0:00:24 discretion is advised now let's walk the
0:00:27 path of
0:00:28 night
0:00:37 last time on path of night Wynn and Kabir
0:00:40 left the Rave to talk a coven of
0:00:43 infernalists led by Zachariah Slane found
0:00:45 Wynn and Kabir Slane told Wynn about a way
0:00:48 to revive the dead and explained that he
0:00:51 was seeking the Ur-Codex and working
0:00:53 against Reiss, the Giovani, and other
0:00:55 enemies of the Coterie Wynn agreed only
0:00:58 to consider his offers
0:01:00 Renwick dragged Neil into the warrens
0:01:04 there Renwick and Neil exchanged
0:01:06 information and conspiracy theories
0:01:08 until the two finally decide to trust
0:01:10 one another enough to attempt to rescue
0:01:12 Fester the Coterie meets up at their
0:01:14 shared Haven
0:01:15 [Music]
0:01:26 the Rave comes to an end with the
0:01:30 gathered Kindred enjoying their last
0:01:32 hurrah Spirits are raised through song and
0:01:36 the arrival of
0:01:38 reinforcements hospitality is given to
0:01:40 guests who are provided with various
0:01:43 locations to Haven for the day and after
0:01:47 some worrisome phone calls the Coterie
0:01:50 agrees to meet as quickly as they can to
0:01:53 make the best of what little time they
0:01:55 have Before Dawn comes each files into
0:01:58 the Haven some more worse for wear than
0:02:02 others but after they're seated there's
0:02:05 a quiet pause between them and Miles
0:02:09 speaks all right guys this was a pretty
0:02:11 successful Rave I think I did a good job
0:02:14 so what kind of information have we got for
0:02:15 me what heard something about a Teflon
0:02:20 Prince Johnny good job with the Rave oh
0:02:23 couldn't have done it without miles
0:02:25 there he he slaps miles in the back pops a Morley
0:02:29 into his lips and then grabs a seat in
0:02:31 the armchair that Johnny likes to Lounge
0:02:33 in Britta takes a pause taking bobby pins so
0:02:37 many bobby pins out of her hair and
0:02:39 looks between Neil and Wynn trying to sus
0:02:43 out which is bringing forwards the
0:02:45 bigger issue Johnny uh before lighting
0:02:48 the morley kind of looks back and forth
0:02:50 between Neil and Wynn two of you look like
0:02:53 you got a a lot more to say about what
0:02:56 happened at the Rave than I think he
0:02:59 points at Neil
0:03:00 you know what actually you always say
0:03:02 some crazy ass [ __ ] let's start with
0:03:05 with Wynn oh it's not going to be better
0:03:07 all right lay it on us he lights the morley so
0:03:11 went walking with
0:03:12 Kabir saw our friends from the Boston
0:03:15 Chantry the tremere the tremere the gargoyle
0:03:19 so they were and you know
0:03:22 Arabella
0:03:24 um and they
0:03:26 brought Z with in Raven's body does not
0:03:32 look like they've been taking care of
0:03:33 her wait back it up Z Arabella yeah
0:03:38 along with those tremere from Boston and
0:03:40 the the gargoyle plus someone else
0:03:43 didn't we see that gargoyle with Reiss
0:03:45 we're going to have a lot of questions
0:03:47 but maybe Wynn you should keep going so
0:03:50 this guy I didn't ask his name to start
0:03:53 with because honestly I wasn't sure I
0:03:54 wasn't going to kill him I don't think
0:03:57 Kabir was going to let me though either
0:03:59 way
0:04:00 this guy Zachariah
0:04:05 slane um hates both Ambrogino Giovani as
0:04:09 does not have a good track record with
0:04:11 Reiss so didn't immediately dislike him
0:04:14 despite being a Tremere does this the
0:04:16 name slane ring off any bells for any of
0:04:18 us yeah I thought that was in Neil's
0:04:21 paperwork at some point uh someone was
0:04:23 reading a book when we were in it's in
0:04:25 my paperwork at some point yeah when we
0:04:27 were reading the Chantry thing about Ira
0:04:30 is the one who is aware of who Zacharias
0:04:31 Slane is ah none of us do
0:04:35 no unless she took his phone I mean we
0:04:38 probably did but also turned it off and
0:04:40 removed the SIM card yeah let me know if
0:04:42 you kept that around yeah um would would
0:04:46 it would it appear in any of the
0:04:47 paperwork that rowlands had that is in
0:04:50 Miles possession give me if you guys are
0:04:54 just starting to pore through it looking
0:04:55 for the name give me a wits plus
0:04:58 investigation I just figure maybe miles
0:05:01 might because of the fact that he's the
0:05:02 one that's aware of all that stuff yeah
0:05:04 Whoever has access to that paperwork and
0:05:06 wants to just kind of while they talking
0:05:08 double check wits investigation uh that
0:05:10 won't be me since I have no
0:05:11 investigation do you want me to try to
0:05:13 take a look for it I get I guess I guess
0:05:16 the seneshal is going to make the role um I
0:05:19 if anyone has information on him uh what
0:05:22 I can tell you is that he's an infernalist
0:05:24 he hates Reiss and he hates the
0:05:28 Giovani
0:05:31 one success are you helping U I'd like
0:05:33 to I've got one dot of Investigation go
0:05:37 ahead two successes two of you go
0:05:40 pouring through and what you find is a
0:05:46 little bit of a I don't want to say a
0:05:47 hit list but it's basically a set of
0:05:51 people that Upton Rowlands had
0:05:53 specifically defined as enemies
0:05:56 specifically members of operation longbow
0:05:59 Zachariah Slane is in there and it
0:06:02 talks about some really [ __ ] weird
0:06:05 stuff about this guy according to Upton's
0:06:09 research which by the way gets a bit of
0:06:12 occulty and uh for those who had not known
0:06:15 before between the two of you
0:06:17 researching it actually becomes pretty
0:06:18 clear that upton rolands was a
0:06:20 thaumaturge and rolands starts speaking with a
0:06:25 man who was performing experiments
0:06:27 involving the spirit world uh
0:06:29 particularly the spirit world that is uh
0:06:32 the purview of
0:06:34 lupines and it gives a little bit of
0:06:36 description as to what the spirit world
0:06:38 is like talking about how almost
0:06:42 everything has a everything has a
0:06:45 reflection in the spirit world however
0:06:48 whether or not it is dormant or awake
0:06:50 and conscious kind of varies but the
0:06:53 things that are conscious are thinking
0:06:55 plotting Sapient for usually beings
0:07:00 and Zachariah slane was performing
0:07:03 experiments uh to determine the use of
0:07:06 such Assets in
0:07:08 war and specifically he had been working
0:07:13 for a man by the name of Roman Pendragon
0:07:16 and had been performing basically
0:07:19 giving thaumaturgical Aid to Roman
0:07:21 pendragon's men to Roman pendragons
0:07:24 Haven allies uh directly enhancing Roman
0:07:27 Pendragons like combat
0:07:29 capabilities Upton makes minor mention
0:07:34 that he had asked Reiss on numerous
0:07:36 occasions to acquire this asset for New
0:07:40 Haven and use this man to benefit the
0:07:44 Gemini League instead of operation longbow
0:07:47 however Upton got the impression that
0:07:51 Reiss could never quite get a handle on
0:07:53 him this guy was such a loose cannon
0:07:55 that Reiss just kind of couldn't keep
0:07:58 control on him so it became the
0:08:02 preference of Upton Rowlands that this man
0:08:05 meet final death somewhere along the
0:08:06 lines he did not pursue it himself
0:08:10 because allegedly a group of lupines who
0:08:13 refer to themselves as wendigo were
0:08:15 hunting this man and Upton sort of just
0:08:19 assumed it would be a matter of time
0:08:21 before this arrogant tremeer burned out and
0:08:22 was slaughtered by
0:08:25 lupines the Wolves tend to a mass at the
0:08:28 door mhm
0:08:32 so yeah this guy showed up and said
0:08:36 hey you know that stuff you're supposed
0:08:38 to do for Ambrogino
0:08:41 Giovani don't do it and you don't need
0:08:43 him to get Joey safe and what he and the
0:08:49 group of them seem to be planning is
0:08:53 to use Z to power them removing Tzimice from
0:09:01 existence like like they burn him out
0:09:04 and then they burn Tzimice out entirely
0:09:09 yes and what he asks in return is the
0:09:13 pages of the ur-codex that he doesn't
0:09:16 know he already has where are those
0:09:18 pages he can see a lot of places and I
0:09:21 don't want to say it that's smart
0:09:23 extremely smart thank you better than an
0:09:26 air horn I guess as the discussion rolls
0:09:29 BR kind of helps to organize papers that
0:09:32 Johnny is finished with and pass them to
0:09:35 the Cod members so that in between
0:09:38 pauses when they're able to process they
0:09:39 can take in the same information that
0:09:42 the two of them have come across so she
0:09:44 tell me this slain is in charge of this
0:09:48 group it's like a Coterie that has like Z
0:09:51 and Arabella and Z is not there
0:09:53 willingly they have him bound like some
0:09:55 kind of weird demon host well he's being
0:09:59 being hosted inside Raven's body and I
0:10:01 suspect they put him in there makes
0:10:03 sense that shant rebound him in the
0:10:04 first place yeah but they want to work
0:10:08 with you in so much as I have something
0:10:11 they need they can they've functionally
0:10:15 given me what I want and what they don't
0:10:18 want is for Giovani to succeed with his
0:10:22 ritual well what does he want what does
0:10:23 Gianni want to remove the curse of
0:10:28 vampirism
0:10:30 it because in the final nights that's
0:10:32 crazy yeah it we get into full tinfoil
0:10:35 hat here well could it work
0:10:39 hypothetically well that anything could
0:10:41 be hypothetical on but that's insane
0:10:44 it's a group of necromancers working
0:10:46 with other blood Mages to remove the
0:10:50 curse of vampirism from their group well
0:10:53 who do you trust more Giovani these guys
0:10:58 I don't [ __ ] trust any of these
0:11:00 people that's the most sane thing I've
0:11:01 heard all night like I can't I've said
0:11:03 it a few times this guy is a straight up
0:11:05 infernal who sees Through Time sees
0:11:07 through time yeah I forgot to mention
0:11:09 that part several times but he's an
0:11:10 infernal who sees through time he cited
0:11:12 various points that he's peaked in on my
0:11:15 life well you don't have to see through
0:11:17 time to do that you just have to be
0:11:19 there and and know when to and know what
0:11:22 was happening around you for a specific
0:11:26 person sure yeah that's yep so he's been
0:11:30 watching at least you for a while yeah I
0:11:33 mean it seems like he works for pen
0:11:35 Dragon so keep an eye in the Cod and
0:11:37 itself I think I think he worked for pen
0:11:39 dragon as much as Reiss worked for
0:11:42 Roland which is to say that they are
0:11:45 useful Ally in times of stress but
0:11:48 they've got their own agenda I mean he's
0:11:49 a trere even if he's a weird tremier
0:11:52 he's a trir they're not trustworthy
0:11:54 exactly trir I trust the most is staked
0:11:57 in the pool house no we moved him he's
0:11:59 in the basement whatever point is is
0:12:01 that the one I trust the most that's how
0:12:03 we treat him so the ones that aren't Ira
0:12:06 to be fair he did ask us to do that okay
0:12:09 that that feels beside the point or I
0:12:11 guess reinforcing the point but the op
0:12:14 the I mean Rees is working with the
0:12:18 Giovani on this yeah there's there's a
0:12:22 trere on either side there's nobody
0:12:25 involved in this who is worthy of our
0:12:27 trust okay
0:12:29 but you said that they got you away
0:12:31 towards what you want I can use one of
0:12:35 the books to bring Joey
0:12:37 back to an end though when everything's
0:12:40 collapsing he would be a CH a normal
0:12:43 human
0:12:45 child able to live a normal child life
0:12:48 resurrection that did he say that he
0:12:50 would be a normal human
0:12:53 child I don't remember if he said normal
0:12:56 but he could have a body that is made
0:12:59 for
0:13:01 him
0:13:02 I I feel like I'm choking on strings
0:13:05 already it sounds like he gave that
0:13:08 without wanting anything so you'll be
0:13:11 able to figure it out from the text
0:13:12 before you enact it what he wanted also
0:13:16 was for us to be allies that is what he
0:13:18 said and he understood that that was
0:13:21 justifiably a hard pill to swallow and
0:13:24 he cited our relationship with trir in
0:13:27 the past [ __ ] that the person I trust
0:13:30 the most out of this group is
0:13:32 zil yeah please don't say his
0:13:35 name I don't think he's completely under
0:13:37 their control and that's why they need
0:13:38 those pages I'm just saying that
0:13:40 Arabella is in that group so at least
0:13:43 like you know quarter per trust there
0:13:46 what why this sounds along the same
0:13:49 deals that she was talking about when we
0:13:50 originally got her some of the
0:13:51 information that is what she wanted to
0:13:53 start with yeah that doesn't make her
0:13:54 any more trustworthy this exactly what
0:13:57 she promised that's delivering on the
0:14:00 thing she said she was going to do I
0:14:01 don't know I don't trust herel at all
0:14:03 but they have a way that maybe they
0:14:05 could or at least they think they could
0:14:07 destroy sany yeah well they think so it
0:14:12 would also they he told me that it would
0:14:15 give Raven back to
0:14:18 herself make her not possessed anymore
0:14:21 yeah speaking of destroying the things
0:14:23 that are in that house and whatever
0:14:26 Johnny weren't we supposed to do
0:14:29 something with your daughter's
0:14:31 friends
0:14:34 yes I don't know if that's related let
0:14:37 me wrap up oh please I I didn't know if
0:14:39 those were related or that was I have no
0:14:41 idea he mentioned nothing about Hell
0:14:43 House only about zamit okay that's true
0:14:45 yep to clarify we are talking about the
0:14:47 giant flesh monster yes the dragon not
0:14:51 just the clan the dragon I have no idea
0:14:53 how far in how far in the clan go
0:14:56 whether it would destroy the vampires or
0:14:58 destroy their V itude I just want to be
0:14:59 clear since they're kind of
0:15:02 interchangeable in terms of yes we're
0:15:04 talking about the thing under New York
0:15:06 and the dragon that we fought and and
0:15:08 the short of it that's in Hell House
0:15:09 that's why but anyways
0:15:12 please if we did take them up on this
0:15:15 and give them those
0:15:17 pages Joey gets not manipulated by the
0:15:21 Giovani
0:15:22 anymore hyp of if all goes according to
0:15:25 plan which we all know the answer to
0:15:28 that yeah the Giovani don't get their
0:15:32 you know jetpack out of the
0:15:35 Apocalypse if that's what they're going
0:15:37 for and we get rid of zitti I don't
0:15:40 think they get the jetpack out of the
0:15:42 Apocalypse anyways I mean you said
0:15:44 yourself there was a malstrom going on
0:15:46 there's everyone keeps saying it's final
0:15:48 nights and maybe just for us for gehenna
0:15:51 but everyone can see the red star and I
0:15:55 Neil's like pacing around he is not sat
0:15:57 down he is just filled with nervous
0:15:59 energy right now pause those are the
0:16:02 three pros we would get if everything
0:16:04 went according to plan and we if us with
0:16:06 us taking this deal MH the downside yeah
0:16:08 there's a [ __ ] Maelstrom going on and
0:16:11 we just pissed off a bunch of
0:16:12 necromancers and extremely powerful
0:16:14 blood Mages and if they somehow lose
0:16:17 control of Z we've pissed off a demon
0:16:20 too miles Z can't hurt us right is that
0:16:25 what you said yes he can hurt us
0:16:29 I believe I said mentally and physically
0:16:31 no he can hurt us he can watch us get
0:16:34 hurt right he can hurt the people around
0:16:36 us yeah okay yes yes yeah I correct I I
0:16:39 get part of it is he's not supposed to
0:16:40 be able to create mental anguish well I
0:16:43 I don't know demons are so alien that
0:16:46 how could that was part of my deal yeah
0:16:48 that's all I'm saying sure but you know
0:16:51 deals with demons what are the physical
0:16:53 choices that we have from this and do we
0:16:58 have a Time limit he said no but I
0:17:02 suspect they're only waiting on getting
0:17:03 those books to enact their ritual and
0:17:06 all this is assuming they're dealing
0:17:07 with us on the level on the level and
0:17:12 whether they're dealing with us on the
0:17:13 level or not the implication of giving
0:17:16 if I'm reading this right Zachariah
0:17:18 slain more power is that Roman gains
0:17:22 more power and you know whatever that
0:17:25 means for this region maybe giving more
0:17:29 power does not give Roland more power or
0:17:31 did not give Rand more power that's fair
0:17:34 that's a fair point out of the two of
0:17:35 them amberino has the worst reputation
0:17:39 not of the two people I barely know
0:17:41 slain but it's pretty well known and
0:17:43 amberino Giovani is he's a slaver he's a
0:17:46 torturer SL not a great individual yeah
0:17:50 and he's looking for girls like me and
0:17:53 Eden yeah well I suspect you're part of
0:17:57 the ritual
0:17:59 Brea just kind of pauses in her bobby
0:18:03 pin collection and curls up a bit
0:18:06 nodding it's not a surprise suspicion
0:18:09 she's had it on her mind sounds
0:18:13 like it sounds like the choice is almost
0:18:16 made for us at this point but isn't it
0:18:19 bad that they're like infernal yes yes
0:18:23 it is yeah he had
0:18:26 some thoughts on that too sure he did
0:18:29 but it's bad you can justify anything
0:18:31 you want but infernalis is infernalis
0:18:33 it's not good making deals with demons
0:18:36 for power is bad well to his mind we all
0:18:39 end up in hell because we're damned
0:18:40 anyway so start earning good rep with
0:18:43 them now that sounds like a lot of
0:18:45 self-justification I don't have a better
0:18:47 answer than that when it boils down to
0:18:49 it it's pretty clear to me that we're
0:18:51 not giving Eden over to anyone yep so it
0:18:55 becomes pretty clear where we're at well
0:18:57 he's not asking for Eden
0:18:59 yet yet but if he doesn't get those
0:19:03 books okay so regardless of whether or
0:19:06 not we actually
0:19:07 have as much time to think about that as
0:19:11 we would
0:19:12 hope Neil you also had things that you
0:19:14 needed to share are they more time
0:19:16 sensitive yes yes well then why didn't
0:19:19 you go first because you were talking
0:19:21 and Johnny was uh I know where Fester is
0:19:23 and I know who the mole is and uh I know
0:19:27 uh it's bad it's really bad you've been
0:19:29 surprisingly productive today I had a
0:19:32 long talk with Renwick when did where
0:19:35 did you find Renwick uh he found me we
0:19:37 were it was a discussion it's it's fine
0:19:40 how that feel misunderstanding but he
0:19:43 and I are on the same page no I meant
0:19:44 being the one who got crept up on
0:19:46 doesn't feel good yeah just anyway go
0:19:50 forward so I didn't even get a chance uh
0:19:53 miles you wanted me to ask about um you
0:19:57 know next time we in court I was I was
0:19:59 going to look into uh all the princes
0:20:01 who came in and um you kept talking
0:20:03 about Marcus Vitel yeah yeah it's Marcus
0:20:05 vital I knew it he is there's something
0:20:09 wrong with
0:20:10 him V vitel was the prince of
0:20:14 DC yes uh speaking of which he's the one
0:20:16 that he's the shitthead who had that
0:20:18 painting commission right yeah well as
0:20:20 far as we can figure out he didn't
0:20:21 commission it he just bought it and art
0:20:24 not his only hobby apparently Mr I used
0:20:27 to live in DC has a really big interest
0:20:30 in intercontinental ballistic missiles
0:20:33 um you know of the nuclear
0:20:36 variety uh what do you mean
0:20:40 interests that's about as much as I got
0:20:42 Renwick you know I was doing things my
0:20:44 way and Renwick is doing his his way and
0:20:46 we kind of met in the middle does he
0:20:48 have them in his pocket or does he know
0:20:51 where they are I don't know he was a guy
0:20:53 who lived in Washington as The Prince
0:20:55 and has mind control so okay is he about
0:20:57 to set off a nuke or is this what is
0:21:00 this I don't know I'm just talking about
0:21:02 the scale of where things are at when it
0:21:03 comes to Marcus Vitel what does this
0:21:05 have to do with Fester I'm getting there
0:21:07 okay uh he has him he has Fester he has
0:21:10 fester in a cage under his floorboards
0:21:12 in a townhouse here in New Haven he has
0:21:14 him right now and I want to go get him
0:21:16 how many hours do we have before the sun
0:21:18 comes up not enough what would if we had
0:21:21 to put it between 12 and zero 12 and Zer
0:21:25 what hours until the sun comes up
0:21:28 we have less than an hour he has fester
0:21:31 and Beyond the fact that Fester is my
0:21:33 friend and has suffered enough and I
0:21:34 want to get him out of that cage he's
0:21:36 being locked in under the floorboards in
0:21:38 some sort of device Contraption whatever
0:21:41 that vitals got him in fester for all
0:21:43 that he was often overlooked was a
0:21:45 member of the web and has tons of
0:21:47 information on us and this entire city
0:21:50 and I saw him and I saw vital with him
0:21:53 and I haven't looked the way that
0:21:55 perhaps I can look but I'm willing to
0:21:58 bet basically anything I've got that if
0:22:01 I was to look at vel's Aura it would be
0:22:04 the same one as I saw down in New York
0:22:06 talking to Carmen which means he is
0:22:09 based on the things that I've seen and
0:22:10 the things that Ren Wick found the mole
0:22:13 which means anything that is sort of
0:22:15 common knowledge here in the city the
0:22:17 sabat already have through him and
0:22:19 anything that wasn't common knowledge I
0:22:22 don't know how Fester's doing or if he's
0:22:24 managed to hold out at all but every
0:22:25 second he has Fester is another chance
0:22:28 for every defense of this entire city to
0:22:30 blow up in our faces how do how do you
0:22:32 sure that he has Fester I saw him you
0:22:35 saw him Renwick and I went down to the
0:22:37 Warren Renwick gave me some of Fester's
0:22:41 lipstick and it was enough of a
0:22:43 connection to him that I was able to
0:22:47 look in on him now that I can find
0:22:49 anyone now anyone anywhere I'm I'm tired
0:22:51 of people you know where this townhouse
0:22:53 is I know the address I know the I know
0:22:56 the the part of the floor that he's
0:22:58 living under well kept under all right
0:23:02 all right so it sounds like that's
0:23:03 Priority One we can get up and go we
0:23:07 need we need to get Fester out and and
0:23:09 then the problem so if vital is the aura
0:23:14 that I saw he's strong like strong and
0:23:18 old and more than just some ventu from
0:23:23 if you're the prince of DC you got to be
0:23:25 [ __ ] mean well he came out of nowh he
0:23:28 was quick he he rose through the ranks
0:23:31 fast fast fast like he just showed up
0:23:33 one day and then he was in total control
0:23:37 is that is that true miles yeah from
0:23:39 everything I've got he's actually of the
0:23:40 younger generation doesn't your clan
0:23:42 keep pretty close Ties on where people
0:23:45 come from well that's also that's also a
0:23:47 thing okay uh according to Renwick
0:23:49 anyways and I haven't been able to
0:23:50 confirm it but according to Renwick he's
0:23:52 not rumor is he's a l Sombra makes so
0:23:55 much sense he's not aent all
0:23:56 [ __ ] can we trust ter
0:24:01 I trust Renwick on this I do okay so I
0:24:07 don't like Renwick but I trust the hell
0:24:08 out of him I like I said he and I had a
0:24:11 long talk and I think I came out of the
0:24:15 other end of that trusting him more than
0:24:17 I did when I went in okay so because
0:24:20 you've seen the area who are we going to
0:24:22 need to get in and get out with him it
0:24:25 depends on if uh it depends on if he's
0:24:29 home if uh um is this all of us or is
0:24:34 this just a couple of us going with you
0:24:37 I don't I don't know no I I mean it's if
0:24:40 if if Marcus vitel if there's even if
0:24:42 there's even a chance that Marcus Vitel
0:24:44 is home or could be home or would get
0:24:46 home all of us all of us at at as strong
0:24:49 as we can get this this is an an an
0:24:51 elder Las Sombra [ __ ] gross who has
0:24:54 ties outside the Camara who who is a
0:24:58 I hate to say this an infiltrator from
0:24:59 the saat at least I hate to say this
0:25:01 because this is [ __ ]
0:25:03 stupid but if it's a
0:25:05 lombra he looks at his watch I'm
0:25:08 inclined we go now we're not going to be
0:25:10 able to make it we sure as hell will but
0:25:12 we have to go but if we're going to do
0:25:14 it we have less than an hour before
0:25:15 Sunrise I know and it's on the other
0:25:17 side of town I know it's it's just not
0:25:20 going to happen if something happens to
0:25:22 compromises the whole situation goes to
0:25:23 [ __ ] the whole point is to get out with
0:25:26 the information we can get up before him
0:25:29 and be ready by the same calculations I
0:25:32 don't know if we can I I want to get him
0:25:35 now now now but I am I am worried about
0:25:38 survivability and we need a mild amount
0:25:41 of preparation I'm not saying a ton but
0:25:43 we need to get some stuff and get there
0:25:44 and if we get I can have the ghouls
0:25:46 prepare everything how how fast would it
0:25:48 take us to get across town if Johnny was
0:25:50 driving if Johnny's driving mhm 10
0:25:52 minutes less it's also guaranteed that
0:25:54 he's there I I don't know if we we call
0:25:56 a gathering if we have an hour 10
0:25:59 minutes for prep you get things together
0:26:01 I will get us there in 10 minutes and 10
0:26:03 minutes to get out and it somewhere
0:26:07 nearby safe out of sun that's a half an
0:26:10 hour that leaves us a half an hour to to
0:26:12 smash into that haven and get Fester out
0:26:16 I'm inclined to to put the clock of the
0:26:20 sun on his ass just as willing as as I
0:26:24 am willing for myself the lambra do not
0:26:28 like the sun none of us do but them
0:26:31 especially Lex uh the part of town
0:26:35 hearing Johnny say like well we can go
0:26:36 into someplace that's safe the townhouse
0:26:40 and the part of town that I know this
0:26:42 address is is it in a similar area to
0:26:48 where uh we sort of expected the um
0:26:52 Killing Spree to be last time no this is
0:26:55 more towards uh uh the Harbor actually
0:26:58 um it is at a place that is referred to
0:27:01 as the estate that's on Town cend Avenue
0:27:04 okay
0:27:06 I that's assuming everything goes
0:27:08 perfect I I want to get him out too
0:27:10 but Johnny I'm I'm worried and and and I
0:27:13 don't want to put too fine a point on it
0:27:14 but this is an elder who can control
0:27:17 your mind right the for the Sombra he
0:27:20 looks at Miles and and Britta the two of
0:27:23 you are broken C can you do this what do
0:27:26 you mean is slightly offensive what do
0:27:28 you mean what do I mean the two of you
0:27:29 are broken you can see it plain as day
0:27:32 you mean what happened to us in the
0:27:34 Chantry you're not yourselves damaged is
0:27:37 more preferable so you're worried about
0:27:40 the mental Powers I'm I mean I'm worried
0:27:43 about the whole thing I'm always worried
0:27:44 about the whole thing but I'm I don't
0:27:46 know then what if they're just not in
0:27:47 the area they're keeping sniper points
0:27:49 or something that's splitting us that's
0:27:52 splitting all of us up 20 minutes before
0:27:53 the sunrises I and how big is this place
0:27:56 it's pretty big Neil can you please tell
0:27:59 us all the details of it if we're going
0:28:01 to make any plan here write it down uh
0:28:04 Neil grabs a pen and a paper and sort of
0:28:07 writes down the address on Townson AV
0:28:09 everything he knows about the estate
0:28:11 everything he knows about like where the
0:28:14 floorboard is the contraption that
0:28:16 Fester is being held in as much as he
0:28:18 knows about the the layout and
0:28:20 occasionally like gives apologies like I
0:28:22 don't I don't know any more than this
0:28:23 because my focus unfortunately is
0:28:26 limited to fester and rounding Fester
0:28:28 you you brief them as much as you can
0:28:30 you figure out whether we're moving I'm
0:28:32 going to get things started and Johnny
0:28:33 Goes to start getting a vehicle loaded
0:28:36 with gear so that if they decide we're
0:28:38 going we're
0:28:44 going where's Eden is it all right if I
0:28:47 had like kind of gotten her some makeup
0:28:50 remover I I mean she's probably gone to
0:28:52 bed she stay up super late she's a
0:28:55 regular person she's 14 years old it's 4
0:28:57 o00 in the morning we probably had to
0:29:00 carry her in so it sounds like brto
0:29:03 would have probably gotten her some like
0:29:05 makeup remover and like an extra blanket
0:29:08 or something and set her off to bed I
0:29:11 have the feeling that taking Fester
0:29:13 might anger Mr vitel yeah if we hit with
0:29:17 Fester we we need to take out Vel at the
0:29:19 same time okay and this house is too big
0:29:22 for us to to search in the time period
0:29:25 we have this I know exactly where he is
0:29:26 in the house but I don't know what kinds
0:29:28 of defenses he has in Vel vel's house
0:29:31 right do you know where he is exactly in
0:29:32 the house know I know where I know where
0:29:34 Fester is we can look this over this
0:29:36 information and we can try to see if
0:29:39 there's I'll look it over tactically and
0:29:41 see if there's anything that we can add
0:29:43 in but Neil do you have miles and I
0:29:48 we've been working on this okay the bra
0:29:51 thing and I don't
0:29:54 know like I have thoughts but it would
0:29:57 take me a couple hours to to maybe give
0:29:59 you guys a chance to find yourself what
0:30:02 does that even mean the moon the thing
0:30:04 you've been done before is that short
0:30:06 enough I mean that would that would only
0:30:08 take me a short amount of time that
0:30:10 might be enough to cover the difference
0:30:12 okay the moon would be great but what
0:30:14 does that have to do with our trauma
0:30:16 what do you know about this a whole this
0:30:18 is a whole other thing but when your
0:30:19 brain is I know what it is to have your
0:30:23 personality broken to to have parts of
0:30:25 your mind broken and and put elsewhere
0:30:29 and climbing back from that state into a
0:30:34 a place of finding your ego and your
0:30:36 will again um and confronting the parts
0:30:41 of you that are wounded is an ordeal but
0:30:46 it I don't know I've never done it for
0:30:48 other people before but I think I can
0:30:50 lead you to a place where you can
0:30:53 confront yourselves and maybe at least
0:30:56 start to heal but it it's going to take
0:30:58 time so that's kind of my concern the
0:31:01 damage that was done to us makes us more
0:31:03 susceptible to the powers of dominate it
0:31:05 is a common thing to do if you need to
0:31:07 break somebody so once we're in the
0:31:10 house I can probably triangulate where
0:31:14 vampiric beasts are if we're inside I
0:31:17 can hide all of us if you move like I do
0:31:19 if we agree to a plan I can get some
0:31:22 final touches on it so we could move
0:31:23 together better I just wish we knew more
0:31:26 if wish were presents we'd all have a
0:31:28 Merry Christmas time is of the essence
0:31:30 Johnny is right but I don't think we can
0:31:32 move now but if we're ready to go first
0:31:34 thing can you do the hunters Moon Moon
0:31:36 on the go yes I can okay and how many
0:31:39 hours would it take for I mean I don't
0:31:42 even know if what you're suggesting I
0:31:44 don't know if it would work either I've
0:31:45 never done it this is this is in the
0:31:47 realm of the theater retical I I was
0:31:50 hoping that I could help before another
0:31:54 crisis come came up but that's not the
0:31:56 world how it goes do you think you could
0:31:58 maybe just do one of us no it's a it's a
0:32:01 it's a it's a it's a together thing the
0:32:03 ritual is going to be the ritual no
0:32:04 matter
0:32:05 what okay miles you know more about oh I
0:32:11 Neil you've mentioned it in the past too
0:32:13 what the abilities of domination what
0:32:16 can we do not to get in the way the
0:32:19 Hun's moon is one and I believe I can if
0:32:22 people are willing I can implant some
0:32:25 suggestions that would make it harder
0:32:26 for him Bria has already been pretty Cy
0:32:31 about Neil's suggestion and as miles
0:32:34 says implant
0:32:36 suggestions she pretty physically
0:32:38 withdraws Neil has a strangely similar
0:32:42 reaction it is a Bull workk against it
0:32:45 it is harder to dominate somebody who is
0:32:46 already under the effects of Dominate
0:32:48 and for a penny and for a pound do it to
0:32:50 me mil I'm first
0:32:53 thing I don't I'm worried about I'm
0:32:56 worried about the the the scope of
0:32:59 whatever you would say to dominate us
0:33:03 limiting the creative application guys
0:33:06 are we putting the cart before the horse
0:33:08 here kind of yes okay then let's back up
0:33:09 the cart so we can actually get moving
0:33:12 with some intent and let's be real here
0:33:15 if he's going to dominate any of us it's
0:33:17 me or me I'd ra I'd rather I'd be under
0:33:21 miles control than vitales I think the
0:33:24 rest of you we can avoid I'm really just
0:33:26 saying
0:33:27 the major the only implant that I'm
0:33:29 talking about is that you wouldn't
0:33:30 attack any of the rest of us agreed I
0:33:33 don't like the idea of having my mind
0:33:35 [ __ ] with more I don't like the idea
0:33:37 of me we going tonight or are we going
0:33:39 tomorrow first thing in the morning do
0:33:42 we have that
0:33:43 long well he's got to sleep too we do
0:33:47 the only thing I'm worried about is
0:33:50 fighting an elder lambra with a whole
0:33:52 night ahead of
0:33:54 us
0:33:55 my my priority is to get faster out I
0:33:59 need to get him
0:34:00 out
0:34:02 I'm I'm the reason he's in there so I
0:34:05 got to get him
0:34:07 out you you're right we need to Marcus
0:34:10 vital is the traitor he's the mole he's
0:34:12 an elder L Al right in our ranks he's
0:34:13 sewing Discord he is prepping the way
0:34:16 for the sabat to invade and kill us all
0:34:18 I just don't think he's going to let us
0:34:20 just walk in and take Fester out of his
0:34:23 lair I don't either but I I know then we
0:34:26 said his house on fire the Fester's in
0:34:28 that house well we get Fester first and
0:34:30 we scoot out of there lighting the place
0:34:32 on fire is just a way that we can't
0:34:33 figure out if he's actually done with or
0:34:35 not yeah but it gives us a shitload of
0:34:37 light well and we all freak out too
0:34:40 remember he's a sabat and as Johnny has
0:34:43 said sabat don't aren't afraid of the
0:34:45 fire the way that we are he but he's Las
0:34:47 somra so it'll [ __ ] him up a little bit
0:34:49 well are we thinking that next morning
0:34:52 we get suited up miles would have done
0:34:55 the preparation beforehand
0:34:57 then we drive over and we try to sneak
0:35:00 in yes and then we try to retrieve
0:35:04 faster do we intend on attacking vitel
0:35:07 or not yes okay so that's one of our
0:35:10 objectives then is handling him correct
0:35:15 and Brea starts taking notes uh right
0:35:18 next to the papers that are set out with
0:35:21 everything that Neil has put forwards
0:35:23 I'll call you know if everybody's okay
0:35:26 with it
0:35:27 obviously I'm going to stay and help and
0:35:29 deal with Marcus if I tell I I'll call
0:35:33 Renwick tell Renwick to be ready to get
0:35:36 Fester the hell out so that we don't
0:35:38 have to worry about that after that is
0:35:40 he just going to go tonight Renwick yeah
0:35:42 no I told him I would talk to all of you
0:35:44 and he knows the sticks can he bring
0:35:47 anyone he trusts the more people we
0:35:49 bring the harder this gets yeah he
0:35:52 doesn't trust very many people he trusts
0:35:54 fester and if he meet kind of me if he
0:35:57 meets up with us we can put him on fer
0:35:59 priority his priority is not vital in
0:36:01 the same way also we're where are the
0:36:05 guests all over the city wherever they
0:36:08 wanted to be some of them may have left
0:36:10 so we have an elder [ __ ] Gangrel and
0:36:13 Theo godamn Bell you're not wrong
0:36:17 letting uh at least telling the archon
0:36:21 uh
0:36:22 miles it maybe just sending a message
0:36:24 while we go is not necessarily a
0:36:25 terrible idea so he knows in case we
0:36:28 fail but um as far as a blanket
0:36:32 statement to everyone is concerned
0:36:34 Marcus Vel has ears everywhere but
0:36:37 beyond that when it comes to Xavier and
0:36:39 all of that I um we don't have any proof
0:36:43 that's the problem it's functionally my
0:36:46 word against everyone and even within
0:36:49 the confines of this city I'm not
0:36:51 exactly known for being and laying these
0:36:54 accusations at the fee of an archon
0:36:56 means
0:36:57 investigation time things we don't
0:37:00 necessarily have he's going to Ash
0:37:02 fester in that time or get whatever he
0:37:04 needs out of fester he will be dead yeah
0:37:07 yes but this is your domain we don't
0:37:11 need an Aron you could just blood hunt
0:37:15 him well if he gets away yes but the
0:37:17 whole point is surprise surprise and
0:37:19 then when someone questions and the more
0:37:21 people we bring in the more phone calls
0:37:23 we make the more this is going to become
0:37:26 it's good idea for someone to know what
0:37:28 we know and so we tell Renwick I don't
0:37:32 just mean Renwick cuz if he's coming
0:37:34 with us he's not it's not good to tell
0:37:36 someone that's coming with us well so
0:37:39 where I'm
0:37:40 at Xavier's whole thing is hunting down
0:37:45 zitti I'm going to tell him that there's
0:37:48 an option on the table with that
0:37:50 involves infernalis to take that off the
0:37:53 table this is where the problem is
0:37:55 located if he wants so he can be doing
0:37:57 recon at Hell House or something like
0:37:59 that and also by the way we're going to
0:38:02 I mean that's that's a huge conversation
0:38:03 when and if we're going right when the
0:38:05 sun comes goes down we're Gangrel it's
0:38:07 fine we don't need a lot of
0:38:09 words this one feels like he might all
0:38:11 right I am going to contact Xavier and
0:38:14 let him know that he should probably
0:38:17 keep eyes on Hell house because he's the
0:38:19 one who warned the camaria of this whole
0:38:21 thing and when they turned their back on
0:38:23 it he left too he'll get it he'll get it
0:38:27 without blowing up the spot yeah I mean
0:38:29 if we just leave the Hell House part and
0:38:31 and and forget the estate then yeah
0:38:34 he'll be he'll be good he'll understand
0:38:35 he's got it right yes yeah there's a
0:38:39 reason I called him yeah that makes
0:38:41 sense okay and then Neil you'll do the
0:38:45 moon thing I'll prepare us tomorrow and
0:38:47 I'll prepare myself we won't have time
0:38:50 to do whatever therapy thing you were
0:38:53 thinking no am I calling slain not today
0:38:56 no I don't think so I think we need to
0:38:59 focus on this he I I would be calling
0:39:03 him so that we could focus on this well
0:39:05 he did you said he didn't give you a
0:39:07 timeline no then you can wait right as
0:39:10 long as amberino Giovani does not get
0:39:13 his hand on those books in the meantime
0:39:15 I mean look it's up to you on the they
0:39:17 don't know where the pages are right now
0:39:18 anyways right so they don't they got to
0:39:20 work through you anyways there's a
0:39:22 reason they came to talk to you no I
0:39:23 don't think you're understanding the
0:39:24 sequence of events here okay all right
0:39:27 for what they need they have all the
0:39:29 time in the world for what I need I am
0:39:32 contingent on Giovani not getting those
0:39:35 books okay they have infinite time okay
0:39:38 well I do not based on how things have
0:39:40 gone in the past tomorrow evening you
0:39:43 know hour or two and we'll know whether
0:39:46 we got time after that one way or
0:39:47 another right look if you wanted quick
0:39:50 vote I'd rather go with s it sounds like
0:39:53 if we survive fighting the Elder L
0:39:55 Sombra we can revisit this I don't mean
0:39:58 to say that to be disruptive to what
0:40:00 you're saying it's just that I don't
0:40:03 know if we can split time I think slain
0:40:06 can wait an hour to get his phone
0:40:08 call that's my opinion all right he gets
0:40:12 an hour right we can call him from the
0:40:16 Estate One Way or
0:40:18 Another that gives us some time to think
0:40:21 it over if you or even just you some
0:40:24 time to think it over what do you think
0:40:26 when I think we're crushed for time on
0:40:28 too many fronts and I'm trying to see
0:40:30 how many of these things we can get done
0:40:32 in the little time we have left and you
0:40:34 guys are saying these are tomorrow night
0:40:36 problems this time though I think we
0:40:38 literally mean
0:40:39 tomorrow and I'm saying I don't know if
0:40:41 we're going to get tomorrow well either
0:40:43 way we've only got half an hour or so
0:40:45 left before the sun comes up so I don't
0:40:47 think he's expecting a call tonight
0:40:48 anyways I doubt it so half an hour now
0:40:52 before it's time to sleep and an hour or
0:40:54 two in the evening tomorrow
0:40:57 that's I mean that's a fast turnaround
0:40:59 for Kindred we'll be
0:41:02 okay
0:41:03 right I'd love to tell you yes no me too
0:41:07 you wouldn't believe me even if I did
0:41:09 Miles
0:41:11 you I'm I'm scared of my mind being
0:41:15 [ __ ] with okay I'm scared of it's been
0:41:18 scary every time that you've had to
0:41:20 use a dominate command on me or any of
0:41:24 that and I I don't know how it works I
0:41:25 don't know it causes cumulative damage I
0:41:28 don't know if my mind's already mess
0:41:30 with is
0:41:32 it safe if you use what you have to
0:41:37 protect us against our minds being
0:41:40 messed with would that cause more damage
0:41:45 it's not conditioning I'm not weakening
0:41:48 your resolve I'm merely planting a
0:41:52 suggestion mostly I I get it it's just
0:41:56 there's a lot of suggestions planted in
0:41:58 my brain and I don't know how they work
0:42:00 well a lot of those probably came from
0:42:02 previous to being a
0:42:04 vampire I guess what I'm asking is can I
0:42:08 can I trust you that that won't cause
0:42:10 more as far as I know it does not cause
0:42:13 any more damage should I put that in
0:42:16 then as part of the plan for any who are
0:42:19 willing yes I highly suggest it though
0:42:23 baa braces herself eyes wide there's
0:42:27 definite fear in it but she decides to
0:42:30 give a nod Lex I am interested in making
0:42:35 a tactics roll with the plan that we've
0:42:38 discussed I'm unsure if I should do that
0:42:41 now or before if this is the end of
0:42:43 planning you would make it now are we
0:42:46 settled on how we want to go about this
0:42:49 what's what have we settled on that to
0:42:51 uh tomorrow evening at Sunset we go to
0:42:55 the townhouse kick the door in get
0:42:57 Fester rout and kill vitel pretty much
0:43:01 he there I don't think we should kick
0:43:03 the door in I think we should sneak in
0:43:05 get fester in our possession before we
0:43:07 confront Vel if we can do it quietly we
0:43:09 can do it quietly I can cloak all of us
0:43:13 yes we try to we get Fest rout we get
0:43:15 him to redwick and we go from there how
0:43:17 quiet do I have to be when I'm cloaked
0:43:19 just don't draw direct attention to
0:43:20 yourself and don't stand in any Bright
0:43:23 Lights what about having a chainsaw
0:43:25 going if it's running then it will it's
0:43:27 a little loud yeah understood I am not
0:43:31 actually an as Amite I can't keep it
0:43:33 quiet and we're certain we want to kill
0:43:37 V tell not stake him 100% I don't know
0:43:40 if we'll have a choice he might be
0:43:42 immune I don't know what his
0:43:44 capabilities are he's an elder Las somra
0:43:46 I think we can't hold back is what I'm
0:43:48 saying yeah okay so so we we we'll try
0:43:52 we'll try so we go as soon as we can
0:43:55 after Neil you make your preparations
0:43:58 and Miles you protect those who are
0:44:01 willing then we pull together all
0:44:04 supplies all other armor whether that's
0:44:08 physical mental so on and so forth we
0:44:11 drive over Johnny gets us there and we
0:44:14 start off with sth while Neil has us
0:44:16 covered we should ensure that Renwick
0:44:18 knows the plan too we ensure that
0:44:20 Renwick knows the plan we put Renwick
0:44:23 primarily on rescuing f
0:44:27 and we know that we have to try to take
0:44:31 vitel out regardless of whether that
0:44:34 means we go in loud but we start off in
0:44:37 South is that all good yeah I think
0:44:42 that's as good as we're going to get
0:44:44 unless we learn more tomorrow morning if
0:44:46 we had sure but every plan needs room if
0:44:49 we had an extra night I could we there's
0:44:52 all sorts of things we could do to to
0:44:53 even the odds but I don't think we have
0:44:55 the the time not if we want fer safe not
0:44:58 if we want to no I mean like we get a
0:45:00 phone call tomorrow morning from vitel
0:45:02 saying hey Fester's dead [ __ ] you well
0:45:06 hopefully he doesn't know yet all right
0:45:09 but if that's not the case then I'll put
0:45:11 some final details on the plan you're
0:45:13 going to roll intelligence plus tactics
0:45:15 at difficulty 6 I am going to spend a
0:45:18 willpower okay okay does my spec in
0:45:22 Jihad count
0:45:24 yes
0:45:27 four successes did you count the wol
0:45:29 power no five successes thank you you
0:45:32 have five successes now what you do is
0:45:35 you those are each a die and you will
0:45:38 give dice to the various members of the
0:45:41 team and so long as they are following
0:45:43 the plan they will benefit from those
0:45:45 dice on their roles hey Neil can you
0:45:47 look at this necklace and tell me if
0:45:48 it's dangerous or not it's a necklace
0:45:51 what what do you mean supposed to
0:45:52 supposed to give me a lot of uh the
0:45:55 seites gave it to him swordmanship
0:45:57 ability what it's from the seites it's
0:45:59 dangerous well it was an apology gift
0:46:02 okay well let me re it's dangerous of
0:46:04 course it's dangerous that's part of the
0:46:06 fun anyways no I don't have any way to
0:46:08 look at something and know what it does
0:46:10 that's all I wanted to know sorry Neil
0:46:13 looks after BR finishes making the plan
0:46:16 and says uh when we all rise in the
0:46:19 evening um just give me give me a few
0:46:22 minutes give me 15 minutes and I I think
0:46:25 you know it hasn't been tried but I
0:46:27 think I can help protect us at least a
0:46:29 little bit I'll try my best but there
0:46:31 are rituals for for a Cy haunting a
0:46:34 Target do you think that maybe if it
0:46:37 would be worth it that you'd have time
0:46:39 to sunproof the van on the way or I
0:46:43 don't know if we're taking a fan
0:46:44 actually I mean that'll take me 5 10
0:46:46 minutes right before we go that's that's
0:46:48 not we can do I can do that on the way I
0:46:50 don't know if it's relevant just a
0:46:52 thought if we're if we're going tomorrow
0:46:53 night it's not going to be an issue all
0:46:55 right miles do you have enough time to
0:46:57 help us with weapons I I don't I don't
0:47:00 have my armor or anything of course
0:47:03 thank you we have a bunch here and at my
0:47:05 office oh did you ever look into um a
0:47:09 bow I did I think I have one around here
0:47:13 somewhere thank
0:47:15 you okay I'm really glad we made it
0:47:19 through the
0:47:21 rafe
0:47:23 and look yes there is a part of me that
0:47:27 feels changed like Neil was saying and I
0:47:30 don't know if we can fix that certainly
0:47:31 not in time but I know that
0:47:35 I if there's going to be this kind of
0:47:37 emergency all the time I'm just glad
0:47:41 it's you guys where with this Coterie
0:47:44 doesn't do a ton of things always the
0:47:47 best way or the correct way but the
0:47:50 thing we do is that we do not leave our
0:47:54 friends or Allies
0:47:56 in danger and we move quickly and
0:47:59 decisively and it's part of what how
0:48:02 we've made the impact that we
0:48:04 have we'll get Fester out of this his
0:48:07 own Clan left him behind to die at the
0:48:10 gala which they knew was a trap so what
0:48:14 do you mean they knew it was a trap um
0:48:17 oh yeah Renwick said war knew the attack
0:48:22 was coming it was just all pieces on
0:48:25 chess board to try and kill Roman pen
0:48:28 Dragon um but they left they left Fester
0:48:32 behind and so it means a lot even if he
0:48:36 doesn't get a chance to say it to us I I
0:48:38 want you guys to know a lot that it
0:48:39 means a lot to me that we're going to go
0:48:40 after him I'll get him I owe it to
0:48:44 Fester thank
0:48:46 you there's a lot more to be discussed
0:48:49 with that but oh yeah yeah but now we
0:48:52 should rest tomorrow night
0:48:57 yeah tomorrow night left with no choice
0:49:02 the Cy gets
0:49:07 rest on the next night one at a time in
0:49:11 order of who has the highest Humanity
0:49:14 the Kindred snap awake finished with
0:49:17 their Restless sleep the Coterie
0:49:19 gathers up its gear piles into the
0:49:22 vehicle Johnny what are you driving for
0:49:24 this well first off before they pile
0:49:27 into the vehicle Johnny stops outside of
0:49:29 the uh it's probably a a a
0:49:32 black what would you think like a
0:49:34 Suburban or an Escalade Johnny would
0:49:36 have ch chosen some kind of just lowkey
0:49:38 van but knowing miles would never ride
0:49:41 to to take out a rival in a uh lowkey
0:49:44 vehicle like that he he grabs a black
0:49:47 Escalade yeah acceptable A Midnight
0:49:52 oud Escalade there you go I feel better
0:49:55 now yeah but he stops the Coterie outside
0:49:58 as as they're about to uh Gather in the
0:49:59 vehicle and gathers gathers them
0:50:03 together things have been getting pretty
0:50:04 crazy lately but I want you all to know
0:50:08 that I need all of you I need you to be
0:50:12 here I don't want to lose any of you so
0:50:16 when we go to take
0:50:18 vitel kill him and save
0:50:22 Fester I want you to know that nothing
0:50:26 is going to be able to stop us and he
0:50:29 pulls all of their hands together into
0:50:31 into like a
0:50:32 clasp and you feel a an anger kind of
0:50:37 radiating from Johnny's hands and this
0:50:41 weird energy flows into each of your
0:50:46 arms and Johnny will activate a spr
0:50:48 decor and iron heart what this means is
0:50:53 that you will all be at Plus three
0:50:56 difficulty to int take uh intimidating
0:50:58 actions Iron Heart affects dominate
0:51:02 presence and mind affecting thury and a
0:51:04 spr Decor affects uh intimidate actions
0:51:08 certain uses of dominate therefore will
0:51:10 be at plus three difficulty spr de cour
0:51:12 also conveys three dots of
0:51:17 potent so Johnny will be at eight
0:51:20 potents oh my God and all of you will be
0:51:23 at three except for when I think you're
0:51:24 now four you're four dots of
0:51:30 potent he gives you each in turn a long
0:51:34 bit of eye contact and then kind of nods
0:51:37 pops a morle in his mouth and says all
0:51:39 right let's ride when Johnny gives the
0:51:41 prolonged eye contact she will lean
0:51:43 forward and bonk his forehead with her
0:51:45 own as is her want hell yeah as they are
0:51:49 outside by the van all preparing to go
0:51:51 Neil looks up uh towards the moon and
0:51:54 the stars and goes anyone who wants to
0:51:57 know that this is the right time for us
0:51:59 to do this I know it makes you
0:52:01 uncomfortable he kind of looks over at
0:52:03 Johnny but give me some of your Vite
0:52:05 give me your blood and I'll make sure
0:52:08 that we're bolstered as much as we can
0:52:11 uh that our will is set towards
0:52:14 success as he talks when is already
0:52:17 finding a knife to cut herself open BR
0:52:20 is still sort of lingering the feeling
0:52:23 exchanged to her by Johnny at first
0:52:25 there was a moment of almost concern
0:52:28 this strange feeling emanating from his
0:52:30 hands but as she looks her own and feels
0:52:34 the capacity in them she gives Neil a
0:52:38 nod she's always been more comfortable
0:52:41 with his blood magic but something in
0:52:44 this strength almost seems to evoke a
0:52:46 similar reaction in her as miles imbuing
0:52:49 her with King maker confidence there's
0:52:52 something about feeling this strong this
0:52:56 unassailable that makes this all seem a
0:52:59 little easier to face and she waits for
0:53:02 wind to be done with a knife and
0:53:04 contributes her own blood when we'll
0:53:06 pass it handle first to her thank you
0:53:09 and she offers the knife to anyone who
0:53:11 would participate Johnny undoes one of
0:53:14 his uh fingerless gloves that he's
0:53:15 wearing uh and just puts his hand over
0:53:18 to you doesn't even bother grabbing the
0:53:19 knife just offers his hand for you to
0:53:22 cut open BR very gently takes hold of
0:53:25 Johnny's hand and does as it needs to be
0:53:28 done I will partially draw my Katana and
0:53:31 cut myself on it and then add my point
0:53:33 of V to it Neil takes the blood that is
0:53:37 offered and sort of it ritualistically
0:53:40 flows over his hands and he looks up to
0:53:44 the heavens and there's a sense of Fate
0:53:48 Destiny like everything like the the
0:53:51 environment around them Spirits unseen
0:53:53 are all looking towards them the heavens
0:53:55 and the heavens are looking back towards
0:53:57 the group of them sealing them towards a
0:54:00 purpose all of you will gain six
0:54:03 temporary willpower for the remainder of
0:54:05 the evening or until such time as our
0:54:08 task is complete BR looks to the group
0:54:11 and kind of takes out the notes from a
0:54:14 pocket looks them over and puts them
0:54:18 back looking to each person recognizing
0:54:21 the weight of what's to come and
0:54:23 focusing in on their features taking in
0:54:25 their faces how much she cares about
0:54:28 them which means out of character Lex I
0:54:31 would like to distribute I did a tactics
0:54:35 role with my spec in the Jihad I had
0:54:39 five dice to distribute I would like to
0:54:42 Simply give everyone present a dice is
0:54:44 that all right that's perfectly fine all
0:54:47 right so everyone note down that you
0:54:49 have one di to contribute to whatever
0:54:51 effort so long as you follow the plan
0:54:53 that we outlined earlier so that plus
0:54:55 one die all the time or just once we get
0:54:57 to one all the time got it oh [ __ ] I did
0:54:59 not realize I thought it was one use
0:55:02 that's awesome as the group gets going
0:55:05 uh the last thing Neil like while he's
0:55:07 in the car seems a little out of it like
0:55:09 really almost has to be guided into the
0:55:11 back of the car cuz he's just so focused
0:55:13 inward uh and from his little fanny pack
0:55:15 that he has back on around his waist
0:55:18 pulls out a broken Shard of mirror uh
0:55:21 and just starts muttering to himself and
0:55:24 doing some sort of Arcane [ __ ] BR is
0:55:26 addressing in the ways that she's been
0:55:29 taught making sure that the body armor
0:55:31 is tight like Johnny shown her keeping
0:55:34 her jacket laid over it nicely the First
0:55:37 new addition that she has is a compound
0:55:40 bow draped over her shoulders joining
0:55:43 the collection of guns and knives but
0:55:47 apart from that she looks like you've
0:55:49 seen her before maybe a little more
0:55:53 determined when doesn't really have much
0:55:55 to contribute in terms of group Buffs so
0:55:58 she does take a minute to make sure that
0:56:00 she's wearing body armor she will
0:56:02 clarify with Neil at some point glowing
0:56:05 eyes will that bust the group out you
0:56:07 skate no okay she will spend the blood
0:56:10 for be able being able to see in the
0:56:12 dark Neil can you run through what does
0:56:16 busts that don't stand in the light any
0:56:20 any direct light like you know little
0:56:22 lights is fine but like spotlights
0:56:24 headlights things like that remember
0:56:25 when I back feels like forever ago um
0:56:29 that breaks it uh don't cause any huge
0:56:31 direct uh attention to yourself so once
0:56:34 you attack um it it's broken now if each
0:56:38 of you breaks it any of you breaks it
0:56:39 it's broken for you if I break it it's
0:56:42 broken for all of us understood miles
0:56:46 gets into the front passenger seat stows
0:56:48 the katana securely and goes I don't
0:56:51 think the Dominate is going to work with
0:56:53 all the other posts we put on already
0:56:54 already so and uh based on my reading
0:56:57 the text I don't really know if it's
0:56:59 going to do any Improvement unless we
0:57:02 get separated and have to hunt around
0:57:04 the house he would have to use Mesmerize
0:57:06 which takes time not much I can do
0:57:08 against command we get to skip that far
0:57:10 as I can tell yes BR definitely looks
0:57:13 relieved Wynn finds one of the early or
0:57:17 one of the the bats that are still out
0:57:20 and asks it to tell Xavier to go check
0:57:23 out one two3 a Street if he's interested
0:57:26 in exactly what kind of problems New
0:57:28 Haven has with why he left the camaria
0:57:33 the bat obeys your use of animalism and
0:57:36 we'll take flight Johnny uh leans into
0:57:39 the back and passes back a brand new
0:57:43 shiny
0:57:44 chainsaw just uh sets it down in Neil's
0:57:47 lap how would you hang out to this for
0:57:49 me while I'm driving um that's not I'm
0:57:52 not going to be able to do that you
0:57:54 can't hang on to it as Johnny Goes to
0:57:57 put it onto Neil's lap the ritual is not
0:58:00 fully complete yet because it takes a
0:58:02 little time but it starts to pass
0:58:03 through
0:58:04 Neil makes a surprise squeak and goes to
0:58:07 grab it yeah maybe it's best you you
0:58:10 hang out to this kid all right passes
