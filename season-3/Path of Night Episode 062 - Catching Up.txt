0:00:32 [Music]
0:00:39 last time on path of night
0:00:42 the cautery woke in their New Haven
0:00:44 Beretta and Miles rallied from the
0:00:46 effects of the psychic assault Ritter
0:00:49 called Neil discovering that the
0:00:51 mulcavian was with weather is on a
0:00:52 mission against the Sabbath weathers
0:00:55 told Johnny that the Rave needed to
0:00:56 happen sooner rather than later
0:00:59 Neil gathered Intel about the sabbat's
0:01:01 Crusade and found out about a traitor
0:01:03 exchanging information about miles's
0:01:06 diablary to Carmen Neil and the bruja
0:01:08 ran from a horde of ravenous meanwhile
0:01:11 Ira received orders from the premiere to
0:01:14 bring them
0:01:15 [Music]
0:01:29 so leading her from the rooms to the
0:01:32 kitchen dining room-esque area where the
0:01:34 other two have been hanging out Britta
0:01:37 has not put herself together correct
0:01:39 she's still in sweatpants and bunny
0:01:41 slippers and hair messy the bunny
0:01:44 slippers are the only addition to what
0:01:47 she said here College 8 A.M class
0:01:51 and kind of gives her a look
0:01:53 do you want me to do your hair
0:01:55 Britta doesn't look back up at wind but
0:01:58 there's a self-conscious shy nod and she
0:02:03 does go over to win right win kind of
0:02:05 sits on the arm of a comfy couch and has
0:02:09 Brita sit on the cushion and just kind
0:02:11 of very gently
0:02:12 starts brushing her hair
0:02:14 thanks
0:02:15 no problem
0:02:17 as she had come up the stairs when was
0:02:19 finishing up braiding her own
0:02:22 um Aiden's still asleep she ate I'm
0:02:25 gonna say three quarters of a pizza
0:02:28 us she I tucked her in I figured she
0:02:31 should probably just sleep some more
0:02:32 she's a growing child I'm sure it'll be
0:02:34 good for her I mean here's hoping
0:02:37 um so
0:02:39 we've all
0:02:42 seen some stuff
0:02:44 it's been a very weird week
0:02:47 I'm going to propose right now
0:02:51 that for the purposes of getting it all
0:02:55 out there
0:02:56 we don't get mad at each other for
0:02:58 decisions we weren't there to help make
0:03:00 we don't get
0:03:01 spun up on what we would have done
0:03:04 better
0:03:05 she kind of looks at herself in the
0:03:07 mirror and does the look watching you
0:03:09 thing to herself
0:03:11 and I don't
0:03:13 care who starts but if you need to tap
0:03:16 out for a minute just walk out
0:03:19 and win just continues brushing brita's
0:03:24 hair starting at the bottom working her
0:03:25 way up trying not to pull and she just
0:03:28 kind of makes eyes with everyone in the
0:03:31 room except Brita because she's looking
0:03:32 at the back of her head but Britta can
0:03:34 probably feel her looking at her as well
0:03:36 we can start with City updates
0:03:39 as you are aware Rollins is dead
0:03:44 we
0:03:45 raided his house during the day and
0:03:49 staked him and then came back to finish
0:03:53 the job in the evening during that
0:03:55 Excursion
0:03:57 um zofil took control of my body and
0:04:00 hostage me
0:04:03 when he says that name a shiver runs up
0:04:07 everyone's spine and you can't quite put
0:04:11 your finger on what's going on but you
0:04:13 get this sense of unease
0:04:17 miles yeah just call him Z from now on
0:04:20 please
0:04:21 any any reason why
0:04:23 you are
0:04:25 flippantly
0:04:26 talking about a demon
0:04:28 I'm gonna assume that's a bad thing I
0:04:31 mean it was a Superstition that I had
0:04:33 but
0:04:34 um
0:04:35 like it could summon him like Ira and
0:04:38 [ __ ] Rhys said there are pet there is
0:04:42 power in names good to know
0:04:44 he's just a I mean how did you guys even
0:04:48 do that during the day
0:04:51 I
0:04:52 possessed one of the ghouls that
0:04:54 Rowlands had dismissed I had taken them
0:04:57 in I had
0:04:59 done some preparation and With a Little
0:05:01 Help from some of uh Neil's magic I was
0:05:05 able to
0:05:07 possess his body during the day
0:05:09 okay you can see Johnny is kind of like
0:05:13 pacing back and forth in the kitchen
0:05:15 area it was like opening drawers looking
0:05:18 in cabinets and things like that how the
0:05:20 hell do you stock this place with
0:05:21 everything so good you know put a
0:05:22 [ __ ] carton of cigarettes anywhere
0:05:25 did you check your bedside drawer yes
0:05:27 linen closet he just kind of had he he
0:05:29 puts his hands on the counter top and
0:05:31 just kind of hangs his head and just
0:05:33 kind of nods I mean the den does have a
0:05:35 selection of cigars oh [ __ ] yeah I'd
0:05:37 take one of those James kind of frowns
0:05:40 goes walk and goes stomping over towards
0:05:42 the den
0:05:43 so during that process I was out of my
0:05:47 body so he
0:05:49 took a vote and I wasn't there to stop
0:05:52 him and then he hostage my body but he's
0:05:57 not in you anymore no I released some of
0:06:00 our previous bargain and he left my body
0:06:03 intact
0:06:05 and that's all he wanted in return yes
0:06:08 he's free I did get protection from
0:06:11 somebody outside of the codery
0:06:13 Elsa when as your brush runs Sarah
0:06:17 bretta's hair you feel her crunch into
0:06:20 the couch
0:06:21 wind kind of stops brushing for a second
0:06:25 it's initially she thought she pulled
0:06:28 her hair or something like that but when
0:06:30 it doesn't go away
0:06:32 when it's just kind of paused for a Beat
0:06:35 is
0:06:38 what about
0:06:39 Elsa Alberta
0:06:42 I think she's probably dead
0:06:47 why do you think that and she kind of
0:06:50 resumes brushing like she's trying to
0:06:51 maintain her own level of chill because
0:06:54 when
0:06:57 um
0:06:58 basically there was a Gala and she was
0:07:00 there and the spot attacked it and and
0:07:03 Roberta kind of trails off and is trying
0:07:06 to you can see that she's like holding
0:07:08 like this list that she's written kind
0:07:10 of closer to herself and closing her
0:07:12 eyes and kind of trying to like go
0:07:13 through the list to Center herself wind
0:07:15 just kind of puts her hand on British
0:07:18 shoulder
0:07:19 if that's an event in something else
0:07:22 do you want to start from the beginning
0:07:24 or do we want to continue on Miles first
0:07:27 and we'll get back to this
0:07:29 Bretta shrugs she she that kind of
0:07:32 decision she seems so overwhelmed that
0:07:36 that kind of feels like it would be like
0:07:38 treading on someone else from her
0:07:39 perspective when looks to Miles why
0:07:42 don't you finish up with what you're
0:07:44 talking about Johnny comes walking back
0:07:46 into the room clipping the uh the ends
0:07:48 off three cigars he puts one in front of
0:07:50 miles one in front of when and then
0:07:52 lights his own with his with his Zippo
0:07:54 and leaves a Zippo on the uh on the
0:07:56 coffee table between the two of them
0:07:58 goes walking off back to his post in the
0:08:01 kitchen puffing on his cigar at that
0:08:04 point
0:08:04 we had secured both the chamir and The
0:08:08 Toreador support in within the city and
0:08:11 was able to declare Praxis and that's
0:08:13 the night the princes showed up princess
0:08:18 showed up a little bit later all right
0:08:19 was that no that was when the children
0:08:21 of Hakeem showed up yes all right yes
0:08:24 the city is currently a refuge for
0:08:29 Assamites
0:08:32 not too many days later
0:08:34 the princess showed up
0:08:36 the event with Kabir happened which I'll
0:08:38 let you cover then
0:08:42 um we held our first chord for all the
0:08:44 strange happenings in New Haven
0:08:47 not quite sure exactly the timing on
0:08:50 that I don't think anybody's thrown the
0:08:52 timing on that I keep on replaying those
0:08:54 nights in my head and none of none of
0:08:56 the timeline makes sense to me that's a
0:08:58 blur there's a lot going on as we secure
0:09:00 the city we provided money and whatnot
0:09:03 for many of the residents that Rowlands
0:09:06 attacks is to and to buy safety security
0:09:09 for many of the residents as miles talks
0:09:12 when is just still twirling brita's hair
0:09:14 around her fingers trying to just like
0:09:16 play with Styles nothing elaborate just
0:09:19 mostly an excuse to kind of give a
0:09:21 soothing touch if Brita still seems to
0:09:23 want it you can feel that she is leaning
0:09:26 into the physical comfort that like the
0:09:29 soft touches even though she Brita seems
0:09:32 very inclined to pull away right now to
0:09:35 shut down right now that you can feel
0:09:38 that the action is helpful that first
0:09:40 night
0:09:41 um that is when wind was declared
0:09:43 Sheriff Johnny was sent a show and I
0:09:46 believe primagen currently I am too but
0:09:48 I'm a clan of one yeah I'm still [ __ ]
0:09:51 furious with you about that noted most
0:09:53 of the other primogens have stayed the
0:09:56 same same with the scourge and then uh
0:10:00 we got attacked by some of the uh Prince
0:10:02 from Newark I'm not quite sure he
0:10:05 declared Praxis and me and Johnny uh
0:10:08 stopped it aggressively neither of you
0:10:10 seemed like the type to do it passively
0:10:12 so that tracks yeah and then I think
0:10:14 that really leads us to Ira showing up
0:10:17 with not too long after ambrosino
0:10:19 Giovanni where we met him went out to
0:10:22 deal with the thing that happened to win
0:10:24 at the hotel then we ended up going to
0:10:27 the Chantry
0:10:28 what happened to you at the hotel so
0:10:31 that's a story within a story her
0:10:32 fingers continue to work she seems to be
0:10:34 having fun with someone who actually has
0:10:36 a bunch of hair to play with so that's
0:10:38 kind of a story within a story
0:10:41 it wasn't long after miles became Prince
0:10:46 the day after maybe two days after Maybe
0:10:50 again time time got weird I got a call
0:10:53 from Kabir Johnny got a page from him
0:10:56 that he wasn't okay he was in trouble
0:10:58 and so we went to his hotel and he was
0:11:02 largely I would describe it as just
0:11:05 twitching just his brain wasn't all
0:11:07 there he wasn't all there and there was
0:11:09 something on TV about the storm in
0:11:12 Bangladesh then he tried to attack and
0:11:14 we got him staked I turned off the TV
0:11:17 the TV turned back on and I stayed there
0:11:21 I must have left at some point because I
0:11:22 had books I was reading and then Mr
0:11:25 Perfect showed up
0:11:27 and I tried to get one over on him and
0:11:30 it for a minute it felt like it didn't
0:11:32 work and then it did
0:11:35 and so I've got him off doing something
0:11:38 to help Joey
0:11:40 but Kabir was there when he showed up
0:11:42 and now kabir's not there anymore
0:11:45 and I tried so hard to find him and like
0:11:47 I can track people's beasts like it
0:11:49 doesn't matter how well I can see or not
0:11:51 see I can track people Kindred
0:11:54 specifically
0:11:56 and it just always brought me back to
0:11:58 the hotel room so knowing that now that
0:12:01 there's something going on with his
0:12:04 anti-diluvian she seems a little
0:12:07 hesitant to say the word but that [ __ ]
0:12:09 has sailed so it wouldn't surprise me if
0:12:12 it played out any number of ways that he
0:12:14 was there and I couldn't see him that he
0:12:17 was there and couldn't see me that he
0:12:19 wasn't there at all and was tricking me
0:12:21 into thinking that his Beast was back
0:12:23 back it up back it up what are you
0:12:25 talking about his anti-diluvian
0:12:27 the thing we fought Was A Shard of
0:12:30 ravana is the storm in the East what the
0:12:34 [ __ ] is ravana the ravno Santi deluvian
0:12:38 Johnny has kind of a far away look for a
0:12:41 second as he pieces together the the
0:12:43 connection of ravnos and ravana and he
0:12:46 kind of goes still for a little bit yeah
0:12:48 it was I'd heard the name in like myths
0:12:51 and legends before but that it has real
0:12:53 world consequences is
0:12:55 unsurprising yet still I'm surprised by
0:12:58 it Marie said confirmed also yes so
0:13:01 we're talking about two now we seemed to
0:13:04 think
0:13:06 um well I I wonder if
0:13:08 I wonder if that's side to The Shard
0:13:12 connected to Vito waking up
0:13:14 waking and going haywire and everything
0:13:18 when Ponders this for a minute she
0:13:21 pauses playing with her hair as she
0:13:23 thinks and then trying to tell me that
0:13:25 some piece of Flesh in New Haven can
0:13:29 sense a storm on the other side of the
0:13:31 planet it seemed like it had
0:13:34 really heightened awareness and it
0:13:37 definitely was able to to hit hard
0:13:40 psychically I mean it makes sense that
0:13:43 if a predator appears in a place where
0:13:45 you've been unchallenged
0:13:47 for so long if you are also a predator
0:13:49 that you would take pains to try and
0:13:51 assert dominance in your territory so
0:13:53 that all tracks with me recent also
0:13:55 referred to it as the eldest it was able
0:13:58 to lash out and
0:14:01 rip
0:14:03 Parts away so I think that it would be
0:14:07 able to to maybe it's like me or like
0:14:11 Neil where it can
0:14:12 well maybe not like us at all much much
0:14:15 better
0:14:16 uh specs what do you mean it ripped
0:14:19 Parts away from you Britta the
0:14:21 tightening again she continues like
0:14:23 running her fingernails over britta's
0:14:25 head and like her hand kind of Cups her
0:14:29 forehead for a second and just kind of
0:14:31 Pats her and then Retreats back to just
0:14:34 styling her hair
0:14:36 you don't have to talk about it
0:14:38 but it sounds it sounds like miles went
0:14:41 through something similar
0:14:43 she blinks and you can kind of feel her
0:14:45 nod but whether she's following your
0:14:49 advice that she doesn't have to talk
0:14:50 about it or whether she's
0:14:52 flinching at something unseen not
0:14:55 particularly clear so anyway I was in
0:14:58 the hotel room I just kind of used that
0:15:01 as a base while I was looking for Kabir
0:15:03 and the TV was on and it was always
0:15:06 about the storm in the East and I don't
0:15:09 know if that was some chemistry trick or
0:15:12 if that was genuinely the only thing
0:15:15 going on in the world worth putting on
0:15:17 TV but I destroyed the TV because it was
0:15:19 a pain in the ass and I was tired of
0:15:21 listening to it and then dozens
0:15:24 dozens of starved crazed vampires showed
0:15:30 up and I swear they were real and they
0:15:33 broke through the window and they came
0:15:34 through the vents and I couldn't get
0:15:36 away and they took me down
0:15:39 and the next thing I remember
0:15:41 is Miles being a condescending jerk
0:15:44 and trying to get me to wake up
0:15:46 and I've never been so glad to hear him
0:15:49 being a condescending jerk
0:15:51 and she kind of gives a grateful look to
0:15:54 miles
0:15:55 figured anger might work better than
0:15:56 anything else
0:15:58 yeah you've got me in a box here man
0:16:02 that's pretty much what I do
0:16:05 but I woke up and saw IRA and Ira
0:16:09 mentioned that I would be working with
0:16:11 him on behest of
0:16:14 Mr Giovanni
0:16:16 and then we got the call to go to the
0:16:18 Chantry
0:16:20 just before that Johnny had an unusual
0:16:22 encounter I did
0:16:25 Johnny has settled down at this point
0:16:27 he's actually found his way into a chair
0:16:29 and has stopped fidgeting and pacing
0:16:32 back and forth it seems having the cigar
0:16:34 in his fingers and being able to smoke
0:16:36 on something is calmed him quite a great
0:16:39 deal last night was a hell of a night
0:16:42 yeah
0:16:44 yeah
0:16:45 the prince from New Jersey and his goons
0:16:47 tried to practice miles and we took care
0:16:51 of that and then I got a call about a
0:16:53 raging Lupine oh shoot near Yale
0:16:57 what
0:16:58 is there two of them captured still oh
0:17:00 we do two Loops no no sorry two of the
0:17:04 two of the goons from New Jersey
0:17:07 like
0:17:08 Prince or no he didn't make it out miles
0:17:11 still has his pension for taking arms
0:17:14 um where are they
0:17:16 and a secure holding cell the uh the
0:17:19 prisoners from New Jersey are staked and
0:17:22 tucked away in a room anyways I think
0:17:25 you're the one who put them somewhere
0:17:26 yeah I took care of that so we've got
0:17:30 the two displaced Prince
0:17:32 boot party
0:17:34 locked in a closet somewhere and the
0:17:37 Lupine is where Johnny in my Haven
0:17:41 I know that's an exceptionally bad idea
0:17:44 look here's the thing
0:17:46 I'm pretty sure whatever this I think
0:17:49 the lupine's related to the one we
0:17:51 killed at Elysium you'd be surprised if
0:17:54 it wasn't they don't usually seek out
0:17:55 interaction with us I'm not sure it was
0:18:01 acting of its own volition well I just
0:18:03 start from the beginning
0:18:05 I got a call from the hunters
0:18:08 the group that my daughter's a part of
0:18:09 they needed help Suarez and Ramirez are
0:18:13 they okay
0:18:13 Ramirez is okay
0:18:16 Suarez I don't know
0:18:18 my daughter Jessica is she's um she's
0:18:21 okay
0:18:22 Joey's mom didn't make it
0:18:25 [ __ ] I was right there and
0:18:26 it was pretty bad when
0:18:29 um God I hope he didn't see it oh God I
0:18:31 hope he wasn't there this werewolf was
0:18:35 it looked almost rabid an animal that
0:18:39 kind of has lost sense of itself
0:18:42 you should have seen the destruction
0:18:44 this thing wrought their cars overturned
0:18:47 it looked like a [ __ ] war zone I get
0:18:49 that you fought a werewolf before but um
0:18:52 the way that that one was staring
0:18:54 through people I don't there was nothing
0:18:57 I don't think you could have saved Joyce
0:19:00 Mom that's not the
0:19:03 how did they hold it off until you got
0:19:05 there it barely did when I found Suarez
0:19:08 he was pinned against a wall under a car
0:19:11 Jesus
0:19:13 and this thing it was um
0:19:16 I unloaded all of the silver bullets
0:19:18 into its head
0:19:20 it should be dead
0:19:22 I probably should have kept trying I
0:19:24 probably should have tear it torn apart
0:19:25 I probably should have just drank all
0:19:28 its blood and gone on a frenzy myself I
0:19:30 I should have done something how would
0:19:31 that be better because it wouldn't be
0:19:33 here anymore but it still is and the
0:19:36 best place I could think to put it was
0:19:37 my Haven and then we would have had to
0:19:39 put you down no getting mad at people
0:19:42 you're right badwin she intently like
0:19:45 takes tiny strands of brita's hair so
0:19:47 she can hyper focus on braiding
0:19:50 I agree with you
0:19:52 the the the options I had for trying to
0:19:55 kill this thing were exhausted and I
0:19:58 figured the best solution would be to
0:20:00 put it somewhere that it might have a
0:20:02 hard time getting out of the basement
0:20:03 under the Sherwood's a labyrinth and
0:20:06 hopefully that bomb shelter can keep
0:20:08 that thing in and it won't get out and
0:20:10 hurt anybody else I'm gonna have to get
0:20:12 over there and deal with that eventually
0:20:14 Maybe
0:20:16 we can talk to it him thing
0:20:20 increasingly becoming worried that part
0:20:23 of what's driving it crazy is the same
0:20:26 thing that's driving everything else
0:20:27 crazy if ravana is causing the flesh New
0:20:30 York to catalyze causing it to go crazy
0:20:33 in New Haven maybe it's also making the
0:20:36 werewolves crazy
0:20:38 no idea what they're about like some
0:20:39 kind of weird radio signal in the air
0:20:42 that only dogs can hear you know what I
0:20:43 mean
0:20:44 I'm also still worried the hell about
0:20:46 Jessica
0:20:47 Hal I'm even worried about Suarez and
0:20:50 Ramirez
0:20:51 [ __ ]
0:20:53 they've got dashwood in a car with them
0:20:56 people do we have locked in places right
0:20:58 now
0:20:59 Neil Neil somehow
0:21:02 got inside dashwood's head and was
0:21:04 I don't know how half this [ __ ] Works he
0:21:07 was there for a moment and then when I
0:21:09 tried to ask him about what was
0:21:11 happening he he was gone and dashboard
0:21:13 was in a was in torpor like Neil's body
0:21:16 was somewhere else but Neil was in there
0:21:19 and you could see him kind of
0:21:22 yeah just like that yeah that happened
0:21:25 to me too so anyhow are our hunter
0:21:28 friends are on the Run either crippled
0:21:31 or dead they've got the keeper of
0:21:34 Elysium in the back of a taxi
0:21:37 and I'm sure they [ __ ] need some help
0:21:39 I got it I think they're still planning
0:21:41 on going out their Hell House I'm sure
0:21:43 that place is a freaking mess right now
0:21:45 well I think Reiss might be headed there
0:21:47 too so that's gonna end badly if we
0:21:49 don't get involved that's not any
0:21:51 guarantee that it's not gonna end badly
0:21:53 but after our discussion here maybe you
0:21:55 should reach out to some of the hunters
0:21:58 I think we can do that I was wondering
0:22:00 if maybe they'd be better at keeping
0:22:03 Eden safe than we would Johnny kind of
0:22:05 looks at her like that's like with like
0:22:07 a kind of a shock expression like holy
0:22:10 [ __ ] that's a good idea yeah it kind of
0:22:12 like nods his head a little bit I was
0:22:14 wondering the same thing on how they
0:22:16 view her
0:22:17 well she's kind of Kindred but she's
0:22:20 Sheila is um Sheila is the reason I
0:22:24 didn't try something stupid with the
0:22:25 werewolf I'm pretty sure she and Ramirez
0:22:29 both
0:22:30 think a lot higher of Our Kind than
0:22:34 we thought they might I mean Ramirez
0:22:37 brought pizza I think he's a straight
0:22:38 shooter he's just the only confused the
0:22:40 only thing I'm worried about
0:22:42 is if we can actually trust Eden with
0:22:44 them
0:22:45 she is still a vampire isn't she
0:22:48 seemingly she drinks blood at least she
0:22:51 I think half a pizza I think she would
0:22:53 be safe with them I don't know if they'd
0:22:55 be safe with her I don't know if they
0:22:57 can protect her either
0:22:58 I think we have to let go of the notion
0:23:00 that she's gonna be safe anywhere I
0:23:02 think we have to focus on where she'll
0:23:04 be safe fast also
0:23:07 that call was from Weathers sounds like
0:23:10 he's in New York dealing with some [ __ ]
0:23:12 I tried to warn him but whether said
0:23:15 nails with him so when weathers come
0:23:18 back come back I mean Kabir no I mean
0:23:21 Neil I'm Neil's with him too yeah
0:23:24 [ __ ] shady bastard didn't tell me
0:23:26 that
0:23:26 um I actually I was nail cell phone on
0:23:29 the line I what does the goddamn party
0:23:31 done in New York I wouldn't imagine he's
0:23:33 down in New York by choice no I trust
0:23:35 him you're right he's probably there for
0:23:37 damn good reasons I don't know how
0:23:38 Neil's doing with him though what did he
0:23:40 say he was there for some kind of
0:23:42 exchange trying to Garner support for
0:23:44 the anarchs maybe they could use it we
0:23:47 could use it well he also they support
0:23:49 us if we play our cards right he also
0:23:51 said that we really need to get this
0:23:53 bruja Rave together I need to put a call
0:23:55 of arms out try and get as much support
0:23:57 in this region as we can
0:23:59 how to rant really recently we had a
0:24:02 ranch what we want to do is a rave a
0:24:05 little bit different
0:24:06 it's a bruja party so to speak and
0:24:09 it's often custom that uh bruja can
0:24:12 bring along people from outside the clan
0:24:14 to a rave
0:24:15 and they tend to be a little bit bigger
0:24:16 than a local rant and when they happen
0:24:19 often times it's discuss pretty big
0:24:21 matters and sometimes called arms goes
0:24:26 out
0:24:26 that's when our clan comes and forms
0:24:29 ranks we don't do it very often because
0:24:32 more more often than not we'd like to
0:24:34 beat the hell out of each other when a
0:24:36 called arms goes out we generally
0:24:38 respect that when we form ranks weathers
0:24:41 wants to call called arms against the
0:24:43 Sabbat invasion but considering we're
0:24:45 dealing with possibly
0:24:47 um he looks back and forth at win and
0:24:49 Brita not really willing to say
0:24:52 anti-diluvian himself auntie deluvian
0:24:56 yeah
0:24:57 and if that's the case I think we might
0:24:59 have to put a cold arms out to all sex
0:25:02 I've been thinking I need to
0:25:04 the former Gangrel Justicar
0:25:07 left
0:25:09 because of something he found in New
0:25:11 York
0:25:12 and I think he might be interested to
0:25:14 know that there's people willing to do
0:25:16 something about it
0:25:18 so maybe a thing is in order as well
0:25:20 what a thing it's like a Gangrel rant
0:25:22 wait that's as a proper name yeah no
0:25:26 yeah it's a Germanic base I think but
0:25:29 well
0:25:30 all right and when starts braiding
0:25:34 brita's hair with purpose how many
0:25:36 braids are in there
0:25:38 uh at this point there's like there's
0:25:41 two little ones kind of on the sides
0:25:43 just kind of hanging there for now and
0:25:45 then she's kind of starting at the top
0:25:47 like a French braid or a Dutch braid oh
0:25:49 she's giving her a proper win one of
0:25:51 those wind battle braids now exactly I
0:25:53 assume that you've been braiding your
0:25:54 hair and then unbraiding it and then
0:25:56 reiterating it like over and over again
0:25:58 yeah she's been she's been going through
0:25:59 a myriad of braids braids are pretty
0:26:01 much what she can do seven different
0:26:02 braids on her head at the same time
0:26:05 as the conversation kind of it turns
0:26:09 more towards the future than filling
0:26:11 each other in when
0:26:13 very gently and slowly kind of tugs on
0:26:17 the top of brita's braid that she's
0:26:19 putting in her hair
0:26:20 just so that she can look they can make
0:26:22 eye contact
0:26:24 and it's not meant to be rough it's not
0:26:29 meant to be intimidating just just
0:26:32 enough so that they can make eye contact
0:26:33 and Wynn kind of gives her a look like
0:26:36 the floor is yours when you're ready for
0:26:38 it and then kind of tips her head back
0:26:40 down so she can keep braiding Brita is a
0:26:42 little confused by this
0:26:45 she moves in the way that someone very
0:26:48 polite at the hairdressers would at
0:26:50 first just directed to look up but she's
0:26:53 a little avoidant of the eye contact and
0:26:56 she does get the message
0:26:59 she kind of squares herself moving just
0:27:01 a bit away from when trying to look at
0:27:04 the group at large generally failing
0:27:06 Gwen adjusts her body to continue
0:27:07 braiding so she's sort of perched on the
0:27:10 back of the couch at this point
0:27:12 so
0:27:14 Brita pulls out the little shade of
0:27:17 notes like it's a personal anchor for
0:27:19 the situation
0:27:21 after we killed the Abbott
0:27:25 um we had driven back to my Haven and I
0:27:28 went inside too
0:27:30 check everything over and
0:27:33 um
0:27:34 I felt this
0:27:35 undeniable urge that I needed to go
0:27:38 somewhere being being summoned and when
0:27:41 I finally got to where I summoned to
0:27:45 Roman Pendragon was there
0:27:49 um I'd gotten to the limousine and we
0:27:53 started talking
0:27:54 and
0:27:57 um
0:27:58 I apologize for us leaving Boston
0:28:02 and was he mad about that yeah
0:28:07 um
0:28:08 oh he you know how he said he was going
0:28:11 to summon and kill us if we
0:28:15 left
0:28:16 I don't remember that but I assume he
0:28:19 did feels on brand
0:28:21 they threatened something along those
0:28:22 lines he summoned me and asked why he
0:28:27 shouldn't and
0:28:29 um
0:28:29 basically I I apologize for a slaving
0:28:33 boss and Anna expressed that we so
0:28:35 wanted to work together and that we
0:28:37 could work together
0:28:39 um
0:28:40 and if we keep on cooperating then
0:28:45 you know
0:28:47 you know what
0:28:50 he wants us on his team
0:28:53 and I said that we would be
0:28:57 not against working with Pendragon but
0:28:59 his methodology is
0:29:02 problem
0:29:03 he's not someone who
0:29:06 is used to being
0:29:10 defied so
0:29:14 um
0:29:16 I think that if we
0:29:18 don't run and we talk about things that
0:29:24 in order to keep on working together
0:29:26 will need to keep
0:29:28 better communication with between
0:29:31 ourselves with Pendragon
0:29:34 I know that
0:29:37 I know that his methodology
0:29:41 um I
0:29:43 there's there's more I should go in
0:29:45 order but Rita you don't have to justify
0:29:49 decisions you made
0:29:51 in that situation
0:29:54 we should talk about them we should
0:29:55 figure out how to move forward with them
0:29:58 but I'm not going to be mad about
0:30:00 anything you did said or otherwise had
0:30:03 to do to survive
0:30:05 basically after that he took me back to
0:30:08 his Haven and
0:30:12 told me that he'd be bringing me to a
0:30:15 Gala held by Prince Warwick
0:30:17 to demonstrate the alliance between New
0:30:20 Haven and Hartford oh all right
0:30:23 when sort of keeps her hands
0:30:26 intentionally untense it's sort of like
0:30:29 holding on to someone's hair someone she
0:30:32 cares about is keeping her from getting
0:30:35 mad
0:30:38 um during the night I
0:30:41 well during the day sorry I mean it's
0:30:43 kind of confusing I I had
0:30:47 I got woken up by a nightmare and that
0:30:50 was I guess when you guys were going to
0:30:52 go kill Rowlands and it felt like that
0:30:55 it felt like
0:30:57 I mean I um I screamed when I woke up
0:31:00 and it woke
0:31:02 Fred's Pendragon up too and he said that
0:31:04 it was like a vision from my all specs
0:31:10 and I could feel the Noose slipping down
0:31:13 over Rollins and
0:31:16 I don't know but I that feeling like
0:31:19 you're smelling the smoke and you can't
0:31:20 see the fire yet
0:31:22 but we ended up going to the Gullah the
0:31:25 next day
0:31:28 and Elsa was there
0:31:30 and um
0:31:32 she was trying to look out for me and
0:31:35 make sure that I was safe
0:31:37 and that's that's when um
0:31:40 Neil Neil found me at that Gala he came
0:31:43 with fesser I think they were acting in
0:31:46 some capacity as security maybe work is
0:31:49 Noth right
0:31:50 yeah makes sense work was
0:31:55 Prince Pendragon had warned me that
0:31:56 Warwick would
0:31:58 react negatively to me between disliking
0:32:01 the toreadora and
0:32:03 Shaw being
0:32:06 Shaw was of Works line two so
0:32:09 and
0:32:11 um while I was there Warrick pulled me
0:32:13 aside for an interrogation effectively
0:32:17 but when I walked in the room there was
0:32:20 the people that you saw in the Chantry
0:32:24 the um the blonde one and the trench
0:32:26 coat shrike
0:32:28 and
0:32:30 the one with all the teeth
0:32:33 Phantom
0:32:35 when Britta says Phantom she looks
0:32:38 quietly angry
0:32:40 there's so many emotions roiling in her
0:32:42 but the anger from the Chantry is left
0:32:46 over you saw them in the shadowlands no
0:32:49 they weren't in the shadowlands they
0:32:51 were they were in the room but you those
0:32:54 were the ones you had seen in the
0:32:55 shadowlands I recognize Phantom it's the
0:32:59 one with all the teeth
0:33:00 I hadn't seen shrike before well of
0:33:04 course I'd seen him before I just didn't
0:33:06 remember him at all also question where
0:33:10 was Pendragon when you were taken away
0:33:12 to be interrogated
0:33:13 when Warwick came up to us and asked
0:33:18 that I come with him
0:33:20 I went with him and it was tense between
0:33:23 the two of them their allies but
0:33:27 um
0:33:28 I told pendrick and that I'd go and I
0:33:33 was doing my best to
0:33:36 really important that I did what I could
0:33:39 to follow pan drug instructions
0:33:42 win kind of gives a non
0:33:44 he specifically
0:33:46 wanted me to demonstrate that New Haven
0:33:48 was safe and strong and in Alliance and
0:33:52 to be the representation of our city
0:33:56 so I went with work alone at first
0:34:01 and Warwick knew all about hell house I
0:34:05 mean that makes some sense if he was
0:34:08 talking to Shaw
0:34:09 he's looking for more information about
0:34:12 it he asked me a lot of questions about
0:34:14 it but he seemed more like he wanted to
0:34:17 kneecap the cautery politically then
0:34:19 like he was approaching it as
0:34:22 what it is
0:34:24 it looked like he was looking for
0:34:26 political con control
0:34:28 and he knew that the chamir had
0:34:31 Freda kind of looks like she's gonna
0:34:33 throw up even if that instinct isn't
0:34:36 quite there for a vampire him yeah that
0:34:40 that they had veto and that veto was
0:34:42 owed to pendragon's Army by Johnny
0:34:46 and he's looking to use that against us
0:34:49 as well
0:34:50 I I just answered his questions
0:34:52 straightforwardly I tried to leave out
0:34:54 things if I could but most things that
0:34:58 we know about hell house he knows what
0:35:01 were the other two doing there
0:35:03 it seemed to me like they were there too
0:35:07 manipulate him
0:35:09 like they had arrived under the guise of
0:35:12 being
0:35:13 his allies
0:35:15 that had given him information about
0:35:18 hell house and other things
0:35:21 to use him in order to get information
0:35:25 out of me or to get me into the room
0:35:28 it felt clear to me that they had caused
0:35:31 the situation and
0:35:34 it felt like work was reading my mind
0:35:37 like he was skimming the surface
0:35:39 I don't know how to explain it I just
0:35:42 when I would react to things like them
0:35:45 speaking in demolish instructions that I
0:35:48 couldn't ignore Grandma leash
0:35:51 um that their language
0:35:53 whose language the tomahira
0:35:57 they
0:35:58 that's what it seemed to me that they
0:36:00 were going to use however Warwick was
0:36:03 skimming my mind he would recognize
0:36:06 things in me that emotional responses I
0:36:10 had to them or little things like that
0:36:12 and they were listening to me talk to
0:36:15 it seems like they had directed the
0:36:17 conversation so that work would
0:36:20 feel that he was leveraging information
0:36:23 politically and he did have a lot of
0:36:26 that but that work would feel that he
0:36:30 was leveraging that information himself
0:36:32 but really that he had been directed to
0:36:33 do it by the time rather
0:36:36 um shrike I didn't realize at the time
0:36:39 but I
0:36:41 I think he's my sire
0:36:43 which one was he
0:36:45 um
0:36:46 the one who had the grenade launcher
0:36:48 blonde trench coat yeah why do you think
0:36:52 he's your sire
0:36:54 um you've seen me do this before this
0:36:56 thing where it seems like I'm having one
0:36:59 conversation but I'm really having
0:37:01 another
0:37:02 Elsa taught me it it's something our
0:37:06 clan does again she looks briefly Crest
0:37:09 Fallen but she's trying to stay on topic
0:37:12 he looked at me and he did it like he
0:37:14 knew I'd be able to do it back or at
0:37:17 least to recognize it
0:37:19 um
0:37:20 and he
0:37:22 was taunting me during the meeting
0:37:24 but he said a phrase a phrase I
0:37:26 remembered it from my first night when I
0:37:28 was walking through Haven the club
0:37:32 someone someone had looked at me and
0:37:35 said good for you and he said it the
0:37:37 same way purposefully at least sounds
0:37:40 like a [ __ ] but that's neither here
0:37:43 nor there
0:37:44 um
0:37:45 things were getting worse and
0:37:48 then Prince Pendragon came in
0:37:51 and he
0:37:52 protected me from work he got me out of
0:37:55 the meeting he had said that he would
0:37:57 when
0:37:59 he asked that we go to the gala he said
0:38:03 that if I did as I said he would protect
0:38:05 me and he followed through on it he kept
0:38:08 his word
0:38:09 he got me out of there and um
0:38:12 shortly after that's when the Sabah
0:38:14 attacked what do you attacked how
0:38:17 britta's been looking down but her gaze
0:38:20 migrates to the spot by Johnny's feet
0:38:23 when pendricken got me out
0:38:27 um Neil tried to talk to me
0:38:30 and I didn't want the interaction to go
0:38:33 badly and Prince Pendragon was already
0:38:37 angry with Prince work and it seemed
0:38:41 like there had maybe been some
0:38:43 interaction between him and Neil before
0:38:45 and
0:38:47 um we started catching wind of things
0:38:49 and Neil noticed it first a scent of
0:38:52 blood and Ash and
0:38:54 they it was
0:38:57 it was horrifying like there are so many
0:39:01 support like they came from the ocean
0:39:04 like they'd walked out beneath the water
0:39:08 like they got together
0:39:10 a like a campaign to destroy this party
0:39:13 and all the elders there and
0:39:18 they were very prepared
0:39:20 and they were very successful
0:39:23 wind kind of finishes the braid in her
0:39:26 hair just kind of ties it off with
0:39:28 another piece of her hair tucks the
0:39:30 little braids in so that they're kind of
0:39:32 decorating the main braid
0:39:34 and just kind of puts a hand on her
0:39:36 shoulder
0:39:37 I know what you think of his methods
0:39:41 but he helped Prince pendrick and helped
0:39:45 us
0:39:46 survive the Savannah attack too how many
0:39:49 people got out I think it was
0:39:52 some of the NOS fraught too got out
0:39:54 through some passageways and
0:39:57 Neil seemed like he'd sent some warning
0:39:59 along so maybe melchavians
0:40:02 but it was like walking through sludge
0:40:07 everything was Ash and blood and they
0:40:11 let the men are on fire with a lot of
0:40:14 people in it and they circled everyone
0:40:16 and they burnt all the cars so there was
0:40:18 no way out through cars and
0:40:21 very few people got out how did you get
0:40:25 out and Neil Neil knew of a back way
0:40:28 something like something that the north
0:40:31 brought you had to use to I guess maybe
0:40:34 like a staff entrance
0:40:37 and we ended up fighting our way through
0:40:39 we had to go back into the burning
0:40:43 building to do it and for some of it I
0:40:47 um my Beast got the best of me and I
0:40:49 fell into fear and when I
0:40:51 awoke I was Prince Pendragon was
0:40:55 carrying me and we are getting out of
0:40:56 the tunnel we got to Fester's truck
0:41:00 um he must have parked it further away
0:41:03 and we we drove away in that
0:41:07 is that the attack that took Elsa
0:41:09 yeah
0:41:10 um you said something about Carmen
0:41:12 Carmen was there and Delgado was there
0:41:15 The Killing Spree was
0:41:17 to hearing a lot of the damage too it
0:41:20 seemed like Carmen was there too
0:41:22 specifically root out elders
0:41:25 when we had gone in the building the
0:41:27 first time
0:41:28 I had been instructed to try to warn
0:41:31 Prince work it seemed like he had
0:41:33 already run away
0:41:34 to get some weapons and
0:41:37 we tried to get Elsa out we were looking
0:41:40 for her and she had locked herself away
0:41:41 in a room and we were trying to call her
0:41:43 and
0:41:45 she got scared um I think it was maybe
0:41:48 my fault because I said what this about
0:41:51 we're doing and we broke into her room
0:41:53 and when we broke into her room Carmen
0:41:55 was in there and Carmen put up this
0:41:59 fear of darkness and she had pulled Elsa
0:42:03 into it and we're trying to pull Elsa
0:42:05 out and
0:42:06 and we're making a chain it was me and
0:42:09 Neil and the other Toreador in there but
0:42:11 we're not strong like a la Sombra and
0:42:15 Neil said that he felt else's arm turned
0:42:19 turned to Ash so I so I ran and pulled
0:42:24 Neil with me
0:42:26 and you got away Investor's truck
0:42:28 yeah
0:42:31 um Prince Pendragon got us a hotel and
0:42:36 that's the last time I saw Neil um he
0:42:40 was supposed to be in another room
0:42:42 I
0:42:44 I was really worried that I got him
0:42:47 killed because
0:42:50 um
0:42:51 after
0:42:53 you know the end of the night and
0:42:55 everything the next night I woke
0:42:58 early and there was
0:43:01 the door was open
0:43:03 um
0:43:04 and I called out to see who it was and
0:43:10 and
0:43:11 that tomorrow were outside
0:43:14 well not really the time Ira it was
0:43:17 Phantom the one with all of the teeth
0:43:18 and it was Romeo you could see them at
0:43:22 that mention Brita looks around the room
0:43:24 with our specs checking for Romeo there
0:43:27 is no sign of Romeo
0:43:28 oh Johnny I'm I'm sorry um Pendragon
0:43:33 knows that Delgado is your sire nothing
0:43:35 for you to be sorry about he saw the
0:43:38 moon on my hand and
0:43:41 he thought I was gonna be Blackhand and
0:43:43 I was trying to explain and I was
0:43:45 yeah
0:43:47 here's I tried to say I wasn't like
0:43:50 Delgado and he was asking why I knew
0:43:53 Delgado went
0:43:55 and I told him that I was tomahira
0:43:59 or that they took me did he seem to know
0:44:02 anything about them
0:44:04 I don't think so
0:44:06 so he'd been unwittedly working for them
0:44:08 anyways I don't think so I think they
0:44:11 were working with work it sounded like
0:44:13 the way you're describing before they
0:44:15 were unwittingly controlling Ward
0:44:18 I think so yes I think they were using
0:44:21 Warwick's skill as a spymaster and their
0:44:25 own skill with acquiring information to
0:44:27 make themselves useful to work so that
0:44:29 they could move him in the way that they
0:44:31 would need for their objective do you
0:44:33 know what their objective is yes
0:44:36 when they came to the door they were
0:44:39 trying to come get me and when I called
0:44:41 out
0:44:43 um it woke pen tracking up and he asked
0:44:46 me it was at the door he couldn't see
0:44:48 them I think I think
0:44:50 I don't know why if there was something
0:44:52 to do with you know the way that I can
0:44:54 see things that others can't but they um
0:44:58 they activated me
0:45:01 I went like I've gone before and I lost
0:45:05 control of myself and I am
0:45:08 I hit I tried to hit and dragon with a
0:45:13 coffee maker and I um
0:45:15 I didn't succeed I I am tried to I I
0:45:19 didn't mean to I I just that was someone
0:45:23 else I was who I am an agent and I tried
0:45:29 to dread gaze him and it didn't work and
0:45:33 I don't think I'll ever be able to use
0:45:35 presents on him again and he
0:45:38 um
0:45:39 didn't kill me so that's good take that
0:45:43 as a win I'm sure he's been hit by worse
0:45:46 and I ran and
0:45:49 by the time I could get control of
0:45:51 myself again I was in a van with them a
0:45:54 van with who a unit I think
0:45:57 I guess it was mostly my old unit
0:46:01 and with a strange expression as if some
0:46:04 information has somehow been shaken
0:46:06 loose with Clarity that is unusual to
0:46:09 Bretta speaking about her past she
0:46:12 recalls a word come on they're called a
0:46:15 unit of this organization is a common
0:46:18 yes okay who was can you tell us who the
0:46:22 people were some of them weren't people
0:46:25 that were my group the name they called
0:46:29 me was Canary and everyone that was a
0:46:32 part of my group had a name like that
0:46:34 that was shrike who he seemed like me in
0:46:39 some ways but
0:46:41 um I space out when things are really
0:46:44 pretty and he seemed to space out not
0:46:47 space out he seemed to be caught in
0:46:50 interest by pain strikes are horrible
0:46:53 murderous little birds it makes sense
0:46:54 well the names seemed to speak to who we
0:46:57 were um Eagle Eagle was the one that I
0:47:00 saw in that Vision flashback it must
0:47:04 have been a flashback the one that was
0:47:06 teaching me how to shoot um
0:47:08 Phantom was there and Romeo and I
0:47:11 couldn't tell if Romeo was under their
0:47:13 controller if he was doing it willingly
0:47:15 or he may have just been trying to stay
0:47:18 near you yeah
0:47:20 and then there were a couple others
0:47:22 there was Tanakh
0:47:25 um the woman who had started turning to
0:47:27 Ash and there was the one that you saw
0:47:31 in the ceiling perin he was the leader
0:47:35 of the mission and he explained that he
0:47:37 was old Clans Mitzi
0:47:40 like he was a part of the clan that had
0:47:42 fought against the Sabbat samitsi he
0:47:46 explained that I had been brought for
0:47:49 one last mission and that they had done
0:47:52 something like what Neil does to look in
0:47:54 the sky to know what you have to do to
0:47:56 succeed at something and that they had
0:47:57 learned that they needed me for it and
0:48:01 that they were gonna go and
0:48:03 take out veto and they were going to
0:48:07 take The Shard of the eldest and put it
0:48:10 in the shadowlands oh God they thought
0:48:13 it would die there because it's flesh
0:48:15 and there's not chat no there's not
0:48:16 flesh in the shadow land so they had
0:48:18 this plan that they that way they could
0:48:20 I know that's why I was asking you when
0:48:22 we were there but that was it seemed to
0:48:25 make sense and they had consulted
0:48:26 necromancers on it and they all said it
0:48:28 would work I don't blame you but that we
0:48:32 we do need to pull a ticket and come
0:48:33 back to that it seems like it wouldn't
0:48:35 have been any worse except people
0:48:36 couldn't get to the physical side of it
0:48:37 until it decided to reach through some
0:48:40 some wraiths can reach through and
0:48:42 there's no reason to think that they
0:48:44 infected with this wouldn't just reach
0:48:46 back through I'm just saying that it
0:48:47 possibly could already infect rates
0:48:49 based on what you've just said its
0:48:51 effect had been well again pulled a
0:48:54 ticket we'll go back to that let Brenda
0:48:56 tell her story
0:48:57 they were going to make me do it I tried
0:49:00 to leave when we were in the van I tried
0:49:03 to make a run for it and I fell into
0:49:05 this looking back I think it must have
0:49:09 been Tanakh at first I thought it was
0:49:10 something imprinted in my mind that if I
0:49:12 tried to run I would just fall into a
0:49:15 constant Loop but now seeing what she
0:49:17 was capable of I think she must have
0:49:19 done it that I just kept trying to walk
0:49:21 for the door
0:49:23 and
0:49:24 Perrin made a deal with me that they'd
0:49:28 leave me alone after this do you think
0:49:31 they're going to honor it without power
0:49:32 no I don't think so I'm sorry you don't
0:49:36 need to be sorry for other people not
0:49:37 honoring their word hmm
0:49:41 I don't think they'll honor it because
0:49:43 they didn't even honor their last
0:49:45 mission it was they left right
0:49:50 they're left
0:49:51 they provided a support maybe they
0:49:53 thought we had it a lot of sides here
0:49:56 working against each other with each
0:49:58 other hmm
0:50:01 they when we went to the Chantry
0:50:05 I hate
0:50:06 they had gotten contact over and Acolyte
0:50:10 and um
0:50:11 I had tried to save someone before by
0:50:14 not doing as I was told and refusing to
0:50:17 kill someone and that person had died
0:50:20 really badly
0:50:22 um they ordered me to kill the Accolade
0:50:24 and I thought that maybe if I did it
0:50:26 that he wouldn't suffer so much but
0:50:30 I couldn't think of a way that he
0:50:32 wouldn't leave this scenario dad who
0:50:35 else did they make you kill just the
0:50:37 acolyte I don't know who's the other
0:50:39 person
0:50:40 I'm sorry the person used that when you
0:50:43 refused to kill them they died badly
0:50:46 um that was
0:50:47 Pendragon wanted me to feed with him no
0:50:51 good old pen Dragon no based on what we
0:50:54 saw in the sand tree it might have been
0:50:55 a favor it wasn't sure
0:50:58 were they responsible for the other Dead
0:51:01 premiere
0:51:02 yeah
0:51:04 we were sneaky in and I was naive I
0:51:07 thought we would just slip past until I
0:51:09 saw them dispatching everyone what
0:51:13 what do they do what is the point of
0:51:17 training like this did they just get
0:51:19 deployed for specialized missions or is
0:51:22 there like a point to their organization
0:51:24 and you may not know
0:51:28 the tomahira does what they do
0:51:31 and took me for the purpose of making
0:51:37 themselves into Protectors of humanity
0:51:41 they intend to undermine vampire
0:51:44 society's control they believe that
0:51:47 vampires are an awful blight on Humanity
0:51:52 they're not as like like the book of Nod
0:51:56 who
0:51:58 um
0:51:59 they worship the anti-diluvians as
0:52:01 Springers of the end and they feel that
0:52:04 the end is where all Vampires will be
0:52:07 judged destroyed and Mankind freed
0:52:11 there's again flashes of recollection
0:52:13 like some damn is finally setting cracks
0:52:16 in britta's brain
0:52:19 they they're the first sect of vampires
0:52:22 and they control a city in the
0:52:24 Underworld anokh the place I was taken
0:52:27 rules about Lord Johnny six
0:52:31 ocean two successes with two successes
0:52:34 you know that is
0:52:38 the name of the first city
0:52:41 it is the city that Cain made to rule
0:52:45 over all vampires when I was first
0:52:47 embraced by
0:52:49 killing spree
0:52:51 Carmen's child Rafi was preaching his
0:52:54 sermons at me and all the other
0:52:55 shovelheads
0:52:57 crazy Sabbat ramblings
0:53:01 but I remember a lot of what he said
0:53:03 and he spoke of Enoch
0:53:06 the first city
0:53:08 I thought that was garbage at the time
0:53:10 ravings of a lunatic
0:53:14 Bretta looks ashamed she pulls her gaze
0:53:17 a little bit further away from Johnny
0:53:19 you and I are so alike
0:53:22 and that we were both
0:53:24 denied our mortal lives by Insane Cults
0:53:29 of vampires with ludicrous
0:53:33 motivations
0:53:37 I don't talk about what happened to me a
0:53:39 lot just because I don't want to
0:53:40 remember it but generally I don't keep
0:53:42 it secret
0:53:44 scares me about you
0:53:46 is that we're led to believe that either
0:53:49 you
0:53:50 genuinely don't know what happened to
0:53:52 you or you're very [ __ ] good at
0:53:54 keeping secrets
0:53:55 and I can't decide which it is
0:53:58 when kind of partially stands up on the
0:54:01 back of the couch and just kind of lifts
0:54:03 her one of her legs over britta's head
0:54:05 so she can step on the couch and onto
0:54:07 the floor wind just kind of
0:54:10 like she didn't have a plan for words
0:54:15 but she doesn't like that after
0:54:17 everything britta's been through
0:54:18 Johnny's choosing now to bring this up
0:54:24 using where your first months Johnny are
0:54:27 these her first months you're the one
0:54:29 who found her I did when Fido is that a
0:54:32 coincidence dropping off a young girl to
0:54:35 be picked up by me of all people then
0:54:37 it's not it's like it's not it's not
0:54:39 been a secret that I I have issue with a
0:54:42 lost daughter when feet
0:54:45 I want to explain when Vito looked at me
0:54:49 and when all the you know came out of
0:54:53 him and there was some kind of psychic
0:54:56 attack thing it felt like maybe that
0:54:59 started shaking memories loose once I
0:55:02 had enough time to think about it I felt
0:55:03 like Words kept coming back or touching
0:55:06 at the edge of my brain I feels like I'm
0:55:08 starting to remember stuff but I've been
0:55:10 telling you guys what I remember
0:55:13 all I'm saying is that she's at the
0:55:15 center of an awful lot of [ __ ] a lot
0:55:17 of things happen when she's around like
0:55:20 Neil's been saying for [ __ ] ever
0:55:22 weird shits happening there are two Gods
0:55:26 apparently waking up
0:55:28 and she's told us that she's part of an
0:55:31 ancient vampire cult that worships these
0:55:34 Gods then how were they really different
0:55:37 than anyone else doing the weird [ __ ] in
0:55:40 this world I'm asking her if she's been
0:55:42 playing us this whole time and that's
0:55:45 [ __ ] insulting is it yeah yeah it
0:55:47 [ __ ] is Johnny it happened and
0:55:52 please believe me I I want to believe
0:55:55 you
0:55:56 I care about you a whole lot I'm sorry I
0:55:59 never wanted you guys to come to the
0:56:02 Chantry to help me I I know how much
0:56:05 danger that put you guys in we didn't go
0:56:08 to the Chantry to help you maybe you
0:56:10 didn't win is fully squaring up to
0:56:12 Johnny at this point and glares at him
0:56:15 we are getting very close to Breaking
0:56:18 the rule I set at the start of this
0:56:20 conversation what's this Weeble [ __ ]
0:56:22 looks like you're the one who's
0:56:23 bristling oh no no I don't get like this
0:56:27 unless there's a predator creeping on
0:56:29 her you talking to me yeah just cause
0:56:31 the fact that I'm not willing
0:56:34 to deny the fact that I feel like my
0:56:37 trust has been broken
0:56:38 doesn't make me a predator and the fact
0:56:41 that you don't like to hear these hard
0:56:43 truths come on out of my mouth I don't
0:56:44 know what that says about you I don't
0:56:46 think you stand for anything Johnny I
0:56:48 think you'll fall for anything that's a
0:56:49 clever little turn of freeze and I'm not
0:56:51 sure what the [ __ ] it means it means you
0:56:53 have no idea where you're standing
0:56:54 anymore you're turning against the
0:56:56 people that have been standing with you
0:56:58 this whole time you've said yourself
0:57:00 that you care about her an awful lot so
0:57:02 what does it matter you guys you don't
0:57:04 have to fight everyone has done so much
0:57:07 for me in this codery I can just I I can
0:57:11 stop being a problem it can leave it's
0:57:13 not a fight it is a culmination of all
0:57:15 the stress we're going through Johnny
0:57:17 has questions is he totally right in
0:57:20 them I don't particularly think so but
0:57:22 he's allowed to ask them and I'm allowed
0:57:25 to take exception to them I don't know I
0:57:27 don't know how either of you just think
0:57:30 that it's okay that
0:57:32 you're being incredibly naive when
0:57:35 I think either be the one being
0:57:37 incredibly naive if you're not willing
0:57:38 to believe the truth set out in front of
0:57:40 you you're looking for tin foil hat
0:57:41 conspiracies at this point Johnny from
0:57:43 the girl that came out of nowhere
0:57:45 trained by a death cult showing up to
0:57:48 the Chantry in tactical gear with a with
0:57:51 a crew of cultists in tactical gear off
0:57:54 to with with Roman Pendragon back and
0:57:57 forth to operation longbows parties
0:58:00 attacked by the Sabbat she's talking
0:58:03 about anti-diluvians and not as lore
0:58:05 she's a walking tinfoil hat when I don't
0:58:08 have to look for any of this wind
0:58:10 squares up more to Johnny she is Brita
0:58:13 yeah doesn't change anything what I said
0:58:16 does it maybe if you'd actually lost
0:58:18 your daughter you'd be a little willing
0:58:20 to put Faith out there that's frenzy
0:58:22 check yep because of how hard Tim worked
0:58:24 on all of this uh I'll give everyone a
0:58:26 Plus on die bonus to self-control checks
0:58:28 I will spend a point of willpower thanks
0:58:31 buddy
0:58:32 difficulty eight yes sir Mr bruh that is
0:58:36 two successes all right it almost hurts
0:58:38 how hard your Beast rails against its
0:58:41 cage and win finishes her sentence like
0:58:43 I did
0:58:45 you can see Johnny his eyes are closed
0:58:48 and you could see him fighting down the
0:58:51 urge to let loose and just start causing
0:58:54 violence do you want to have a
0:58:56 conversation with me or do you want to
0:58:58 continue sticking your [ __ ] finger in
0:59:00 my raw nerves what are you up for I'm
0:59:03 not the one poking the beast when I'm
0:59:06 trying to have a conversation you're the
0:59:08 one getting in my face and talking about
0:59:11 my daughter when kind of glares she
0:59:15 knows she pushed hard she knows that if
0:59:17 he had done the same she probably would
0:59:19 have also fought back
0:59:21 the Beast would have done what it's done
0:59:23 so many times before
0:59:24 have your conversation but this is Brita
0:59:28 and I think she deserves the benefit of
0:59:30 the doubt she does that's why I'm having
0:59:32 this conversation I care about all of
0:59:35 you it's why I haven't walked out on you
0:59:37 I got to see my daughter last night and
0:59:40 by all means I wish I just left with her
0:59:43 it would have been a hell of a lot
0:59:45 better than having to face down that
0:59:46 [ __ ] flesh Dragon but you all are too
0:59:49 important to me
0:59:50 which is why I'm hurt and I'm confused
0:59:53 about why and how Britta landed our lap
0:59:57 in the first place I think that's a fair
0:59:59 question I think there's plenty of
1:00:01 people that know that I'm easily hurt by
1:00:03 a lost girl needing somebody to help her
1:00:06 out that could have been used against us
1:00:07 against me
1:00:09 it's a very soft tap as a drop of blood
1:00:13 Falls from breto's eyes she's trying to
1:00:16 hide it she's keeping her head tilted
1:00:18 down she very well could have been used
1:00:20 against us would I get the feeling that
1:00:22 her memory loss was never part of the
1:00:25 plan and if she was used against us
1:00:27 that's not her choice try to ask them
1:00:31 about it and they they acted like it was
1:00:35 strange like they hadn't like they
1:00:37 hadn't taken my memory
1:00:39 I wish Johnny's right things have gotten
1:00:43 worse since I've been here and I'm more
1:00:46 trouble than it's worth I don't think I
1:00:49 ever said that Brita things have changed
1:00:52 since you've been here and that may or
1:00:54 may not have happened if you were or
1:00:56 weren't here and I for one don't want
1:00:59 you going anywhere I mean did you make
1:01:02 any of those weird things we've had to
1:01:03 deal with happen yourself
1:01:07 no
1:01:08 then you haven't made things worse or
1:01:10 harder or anything else and in some
1:01:13 cases you may have made things better
1:01:14 Johnny has questions and while Johnny is
1:01:17 Gruff they are fair questions and they
1:01:20 help us come together
1:01:22 I really only have one question
1:01:25 I want you to look me in the eye when I
1:01:28 ask it and he waits for you to lock gaze
1:01:31 with him when Bretta looks up she's
1:01:33 trembling and it's far more apparent
1:01:37 that she's been crying but she does try
1:01:39 to lock her eyes with Johnny there's not
1:01:42 the same will fueling it as he's used to
1:01:46 other times that he's had her look him
1:01:48 in the eye too
1:01:50 still up for a conflict it's like that
1:01:53 part of her has been shaken she's trying
1:01:55 she's looking at him when she first
1:01:58 meets his gaze it is unrelenting
1:02:03 and terrifying
1:02:06 well actually I shouldn't say
1:02:07 unrelenting
1:02:09 because at first he stares at other
1:02:12 intensity
1:02:13 but seeing the Damage Done by the
1:02:18 psychic assault his eyes kind of soften
1:02:20 a bit and his expression changes from
1:02:22 this one of boring intent like drilling
1:02:26 intensity into someone looking at a long
1:02:30 lost family member that they miss
1:02:34 I want to know
1:02:36 whose side are you on
1:02:41 I want to be with you guys if you want
1:02:43 me here
1:02:46 I don't know how to keep doing it I
1:02:49 don't know how to keep going with
1:02:51 everything getting
1:02:53 worse all the time it was already too
1:02:57 much to handle and it just keeps getting
1:03:00 worse but I don't I don't know how to
1:03:04 keep doing it but I want to keep doing
1:03:05 it with you guys
1:03:07 your answer is you're on the side of
1:03:09 this codery yes he stares at her first a
1:03:13 few moments
1:03:14 few moments more comfortably than I
1:03:17 think anybody would like
1:03:20 and the rest is water under the bridge
1:03:22 for me
1:03:23 if you're part of this codery and that's
1:03:26 that
1:03:27 okay Alberta swallows hard she doesn't
1:03:30 really seem to believe him on the first
1:03:33 nod and a hot tear falls down she tries
1:03:37 to nod to make it sink in again when she
1:03:39 nods he walks over to her and picks her
1:03:43 up in a big bear hug and squeezes her
1:03:45 very tightly
1:03:46 she curls in to the hug just
1:03:50 tries to disappear into him basically
1:03:52 you're on a nasty little Odyssey there
1:03:55 kiddo but I'm glad to have you back I'm
1:03:58 really glad to be back I was really
1:04:01 scared you did good
1:04:03 and I need I I need to fix a lot of my
1:04:06 mistakes so that we can keep going
1:04:10 do we are talking about fixing mistakes
1:04:12 that's not what we do we double down on
1:04:15 them Johnny cracks a wry little smile
1:04:17 looks back at wind at that wind kind of
1:04:20 gives him a smirk well nods because that
1:04:22 is what we do
1:04:23 Brita
1:04:25 what please don't talk about leaving us
1:04:29 anymore
1:04:30 if we didn't want you here you wouldn't
1:04:32 be here
1:04:33 we always want you here
1:04:35 again the yeah is muffled almost in the
1:04:38 same way that it had been earlier in the
1:04:40 night for a miles behind the hiding
1:04:43 place of the closet and all the various
1:04:45 pillows and everything but this time
1:04:47 it's muffled into Johnny
1:04:49 one more question Johnny puts her down
1:04:52 so that she can look at when yeah and
1:04:55 when kind of like directs her to look at
1:04:57 a mirror did I do okay or do you need
1:04:59 gel in the hair it looks it looks pretty
1:05:03 well it's on you so of course it does
1:05:06 and she kind of like hugs her around the
1:05:08 shoulders Bretta hugs her back all right
1:05:11 well that's a lot of we really dumped
1:05:13 out some purses there guys nice job yeah
1:05:19 you've said that you had a phone number
1:05:22 for Prince Pendragon I can get in
1:05:24 contact with him I don't know how to
1:05:26 apologize for trying to hit him with a
1:05:28 coffee maker but hit him with a bigger
1:05:30 one
1:05:33 let Johnny hit him with one try a
1:05:35 Haymaker next time
1:05:37 there is
1:05:38 something
1:05:40 I forgot to mention this whole thing
1:05:42 with Amber Gino Giovanni Brita actually
1:05:45 bristles when you say I'm Regina
1:05:48 Giovanni like she's back in
1:05:51 a bit of a combat mode there's a thing
1:05:55 he wants me to work on
1:05:56 I don't know who it involves he
1:05:58 mentioned the premiere I'm guessing
1:06:00 that's part of why Iris here
1:06:02 has something to do with
1:06:05 with restoring Humanity to vampires to
1:06:10 wraiths when we when we went to see him
1:06:13 the original and he tried to bargain to
1:06:16 you to trade me over to him never not
1:06:20 ever no he did I know I know he did just
1:06:23 saying she would never I'm saying I
1:06:24 would never okay you're not a thing to
1:06:26 be bargained with and I think I told him
1:06:28 that I understand but the tramir had a
1:06:32 deal with him to hand over girls with
1:06:36 crescent moons on their hands Eden that
1:06:40 means that he was trying to make deals
1:06:42 like that
1:06:44 and I don't think that I don't think he
1:06:47 gave up like he seemed to so easily in
1:06:50 that conversation with you when he asks
1:06:52 you to trade me I think
1:06:54 he's gonna still be looking for Eden I
1:06:56 think he's gonna still be looking for me
1:06:58 just to make trades with people who
1:06:59 aren't ill for what it is within my
1:07:02 power to do
1:07:03 he's not going to get you he will have
1:07:06 to dominate me he will have to steal my
1:07:08 soul he will have to do unspeakably
1:07:11 horrible things and if I try to do
1:07:13 something like that you have to kill me
1:07:15 I got more of it fast I have that effect
1:07:17 on people
1:07:18 either morbid or horny and it's quite a
1:07:20 spectrum I'm a protege I think the
1:07:23 halfway between is the word is turgid
1:07:25 feels unbrandt it's good to know that
1:07:29 he's up to something odd in and around
1:07:31 the domain again oh he was never not
1:07:34 going to be yeah Britta did anyone else
1:07:37 in the tell mahera have a mark on your
1:07:39 hand like that Bretta
1:07:41 searches her memory kind of you get the
1:07:45 sensation of
1:07:46 trying to pull those threads until
1:07:50 something unravels
1:07:51 and
1:07:53 something crystallizes and she says
1:07:56 I think it's supposed to work that the
1:08:00 moons only show up in the shadowlands
1:08:04 and then when we're here they're not
1:08:07 supposed to show up but mine ever since
1:08:10 we went to go see amberjino Giovanni
1:08:14 it's been there okay
1:08:17 oh um speaking of his deal with the
1:08:20 Chimera there was
1:08:21 a few other things I don't know if I
1:08:24 managed to cover them when we were in
1:08:25 the Chantry about the premiere they had
1:08:27 a list of people that they were going to
1:08:31 keep imprisoned this year's yeah his
1:08:34 name was on the list yeah you did
1:08:35 mention that yeah and they had some plan
1:08:38 involving vicissitude to survive gehenna
1:08:42 Rhys said trying to convince me to let
1:08:44 let veto live yeah we had that similar
1:08:47 discussion with them since there were
1:08:49 other parts that we could get a hold of
1:08:50 he decided that veto could die yeah or
1:08:53 you know he was debating us and hoping
1:08:56 we were dying I'm not sure okay it
1:08:58 wasn't going to be his choice either way
1:09:00 there are there are things in the world
1:09:03 that that Harbor disease because they're
1:09:06 just how their immune systems works like
1:09:08 bats that's why bats are always getting
1:09:10 tested for rabies because they can carry
1:09:12 it without becoming infected by it and
1:09:14 I'm guessing that using something like
1:09:16 this institute as like a carrier for
1:09:19 mortality or something like that he
1:09:23 still had the little um
1:09:25 not not a gargoyle I don't I don't know
1:09:28 the word the the like some kind of
1:09:31 creation yeah
1:09:33 um it was it looked infected yeah I have
1:09:36 no idea what exactly they were doing
1:09:37 this is strictly swag I'm sorry what
1:09:40 sophisticated wild ass guess right we
1:09:44 will need either needle slash maybe Ira
1:09:47 if he's willing to talk about your
1:09:49 mirror things to really put any of that
1:09:51 together Neil seemed to think that
1:09:54 I thought I had put Neil in danger by by
1:09:58 endangering everything with Prince
1:10:01 pendra Again by being activated but he
1:10:05 sooner thinks that he had put me in
1:10:06 danger somehow by coming for you yeah
1:10:09 you'd specifically told us not to
1:10:12 um that didn't seem like it was the case
1:10:14 I mean oh Prince Pendragon was pretty
1:10:17 much just ignoring him that was not the
1:10:20 impression he gave us over the phone
1:10:21 something the degree of killing you if
1:10:23 we showed up
1:10:25 yeah
1:10:26 um he's he's I think he didn't find Neil
1:10:30 to be very important I think he was
1:10:32 annoyed
1:10:34 um for sure but as so long as I kind of
1:10:37 kept Neil at I kind of kept pushing Neil
1:10:40 away and not letting him in or talking
1:10:45 to him about stuff just sticking with
1:10:48 Prince Pendragon
1:10:49 so I was hoping that would keep Neil
1:10:52 alive some of the impression he was
1:10:54 going there to discreetly look out for
1:10:57 you oh based on your story that sounds
1:10:59 like you went up and introduced himself
1:11:01 yeah Neil wasn't right after I killed
1:11:06 the Abbott all right Neil he came and
1:11:09 found me well I was getting my head back
1:11:13 together and he was he seemed a little
1:11:15 beast hungry around the eyes yeah and I
1:11:19 don't think I don't think he'd like that
1:11:21 one of us was taken because we're his he
1:11:24 gets spun up about magazines Neil was um
1:11:27 definitely trying to help but he um
1:11:31 look I I know you don't I know you don't
1:11:34 like Prince pen Dragon but I it meant a
1:11:38 lot to me that he kept his word and he
1:11:41 did protect me on several occasions and
1:11:44 he was kind of
1:11:49 um you know was really worried about me
1:11:51 and I get why he was trying to get me
1:11:52 away but it was risky Pendragon was
1:11:55 Dependable you would say of all the
1:11:58 traits Brew Ha have we're almost always
1:12:00 Dependable he was at least honest it
1:12:04 seemed honesty and dependability does
1:12:07 not make a good person don't forget that
1:12:09 yeah it's in my mind he kidnapped a
1:12:12 fledgling Toreador away from the people
1:12:14 she trusted and manipulated her into
1:12:17 doing things under threat of hurting the
1:12:18 people she loved he's not a good person
1:12:21 a lot of our allies aren't I'm aware I
1:12:25 am under no compunction that I am a good
1:12:27 person but I've been inside a dragon at
1:12:29 this point and I am willing to look away
1:12:32 from some of the dirtier parts of people
1:12:34 if they're going to help us kill the
1:12:35 thing that it's a part of part of the
1:12:37 reason we don't like pen Dragon much is
1:12:38 because he you know kidnapped you yeah
1:12:40 don't be too hard on yourself win you're
1:12:42 better than most of them of the Dragons
1:12:45 uh vampires I mean of all the dragons
1:12:48 I've met yes
1:12:49 if it helps I'm
1:12:53 just hoping that we can still work
1:12:56 things out I don't think we'll have a
1:12:57 lot of choice in that but it does sound
1:12:59 like operation Longboat took a pretty
1:13:02 big hit no
1:13:04 um I'm sorry but it seemed like our the
1:13:07 clans in connection to us more so there
1:13:10 were a lot of Toyota there with Elsa
1:13:12 Linden and I tried well we we tried to
1:13:15 warn the ones that were in the room
1:13:16 trying to help her but you know there
1:13:19 were there were a lot of toriot over
1:13:21 there
1:13:22 and most of the other Elders as I said
1:13:27 that party most people died
1:13:30 yes which includes a good amount of
1:13:33 their people
1:13:34 not if
1:13:36 not if most of the people that survived
1:13:39 were
1:13:40 mulcavians and
1:13:43 Nosferatu and
1:13:45 Pendragon tried to protect the bruja
1:13:47 there oh did you see all these people
1:13:49 get away because it sounded like a lot
1:13:52 of people died
1:13:54 um you don't really see nosfera too
1:13:57 trying to get away
1:13:58 but there were passageways that were
1:14:00 sealed off and locked very expensive and
1:14:05 well-made locks
1:14:07 into strange places tunnels that kind of
1:14:10 thing and a lot of the Nosferatu were
1:14:12 working security details anyway so out
1:14:15 in the woods her able to keep to the
1:14:17 fringes the malkavians I'm not so sure
1:14:19 about I Neil did something strange and
1:14:22 then Sir William Biltmore was laughing
1:14:27 um like he'd gotten
1:14:29 the message through but if you're
1:14:32 attacking a no nasaratu party you come
1:14:35 prepared for Nosferatu I think they just
1:14:37 wanted to wipe out the camarilla they're
1:14:39 like a tidal wave to send a message that
1:14:42 they were coming A lot of it was done
1:14:44 for fear fur effect feels familiar when
1:14:48 they make attacks like that they often
1:14:52 are
1:14:52 targeting Elders they were there they
1:14:56 were calling out for elders there were a
1:14:58 couple of them that seemed more
1:14:59 important one that was a lot of the
1:15:02 other party guests may have gotten away
1:15:04 because they were focusing on just a few
1:15:07 individuals Johnny I don't know if you'd
1:15:09 recognize the ones that seemed important
1:15:12 um there was one I I don't
1:15:15 I don't know if if they were a man or a
1:15:19 woman or I don't I don't know what to
1:15:23 call
1:15:24 um I I guess I'll go with them although
1:15:29 part of me kind of wants to go with it
1:15:31 they they must be talking about the
1:15:34 lycos like like they were wearing their
1:15:37 own skin like it was close and something
1:15:39 about them seemed like they were
1:15:41 reaching out with their mind very
1:15:43 powerfully and
1:15:45 Sasha vikos it's one of the oldest
1:15:48 members in the Sabbat
1:15:50 I've never seen it but I've heard of its
1:15:53 Legend it was throwing Fireball scent
1:15:57 seemed like it was sharing command with
1:16:00 it is a powerful zamizi sorcerer as I've
1:16:04 heard
1:16:05 it was once born a man
1:16:09 but when the Sabbat became the sect it
1:16:12 is it discarded its manhood so that it
1:16:15 could Ascend into something greater
1:16:18 things like Mortal gender are nearly
1:16:22 things it wears as it suits it it is old
1:16:27 and terrifying I can't tell if I'm
1:16:31 jealous or sorry for you that you had to
1:16:34 experience that it was sharing command
1:16:37 with someone
1:16:38 um well The Killing Spree seemed like
1:16:40 they had positions of importance was
1:16:43 sharing command yes I can only think of
1:16:45 a few people that could have been
1:16:48 um did they have a sunburn
1:16:50 yes I uh white tuxedo handsome maybe
1:16:55 it's maybe don't care who's the Cardinal
1:16:58 of New York his name is Polonia
1:17:01 he is something of
1:17:04 a celebrity
1:17:06 warlord and
1:17:09 high priest amongst the LA Sombra they
1:17:13 venerate him they love him and they are
1:17:17 terrified of him all at once he is from
1:17:20 the old line stretching back to Europe
1:17:24 Legend has it he came to the old world
1:17:26 or he came to the new world and his pale
1:17:30 skin didn't like the sun and when he was
1:17:32 embraced it stuck with him and anybody
1:17:36 who speaks as flippantly as I am about
1:17:38 him in his presence meets final death
1:17:44 pretty you saw one hell of a crusade
1:17:48 yeah and um talcotto was doing a lot of
1:17:52 damage he had taken this form
1:17:55 um almost unrecognizable but I could
1:17:58 still see his hair we saw that yeah is
1:18:02 that what Vito made me into
1:18:04 um
1:18:06 not quite
1:18:08 all right gang flat on our plate here
1:18:10 guess the other thing we should talk
1:18:11 about is Eden
1:18:13 I thought that maybe she'd be safer with
1:18:16 The Mortals because it seems like
1:18:18 vampires are trying to hunt her down and
1:18:22 if she's seen with us those that know
1:18:25 what a dampier is are gonna want her dad
1:18:28 and US dead too there's a good notion
1:18:30 but we cannot dump that responsibility
1:18:34 into the lap of my daughter and her
1:18:36 friends yeah unless they are in a much
1:18:40 better position than they currently are
1:18:42 which means I I need to find her and the
1:18:45 hunters and make sure they're okay
1:18:48 and that's before we have any
1:18:49 conversations about letting Eden go with
1:18:52 them that makes sense if Mr Giovanni is
1:18:56 looking to collect little girls with
1:18:58 marks like hers I shouldn't know where
1:19:01 she is that's fair because I will not
1:19:03 voluntarily give that information away
1:19:05 but I have no idea what he's capable of
1:19:08 I think he I don't know it's just a
1:19:11 feeling that I have that he didn't want
1:19:13 to get caught looking by you it's
1:19:17 possible I'm not entirely the problem is
1:19:19 wherever she goes I think we need her
1:19:23 because of her ability to undo the
1:19:26 vicissitude yeah like I said I sent
1:19:29 final goodbyes guys I wasn't I wasn't
1:19:31 walking out of that Gentry
1:19:33 she undid the vicissitude done to you do
1:19:38 you think she could undo the Damage Done
1:19:40 to your psyche I don't know she was
1:19:42 pretty unsure of her own powers when we
1:19:45 talked to her before and I think if she
1:19:46 can do that maybe we should see if she
1:19:48 can do it for herself first do you
1:19:50 remember the thing that Ira cited to us
1:19:52 seemed like something he'd memorized
1:19:55 about the last daughter of Eve Saving
1:19:57 All Mankind and we'd know her by Mark's
1:20:00 honor right did you catch the part about
1:20:02 the pain and suffering essentially that
1:20:05 has caused to her by Our Kind sure it
1:20:08 was there that part concerns me more as
1:20:12 much as the rest of it why would she
1:20:14 Save Our Kind if that's what happens to
1:20:16 her it makes me feel like we need to do
1:20:18 more I don't think that stopping this
1:20:23 institute is about saving Kindred kind I
1:20:25 think it's about protecting the world I
1:20:27 can't remember it's not really my no I'm
1:20:29 just four times
1:20:31 so the thing I pulled a ticket to get
1:20:34 back to was that outside of that safe
1:20:36 room the spiritual landscape was gone
1:20:40 not like used not like wiped clean gone
1:20:45 you had said that you could see that The
1:20:48 Shard of the eldest was alive in the
1:20:51 shadowlands infecting it it changed the
1:20:54 shadowlands it changed outside but that
1:20:58 close in it it ripped it away it there
1:21:02 is a void there is that something that
1:21:05 can be healed I don't know if it's
1:21:07 something that can be healed but I want
1:21:09 to believe that something that can be
1:21:10 prevented before it happens in the skin
1:21:13 lands where we are just in case it
1:21:16 wasn't self-referential enough I got it
1:21:19 I'm unsure I I don't know what she can
1:21:21 do I know what she did do
1:21:24 we may have to hide her here and on top
1:21:27 of that we may need to train her I'm
1:21:31 sorry what make her stronger I thought
1:21:35 you said drain her oh no
1:21:37 sorry train train her train her much
1:21:40 like we did with Bruno that's a whole
1:21:42 different proposition yeah a lot more
1:21:44 agreeable I really hope you guys would
1:21:46 not just think that I would drain a
1:21:48 small girl it's been a very long night
1:21:50 everyone's senses are a little in
1:21:52 overdriving in weird places man okay no
1:21:55 I I think you're right about having to
1:21:57 train her I'm racking my brain for our
1:21:59 list of allies who might be able to help
1:22:01 and unfortunately it's very [ __ ] thin
1:22:03 we have to keep this very close to our
1:22:06 chest what about the anarchs no through
1:22:09 weathers no I trust the old man but this
1:22:12 is not a burden that I can give to him
1:22:13 and they've got and snakes up the water
1:22:16 and this is no slight against weathers
1:22:18 that guy doesn't take chances and
1:22:21 keeping her alive is a big [ __ ]
1:22:22 chance I mentioned the anarchs because
1:22:25 they take kadiff they take the thin
1:22:28 Bloods that the cam and the Sabbat just
1:22:31 either uses cannon fodder or worse it's
1:22:34 a good thought but I don't necessarily
1:22:35 know if it's gonna be she needs to be
1:22:38 somewhere where people can keep her safe
1:22:40 and right now the anarchs are dealing
1:22:42 with the setites then let's deal with
1:22:44 the setites I mean I'm not opposed but
1:22:47 they seem to be a bit stronger than just
1:22:49 strolling down to their local snake
1:22:51 temple and kicking them out and
1:22:53 they're probably gonna get stronger
1:22:55 because um the tremair got a lot weaker
1:22:59 they'll fill the vacuum they've they've
1:23:01 been waiting too or the assemites will
1:23:04 yeah currently the sedites aren't very
1:23:06 welcome in New Haven and he settles it I
1:23:09 think Eden's gonna stay with us and
1:23:11 she's going to be our problem she's not
1:23:13 a problem no you're right bad phrasing
1:23:17 responsibility charge feels like the
1:23:19 same thing I feel like we're all kind of
1:23:22 problems actually I mean I make it a
1:23:25 point to be one pretty much I have a
1:23:27 resolution thank you very much
1:23:29 the only problem is twofold race is
1:23:33 somewhere and he knows that we have her
1:23:36 yeah is Theresa problem when hasn't he
1:23:39 been well I'm during the fight I um I
1:23:42 felt him help he uh there was like a
1:23:46 sensation like he was asking me to pick
1:23:48 someone and I didn't know what he wanted
1:23:50 and if I could trust him so I picked
1:23:52 myself in case he was gonna put Magic on
1:23:55 someone that would hurt someone and it
1:23:58 made me I felt like I could Dodge
1:24:00 anything and I was ready to keep on
1:24:04 Distributing I guess spells from him he
1:24:07 stopped I don't I don't know why but he
1:24:10 did help during the fight well he was
1:24:12 keeping the girl prisoner in his Chantry
1:24:16 for that reason alone I think he
1:24:19 shouldn't have any more contact with him
1:24:21 but I I don't think he's got designs on
1:24:23 her beyond that does he I don't know I
1:24:26 don't think he'd keep her if he didn't
1:24:27 that's a fair point he's going to think
1:24:29 that she would be important for what I
1:24:31 was talking about the premiere plan to
1:24:34 evade to evade gehenna a way out so that
1:24:38 Kindred wouldn't have to like the way
1:24:40 that he was talking about her when I
1:24:42 first saw him
1:24:44 it seemed like he felt that she was a
1:24:46 part of the answer to I'm sorry I don't
1:24:50 fully understand but some sort of key to
1:24:52 his plan yeah or their plan yeah I'm
1:24:55 getting that sense from a lot of
1:24:57 different corners
1:24:58 we need to talk to Ira he made a face in
1:25:01 there like
1:25:02 like he was scared like you weren't
1:25:05 making a face like you were scared I
1:25:07 obviously was scared Johnny but this was
1:25:09 different this was there's the oh [ __ ]
1:25:11 oh [ __ ] I'm staring at a dragon and
1:25:14 there's oh I am in so much [ __ ]
1:25:17 trouble for what I just did
1:25:19 we can talk to him when he gets back and
1:25:22 yeah you guys um before that was a
1:25:25 dragon when I was going around the
1:25:28 Chantry trying to
1:25:31 trying to find Vito to kill him
1:25:34 I did originally find him and he had
1:25:39 taken over Perron and he paren through
1:25:43 him had caught me and he was gonna do a
1:25:46 lot of bad things and I just with the
1:25:50 way that everything shook out and
1:25:53 um that psychic attack and I could feel
1:25:56 too much through it the intentions and
1:25:59 just wanted to say thank you
1:26:03 for
1:26:04 killing the dragon you help
1:26:07 you helped do you guys
1:26:10 trusts IRA
1:26:12 aside from us and Neil I'm not sure I'd
1:26:14 really trust anyone at this point
1:26:16 but as far as tremeer go I don't think
1:26:20 he's the worst I'll just say the same
1:26:22 exact thing he's not
1:26:25 he's not here under some sort of
1:26:26 pretense
1:26:28 I got a decent rate of them I don't know
1:26:31 if that is going to leave in my cross
1:26:32 processes to Reiss or not
1:26:35 I think he's very committed to the
1:26:37 premiere I don't know that any tremeir
1:26:39 has any other option than to be
1:26:40 committed to the premiere I have no idea
1:26:42 what kind of initiation rituals they
1:26:44 have just a conga line of dick sucking
1:26:47 and it is at that as if summoned by
