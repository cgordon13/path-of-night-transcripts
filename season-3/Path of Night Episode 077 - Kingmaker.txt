0:01:28 left
0:01:32 prer you find yourself alone among the
0:01:35 Mortal
0:01:37 masses this um party this Rave has raged
0:01:43 on for the better part of the
0:01:45 night and things
0:01:47 are showing signs of winding down
0:01:51 weathers is nowhere to be
0:01:53 seen some of the better known bruha of
0:01:57 the area have one at a time made their
0:02:00 way out in different directions for the
0:02:03 evening you find yourself listening to
0:02:07 the
0:02:08 music but distracted by thoughts of the
0:02:12 night what do you
0:02:15 do coming from emergency to emergency
0:02:19 brda is fully aware that even just being
0:02:23 a little hungry could be a problem later
0:02:26 and as she looks around she counts faces
0:02:30 faces that she recognizes of the sabat
0:02:33 faces that she recognizes of anyone who
0:02:37 could be a threat and as she kind of
0:02:40 does the math she decides to focus her
0:02:43 anxiety from everything that happened
0:02:47 outside into a very simple objective to
0:02:51 feed so enjoy the music letting the beat
0:02:56 become the marker for her steps trying
0:03:00 to let herself fall into this party In
0:03:02 This Moment of solitude and just
0:03:07 exists she watches the ways that The
0:03:11 Mortals move checking carefully for
0:03:15 who's already sluggish for who seems
0:03:18 inebriated she remembers that the Coterie
0:03:21 had told her about that before
0:03:24 and find some familiar rhythm in the act
0:03:29 of find ing someone to brush her
0:03:31 fingertips along their shoulders get
0:03:34 their attention make eyes at them pull
0:03:37 them off into an
0:03:38 enclave well into the night it doesn't
0:03:41 take long before you find someone who is
0:03:45 inebriated and in their own way looking
0:03:47 for something much the same who's young
0:03:51 maybe a little older than you dressed in
0:03:55 current fanss with baggy jeans and boots
0:03:59 it where's this neck chain that hangs a
0:04:02 little too
0:04:03 low football jersey for his top he's um
0:04:08 he's dressed for this kind of party she
0:04:11 is hoping for someone sober it is
0:04:14 unlikely you will find someone who is
0:04:16 both mortal and sober understandable in
0:04:19 that case she'd still rather have the
0:04:22 blood
0:04:23 and in her expression she hides any of
0:04:28 the hesitation she he feels to kind of
0:04:32 touch him to turn that motion of running
0:04:35 fingertips over him into testing the
0:04:38 fabric of his jersey as if wanting to
0:04:40 know how soft it is but really trying to
0:04:42 just pull him closer all of the little
0:04:45 machinations that cause her to be
0:04:48 bringing him over
0:04:50 somewhere somewhere quiet somewhere out
0:04:53 of view so that she could kiss him and
0:04:57 give him the kiss he runs his finger
0:04:59 fers through his blond bull cut kind of
0:05:02 trying to come across as smooth as
0:05:04 possible you can tell by the way his
0:05:06 breath hitches and though his heart
0:05:08 races that he's
0:05:11 nervous at the first indication that you
0:05:13 want him to come with you he
0:05:16 obeys BR finds herself automatically
0:05:19 taking on a role of comfort towards him
0:05:24 trying to make him feel desirable trying
0:05:26 to make him feel good about what she's
0:05:30 about to do she reaches out to trace her
0:05:33 thumbs along the sides of his face to
0:05:36 kiss him on his lips before kissing down
0:05:38 to his neck but like always she needs to
0:05:42 sink her fangs in he's
0:05:46 responsive you can kind of feel the
0:05:49 shiver that goes through him
0:05:52 and once you and Ste the
0:05:56 kiss he offers this very
0:06:00 subservient
0:06:02 groan how much are you taking from him
0:06:05 BR is taking two PS of blood that's you
0:06:09 he's a little dazed and his eyes close
0:06:12 and he falls asleep BR glances around
0:06:16 quickly looking for you know a quiet
0:06:20 place to seat him safely maybe a backro
0:06:24 bench somebody's snack to put next to
0:06:27 him so that he can have some sugar when
0:06:30 he wakes up you have uh a private space
0:06:34 that the Coterie has access to and has
0:06:35 been using once into the VIP area
0:06:39 there's a bench Sy bowls of what have
0:06:42 you in terms of quick snacks and
0:06:45 drinks and you lie him there it becomes
0:06:50 quickly apparent to you though that in
0:06:53 this dark room that overlooks the throng
0:06:57 below You Are Not Alone
0:07:01 in those final motions of making sure
0:07:04 her prey is safe and comfortable baa
0:07:08 finds herself looking up and trying to
0:07:10 meet eyes with the
0:07:13 presence he is very
0:07:16 much how you remember him looking up on
0:07:19 the
0:07:20 rooftop Roman is clad in the same
0:07:24 clothes he wears the same
0:07:27 gorget he has the same anger in his
0:07:31 eyes but at least for the
0:07:34 moment he is
0:07:36 seated still and
0:07:39 relaxed and in his body
0:07:42 language there is no indication of the
0:07:45 same rage that he had in the presence of
0:07:47 his
0:07:49 sire upon confirmation Brea
0:07:53 is somewhat self-conscious she moves
0:07:57 slowly away from
0:07:59 the man that she sat down and her task
0:08:03 and there's a moment of hesitation she
0:08:05 looks down to the exit of the VIP but
0:08:10 her feet don't carry her there and she
0:08:12 finds
0:08:13 herself drawn to look back up an
0:08:17 evaluation of Pendragon of how he's
0:08:20 sitting especially of that trace of pure
0:08:27 rage she takes a moment to ensure that
0:08:30 her lipstick hasn't moved out of the
0:08:32 lines straightens her clothing
0:08:36 and unsure of her
0:08:38 steps
0:08:40 unsteady but on purpose she does choose
0:08:43 to walk over to Roman pen
0:08:46 dragon
0:08:48 and testing she slowly sits down next to
0:08:52 him when you approach
0:08:54 him you
0:08:57 are watched by
0:09:00 him he doesn't speak he doesn't frown he
0:09:04 doesn't indicate that he doesn't want
0:09:06 you near him but he isn't entirely
0:09:09 welcoming
0:09:11 either he just watches with those like
0:09:14 pale blue eyes that he has sitting in a
0:09:18 dark room with probably the poorest
0:09:21 Illumination in the entire
0:09:24 Club
0:09:27 watching now watching
0:09:30 you draw near or up until that moment he
0:09:34 was preoccupied
0:09:36 with people watching what does his chair
0:09:40 face what section of the club his seat
0:09:44 had like he seed in like this love seat
0:09:48 that overlooks the dance
0:09:51 floor when BR sits there's that moment
0:09:54 of
0:09:55 self-arrangement of sitting very prop l
0:09:59 in her assigned portion of a love seat
0:10:03 making sure that she doesn't
0:10:05 accidentally touch him or she's keeping
0:10:10 her hands in her lap and she looks down
0:10:14 at her gloves feeling the texture of
0:10:17 them in a moment
0:10:21 of
0:10:23 comfort definitely em motion that she
0:10:26 uses to Center herself running
0:10:29 fingertips over the edge of the glove
0:10:31 feeling the texture for
0:10:33 herself and she crosses her legs she
0:10:38 Rings her hands but she looks out to the
0:10:41 club sharing his perspective for a
0:10:44 moment
0:10:45 before looking back to him she tries to
0:10:50 speak and whatever sentence she might
0:10:53 have said she abandons in favor of well
0:10:57 what she actually says which ends up
0:11:01 being hey
0:11:05 um are are
0:11:08 you
0:11:11 okay he regards her indicating that he
0:11:13 heard
0:11:16 her am I
0:11:23 okay why are you asking me
0:11:25 this BR looks down and then to the side
0:11:29 um immediately more self-conscious even
0:11:32 than she was at the start but the words
0:11:35 sick in her throat and she doesn't quite
0:11:39 muster up the kind of decision to bail
0:11:43 again so she tries to orient what she
0:11:45 was meaning to say and pressing her
0:11:48 hands more into her thighs flat just to
0:11:53 stop fidgeting and say what she means to
0:11:56 say she expresses
0:11:59 you had to see your sire again
0:12:04 and for what little you've
0:12:07 mentioned
0:12:10 that that would be
0:12:14 really I don't I didn't know if you
0:12:17 would even believe me um when I sent
0:12:20 sent the message I didn't know if you
0:12:23 would respond but I didn't want you to
0:12:26 be the last to know that she was back
0:12:30 that didn't
0:12:31 feel
0:12:33 fair you deserved more than that and I
0:12:36 seeing her must
0:12:38 be
0:12:42 hard is that why you were here to speak
0:12:46 to me of my
0:12:47 sire and her apparent
0:12:53 Resurrection no I am then why are you
0:12:56 here what is it that you won't
0:13:01 you'll have to forgive me but you've
0:13:03 been rather unclear on the
0:13:07 subject I think I have cause to
0:13:11 be I think
0:13:15 that you yourself were the one to tell
0:13:17 me that I was in danger around
0:13:20 you and that is all BR finds herself
0:13:24 swallowing even though there's nothing
0:13:27 in the Mortal way of nervous that would
0:13:29 provoke that physical reaction and she
0:13:33 puts pressure into her thighs trying to
0:13:37 push the stress down through her legs
0:13:40 through her toes into the
0:13:42 floor
0:13:44 and she summons up the
0:13:47 question what you ask for on the
0:13:51 rooftop
0:13:53 why why would you choose that out of
0:13:57 everything choose
0:13:59 what the oery the
0:14:03 amaranth
0:14:05 yes it is a simple
0:14:09 arithmetic when the prince calls the
0:14:11 blood hunt they want the entire city to
0:14:15 participate regardless of how dangerous
0:14:17 the subject of their blood Hunt
0:14:20 is and what do they
0:14:23 offer it's clear in br's expression the
0:14:26 way that she regards him as te her in
0:14:29 this moment that way that she kind of
0:14:32 tilts her head and finds herself a
0:14:35 little more facing inwards towards him
0:14:38 that she does not know the answer to
0:14:40 that question the one who successfully
0:14:43 brings down the subject of a blood
0:14:46 Hunt is typically rewarded with the
0:14:48 heart's
0:14:50 blood they do exactly what they would be
0:14:52 doing in New
0:14:54 York you
0:14:56 see the fear
0:14:59 the worry for what I indicated should be
0:15:02 done it isn't because it is some alien
0:15:07 Madness it is an unsightly truth about
0:15:10 the nature of the
0:15:12 camaria the Camara does not exist to
0:15:15 protect
0:15:17 others the Kindred of the
0:15:21 camria frequently only stand to lose
0:15:24 when they do
0:15:26 so it thrives
0:15:31 because it is a place for the
0:15:35 ambitious to seek and claim what they
0:15:40 want I didn't offer something
0:15:43 new I simply introduced a new way of
0:15:46 offering
0:15:47 it R takes a pause for herself running
0:15:51 that through in her mind trying to make
0:15:53 it align with everything that she's
0:15:57 learned by the look on her face it
0:16:00 matches what she's learned with the
0:16:03 Camaro her brow froze and her eyes are
0:16:08 softer more confused like there's even
0:16:11 more variance being added into this
0:16:13 already complicated question she tries
0:16:16 to find direction in asking
0:16:20 him but what would it I I
0:16:24 mean diablerie changes people
0:16:29 how do people handle that in those
0:16:35 circumstances where it's like where it's
0:16:37 like a reward for a blood hunt
0:16:40 or something that has already been used
0:16:44 I what would it mean on that
0:16:46 scale in the
0:16:48 end it would mean
0:16:51 nothing the camaria would return to the
0:16:54 exact same state it was in
0:16:57 before consider this have you ever
0:17:01 indicated to your Coterie that they
0:17:04 might wish to align themselves with
0:17:06 me that makes BR look back down again
0:17:10 her hands in her lap and away from him
0:17:15 she hangs her head a bit as she
0:17:19 admits
0:17:21 yes when you suggested
0:17:24 it were you aware of my
0:17:27 evils
0:17:30 it feels like more and more the more I'm
0:17:34 here
0:17:36 um there's always some level of evil
0:17:42 that's that I'm supposed to accept that
0:17:45 I've already been a part of I'm I I woke
0:17:49 up and
0:17:52 there the first memory I have is of
0:17:55 killing someone and and that's when the
0:17:59 camria pulled me
0:18:02 in and surviving has been more
0:18:06 about no one no one apart from my Cod
0:18:10 cared that I that I had killed someone
0:18:13 more that that I existed and whether or
0:18:18 not I could make a space for myself and
0:18:21 I keep finding it difficult to fi figure
0:18:25 out it's like in order to keep surviving
0:18:28 in order to keep being able to do
0:18:30 anything good in order to make any kind
0:18:32 of difference there's always some amount
0:18:34 of evil that needs to be done so
0:18:39 yes yes there is R looks more ashamed
0:18:46 but a little more relaxed in her
0:18:48 posture it
0:18:51 is the
0:18:53 price of
0:18:55 success the cost of victory
0:19:00 earlier
0:19:01 you you had called me a soldier and I
0:19:05 had flinched
0:19:08 and I think it's because I I see what
0:19:12 you
0:19:12 mean and I and it doesn't feel like you
0:19:17 have to be scared of it in the way that
0:19:18 I feel scared of it the watching people
0:19:22 around you and knowing yourself knowing
0:19:25 your Beast
0:19:26 knowing what you
0:19:28 capable of doing
0:19:31 and exactly what kind of soldier you
0:19:34 could
0:19:35 be something about the taste of the word
0:19:39 soldier in br's mouth draws her
0:19:41 attention back to the Gorge at on pen
0:19:45 Dragon this armored neck piece by the
0:19:48 way BR is looking at it she's trying to
0:19:51 place it um in an academic sense trying
0:19:55 to find recognition but something
0:19:58 tickling at her mind she finishes out
0:20:02 the first thought
0:20:05 saying yeah
0:20:07 I it's like I know I have to fight
0:20:11 and I don't know how and I do at the
0:20:15 same time and I
0:20:19 guess I'm jealous of your
0:20:23 shity what
0:20:25 is and with saying what is is she finds
0:20:29 herself raising her hand and instead of
0:20:32 touching specifically the gorget she
0:20:35 finds her hand stray just to the side of
0:20:37 it and unsure if he will even allow her
0:20:40 to do so she lightly rests her touch on
0:20:45 his chest his chest feels firm to the
0:20:49 touch and his
0:20:52 eyes shift toward brda as he looks at
0:20:56 her more directly
0:20:59 is it that you don't know what you
0:21:03 want or are you afraid to say
0:21:11 it I think I'm scared of wanting what I
0:21:16 want I think I've spent a lot of
0:21:20 time learning to protect
0:21:24 myself and trying to protect others
0:21:28 around me
0:21:30 and I think what I
0:21:33 want out
0:21:35 of a lot of things that I'm facing
0:21:38 is I think it scares me
0:21:42 more when we were at the
0:21:47 hotel I
0:21:49 um I know I sat on the phone and with
0:21:53 the word phone bre immediately winces
0:21:55 and just tries to power through to the
0:21:57 rest the sentence as if that word did
0:22:00 not pop
0:22:01 up that that I I didn't want to go and I
0:22:08 know that probably means nothing
0:22:11 but I um
0:22:14 I most situations that I've been in like
0:22:17 that
0:22:19 um for everything that you've done for
0:22:24 any interaction that we've had between
0:22:25 us
0:22:26 I
0:22:28 I haven't gotten
0:22:30 to feel safe like that that you wouldn't
0:22:34 cross that line
0:22:36 that um that getting in
0:22:40 the that I'd have a
0:22:43 choice and
0:22:46 um I I guess it's probably kind of
0:22:54 backwards that made me feel safe with
0:22:57 you
0:22:58 in that way and I
0:23:01 didn't want to lash out after that
0:23:04 feeling
0:23:05 I my my
0:23:08 sire came and got
0:23:11 me when I was talking to the door in the
0:23:16 beginning of the night
0:23:18 I I I I think you couldn't see it but my
0:23:22 sire was there and I've always had some
0:23:27 problem programming
0:23:29 issues things things locked into my mind
0:23:32 that that I didn't put there or or want
0:23:35 that I can't explain I um I guess
0:23:41 brainwashing from being a
0:23:44 soldier and they said an activation word
0:23:48 and I and as she's saying this she
0:23:53 almost like she's hiding her hand from
0:23:55 herself the Palm that has has the moon
0:23:58 on it she pulls closer to herself laying
0:24:02 on top of her own chest trying to almost
0:24:07 like she's trying to keep the heart a
0:24:09 secret from herself as she's speaking
0:24:11 about it but she does continue on to say
0:24:15 and when they said that word I I lost
0:24:18 control of myself and I I couldn't act I
0:24:22 it was just what was I was just what
0:24:26 they had made me to be
0:24:28 and I when I finally got more hold over
0:24:32 myself when it wasn't just the commands
0:24:35 running through me
0:24:37 I I learned more um about my sire about
0:24:42 where I come from
0:24:43 and and we ended up going to fight a
0:24:47 Shard of the eldest and and I don't um I
0:24:52 haven't felt like myself after that I
0:24:56 that experience took a part of me and I
0:24:58 am I guess that's why I came over here
0:25:01 wondering if you were okay because I
0:25:03 wasn't okay when I met my
0:25:06 sire learning more about what he had
0:25:09 done to me and what he had put me
0:25:11 through and him putting me through more
0:25:15 the damage that it did to me and fra
0:25:18 says the word and but does not continue
0:25:20 she kind of phrases up in his
0:25:24 expression there is the ghost
0:25:28 of
0:25:30 empathy you can see somewhere in him he
0:25:35 understands the discomfort the
0:25:39 humiliation the suffering associated
0:25:42 with being this Pawn that is denied the
0:25:46 power to choose their own
0:25:48 destiny in his own way he
0:25:52 understands finding that trace of
0:25:54 empathy in him BR slow un
0:25:59 phrases un tensing a little bit turning
0:26:02 a little bit more inwards towards him
0:26:05 but it
0:26:07 hardens I get the sense that you aren't
0:26:10 often asked what do you
0:26:14 want I would like to think that it was
0:26:16 this
0:26:17 inexperience that caused you
0:26:20 to be
0:26:23 unresponsive every time I've offered you
0:26:25 my
0:26:26 attention
0:26:28 but you must
0:26:29 see that in some
0:26:32 way I cannot allow that to be the
0:26:35 pattern that exists between
0:26:38 us I will not give you that power over
0:26:42 me R looks up at him and
0:26:47 says I am
0:26:49 scared I I am I was
0:26:53 you you have so much power over me
0:26:58 and
0:26:59 I I've been trying
0:27:02 to I've been trying to navigate that
0:27:05 fear
0:27:06 and the things that you
0:27:09 do you taking my armor keeping me at a
0:27:14 sword's tip you telling me that you're
0:27:18 danger
0:27:20 I miles had been asking me about
0:27:24 you and what my feelings were
0:27:28 and and I can't get my mind off of
0:27:33 you and I've tried and it hasn't really
0:27:37 worked
0:27:39 and and I think as much as I'm scared I
0:27:43 I do see good in you I I wasn't lying on
0:27:46 the rooftop
0:27:48 I I think you are
0:27:53 brave when she opens
0:27:55 up just a bit
0:27:58 he reaches out and he takes the hand
0:28:01 that is covering her
0:28:03 heart and it is uh to put it lightly a
0:28:09 firm grasp he doesn't hurt
0:28:12 her but the motion is
0:28:16 steady and too strong to
0:28:21 resist and with his other
0:28:24 hand he starts to pull off
0:28:28 the
0:28:29 glove BR tenses up and is clearly afraid
0:28:35 but she chooses to turn that inwards
0:28:39 trying to make him a center of
0:28:42 trust kind of Sheltering in against the
0:28:45 couch towards him not quite covering her
0:28:48 face not trying to pull her hand back
0:28:52 just trying to use him as a rock for the
0:28:54 stress of
0:28:56 that now do you want me
0:28:59 here or should I take my
0:29:02 leave as he says this does he have the
0:29:05 glove or is he partway through
0:29:09 he has plucked the glove off of her
0:29:13 slowly and tossed it onto the floor he
0:29:17 just discards it as if it were
0:29:21 nothing BR struggles with it battling
0:29:25 with herself battling with different
0:29:28 instincts the instinct to curl up and
0:29:31 hide the instinct to cover back
0:29:35 up
0:29:37 but she feels the closeness between
0:29:41 them the positioning of both of their
0:29:43 hands the
0:29:45 touch the sense of darkness in this
0:29:48 place the strange sense of solitude that
0:29:51 comes with knowing that you're
0:29:53 surrounded but that no one is paying
0:29:56 attention to you you that you're
0:29:58 separate
0:30:00 but
0:30:02 present and she decides to put her trust
0:30:05 and
0:30:07 him uncurling just a little bit letting
0:30:10 her hand relax in his
0:30:13 hold there's still that fear in her
0:30:17 voice but she
0:30:21 says I want you
0:30:24 here looking back up to him
0:30:28 then submit to that
0:30:32 want and he starts to pull Brea like up
0:30:38 onto his lap and he is
0:30:42 fast he is
0:30:44 aggressive and once she's like looming
0:30:48 over him he lures her down into a
0:30:52 kiss as Pendragon pulls BR into a
0:30:55 straddle BR lets her herself relax into
0:30:58 him thighs straping over him body pulled
0:31:02 close and she lets herself be pressed in
0:31:06 to him taking only the pause to discard
0:31:11 her other glove dropping it to the floor
0:31:14 along with her left and she puts her
0:31:17 hands on his shoulders to lean in and
0:31:20 tests out what kissing him is really
0:31:24 like this elder of the
0:31:27 ruha threads his fingers into br's hair
0:31:33 tugging at her as she's pulled into
0:31:36 these deep kisses BR Returns the
0:31:39 pressure kissing hard and ring into him
0:31:43 putting herself further into his lap and
0:31:45 letting him have control over her
0:31:48 kissing him back and kissing him in a
0:31:51 way that doesn't compare to how she was
0:31:52 feeding earlier she's kissed a lot of
0:31:56 people she's experienced in this but not
0:32:00 when she means it not when she actually
0:32:02 wants to know what somebody's lips taste
0:32:06 like what it feels like to put pressure
0:32:08 on the bottom lip what it feels like to
0:32:11 get their tongue in your mouth to really
0:32:13 explore she feels the sensation of
0:32:17 fangs which is a wildly New Concept for
0:32:22 someone who has largely kissed
0:32:24 Mortals and as things eat up and
0:32:28 continue to escalate the door to the VIP
0:32:30 room
0:32:32 opens BR can't help but to automatically
0:32:36 pull back and as a surprise to her as
0:32:39 she does so retrieving one of her hands
0:32:42 covering her mouth she realizes the
0:32:45 automatic instinct to cover her own Fang
0:32:48 showing miles with his back uh mostly to
0:32:51 them and making sure that Eden is also
0:32:54 facing the other
0:32:56 direction uh yes it is uh time for us to
0:33:00 do the thing that I uh I think we need
0:33:03 to do to get this uh basically shut this
0:33:05 party down and get it finished up we
0:33:07 need to I have a thought we
0:33:10 should anyways um when you're done there
0:33:14 um why don't you come downstairs and uh
0:33:17 find uh find me and Eden
0:33:20 here in the tiniest voice Brea just kind
0:33:25 of squeaks back okay great uh I'll see
0:33:30 you soon yep nice nice to see you again
0:33:33 Prince PR Dragon oh my
0:33:35 God evening Your Grace but it kind of
0:33:39 like just puts her face in Pendragon's
0:33:42 shoulder not willing to look at Miles
0:33:44 right now miles basically closes the
0:33:46 door and moves away from the other side
0:33:49 of the door you hear Eden go who's he
0:33:55 no
0:33:58 as the voices Fade Out as miles and Eden
0:34:02 get away from the door BR kind of
0:34:05 collects herself and sits back on P
0:34:08 dragon's lap creating some space between
0:34:11 the two of them and she lowers the hand
0:34:14 covering her face and looks up at him
0:34:18 offers him a shy
0:34:22 smile fangs and
0:34:24 all he looks
0:34:29 flustered a rare expression from him he
0:34:33 is frustrated embarrassed perhaps wants
0:34:38 to leave perhaps wants to
0:34:42 stay but when she smiles at
0:34:45 him the tension is eased a
0:34:50 bit and he gives this
0:34:54 crooked slight Smile Back back it is as
0:34:59 though he is enjoying
0:35:02 himself when do you have to
0:35:05 leave whenever I
0:35:09 want
0:35:10 um I I have to go
0:35:14 but Brea Cycles through some options and
0:35:19 kind of with like with a peek over her
0:35:23 shoulder ensuring that Miles and Eden
0:35:27 are completely out of range she might
0:35:31 have heightened her senses for that one
0:35:34 at least in this moment you are
0:35:38 alone brda shifts to the side making it
0:35:41 easier for her to stand up off of the
0:35:43 love seat and as she does she reaches to
0:35:46 the ground to collect her gloves
0:35:49 slipping each on one and then the other
0:35:54 and as she writes them making making
0:35:57 sure they're on
0:35:58 correctly she looks back over to Pand
0:36:01 dragon and hooks a finger somewhere
0:36:05 above the slits of her
0:36:08 dress and in one swift subtle motion she
0:36:11 slides something down from hip to heel
0:36:14 navigating a bit of cloth around the
0:36:18 boot that she wears she clucks it up in
0:36:21 her Palm walks back over to Pendragon
0:36:25 one knee on the seat to have better
0:36:28 access to reach into his pocket and with
0:36:31 that slips her underwear into his pocket
0:36:34 she looks back up at him still flushed
0:36:38 pink from the blush of health and from
0:36:40 what they're doing things still hidden
0:36:43 in her smile and she
0:36:47 says I'm hoping you won't make me wrong
0:36:49 about
0:36:50 you she lets her touch Linger on the
0:36:53 pocket just for one additional moment
0:36:56 before turning and going to join miles
0:36:59 and Eden wherever they may
0:37:06 be you slip out of the VIP area head
0:37:09 down the stairs round the corner and get
0:37:11 a look at the crowd that has um is a bit
0:37:16 of a strange concoction of emotions and
0:37:19 energy amidst them you spot miles with
0:37:23 him is Eden kind of keeping close but
0:37:26 very clearly curious about what's going
0:37:29 on with you because she keeps glancing
0:37:31 in your direction and spots you right
0:37:35 away little weave when Edan spots br br
0:37:39 is trying to fix her hair back into
0:37:42 place and kind of trying to get herself
0:37:45 back in order and there's an embarrassed
0:37:48 raise of the hand Back to Eden but BR is
0:37:52 being avoidant and walking more to Miles
0:37:56 than to her with the questions on her
0:37:58 face getting the semi signal from Eden I
0:38:02 turn around and see BR approaching and
0:38:04 move to intercept hey um good good well
0:38:09 as you can see uh the Rave is uh weird
0:38:13 right now and we need
0:38:15 to uh get this domain uh acting together
0:38:20 finding something to give them a reason
0:38:22 to fight because otherwise they will
0:38:24 just hide when things go down you mean
0:38:28 trying to maybe bring the mood up or
0:38:30 something yeah bring the mood up but
0:38:32 also give them something to fight for
0:38:35 Something to Believe In to give hope in
0:38:39 a situation where we just watched a
0:38:41 crazy lady get very insanely violent
0:38:43 yeah um yeah the the the rooftop
0:38:49 is what what were you thinking um well I
0:38:52 do have some music prepared while I'm
0:38:57 lyrics I was hoping that you would
0:38:59 perform them do you have notes or of
0:39:03 course what you don't mean
0:39:07 now do you
0:39:09 soon like tonight soon oh yeah tonight
0:39:12 soon oh uh okay um look not that I don't
0:39:16 think you're skilled or whatnot but I
0:39:18 will also be helping you got a new got a
0:39:22 trick in the bag that'll help things go
0:39:24 along miles do you think do you think
0:39:26 that would even work because I mean I've
0:39:29 yes I've been working during the Rave to
0:39:30 try to get people to like us and like me
0:39:34 so that they'll like us and build that
0:39:35 kind of Rapport and everything and right
0:39:38 I just don't know if it would be enough
0:39:39 if I were to be that Central I feel like
0:39:43 you can and part of it is the nature of
0:39:46 bruha but also I just think that you'll
0:39:49 be able to do what is necessary to
0:39:52 inspire them with a little help from you
0:39:55 know some music So when you say music um
0:39:59 I know you have a lot of connections in
0:40:00 this field mhm would you be playing
0:40:03 piano or do you have a backrack or am I
0:40:07 just kind of going for this I have the
0:40:10 music written with the lyrics I'm
0:40:14 probably can dig up some backtrack but
0:40:17 we'll see how it goes all right can you
0:40:18 hand me the music and I can see if I can
0:40:21 even do this he reaches into his coat uh
0:40:24 and grabs you know crinkled up folded
0:40:26 pieces of paper of um sheet music that
0:40:29 he has written on put some notations and
0:40:33 put some notes in and around the are the
0:40:35 music itself BR starts examining it
0:40:37 starts humming out Melodies as she
0:40:40 figures them out trying to get the
0:40:41 pacing right in her mind trying to
0:40:44 understand and take into account the
0:40:46 lyrics and for a few minutes that's
0:40:49 really what she's putting her heart in
0:40:51 too she looks up at you and she says do
0:40:55 you really think that this this would
0:40:56 work you said you you would be able to
0:40:58 help me personally I don't even know if
0:41:00 you'll need the help but yes I will be
0:41:02 helping you it's just I have a lot of
0:41:06 Hope for this being something that we
0:41:08 can all figure out together and that we
0:41:11 can maybe make this into something
0:41:12 better and that we can take everything
0:41:14 that happened tonight and make it into
0:41:16 something good and I think I can share
0:41:18 that I think you can channel that
0:41:20 correct yes it's just kind of scary of
0:41:23 course don't worry we can help with that
0:41:25 part now Eden cut us the way through to
0:41:28 the the
0:41:29 booth H and she starts kind of excuse me
0:41:33 excuse me and like the sound of the
0:41:36 music and I kind of like I'm following
0:41:39 up right behind her helping you
0:41:42 they as soon as she moves up to the
0:41:44 stage I'm going to look at BR go I'll
0:41:47 talk to the DJ you get ready you've got
0:41:50 this now yes now well as soon as the
0:41:54 song is done you can't interrupt a song
0:41:56 I'm going to hit her with kingmaker you
0:41:58 feel imbued with strange power that you
0:42:02 have not felt before you feel confident
0:42:05 you feel so confident that you don't
0:42:08 feel like you have to apologize for
0:42:09 anything no matter how bad you are no
0:42:12 matter how much you misbehave no matter
0:42:14 how much you double speak if someone
0:42:16 disagrees they are wrong the argument
0:42:19 doesn't matter you feel like
0:42:25 miles
0:42:29 what an end
0:42:30 note that will be six
0:42:33 successes which will add six dice to
0:42:37 whatever social roles you make and it
0:42:39 will reduce your difficulties by three I
0:42:41 just have to stay in general proximity
0:42:44 to you you enact your effect and as it
0:42:48 starts to take hold there's a couple
0:42:50 physical changes even just in the way
0:42:52 that Brea carries herself the way that
0:42:55 she stands she usually has good posture
0:42:58 but here her shoulders go backwards even
0:43:02 her weight shifting in a more confident
0:43:04 manner like more like a model walking a
0:43:08 Runway something makes her feel like she
0:43:11 has the center of the attention of the
0:43:13 room and she deserves it and talking the
0:43:17 notes into the same band that holds her
0:43:20 gun she moves up to take the
0:43:25 microphone
0:43:27 and face out to the
0:43:28 [Music]

0:47:02 tonight roll now okay I would like a
0:47:06 Charisma plus performance rle the
0:47:08 standard difficulty for this is six but
0:47:10 it is modified by the Bonus that miles
0:47:13 is giving and any merits you have the
0:47:16 minimum difficulty for this roll is
0:47:18 going to be three so with the difficulty
0:47:22 reduction from the King maker effect
0:47:26 it is reduced to three from six that's
0:47:28 correct I'll add in six Dice from King
0:47:31 maker as well is enchanting voice
0:47:33 relevant I mean certainly relevant to
0:47:36 the IC aspect of this but the you have
0:47:40 so many bonuses when not going right now
0:47:42 yeah that your difficulty can't get any
0:47:43 lower I will award you an extra two dice
0:47:46 for the roll based on the Merit and
0:47:48 we'll uh call it at
0:47:51 that and the singing spec applies I
0:47:54 would think it does
0:47:56 13 successes you
0:47:59 succeed Crow cheers claps there's
0:48:01 whistling going on all over the place
0:48:04 and like bit of cloth like slaps against
0:48:07 you and drops to your feet and when you
0:48:09 look down I don't know how you feel
0:48:11 about it but there is a powdered blue
0:48:15 thong laying at your feet is the king
0:48:18 maker effect changing my confidence
0:48:20 still a factor yes yeah the bras had
0:48:26 soft things are being thrown your way BR
0:48:30 had been standing in total focus in
0:48:33 total confidence feeling the sort of
0:48:35 fulfillment that one can only really
0:48:38 achieve when
0:48:40 they actualize an art that matters to
0:48:43 them and she really is trying to drive
0:48:47 that sense of hope that sense of navity
0:48:50 that sense of feeling into every word
0:48:52 embodying positive emotion into song
0:48:56 and coming to the end of it feels like a
0:48:58 form of
0:48:59 release and as she feels something soft
0:49:01 hit her I mean she doesn't even really
0:49:04 move at first until she looks down as
0:49:07 everything Fades out and starts
0:49:09 realizing what some of these objects are
0:49:12 and blushes a little trying to as an
0:49:17 automatic instinct to cover her smile
0:49:19 that she might do normally something
0:49:22 that is born out of her usual shyness
0:49:24 but with the revelation of
0:49:26 the instilled sense of confidence she
0:49:29 realizes she can drop her hand and just
0:49:31 smile out to the audience mouth the word
0:49:34 thank you put the mic back send a little
0:49:36 wink off unsure in whose Direction near
0:49:39 the uh front of the club Johnny who had
0:49:42 been existing in the state of limbo at
0:49:44 the front door constantly going out for
0:49:46 a cigarette to talk to people and then
0:49:48 as he tries to come back into the club
0:49:50 being roped into another cigarette to go
0:49:52 back out to the front is actually
0:49:53 standing inside with all of the other
0:49:55 brewha that were in that similar state
0:49:58 of cigarette limbo M and all of the
0:50:01 smokers have come inside to cheer and
0:50:03 yell and and Shout accolades and praise
0:50:06 she makes sure to grab the microphone
0:50:08 back up and make the thank you thank you
0:50:12 thank you New Haven thank you bruha a
0:50:14 bit louder before she puts it back and
0:50:16 exit the stage she gives the DJ to go
0:50:19 ahead to wrap things up I think she
0:50:22 looks over to miles at that I think the
0:50:24 things will start Wynn down from here
0:50:26 Amaya takes the mic before the DJ can
0:50:29 get a hold of it and turns presenting it
0:50:32 to Johnny Johnny grabs the mic get gets
0:50:34 up on stage next to where BR is all
0:50:37 right y'all I think it's been a pretty
0:50:39 successful Rave tonight no permanent
