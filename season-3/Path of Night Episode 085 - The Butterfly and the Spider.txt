0:00:32 [Music]
0:00:39 last time on path of
0:00:41 night the cot reunited with wi at Roman
0:00:44 Pendragon Haven escorted by justicar
0:00:47 Luc sind and her
0:00:50 archons battered the Cod attempts to
0:00:53 pull
0:00:54 together mil sought out his sire Yan
0:00:57 Peterson and brda was called to Ren
0:01:07 [Music]
0:01:28 penri
0:01:33 as Dawn finally draws
0:01:35 near the various members of the quartery
0:01:37 are brought to Rooms where they would be
0:01:40 resting for the
0:01:42 day miles
0:01:45 wind the two of you are escorted to the
0:01:47 room that you'll be staying in during
0:01:49 the daylight
0:01:50 hours when you get in it is a gorgeous
0:01:54 lavish
0:01:56 space and it is complete with its own
0:02:00 balcony space bathroom sitting
0:02:02 area and there is one
0:02:06 bed massive but one bed that awaits the
0:02:10 two of you
0:02:12 when walks
0:02:15 in picks a side of the
0:02:18 bed takes her boots off she may actually
0:02:20 still just be carrying them from coming
0:02:23 inside from where she was sitting with
0:02:26 Neil she sets the boots down goes in the
0:02:31 bathroom she doesn't bother closing the
0:02:33 door the sound of the tub running starts
0:02:36 but it doesn't last long it seems like
0:02:37 she's just rinsing her feet off she
0:02:40 comes out walking awkwardly on a towel
0:02:42 to keep from getting the floor wet uh
0:02:45 miles is enter the room saw that she's
0:02:47 claimed one side kind of shrugs puts his
0:02:51 sword on the other side basically the
0:02:53 beer whatever yeah I couldn't uh I
0:02:56 couldn't find my sire at all we didn't
0:02:58 have a lot of time
0:03:00 so I'm so glad that everything here is
0:03:03 so
0:03:04 accommodating is there a
0:03:07 problem yeah I should have my own bed
0:03:10 why because I'm a guest it's just how it
0:03:14 works I mean I'm glad I've got a
0:03:17 bed but I don't know I've kind of gotten
0:03:20 used to having a bed since you gave me
0:03:23 one right I mean you guys all had spaces
0:03:27 to sleep in previously he's got like a
0:03:29 million rooms here you're telling me
0:03:31 that this couldn't have happened maybe
0:03:33 they wanted to give you and me a minute
0:03:35 to
0:03:39 talk it still feels like Pendragon it's
0:03:42 probably petty [ __ ] but I'm going to
0:03:43 find the silver lining while I can man
0:03:46 fair
0:03:47 enough so that was quite
0:03:49 a meeting we went
0:03:52 through
0:03:54 yeah
0:03:56 um wind kind of like sits on the edge of
0:03:59 the bed
0:04:01 head in her hands for a minute
0:04:03 while thoughts come into being and try
0:04:07 to form into
0:04:08 words after a minute she just kind of
0:04:10 Pats the bed on his side so that he'll
0:04:14 come and at least
0:04:15 sit
0:04:17 um I
0:04:19 guess they have chairs here we can we
0:04:22 don't have to sit on the same
0:04:24 bed do you just want me to shower or
0:04:27 something do you want me to sleep in the
0:04:29 bathtub no it's just very difficult to
0:04:32 have a conversation with the person
0:04:33 sitting next to you instead of in front
0:04:35 of you well then if you want a chair
0:04:38 bring a chair up I want to sit on this
0:04:40 bed excellent miles will drag a chair
0:04:43 over makes an awkward loud dragging
0:04:48 noise he sits down in the chair pulls
0:04:51 out his glasses case and starts cleaning
0:04:53 his glasses have you ever been fully
0:04:55 blood bonded no it's an experience
0:05:00 I'm
0:05:01 sure not one
0:05:03 I want or relish having to do I very
0:05:07 rarely think people want it I mean there
0:05:09 are cases but it's not it's not a thing
0:05:14 you generally want it's slavery let's
0:05:16 call it what it is sure it's not
0:05:20 permanent
0:05:22 three doesn't have to
0:05:25 be so here's the thing
0:05:28 miles I
0:05:31 know I know you're trying to come
0:05:34 up with a clever way out of
0:05:39 this
0:05:41 and I'm going to need to ask you to
0:05:44 stop unlikely I know but hear me
0:05:50 out
0:05:52 you have done a lot in the name of
0:05:56 keeping us safe
0:05:57 right yes okay and that got me taken
0:06:01 away from
0:06:03 you and if you're found [ __ ] around
0:06:06 with
0:06:08 that it's not you they're going to hurt
0:06:12 directly it's going to
0:06:14 be Neil or
0:06:17 brda and they're going to do that so
0:06:19 that you and I have to watch and know
0:06:22 that our actions caused
0:06:24 this so here's what I'm going to ask you
0:06:26 to
0:06:27 do let's you and I be
0:06:31 protectors and you let me
0:06:34 go I don't want this I want a way
0:06:38 out and on a long enough timeline I will
0:06:42 find a way
0:06:44 out but if you want to keep the rest of
0:06:47 them
0:06:48 safe you need to make the choice to let
0:06:51 me
0:06:53 go clearly it's not one I'm going to
0:06:55 make for
0:06:56 you I understand part of it is
0:07:02 is all of these plans and strategies
0:07:07 that they've been planning for ages are
0:07:09 coming to a head because they don't want
0:07:12 to admit that something is happening I
0:07:15 don't know what that something is Neil
0:07:17 has a few guesses we've been
0:07:20 there giant ominous red star in the sky
0:07:23 gives me a bit of a
0:07:25 pause
0:07:27 but we're not the only one and
0:07:31 that's something is going to
0:07:34 change and that is what they're afraid
0:07:37 of and do you
0:07:40 think screwing up their plans is going
0:07:43 to make them less afraid and more likely
0:07:45 to cooperate I'm not even involved in
0:07:47 their plans as far as I can tell oh you
0:07:49 are a very integral part of their plans
0:07:51 it would seem miles they don't take you
0:07:55 to the Woodshed like they did if you're
0:07:58 not playing a bigger part than you
0:08:00 realize I mean
0:08:03 that they need me because I've made
0:08:07 myself integral to New Haven when he
0:08:12 says they need me there is kind of a
0:08:16 twitch in W's face
0:08:20 and after that no idea probably banking
0:08:24 on the fact that I'll get myself killed
0:08:26 since an entire saat see is coming for
0:08:30 me when kind of grabs fistfuls of her
0:08:33 hair head down between her
0:08:37 forearms all
0:08:39 right did you and Luc sind have a
0:08:44 conversation in that car
0:08:47 ride wind doesn't
0:08:51 move
0:08:56 [Music]
0:08:58 right
0:09:00 he puts his glasses back on his face he
0:09:02 looks over at her when he starts to move
0:09:04 she'll kind of like poke her head up and
0:09:06 just look up with her eyes at him
0:09:09 so as far as I can
0:09:12 tell the blood bond from one side can't
0:09:17 really tell if the other person is
0:09:19 actually bonded to them
0:09:21 besides some behavioral
0:09:24 changes okay lucd implied a lot of
0:09:27 things but she didn't outright say them
0:09:30 you can
0:09:32 choose based on what I can see on timing
0:09:35 right now to pick a different
0:09:39 horse this goes back to that if we pee
0:09:43 in their
0:09:44 weedies we're not the ones who are going
0:09:46 to be punished the most
0:09:49 harshly I
0:09:51 don't I pretty much very
0:09:55 rarely don't try to do stuff I know this
0:09:59 does get me in trouble but it also makes
0:10:01 us who we are and they're going to be
0:10:04 busy pretty soon and then they won't be
0:10:08 well that's a lot of time and a lot
0:10:12 more
0:10:13 uh things and events for us to
0:10:17 have seen our way
0:10:21 through again if they want to come for
0:10:23 me they can and they will when gets up
0:10:27 and goes into the bathroom and shuts the
0:10:29 door door I love these abrupt changes in
0:10:32 conversation read the room
0:10:35 buddy all right I I already
0:10:39 have I need you to come out here if you
0:10:41 want me to try to do something about
0:10:43 it in the bathroom when runs water puts
0:10:48 her hands under it feeling the tension
0:10:51 of the line she's walking with how much
0:10:53 she has already told miles and how much
0:10:55 she can get away with saying again
0:10:59 she doesn't even know if she can even
0:11:02 say that she's sorry or if that will be
0:11:05 saying too
0:11:07 much mostly she's thinking she knows
0:11:11 what she
0:11:12 wants she wants out of this miles will
0:11:16 be in the other room he will stand up he
0:11:18 will turn the chair to face the door he
0:11:20 will take off his Overcoat loosen his
0:11:23 tie and kind of uh stretch his neck a
0:11:28 bit I mid The Silence of this the door
0:11:32 unlocks and Creeks open as someone makes
0:11:36 their way
0:11:38 inside I will turn to face Our
0:11:42 Guest you see your
0:11:46 sire he is not wearing a suit he's
0:11:49 dressed in
0:11:51 jeans hiking
0:11:55 boots he's got this Yale hoodie pulled
0:12:00 up over his
0:12:01 head so that a lot of his features are
0:12:04 kind of difficult to make out you almost
0:12:06 don't recognize him at all because of
0:12:08 this because of the sight of him out of
0:12:10 a suit tucked under his arm as a file
0:12:14 all cap in a manila folder what can I
0:12:18 help you with he looks around he lowers
0:12:20 lights miles I need to speak with you
0:12:23 and I don't have very much time all
0:12:25 right I get closer so he can talk
0:12:28 quieter we have been lied
0:12:30 to by who he
0:12:33 looks
0:12:35 ashamed my
0:12:38 sire spun a
0:12:40 lie that has consumed the
0:12:43 world for centuries I have protected the
0:12:47 Masquerade and defended the camara's
0:12:49 interests to the best of my ability
0:12:52 stretched thinner and
0:12:55 thinner as more and more of these
0:12:57 problems sprad up from every corner of
0:13:00 the
0:13:01 planet I've been
0:13:03 flying back and forth between the East
0:13:06 and West coasts Waring with the WAN Quay
0:13:10 and the sabat on the East
0:13:11 Coast but there are pieces that are
0:13:14 coming together now you heard what
0:13:16 happened in Sri Lanka yes when will
0:13:20 crack the door Yan Peterson grows quiet
0:13:23 and guarded when he realizes that Miles
0:13:24 wasn't given his own
0:13:27 room hey I look at him and
0:13:31 like I look at him pen
0:13:34 Dragon
0:13:36 right
0:13:37 anyway one of the files that we have is
0:13:41 on the zantosa family before they were
0:13:44 called by that name they smuggled the
0:13:47 corpse of something across the Atlantic
0:13:51 Ocean I'm nodding at him like I already
0:13:54 know this stuff to New Haven when will
0:13:57 open the bathroom door and stand in the
0:13:58 door
0:13:59 way my
0:14:01 spies in New
0:14:03 York have made contact with the NOS
0:14:07 feratu they speak of a monster beneath
0:14:10 the city that is feeding and growing out
0:14:14 of
0:14:16 control the
0:14:19 eldest
0:14:21 yes we've known about it for a while I
0:14:23 just didn't know what to do with it if
0:14:26 the stories are to be believed there is
0:14:29 nothing that can be done with it we
0:14:31 fought a piece of it it
0:14:34 was a lot it was so
0:14:37 [Music]
0:14:39 strong in
0:14:43 Transylvania the eldest of the
0:14:45 zi one who is now referred to as the
0:14:49 founder Was Defeated and had a stake
0:14:53 driven through his heart by
0:14:56 anarchs their leader Lugo
0:15:00 theorized
0:15:01 him committed the most terrible sin to
0:15:04 see it destroyed once and for
0:15:07 all and if these spies in New York are
0:15:10 to be
0:15:11 believed
0:15:13 lambach lambach ruthin a witness to this
0:15:18 altercation has been made
0:15:22 aware by the
0:15:24 eldest that it lives
0:15:26 on it is claimed
0:15:29 by it that the lambach is to Bear
0:15:31 witness to something that is
0:15:34 coming we cannot
0:15:37 prevent the fight that is about to
0:15:39 happen in New York my sire insists upon
0:15:41 it he insists that all who oppose this
0:15:47 Siege of New York
0:15:49 City be
0:15:53 eliminated so what are we going to
0:15:56 do he looks
0:15:59 like he wants to give an answer but
0:16:02 can't there are no contingency plans
0:16:05 miles there is nothing planned for it
0:16:08 happens when the Masquerade fails
0:16:09 because it cannot we must find a way to
0:16:14 preserve the
0:16:15 Masquerade to sabotage this attack and
0:16:18 make sure it doesn't
0:16:19 happen and even then it will only buy us
0:16:22 time the thing from New York will still
0:16:25 rise the only way to stop any of this is
0:16:28 that stop that no no it cannot be
0:16:31 stopped miles pay attention it cannot
0:16:34 die it is beyond
0:16:37 death what happened in Sri Lanka
0:16:39 happened because of a war that was
0:16:40 taking place between the ravos and the
0:16:42 wqu the ravnos their war with the one
0:16:45 Quay in Sri Lanka during it there were
0:16:48 Mass Embraces diablas these Mass
0:16:51 Embraces somehow triggered a psychic
0:16:54 event that woke their eldest that
0:16:57 brought it to the surface our conflict
0:17:01 with the sabat on the East Coast it is
0:17:05 drawing towards a similar
0:17:08 event if we if we were to buy time and
0:17:13 deescalate this conflict and may grant
0:17:16 us the opportunity to find some other
0:17:18 way and prevent its
0:17:20 rise I think slain is also working on
0:17:24 something he is I thought slain was dead
0:17:28 nope
0:17:29 I see she looks to Miles like how much
0:17:32 do I tell him I didn't know he thought
0:17:34 he was presumed dead but um essentially
0:17:38 he seems to be wanting to uh
0:17:41 dismantle a demon for its power to
0:17:45 obliterate this
0:17:47 or that's my understanding of it he
0:17:50 looks at you with enough desperation in
0:17:53 his eyes that he might accept it as an
0:17:57 option he checks watch
0:17:59 I don't have much
0:18:01 time I would suggest you talk to Xavier
0:18:04 because he has more insight on this
0:18:06 thing and how to fight it because that's
0:18:09 the whole reason my clan
0:18:11 left Xavier is watched by my sire I
0:18:15 don't know if I can get close you send
0:18:17 an animal I can send an animal here's a
0:18:20 few minutes what do you need to tell
0:18:24 me
0:18:26 miles they are going to destroy you
0:18:30 you are being propped
0:18:32 up as a means of making it look like the
0:18:37 blood of harstad is invested in what is
0:18:40 happening on the East Coast your purpose
0:18:43 does not exist past
0:18:46 that they know they know that they will
0:18:49 lose New
0:18:52 Haven and if they can take New York with
0:18:55 this opportunity to my sire it is a wor
0:18:58 the
0:19:03 trade when is stock
0:19:06 still all
0:19:12 right can we keep New Haven well that's
0:19:14 stop
0:19:15 this he reaches into his pocket
0:19:18 searching for something and takes out
0:19:20 what looks like a key with a tag on it
0:19:23 that's just like a couple letters and
0:19:27 numbers I have made made copies of as
0:19:29 many files as I
0:19:32 could a half century of stamping out GNA
0:19:35 Cults and acquiring the research that
0:19:38 they have made on the
0:19:39 [Music]
0:19:42 end I need to
0:19:46 go forget about New Haven forget about
0:19:50 everything but that was just most dear
0:19:52 to
0:19:52 you and hold on to
0:19:56 it of course but
0:20:00 I can't let them all
0:20:03 die then do what you must to preserve
0:20:07 them he hands you this
0:20:12 key and one more
0:20:14 thing what's
0:20:16 that there is
0:20:18 an item that he draws from Opus skate
0:20:24 you recognize it to be a long sword
0:20:29 this is
0:20:31 overdue as a prince and the leader of
0:20:34 the ventre you have earned your
0:20:37 sword I have brought it to the most
0:20:40 powerful thommes I
0:20:42 know
0:20:43 hopefully it is deserving of its Prince
0:20:47 and he offers you a sword I will take it
0:20:50 with both hands it feels very light is
0:20:55 there anything I can do to help
0:20:56 you I will make contact to as soon as I
0:20:59 can I have a plane to
0:21:01 catch be safe you as well and he slips
0:21:05 out the
0:21:09 door Johnny Neil the two of them are
0:21:14 brought into a room there is a very
0:21:17 large bed and it it is stocked with
0:21:22 makeups
0:21:24 perfumes beautiful art adorning the
0:21:27 walls Bureau with a massive mirror its
0:21:31 own bathroom its own balcony it is this
0:21:34 gorgeous little space that has been
0:21:36 provided to the two of
0:21:37 you the Josan escorts the two of you to
0:21:41 your room uh you recognize her as the
0:21:43 woman who drove you here she quickly
0:21:45 excuses herself and the two of you are
0:21:48 left to your own
0:21:50 devices Neil looks the whole time
0:21:53 they've been brought up here looks just
0:21:54 like deeply lost in thought and
0:21:56 distracted not too dissimilar from the
0:22:00 sort of almost Fugue state that he was
0:22:02 in after confessing that he was
0:22:04 responsible for killing Marcos but stops
0:22:08 when he looks and just starts looking
0:22:09 around the room and then walks over to
0:22:11 the mirror and puts a finger against it
0:22:14 and goes yeah NE is a neat trick uh to
0:22:18 know if if this is oneway glass or not
0:22:21 is it it is a simple
0:22:26 mirror doesn't rule it out but at at
0:22:29 least not Munday it's it's a regular
0:22:31 mirror it doesn't mean nobody's watching
0:22:32 you from the mirror but it it's it's not
0:22:35 a um the hell are you mumbling about
0:22:38 over there doesn't matter it's fine
0:22:41 Johnny's unwrapping a another pack of
0:22:44 Morley's do you think it's okay to smoke
0:22:46 in here I don't give a [ __ ] fair enough
0:22:49 do you see an ashtray I look around is
0:22:52 there an ashtray you do not see an
0:22:54 ashtray um I hope he pays his staff well
0:22:57 the mop as Johnny lights a cigarette
0:23:02 Neil just sort of sits on the edge of
0:23:04 the bed uh the one furthest from the
0:23:06 door oh what the hell man what are
0:23:10 we what do we
0:23:13 what's
0:23:15 [ __ ] I pretty much R and thinking too I
0:23:19 don't I don't know what to I um I don't
0:23:22 know what to think about first I worry

0:24:09 tell us he Saar CIA I [ __ ] know I
0:24:12 don't know keep on worrying brother what
0:24:14 else we got to worry um I'm I'm thinking
0:24:16 it's a lot uh there's um there's the
0:24:20 Ziti the eldest and and everything
0:24:22 that's going to happen with the dragon
0:24:23 Rising in New York um there's the godamn
0:24:28 D say it anti- deluvian yeah yes uh 100%
0:24:32 that yeah um oh God what else um
0:24:36 everything that happened uh with with
0:24:38 the the all the stuff in the shadowlands
0:24:40 and all the the dead being destroyed and
0:24:42 then I I haven't forgotten about it but
0:24:45 like the whole thing that wind said with
0:24:46 like ghosts getting thrown into their
0:24:48 bodies that's happening um uh let's see
0:24:52 um and among all this they're charging
0:24:57 625 for a pack of morle these
0:25:01 days [ __ ]
0:25:03 unbelievable that's Johnny sits back and
0:25:06 just takes a long drag God I feels so
0:25:09 stupid to say are you doing okay Johnny
0:25:11 but like I don't know what else to say
0:25:13 are you doing okay Johnny are you
0:25:16 everybody's been checking in with wi
0:25:17 with M I don't think anybody's checked
0:25:18 in with you in a while oh we're done for
0:25:21 brother yeah I know but like I mean
0:25:24 short
0:25:26 term shortterm
0:25:28 I'm pissed at the price of more
0:25:32 leas you know that actually actually
0:25:36 makes actually makes a lot of sense when
0:25:38 things are really overwhelming you you
0:25:41 focus on the small stuff you hyper focus
0:25:43 on the small stuff until you can't see
0:25:44 anything about the small stuff that's
0:25:46 not a you thing that's a that's a me
0:25:48 thing but it's a I think it's a I think
0:25:49 it's a lot of people thing um I don't
0:25:53 know man it's the it's the end of the
0:25:55 world God I hope it comes soon yeah it'
0:25:58 be a blessing wouldn't it well yeah
0:26:00 because then Wen wouldn't have to kill
0:26:02 any of
0:26:03 us what yeah uh I don't know for a fact
0:26:07 these things are a little unreliable but
0:26:10 I'm pretty sure the justicar is going to
0:26:11 make wind kill one of
0:26:14 us and I don't think W's going to have
0:26:17 any choice in the matter um I could spin
0:26:20 the ru wheel on on who it's going to be
0:26:22 I've got ideas but I want to look into
0:26:25 it first could be all of us to be
0:26:27 totally honest but so Len's going to
0:26:29 make the whole Coterie just go away with
0:26:33 when I don't know about the whole Coterie
0:26:35 it's at least at least somebody maybe
0:26:37 all of us I don't know probably not
0:26:39 Britta depending on how much it's not a
0:26:42 bad plan she could do some of the Allies
0:26:44 could win yeah absolutely take my throat
0:26:47 by surprise and then I don't know
0:26:49 without the F rest of you would deal
0:26:51 with when if I had time to prepare I
0:26:54 could get away miles could say something
0:26:56 but I could get away with from when
0:26:58 in the short term in the long term I
0:27:00 don't know and honestly if she's faster
0:27:02 than me no I couldn't so I don't know is
0:27:05 this how your head works all the time
0:27:06 you just sit here worrying about all
0:27:08 this [ __ ] yes it's [ __ ] exhausting
0:27:12 yes this a reason why the prospect of
0:27:16 the end isn't the thing that scares me
0:27:17 the most what does scare you the most
0:27:21 being alone when it happens it used to
0:27:24 be Rees like really not that long
0:27:26 ago but
0:27:28 now it's being left behind it's been so
0:27:32 long
0:27:33 being distrustful the
0:27:36 trir I'm sure this is probably partially
0:27:39 blood bonds talking but Rees doesn't
0:27:42 bother me that much and I don't have
0:27:45 that bad of opinion of the IRA
0:27:47 guy you talked Ira at all no I
0:27:52 no I
0:27:54 don't I don't know I don't know Johnny I
0:27:56 don't I don't know what to
0:27:59 I know what to do Fester is still he's
0:28:02 probably dead I know no offense and it's
0:28:06 my
0:28:06 fault it's all our fault it's it's mine
0:28:10 the door clicks shut Johnny looks over
0:28:12 at the door and having walked in
0:28:14 completely unnoticed by the two of you
0:28:17 not until he shut the door and allowed
0:28:21 you to be aware of his
0:28:23 presence do you notice William builtmore
0:28:29 um hello who the [ __ ] are you uh I'm

0:30:02 sitting around talking about all the
0:30:04 things that stress us out what stresses
0:30:07 you out buddy he Ponders for a
0:30:11 moment I never quite got to enjoy my
0:30:16 career as a
0:30:17 poet Jesus Christ it's very frustrating
0:30:22 and it has bothered me for a good long
0:30:25 time I spent my whole [ __ ] life of
0:30:28 poets know saddled with one Lex he just
0:30:32 looks at you and smiles I don't remember
0:30:35 putting out a call
0:30:37 correct I also don't remember hearing a
0:30:40 call that's also true okay great Neil
0:30:44 looks at him and are are we waiting on
0:30:48 anyone else uh hopefully not long the
0:30:51 door clicks
0:30:53 again this is like the Hobbit having
0:30:57 infiltrated this
0:30:59 Fortress is Natasha Nicks primagen of
0:31:03 the mavian and secret member of the
0:31:05 inonu and accompanying her is Edmund
0:31:10 dashwood who is staring daggers at
0:31:14 Johnny
0:31:19 Saxon I just opened this pack what the
0:31:22 [ __ ] do you all want cigarettes dashwood
0:31:25 walks right up to get his I feel himself

0:31:31 Mor I start splitting them up um Prim

0:31:38 here for the meeting dashwood says who
0:31:41 put the call out am I invited to this
0:31:43 mavian meeting I don't remember putting
0:31:46 out a call why is Johnny here for this
0:31:48 meeting I ni is raise it's fine he can
0:31:51 be
0:31:52 here I I don't remember putting out a
0:31:55 call fine bmore says we're all
0:32:00 liars okay well I guess since we're here
0:32:04 maybe is there any
0:32:07 um I don't even know what page to start
0:32:09 on here I don't know there are many
0:32:11 astral projections here so have I open
0:32:15 awareness yeah no
0:32:17 there's a lot of weird [ __ ] in this
0:32:20 immediate vicinity these are just the
0:32:22 people that showed up physically so
0:32:24 looking around and seeing all these
0:32:27 psychic Avatar cars and the people are
0:32:29 they all looking at me waiting yeah oh
0:32:32 Jesus Neil swallows down a panic attack
0:32:35 and then goes um okay well since since
0:32:38 we're all here I guess um when Neil goes
0:32:40 to speak the door clicks
0:32:42 again sorry uh Quinton King apologizes
0:32:48 for his
0:32:53 tardiness and he goes and he just makes
0:32:55 himself comfier on the bed like on the
0:32:57 other side of Johnny and so Johnny is
0:33:00 the Oreo the cream filling in this m
0:33:04 sandwich Quinton looks at you something
0:33:07 something ah what's what's happening
0:33:09 what is this about oh yeah yeah
0:33:15 Neil what is this all
0:33:18 about
0:33:21 okay
0:33:22 um
0:33:24 so since we're here and he looks back
0:33:28 over at the door like semi expectantly
0:33:31 billmore speaks up what are you doing
0:33:34 okay
0:33:36 um wait what am I doing you should be
0:33:39 conducting the meeting you've made the
0:33:40 call we have listened we have honored
0:33:43 your request or are we all liars even
0:33:45 make the he gives you the most subtle
0:33:50 wink now conduct the meeting fair
0:33:54 enough um okay sorry I'm not used to
0:33:57 being the center
0:33:59 of so to Prince King's Point yeah it's
0:34:02 gehenna I think it's kind of
0:34:04 a I think none of us are are stupid
0:34:07 enough not to look up Johnny kind of
0:34:10 looks in amazement at all the [ __ ] uh
0:34:13 gathered mavens and it's like what the
0:34:17 okay the weirdest part is Johnny can
0:34:19 only see like a third of the people in
0:34:20 this room right now still a lot of
0:34:22 people true it's to Johnny's assessment
0:34:26 it's just Nick's
0:34:28 Quinton King and uh dashwood and bmore
0:34:33 and um right so
0:34:36 uh we we we've all seen some signs
0:34:40 larger or smaller uh and in the short
0:34:42 term um theot are coming to you know
0:34:45 kill everyone and because they're trying
0:34:48 to do things their way and and they're
0:34:52 mistaken and and misguided and since
0:34:55 it's the you know end of the world at
0:34:58 least for Kindred although probably for
0:35:00 everybody everybody
0:35:02 um but we're not allowed to talk about
0:35:04 how it's the end of the
0:35:06 world uh I guess that's our starting
0:35:09 point is there anybody who's not on that
0:35:11 starting point Neil kind of looks around
0:35:14 everyone kind of nods quietly and once
0:35:17 William has assessed that everyone's on
0:35:18 the same page he just looks at you and
0:35:20 gives a slight Thumbs Up Wait that's it
0:35:23 we're not going to address that you're
0:35:24 the Goddamn poster boy for longbow and
0:35:28 you're the the boot licker for uh pen
0:35:31 Dragon he motions to Quinn King well
0:35:33 there long long about Quin King speaks
0:35:34 up actually I thought we were just going
0:35:36 to skip it and move on to the
0:35:40 point great I'm glad we can get to
0:35:43 business he motions back
0:35:45 to uh Neil okay uh so the saat are
0:35:48 coming up the east coast and they're
0:35:50 coming to you know they're they're
0:35:52 already in motion I don't know how many
0:35:54 of us saw that but they're preparing and
0:35:56 they're they're marching now to to come
0:35:58 up here probably within the next few
0:35:59 days uh and to march on the City of New
0:36:02 Haven and we the bottom like what
0:36:04 whatever um the the more important point
0:36:07 I think uh is how many of us Neil kind
0:36:10 of like puts his hand up how many of us
0:36:11 have are aware have seen uh what happens
0:36:14 when everybody attacks New York what the
0:36:18 thing that none of them raise their
0:36:19 hands no nobody William kind of raises
0:36:22 an eyebrow I assume some sort of
0:36:24 violence nobody sees the nobody else has
0:36:27 seen the Dragon
0:36:28 rise before this is all kind of amusing
0:36:31 to them but the amusement
0:36:35 Fades as they wait for you to go on when
0:36:39 everyone marches on New York some of us
0:36:42 included and fight the sabat in their
0:36:45 home and um you know the the vios I
0:36:48 think is there and ponia and and some
0:36:50 other lasra I don't remember his name
0:36:53 and as fighting and Pen dragon is all
0:36:54 there the the streets Ripple and the
0:36:58 thing under New York the eldest not The
0:37:01 Shard but the eldest Rises no one else
0:37:05 I'm the only one who saw that Nick
0:37:07 speaks up you know I have seen something
0:37:11 that might pertain to this
0:37:13 but it is perhaps from a different angle
0:37:16 another piece of the puzzle oh thank God
0:37:20 perhaps perhaps we have all seen a
0:37:25 future but from different seats
0:37:26 different positions different aspects
0:37:29 perhaps you can explain yours with a bit
0:37:31 more detail I I've been I've been
0:37:34 thinking about it a lot um both through
0:37:39 the visions and the the thoughts that
0:37:42 consume all of us um and then with some
0:37:45 of my own ties
0:37:47 to the heavens um and their
0:37:52 Mastery and the herald of the asites
0:37:57 Rising has risen I saw it happen and
0:38:00 I've been thinking about it and thinking
0:38:01 about it and the only reason that it
0:38:02 would rise
0:38:04 now is because it claims to be the
0:38:06 herald of hakee the children of hakee
0:38:10 right the Nicks and builtmore look
0:38:14 towards a corner of the room where there
0:38:16 is no one and then back to you even with
0:38:20 OSX 5 there's nobody there nope cool
0:38:23 cool cool cool
0:38:24 cool the only
0:38:28 thing that I can think of right is the
0:38:30 The Herald of of hakee right and why
0:38:33 would the herald arrive
0:38:35 to to port in someone's else's arrival
0:38:38 that's what a Herold does um we've seen
0:38:42 The Shard growing of the eldest in New
0:38:46 Haven and all the things that happened
0:38:49 there um the week of nightmares we all I
0:38:52 mean we all we all when we were all
0:38:56 presumably all most of of us when the
0:38:58 things were happening when our minds
0:39:00 were gone when we were seeing things the
0:39:03 rise I don't know he raises his hand
0:39:06 again how many of us saw what happened
0:39:09 when the anti deluvian fell in Sri Lanka
0:39:12 everyone raises their hand at that one
0:39:14 except for Johnny kind of looks around
0:39:16 it like in perplex M as he's just
0:39:19 smoking his
0:39:22 morally I saw a vision of what was to
0:39:28 come could be to come and he kind of
0:39:30 shrugs in that way that like presumably
0:39:33 everybody else kind of gets of like this
0:39:35 shit's not precise I don't know we were
0:39:37 in New York we were fighting a decisive
0:39:40 battle a final stand this Camara versus
0:39:44 the sabat and then the streets begin to
0:39:47 split
0:39:48 open and the dragon
0:39:51 Rises there's something underneath New
0:39:53 York City connected to the
0:39:56 zantosa it's infecting people Johnny
0:40:00 Johnny here actually said he met
0:40:03 something saw something that came back
0:40:06 on the train someone who was
0:40:08 infected right from New York yeah I mean
0:40:10 I've stomped a lot of weird [ __ ] into
0:40:12 the ground before yeah but this one was
0:40:15 different yeah it and it came out of New
0:40:19 York no I had I had to burn that thing
0:40:23 and there's a Shard of it here well not
0:40:25 here we're in Harford in New Haven
0:40:28 and it it definitely reminded me of the
0:40:30 same [ __ ] that was in the Chantry it's
0:40:33 corrupted you said yes during the week
0:40:35 of night was the Chantry exploded and
0:40:36 the flesh called to itself right and
0:40:39 there were plans somebody had plans and
0:40:41 Ne like screws up his face like he can't
0:40:42 quite remember some of the details
0:40:45 somebody had plans to to to shunt this
0:40:48 thing into into the spirit realm or the
0:40:51 shadowlands or something but what they
0:40:53 don't
0:40:54 know is that it's also according to wi
0:40:58 uh it's corrupting the shadowlands too
0:41:00 it's it's it's burning every layer of
0:41:03 reality that we can see so just kicking
0:41:06 it off into another realm isn't going to
0:41:07 help any either it's it's not going to
0:41:09 solve the problem how do you solve the
0:41:11 problem I don't know but it's it's
0:41:13 coming and how many of them are coming
0:41:16 one already came and died presumably we
0:41:20 all saw that and another one Herold
0:41:24 arrived and another one is rising and I
0:41:26 saw it rise and where does it
0:41:30 stop and while we're all running
0:41:32 around playing the games and and
0:41:36 participating in the
0:41:38 Jihad for me it feels like the Jihad
0:41:42 is coming to a
0:41:45 close but personally I don't think it's
0:41:47 going to matter
0:41:49 anymore and where do we go from here I
0:41:51 don't know I'm
0:41:53 just I'm just
0:41:56 me
0:41:57 but I just since we're all here talking
0:42:01 about it I guess it's nice at least from
0:42:03 where I'm sitting to know that other
0:42:05 people can at least see some of it
0:42:08 too William buildmore speaks
0:42:11 up for some time now I've been delving
0:42:14 into a
0:42:16 conspiracy it is one that is conducted
0:42:19 by its leader ambrina
0:42:21 Giovani and it
0:42:24 involves
0:42:26 occultists across multiple sector
0:42:30 lines
0:42:32 Andino
0:42:33 theia some of the more Elite members of
0:42:37 Kindred
0:42:39 Society seek to escape the Jihad the
0:42:43 ritual of the red sign
0:42:45 yes they are drawing
0:42:48 closer I am in
0:42:50 possession of access to one of the toms
0:42:55 that they seek so that they might
0:42:56 complete their
0:42:57 ritual they
0:42:59 know that something terrible has already
0:43:03 begun I
0:43:05 [Music]
0:43:06 have made
0:43:08 contact with one of the most
0:43:11 knowledgeable Kindred in the world
0:43:13 regarding what is
0:43:15 happening and I
0:43:18 believe that if there is anyone that can
0:43:21 convince Yan
0:43:23 petun of the
0:43:25 truth it is them
0:43:28 unfortunately this
0:43:31 entity has made complicated political
0:43:35 choices for the past thousand
0:43:39 years and they are at
0:43:43 odds we shall say with the camaria
0:43:47 status
0:43:49 quo I
0:43:52 believe I
0:43:54 believe that as these Kindred flee by
0:43:59 way of the red
0:44:00 sign
0:44:02 as the conflicts on both coasts of the
0:44:06 United States
0:44:08 reach the point of no
0:44:13 return our masquerade will soon fail
0:44:17 us and there is no camaria without the
0:44:22 Masquerade we must look to the Future
0:44:28 and
0:44:29 respectfully he turns to
0:44:32 Johnny there is only one clan willing to
0:44:35 do
0:44:36 that Neil actually nods we must make
0:44:41 arrangements for
0:44:44 unbun and the angel of Cain to
0:44:48 meet saat Lord
0:44:51 Johnny three
0:44:53 successes oh everyone knows who the
0:44:55 angel of cane is
0:44:57 but among the Camara they don't quite go
0:45:00 by that glorious title the camria simply
0:45:03 refers to them by their chosen
0:45:05 name Sasha
0:45:08 Vos wait I'm I'm sorry back it up you
0:45:12 want Yan Peter zo to meet Sasha Vykos
0:45:15 Neil looks over like wait what the [ __ ]
0:45:18 dashwood is looking at billm like uh
0:45:21 what is the plan what are you doing here
0:45:24 Will and billmore Ashes a cigarette like
0:45:27 right on the
0:45:28 rug
0:45:30 yes that would be uh very aute to you
0:45:35 well what's that going to
0:45:36 accomplish they need to have met and
0:45:39 they need to know that one another
0:45:42 exists they need to be in the Forefront
0:45:44 of one another's
0:45:45 Minds because when events push them they
0:45:49 must be pushed towards each
0:45:51 other they're I mean they're they're
0:45:56 both there in New
0:45:59 York when I saw them anyways or I think
0:46:02 so I don't know if I was actually seeing
0:46:04 through the vios but it
0:46:06 it seemed like it that was my takeaway
0:46:09 that was my I mean I I jumping to
0:46:12 conclusions what well in this moment
0:46:16 there are other members of the clan who
0:46:18 are aware of what it is you speak of
0:46:21 Neil but none of us and I mean none of
0:46:24 us have quite the insight you do on this
0:46:28 matter at this moment
0:46:30 so I ask of
0:46:33 you what is the one thing that the
0:46:37 children of malov can
0:46:39 do to salvage this
0:46:43 situation ask
0:46:45 it and we will make every effort to make
0:46:49 it
0:46:50 reality
0:46:51 and I think you're aware of how
0:46:55 malleable reality can be
0:47:02 the door clicks shut as you Peter zoon
0:47:05 slips off into the night when slips back
0:47:08 into the bathroom you can't just go into
0:47:10 the bathroom again I can because you
0:47:13 can't make eye contact with me if I'm in
0:47:15 the
0:47:17 bathroom what is this going to
0:47:20 help miles what is the
0:47:24 point well the end goal
0:47:28 which end goal of me coming out of this
0:47:32 bathroom and you you took off your
0:47:34 jacket you're planning to do
0:47:36 something yes so talk to me first uh I
0:47:41 probably can't based on what's going on
0:47:43 with
0:47:44 you not
0:47:46 inaccurate so I'm going to need you to
0:47:48 come out here and let me try and if that
0:47:52 fails we will try something else and if
0:47:56 you [ __ ] around with this then more and
0:47:59 more of us get Dragged In we're all
0:48:02 dragged
0:48:03 in this gives us
0:48:05 options
0:48:08 miles I am being
0:48:11 punished you are being punished I would
0:48:14 rather it stayed with just the two of us
0:48:18 I'm pretty sure that's a punishment to
0:48:20 all of us and I don't necessarily
0:48:23 know they don't necessarily think they
0:48:25 are punishing you
0:48:27 though I don't
0:48:29 know what your first job is when kind of
0:48:34 lets her head Bonk Back Against The Wall
0:48:37 are you just going to look at what they
0:48:39 did what are you doing I can't really
0:48:43 tell
0:48:44 you if someone else in our
0:48:48 family is hurt because of this that's on
0:48:52 you all
0:48:54 right and she comes out of the bathroom
0:48:58 room he's looking at her she is kind of
0:49:02 purposefully not making eye contact yet
0:49:05 I don't even know if I can I don't even
0:49:08 know what you're doing I know but you
0:49:11 are going to have to listen to me and
0:49:14 you're going to have to meet my eyes you
0:49:16 don't have to but it does make it easier
0:49:19 when he says that wind's stress instinct
0:49:23 which is becoming more and more apparent
0:49:26 as
0:49:27 to why she no longer has hair on the
0:49:29 sides of her head is to grip and squeeze
0:49:34 at the sides of her head and just pull
0:49:37 her hair miles looks on as
0:49:40 undecided this is an interesting
0:49:44 predicament and he has ways to deal with
0:49:47 it but he doesn't know how it's going to
0:49:50 go all right when I'm going to pass on
0:49:52 this for
0:49:54 now but I haven't St sto and I have some
0:49:58 thoughts but nothing I can do here she
0:50:01 closes her eyes and
0:50:03 nods but it will be
0:50:06 soon miles I don't even know what I can
0:50:09 say to you I know I've been there when
0:50:13 just kind of starts taking off her
0:50:16 shirt and is in her tank top takes off
0:50:20 her pants and crawls into her side of
0:50:22 the bed miles has a flat look like okay
0:50:28 vampires
0:50:32 okay and
0:50:34 she she crawls up and like cocoons
0:50:37 herself in blankets like like she would
0:50:40 so much rather be buried in dirt right
0:50:42 now like just the Earth reassuring her
0:50:46 that everything would be okay he's going
0:50:48 to take the new sword lay down flat in
0:50:52 the bed and hold it over his
0:50:55 chest
0:50:57 TW while he waits for the sun to take
0:51:00 over did you bring the sword into bed
0:51:03 yeah I don't want to take it there's
0:51:05 ghouls all over this place weirdo says
0:51:08 you it's how I
0:51:11 know great Tim as the day takes you you
0:51:16 feel a shifting of the blade as pieces
0:51:20 of its the metal drive itself into your
0:51:24 flesh and drink from you your sword will
0:51:29 drink and store three traits of blood
0:51:32 and become one step blood Bound to
0:51:38 You Neil freezes for a minute sort of
0:51:41 under the weight of everything that's
0:51:44 being talked about everything that's
0:51:45 being offered just absolutely freezes up
0:51:48 and he starts mumbling to himself for a
0:51:50 second in the way that he does sometimes
0:51:52 when he's just trying to work something
0:51:53 out in his
0:51:54 head say like Okay um
0:51:57 I need to think I need I need time to
0:51:58 think I need um it's uh okay this the
0:52:02 ritual the red sign I mean can can that
0:52:05 is that even possible is it would can
0:52:08 that even work he's like looking over a
0:52:10 builtmore and and nicks in particular NX
0:52:13 actually speaks up at that according to
0:52:15 ancient texts into the final
0:52:18 nights as the world takes its steps
0:52:22 towards the rise of the last
0:52:24 City it is s that the power of Cain's
0:52:27 curse will wne I believe they mean to
0:52:31 use this
0:52:33 ritual once it no longer has the power
0:52:35 it once
0:52:37 held and then perhaps nearly anything is
0:52:41 possible what even is what even is the
0:52:43 ritual like slain is is is is doing
0:52:47 things with demons and and there's other
0:52:49 Realms and and what like it is a
0:52:51 violation of the will of the almighty it
0:52:54 is the act of throwing off the curse of
0:52:57 Cain to take one who is
0:53:00 Kindred and restore their mortality to
0:53:04 be human raises even more questions
0:53:09 I presumably this isn't for everyone
0:53:11 this would be a few a few and I mean who
0:53:17 am I to judge who are any of us to judge
0:53:19 but do they even deserve that even if
0:53:23 there is a way out does anyone do any of
0:53:24 us even deserve that I I
0:53:28 Nick says to you it is my place to watch
0:53:32 to observe and
0:53:34 monitor it is not my place to
0:53:37 interfere I cannot say whether or not
0:53:40 one deserves it or not don't
0:53:44 okay okay but what what we're talking
0:53:46 about here what we're proposing here is
0:53:48 undermining all of that stopping it
0:53:50 finding the
0:53:52 parts making sure it doesn't happen or
0:53:55 at least not the way they want it to not
0:53:56 to let the Giovani out not to let the
0:53:58 trir out not to everybody goes down with
0:54:01 the ship wait I'm I'm sorry so this
0:54:05 ritual of the red sign is going to take
0:54:08 away the curse of vampirism and make
0:54:09 somebody mortal again yes that's the
0:54:13 goal and the Giovani want to do this and
0:54:17 and the trir and for what end so that
0:54:20 they can die amidst of vampire Civil War
0:54:23 see that's what I'm saying the Giovani
0:54:25 and chamir involved
0:54:27 were not strictly human as we understand
0:54:30 the concept before their Embrace they
0:54:32 were enlightened or the awakened
0:54:36 avatars some of them believe that by
0:54:38 becoming mortal again they can reattain
0:54:41 the height of the magic they once
0:54:44 wielded it's just it seems
0:54:47 so shortsighted so stupid like maybe
0:54:51 even if they could it's it's not just us
0:54:54 it's not just gehenna
0:54:56 it's it's everyone the the the lands of
0:55:00 the Dead are being destroyed the if the
0:55:02 dragon rises in the city okay great you
0:55:05 got made Mortal and now you're all dying
0:55:08 to Johnny's point in the middle of a
0:55:09 civil war around here but globally
0:55:12 things are bad human beings can see the
0:55:14 red star in the sky escaping one
0:55:16 apocalypse by jumping into another one
0:55:18 doesn't it's stupid it it
0:55:22 doesn't but
0:55:25 so so so uh we need to think about what
0:55:27 to
0:55:29 do you're right camaria is going away if
0:55:33 the Masquerade goes cam is gone and if
0:55:36 this thing rises in New York if the edge
0:55:38 of delians Rise masquerade is going away
0:55:41 it's already going away it's already
0:55:43 feels weaker than it's been in my
0:55:45 lifetime short as it
0:55:47 is
0:55:49 um so but there's a road map there's a
0:55:53 road map for what happens for Kindred
0:55:55 outside the camera at least a little bit
0:55:57 Xavier and the Gang roll did the entire
0:55:59 thing this ritual the red
0:56:02 sign can that be applied to any
0:56:07 Kindred William speaks up I don't know
0:56:10 if they even know the answer to that
0:56:11 question just yet cu the hell with
0:56:14 undoing the curse on any of us what if
0:56:16 we do the undo the curse on the [ __ ]
0:56:19 eldest Neil frowns at that like that had
0:56:22 not actually occurred to him zi stops
0:56:25 being a vampire what
0:56:28 then a good question but how what is
0:56:31 what even is the ritual like how do we
0:56:32 do it I I don't you're the magic
0:56:35 [ __ ] like looks around the room no
0:56:38 that's not well we bu more shugs I am no
0:56:41 magician all right wizard then I don't
0:56:44 care what word you use no it's that's
0:56:46 Neil looks around at everybody kind of
0:56:49 stops at Nicks like maybe but no we
0:56:51 don't do that just Johnny that's um okay
0:56:57 all right uh so there are some people
0:57:00 who maybe maybe would deserve it but
0:57:01 that that goes back to my original Point
0:57:04 what do we need to either find out how
0:57:06 to supersede it or take it or stop it
0:57:09 how do we well that's what I'm saying
0:57:12 look I I I'm sure all of us in one
0:57:15 degree or another would love to be human
0:57:16 again I don't know if any of us deserve
0:57:19 that I don't know if it's possible but
0:57:21 if this ritual can do something like
0:57:24 that can we undo do an anti- deluvian I
0:57:28 don't know but we'd have to find out and
0:57:30 and the person who was Central to
0:57:32 finding a lot of this out was
0:57:34 wi all right well isn't this crew asking
0:57:36 you if they can do something to find out
0:57:38 for you so it's a little bit more than
0:57:44 that when was the one who was reached
0:57:46 out to the G by by the Giovani to to do
0:57:49 things to
0:57:50 work there
0:57:52 are I don't know if she knows anybody in
0:57:55 the TR who was doing anything like this
0:57:56 or was close to anybody there she's the
0:57:58 one who was looking for the books one of
0:58:00 which one of which Elder builtmore has
0:58:03 apparently uh from Amaya the one from he
0:58:06 gives a nod yeah uh there's a reason
0:58:10 that slain in everyone approached win as
0:58:14 far as all this concerned I I don't know
0:58:16 why and I don't know how I can't always
0:58:18 put the pieces together but sometimes I
0:58:19 have a box full of pieces
0:58:22 and
0:58:24 but but I
0:58:29 trying to escape I I don't know but I
0:58:32 know what I want I know what I want us
0:58:34 to try and do if we can leverage it if
0:58:35 we can make it work if we can make it
0:58:37 happen cuz what we need what we actually
0:58:40 need if we need Peter zoon and Vios to
0:58:42 talk to each other if we need everybody
0:58:44 to to look at a larger picture rather
0:58:46 than their own Jihad serving
0:58:49 self-interests
0:58:51 if I can feel myself getting more
0:58:56 detached all the time I don't feel like
0:59:00 myself and tomorrow night maybe I'll
0:59:01 feel less and less until I don't care
0:59:03 and I'm just looking for my own way out
0:59:04 and [ __ ] the rest of everybody too but
0:59:06 for now trying to look for the future
0:59:08 the person who put me back on the right
0:59:11 path and the person who knows more about
0:59:12 things and is is the central to all of
0:59:15 this is win and I don't know if we as a
0:59:17 clan work to I don't know give her the
0:59:21 tools required to figure things out to
0:59:24 enact things but right now she's a tool
0:59:26 herself she's soon to be a permanent
0:59:28 tool of Luc
0:59:31 sind and and even before that she was
0:59:35 manipulated and and the Giovani or
0:59:39 whoever were holding things that she
0:59:42 needed and wanted like Joey over her
0:59:44 head and what I want what I really think
0:59:47 we need to do is just have when with us
0:59:51 with her strings
0:59:52 cut all of them so that she can do what
0:59:55 she needs to do without having to worry
0:59:56 about Joey without having to worry about
0:59:59 I mean we can take care of ourselves
1:00:01 without being a puppet of a jar who's
1:00:04 not going to let her go because if
1:00:06 you're right we do need know more about
1:00:08 this than the rest of you know we're
1:00:11 tied into it and and in ways that I
1:00:13 really really wish we weren't but for
1:00:17 now all I've wanted the whole time if
1:00:20 it's the end of the world is to die to
1:00:23 face it with everybody else and I don't
1:00:25 want her going and Johnny I don't want
1:00:26 you going away and I I can already feel
1:00:29 myself slipping away I I
1:00:31 just I don't know I I don't have any
1:00:34 more coherent thoughts than any of that
1:00:35 I just it is answer
1:00:37 enough Williams says he stands up he
1:00:42 heads for the door and opens it and with
1:00:44 a tilt of a head he gestures to the
1:00:45 other
1:00:46 mavian that will
1:00:48 do
1:00:50 um I don't know how to addend one of
1:00:53 these thank you all for coming
1:00:57 they kind of give you like a little
1:00:59 awkward nod and they head out they shut
1:01:02 the door and it is dead [ __ ] quiet in
1:01:04 the
1:01:05 room Neil looks around sees if like any
1:01:09 astral projections are lingering it's
1:01:12 just you and Johnny being honest Neil
1:01:15 always looks like he's about to cry or
1:01:16 on the F of panic attack but like he's
1:01:19 if he needed to breathe he would be
1:01:20 hyperventilating right now and he walks
1:01:23 over to the pillow on the far FR side
1:01:26 from the door the one near the bed and
1:01:29 just uses a Fang and rips it open and
1:01:31 starts pulling out feathers and it's
1:01:34 like Johnny I uh do you have do you have
1:01:35 your lighter do you have Johnny uh holds
1:01:38 his bow out in a
1:01:40 hand
1:01:42 um I need there's no ashtray or anything
1:01:44 Jesus I I need and he goes over to like
1:01:47 like a like a vase or something dumps
1:01:49 [ __ ] Roman ped Dragon flowers out
1:01:51 puts the FL uh feathers in there can you
1:01:54 I need can you burn these can you
1:01:56 I'm I'm worried I'm gonna freak out I
1:01:57 just can you can you burn all this
1:01:59 please Johnny who's kind of just sitting
1:02:01 on the couch still looking quizzically
1:02:05 at the room that had was previously full
1:02:08 of mavens and kind of now unsure about
1:02:10 what the hell's going on with all of
1:02:12 these feathers and this vase the flowers
1:02:14 on the floor stands up walks over looks
1:02:18 down at the uh the feathers in the vase
1:02:23 it doesn't matter I just need them ashes
1:02:25 but I'm not in a great mindset right now
1:02:29 to face a potful of fire uh Johnny will
1:02:35 light some of the feathers on fire and
1:02:38 drop them into the vase still like not
1:02:41 really able to get a hold of himself
1:02:44 100% Neil starts to try and like quiet
1:02:47 his mind down a little bit after all
1:02:49 that starts going through the motions of
1:02:54 ritually prepar pring the room like a
1:02:57 paranoid mavian so that if anybody tries
1:03:00 to get him while he's sleeping he will
1:03:03 wake with evening's freshness okay and
1:03:07 looks over at Johnny and goes I think um
1:03:10 do you want to take the bed or do you
1:03:11 want me to what the hell was all this oh
1:03:15 we're going to talk about it now
1:03:17 um I don't know I didn't call them
1:03:21 billmore did but he couldn't admit that
1:03:25 he did
1:03:26 so he said I did it because I'm a known
1:03:29 and is that what passes for your clan as
1:03:32 a uh a rave they're
1:03:35 impromptu you feel the pull sometimes
1:03:38 you hear it in the radio see it on TV
1:03:41 sometimes if an Elder's around they just
1:03:43 put out a call and everyone is expected
1:03:46 to show up you'll just awkwardly find a
1:03:50 room and jabber at each other for 20
1:03:53 minutes not always sometimes sometimes
1:03:55 uh sometimes we pretend to do what the
1:03:57 other clans do did one on a rooftop once
1:04:01 fair
1:04:03 enough you think this is actually going
1:04:05 to help anything I don't
1:04:07 know I don't know I think I think there
1:04:11 are people who believe at least that the
1:04:13 ritual of the red sign could work using
1:04:16 against an antiel lubian I don't know
1:04:18 what the [ __ ] that would do what strings
1:04:19 are you worried about on when the
1:04:22 justicar is blood bonding her
1:04:26 completely wi will not be win within two
1:04:29 nights she'll be an archon and even
1:04:32 though she'll still be
1:04:33 win from now until the end of gehna we
1:04:38 won't be able to talk freely around her
1:04:41 who will never be able to trust her the
1:04:42 same
1:04:43 way I will but we won't be able to not
1:04:47 publicly not like that she's already
1:04:50 gotten in her head is going to make her
1:04:53 kill one of us those are a lot of but
1:04:56 the other ones back that up she's going
1:04:58 to what yeah lucenda is making her kill
1:05:02 one of us how do you know that I
1:05:06 know I I'd love to be more specific but
1:05:08 this is no that's good good enough for
1:05:10 me I don't know who I don't know when I
1:05:12 don't know how or why I could I could
1:05:15 put a guess out for why she would make
1:05:16 it any one of us and then we could do a
1:05:18 tier list but like probably miles me's
1:05:23 number
1:05:24 one Ventrue are generally speaking all
1:05:27 The Ventrue care about yeah I don't
1:05:30 think they go through this much plot to
1:05:31 kill any other any of the rest of us no
1:05:33 I think they had opportunity to easily
1:05:35 kill the rest of us and they just
1:05:40 didn't but
1:05:42 miles and here I thought miles was just
1:05:44 getting off with a slap on the wrist
1:05:47 [ __ ] stupid of
1:05:49 me privilege is bought on the bodies of
1:05:52 people who protect
1:05:53 you but when people stop protecting
1:05:57 you all right let me help you out with
1:06:00 the rest of this what else can I do so
1:06:02 you can perform your ritual this is
1:06:04 it it's it's pretty simple I just don't
1:06:08 have any of my things on me the way that
1:06:10 I would want so I had to make
1:06:14 do I guess I owe Prince Pendragon a
1:06:17 pillow no you
1:06:19 don't
1:06:24 okay
1:06:26 PR you
1:06:28 are brought to your room much
1:06:32 earlier
1:06:33 than the other Kindred of your
1:06:36 quartery when you arrive to the room you
1:06:39 recognize it
1:06:40 immediately it was the same one you were
1:06:43 held
1:06:44 in when you were held captive by the
1:06:47 prince of
1:06:48 Hartford where he escorts you in and
1:06:51 there is a dress that Waits For
1:06:53 You the large tub in the bathroom is
1:06:56 already running waiting for
1:06:59 you and she turns to you and
1:07:04 says remove your
1:07:06 garments take a
1:07:08 bath once you're ready I'll put you in
1:07:10 the dress arrange your makeup and ensure
1:07:14 that you are properly prepared to meet
1:07:16 with his
1:07:18 grace he has indicated there is some
1:07:21 unfinished conversation between you two
1:07:23 she says as as derisively as
1:07:27 possible walking back into this room
1:07:31 there's this shudder as the feeling of
1:07:34 what it felt like to come here before
1:07:36 Falls over Britta for a moment that's
1:07:39 all she feels and it makes her feel
1:07:44 small and out of
1:07:46 control but then the present catches
1:07:49 up
1:07:51 and she hears Maria she clearly
1:07:55 understands the tone she knows what
1:07:58 Maria would want to do but she just
1:08:02 chooses to notd walk into the bathroom
1:08:04 and close the door as you make your way
1:08:08 to the
1:08:09 bathroom the door to your room opens and
1:08:13 shuts again with a
1:08:15 click as Roman Pendragon
1:08:19 enters R looks over her shoulder feeling
1:08:22 a little confused by that she pauses by
1:08:24 the bathroom door looking between the
1:08:26 two Maria he says and she looks up at
1:08:30 him quick and hopeful and he gestures
1:08:33 out the door
1:08:35 go she looks back at you once the
1:08:38 resentment you've seen in her eyes more
1:08:40 crystal clear than ever
1:08:42 before but she
1:08:45 obeys her dominer
1:08:47 will and she
1:08:50 leaves clear sympathy in br's eyes that
1:08:54 she doesn't really let come across her
1:08:57 expression the same until Maria's back
1:08:58 is turned and she's
1:09:00 leaving questions this doesn't line up
1:09:04 with the plan is presented the Curiosity
1:09:06 that's visible in Brea shows further as
1:09:09 she looks over to Pendragon taking a few
1:09:12 steps
1:09:13 closer I have just finished something of
1:09:16 a negotiation with the vent
1:09:20 justar we have come
1:09:22 to an understanding regarding yourself
1:09:25 and your
1:09:27 quartery she has asked that
1:09:30 I stand
1:09:33 aside should she need
1:09:36 to
1:09:39 address
1:09:41 past instances of
1:09:45 misbehavior in exchange for me standing
1:09:47 aside while she issues her corrective
1:09:51 measures I have arranged for your
1:09:54 exemption
1:09:56 he pauses a
1:09:58 moment do not return to New
1:10:02 Haven let your quartery defend the city
1:10:04 without
1:10:06 you I can't do
1:10:09 that I can't abandon them I I won't
1:10:13 abandon
1:10:14 them I will send 10 Kindred more
1:10:17 experienc than you in your
1:10:19 place if you're simply worried about
1:10:21 them getting the help that they
1:10:24 need but but New Haven is a grave and it
1:10:27 will bury everyone who goes to
1:10:31 it if New Haven's a grave then I I can't
1:10:34 let them go
1:10:40 alone there is time to discuss it I want
1:10:44 you to understand
1:10:46 that what was agreed upon is a gift to
1:10:51 you a chance to create a un life for
1:10:54 yourself
1:10:57 but that gift doesn't mean anything if
1:10:58 you go off to New Haven and
1:11:01 die thank you for trying to protect
1:11:05 me I don't see a version of this where I
1:11:09 don't stay with my family especially if
1:11:12 I know that they're going to
1:11:13 Danger you've called me a soldier in the
1:11:17 past for them I would
1:11:21 fight and if it becomes the preference
1:11:24 of your prince that you stay with me R
1:11:27 looks
1:11:28 confused she's assessing Pendragon for
1:11:31 whether that seems like legitimate
1:11:34 possibility I don't suppose there's any
1:11:36 like hint in his demeanor about that
1:11:39 tell me would you try I would like to
1:11:41 rathy
1:11:42 villains sure go for
1:11:46 it difficulty
1:11:48 eat six
1:11:50 successes with six
1:11:53 successes he is
1:11:56 pretty willing to force The Ventrue to
1:11:59 capitulate here and thinks he
1:12:03 can and the thing that stands out to you
1:12:07 the most is that his hand his thumb kind
1:12:12 of traces along his index and middle
1:12:15 finger and you notice very subtly hint
1:12:20 of Ash and blood under his fingernails
1:12:24 he killed someone tonight he killed
1:12:27 someone 10 minutes ago and he did it as
1:12:32 a favor to the
1:12:34 vent the shock of that Revelation BR is
1:12:37 not able to hide that and she finds
1:12:41 herself slowly reaching out to take hold
1:12:44 of his wrists and look at the ash under
1:12:46 his nails he lets you you kind of take
1:12:50 this hand it's not like soft like what
1:12:54 you would expect from someone who was
1:12:56 like once a noble there's definitely
1:12:59 calluses like cracks to the cuticles of
1:13:01 his
1:13:02 nails his he's definitely someone who
1:13:05 died in the field when he was embraced
1:13:09 and he seems to recognize that you are
1:13:13 taking his hand by the wrist because you
1:13:18 can see that he's probably killed
1:13:20 someone not 10 minutes ago it's that
1:13:23 feeling like you're holding a breath
1:13:26 she knows she isn't but there's that
1:13:28 tension and her mind is racing it is
1:13:32 perhaps not the
1:13:34 kindness that you
1:13:38 want but it is a gesture for your
1:13:42 sake and one that I do believe has
1:13:45 earned you your
1:13:48 freedom your
1:13:52 friends when is gone soon to be a blank
1:13:55 slate in service to the
1:13:58 Ventrue miles and Johnny are
1:14:02 dust Kindred who fought and died
1:14:06 needlessly on a battlefield that did not
1:14:09 need to happen but they are as good as
1:14:12 gone and Neil never mattered at
1:14:16 all so I cling on to
1:14:19 them they couldn't free
1:14:23 you I did
1:14:27 PR swallows down emotion but it's
1:14:30 showing in her eyes as she looks up at
1:14:32 him and she steps closer pulling his
1:14:36 hand to her to lay it so that it would
1:14:40 fall on a top of her heart and she looks
1:14:42 at him and says they matter to
1:14:46 me they
1:14:48 too and none of them are gone until
1:14:52 until they're
1:14:54 gone and I'm not going to give up on
1:14:57 them so please please
1:15:01 don't I don't give up on people that
1:15:05 easily he
1:15:07 looks
1:15:10 frustrated you will not have this
1:15:12 opportunity
1:15:15 again surely you know
1:15:19 that I
1:15:21 was given a blank slate once
1:15:26 not the way I wanted at least the
1:15:29 version of me that the memories that I
1:15:32 have
1:15:35 and ever since I've wanted to get back
1:15:39 what I don't even
1:15:41 remember and every Discovery I've made
1:15:44 it it's hurt and often put me in more
1:15:49 trouble but they were there with it but
1:15:53 they were there with me through it all
1:15:57 they have protected
1:16:00 me you've done something to protect me
1:16:04 and to give me another chance
1:16:06 and and thank
1:16:10 you there's fear when she says that but
1:16:13 it's not insincere there is a battle in
1:16:18 she definitely wants to ask who was it
1:16:20 she definitely wants to push back but
1:16:24 there's also so that sensation of it has
1:16:27 happened and she knows why and that
1:16:32 is a strange Battle of different parts
1:16:35 of
1:16:37 her please don't make
1:16:40 miles face all of that alone I I want to
1:16:44 be there with my Cod if they have to be
1:16:47 there you may not get everything you
1:16:49 want but I will make sure he does not
1:16:53 face the sabat
1:16:59 alone hard estad agreed to my
1:17:04 wishes theara's restrictions on the
1:17:08 amaranth are
1:17:10 lifted within the city of New
1:17:13 York miles will have everything he
1:17:18 wanted the
1:17:19 Sabbat will
1:17:23 lose but you don't have to be there when
1:17:26 it happens you don't have to be in New
1:17:31 Haven don't do
1:17:38 this you agreed to fight too you
1:17:42 know your armies to put your resources
1:17:45 at
1:17:46 risk yes I
1:17:51 didn't I I can't I can't leave leave
1:17:55 them to die not if there's anything I
1:17:58 could have done about it but there is
1:18:01 not my sire will find
1:18:03 you she will destroy you and she will
1:18:08 use your Ashes to demoralize everyone
1:18:11 who cares for
1:18:13 you do not
1:18:20 go
1:18:22 please he looks like
1:18:25 really torn saying that it is not a word
1:18:28 he's used to BR briefly does not
1:18:31 understand English because that's
1:18:35 not it doesn't sound like it could
1:18:38 possibly be a word use in the
1:18:39 circumstance so like it's that blindness
1:18:43 to meaning where she's trying to sort
1:18:44 out what that arrangement of letters
1:18:46 could
1:18:48 be once she processes she seems Frozen
1:18:52 for a few
1:18:53 moments
1:18:56 Brea takes his hand the same hand that
1:18:59 she's brought close to
1:19:02 herself she brings it up to her jaw
1:19:06 right near her neck so that he could do
1:19:09 whatever he wanted to do as she gives
1:19:14 her rejection and she
1:19:18 says I need to be there for my
1:19:22 Cod I don't know if
1:19:25 with everything that's
1:19:27 happening that there is anywhere that's
1:19:32 safe and
1:19:34 it's
1:19:36 strange that after
1:19:39 everything I get to
1:19:42 feel a little break to be safe for a
1:19:46 little
1:19:48 while I want to spend that time with you
1:19:51 before it all gets to danger again
1:19:55 her
1:19:56 Disobedience Sparks this like slight
1:20:01 look of Fury and those like those cold
1:20:05 blue eyes that he
1:20:07 has and she can feel his fingers
1:20:12 instinctively start to tighten around
1:20:15 her
1:20:16 neck but before he reaches the point
1:20:19 where he's really about to hurt her out
1:20:23 of his anger he tempers
1:20:26 it and he
1:20:28 says on every
1:20:31 occasion that our paths have
1:20:34 crossed
1:20:36 politics war and
1:20:39 secrets have interrupted
1:20:44 us what if just this
1:20:46 once we don't let
1:20:50 them I think I'd really like that but
1:20:54 this kind of cool confident
1:20:59 motion he guides brda into the room that
1:21:03 is just starting to
1:21:05 have water overflow the tub and he shuts
