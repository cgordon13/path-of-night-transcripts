0:01:13 [Music]
0:01:20 last time on path of night Britta Neil
0:01:23 Fester Pendragon and his allies arrived
0:01:26 to a hotel to further evade threat
0:01:28 separated kneel and fester talked
0:01:31 feelings before Neil sire arrived Britta
0:01:34 followed Pendragon into their shared
0:01:36 room miles held his cordless Prince and
0:01:39 assigns positions of importance there
0:01:41 miles and Johnny crushed and attempted
0:01:43 Praxis seizure Johnny's daughter called
0:01:46 in his aide and the Brujah went off to
0:01:48 help the hunters or the werewolf problem
0:01:49 the wind quarreled with the Specter Mr
0:01:52 Perfect an exerted necromantic power to
0:01:54 cause him to find a ferryman to help The
0:01:56 Wraith Joey all the while strange events
0:01:59 around the world began to escalate
0:02:02 [Music]
0:02:09 so
0:02:11 you um
0:02:13 you're here
0:02:15 I'm here in this moment I
0:02:18 it was you
0:02:20 it was it was it was you
0:02:23 in New Haven it was you in Boston
0:02:26 it was you in New York
0:02:27 wasn't it
0:02:29 he Nance
0:02:30 of course child Neil is simultaneously
0:02:35 terrified and relieved
0:02:39 and had somewhere inside happy to see
0:02:42 this man
0:02:44 and
0:02:45 somehow kill ridden at like
0:02:49 disappointing him but also it's like
0:02:51 when it's like when an abusive parent
0:02:53 comes home and you want to make them
0:02:55 happy but you're just internally you are
0:02:58 gripped with Terror at what they might
0:03:00 do
0:03:01 I am
0:03:03 what
0:03:05 why
0:03:08 what happened where you've been gone for
0:03:11 so long
0:03:13 why
0:03:15 you laughed
0:03:18 knew I've learned so much but you ask
0:03:21 the wrong questions
0:03:24 he kneels down and picks up the broken
0:03:27 pieces the mug Left Behind from Fester's
0:03:29 rod truck what you should be asking
0:03:32 is why has the herald come
0:03:35 why have you seen the three murisatva
0:03:39 who make war
0:03:40 what is it that Reigns of the Skies of
0:03:43 Sri Lanka
0:03:45 there is a red star in the sky
0:03:48 it is
0:03:51 it's the end of everything it's coming
0:03:54 Dad it is the end of what the world is a
0:03:57 fragile thing
0:03:59 but it is not so
0:04:02 finite
0:04:04 it is
0:04:05 a Herald of change
0:04:08 you have seen
0:04:10 this change you know that it comes
0:04:14 why fear it why speak of it as though it
0:04:18 is
0:04:19 some symbol of a great wrongdoing that
0:04:22 comes when the world is this unjust
0:04:24 broken mess
0:04:27 I
0:04:29 we have to
0:04:32 there's gonna be a way to fix it or to
0:04:35 to help those who deserve help or you
0:04:39 worry about fixing the solution
0:04:41 gehenna is the death of sin
0:04:45 the Redemption of Cain
0:04:47 the Vengeance of Hakeem
0:04:49 it is the end times yes
0:04:54 at the end of what
0:04:56 is the end of
0:04:59 the Gate of Cain yes right it's it's the
0:05:03 end of Empires is that so unfair
0:05:06 so wrong and these Immortal things will
0:05:09 not indeed last forever
0:05:12 but I
0:05:15 I've been pretending like it doesn't
0:05:17 bother me like I know it's the end times
0:05:19 in so long as we are with the people we
0:05:22 care about then we can weather the end
0:05:25 foreign
0:05:27 I'm scared I am
0:05:30 pretending not to be but I
0:05:33 have the Hakeem comes if they rise if
0:05:37 this is the end
0:05:40 what are we to do with our final nights
0:05:43 I have taught you to be a shipu a master
0:05:46 of Heaven and Earth
0:05:48 what does it matter
0:05:51 what do you worry about for the final
0:05:52 nights why worry about anything
0:05:57 seek Oneness
0:05:59 purify yourself
0:06:01 and when hakeem's judgment comes
0:06:05 embrace it
0:06:08 huh
0:06:11 this is it this is the end but
0:06:15 if that's what this is why why travel
0:06:18 halfway across the world just to I don't
0:06:23 know
0:06:25 I worry about other trivial things
0:06:28 the truth is this
0:06:32 awakened
0:06:34 The Herald of Hakeem sits beside the
0:06:37 throne and waits for akim's return
0:06:41 and in the meantime
0:06:43 all contracts are terminated
0:06:46 all promises for mercy
0:06:49 are unwoven
0:06:52 even the curse set forth by the tramir
0:06:55 it's gone it's better fly in the
0:06:57 presence of a God that's why race ran
0:06:59 off that's why yeah yes okay
0:07:02 how is Reiss
0:07:04 does he remember me
0:07:06 when the domain thought that I was you
0:07:09 there was
0:07:12 Terror
0:07:13 race is stoic but I
0:07:16 I think there's a reason
0:07:19 I don't know
0:07:21 I'm gonna guess he remembers you yeah
0:07:23 yes yes yes he and it gives him
0:07:26 satisfaction to know that he feared you
0:07:28 as he fears me
0:07:30 didn't
0:07:32 I
0:07:34 liked watching him be afraid and try and
0:07:38 hide it and he all feels guilt at that
0:07:42 feeling
0:07:43 but maybe not as much as he thinks he
0:07:46 should has begun war on the Unworthy
0:07:50 all of the get of Cain their heart's
0:07:54 blood
0:07:55 it is to be reclaimed
0:07:57 even those who have turned from alamon
0:08:00 are the fear of
0:08:02 Justice even they are not safe
0:08:06 excuse him yes a parting of ways
0:08:10 different okay yeah I I have come to
0:08:14 uplift you child
0:08:16 to give you the choice that was given to
0:08:19 me
0:08:20 you may be at the mercy of walls
0:08:23 or
0:08:25 you may choose Oneness
0:08:28 and begin the path of blood
0:08:33 I don't um
0:08:36 I
0:08:38 I burn faster why once you make me do
0:08:42 that if we're gonna reclaim if we were
0:08:44 gonna what was you the vested yourself
0:08:47 of weakness
0:08:49 the path of blood demands purity
0:08:51 Focus
0:08:53 needless distractions need to be burned
0:08:56 away
0:08:59 but you you made me it's not like
0:09:04 Ben dragon's guard in the bathroom
0:09:06 she awaits Justice
0:09:09 I I don't
0:09:11 I don't want to suffer my ties I don't
0:09:14 wanna
0:09:15 I
0:09:17 you think I didn't hear you
0:09:19 you are within conversational distance
0:09:22 yeah I said that did you not say
0:09:26 that before your little friend came
0:09:30 you arrest nothing
0:09:32 an object to be set aside are used
0:09:35 things are different now though they're
0:09:38 different for now
0:09:40 child but as you and I speak
0:09:44 Romans seeks his clones into your friend
0:09:49 and she craves it
0:09:51 she craves the opportunities for her own
0:09:54 life
0:09:55 to move on
0:09:57 and forget you
0:10:00 why shouldn't you make the same choice
0:10:03 you want to be seen as a person yet
0:10:06 refused to seize Destiny for yourself
0:10:11 I'm not
0:10:13 I'm not strong enough for this I I can't
0:10:16 I can't
0:10:20 following that path following that road
0:10:23 means
0:10:24 I abandoned others the way that you
0:10:26 abandoned me I I I can't do that to
0:10:29 someone else abandon you
0:10:32 his eyes narrow you left you I was alone
0:10:36 am I not here before you now while you
0:10:39 stand rejected by your so-called friend
0:10:45 your Quarry waits for you in the
0:10:47 bathroom
0:10:48 she waits to be judged
0:10:51 do it you will
0:10:53 I will find you again soon enough
0:10:55 there's no hiding from you and I expect
0:10:58 you'll be ready
0:11:00 in tones the power of the Hunter's wind
0:11:04 and vanishes
0:11:06 Neil as soon as he's gone just sits down
0:11:10 on the floor for a minute amidst the
0:11:12 broken glass
0:11:13 and just thanks
0:11:17 and then gets up
0:11:19 and looks into the bathroom
0:11:26 right now
0:11:28 your hand is on the door you feel the
0:11:31 overwhelming sensation the need
0:11:34 to present yourself before the prince of
0:11:37 Hartford
0:11:38 and slowly as if your hand was acting
0:11:43 without care for your will
0:11:46 the door is opened and you're hit with
0:11:50 the Steam and heat of the running shower
0:11:54 and you approach
0:11:56 as you enter you can see the
0:12:01 looming shape on the other side of the
0:12:05 shower curtain
0:12:07 and
0:12:09 you can kind of make out you know that
0:12:11 it's Roman his hair is down as you can
0:12:14 see kind of like the the shadow created
0:12:18 by his dark hair and in the room kind of
0:12:22 folded and tucked aside are the clothes
0:12:25 that he'd worn to the gala with you
0:12:29 and you see this shape turn
0:12:33 and you see it acknowledge your presence
0:12:36 and there's this brief moment of silence
0:12:39 and as he turns to acknowledge your
0:12:42 presence the hold that he has on your
0:12:45 heart what made you enter this space to
0:12:49 present yourself
0:12:51 is relinquished as Britta's mind Becomes
0:12:54 Her Own there's another
0:12:56 microsecond of a glance around the room
0:12:58 every thought that was squashed down by
0:13:02 the immediacy of the need to follow
0:13:04 through with the summoning anything like
0:13:07 well we're here hiding from being
0:13:10 tracked by the Vykos and just a quick
0:13:14 check for some kind of well danger
0:13:19 um but there's already a pretty readily
0:13:22 apparent empty room and
0:13:26 they're close
0:13:28 this is
0:13:29 I'm terrible with this what's the layout
0:13:31 of the room the room is small but one uh
0:13:37 the back end of it is a kind of a pretty
0:13:41 decently large shower space
0:13:44 um it's kind of like built into the wall
0:13:46 and has a curtain that obscures the
0:13:50 space Within is obviously you know the
0:13:52 toilet there's plenty of space there's
0:13:53 extra towels on shelves there's a sink a
0:13:58 big old mirror behind the sink where as
0:14:01 you kind of scan the room you you catch
0:14:03 your own reflection looking back at you
0:14:04 but beyond that it's very very simple
0:14:06 it's nice that like whoever you know put
0:14:09 this together it's good materials that
0:14:10 are used it's it's well maintained but
0:14:14 it is very much a
0:14:16 simple bathroom the kind that you would
0:14:18 expect in most hotel rooms it's a small
0:14:21 room but Britta finds herself being very
0:14:25 sure to keep track of the distance
0:14:28 I imagine she would have stopped pretty
0:14:30 close to the door
0:14:31 and
0:14:32 with the shower curtain obscuring things
0:14:37 she finds herself watching the shape
0:14:39 behind it there's not enough to get much
0:14:42 of a hint but she's knowing that there
0:14:45 is not much of a hint from her and
0:14:47 either
0:14:48 and
0:14:50 that space that feels if she were human
0:14:54 I think she would be hearing her
0:14:56 heartbeat on her own head but as it is
0:14:59 there's just the beating of the shower
0:15:02 uh down on the floor that that
0:15:05 it doesn't even really seem real for a
0:15:08 second between the Hop seam and
0:15:11 she is trying to parse the situation and
0:15:14 it is such a harsh transition
0:15:17 that she finds herself deer in
0:15:20 headlights
0:15:21 the
0:15:23 bathroom curtain moves
0:15:25 enough so that Roman is revealed
0:15:29 and he gives her this look that is akin
0:15:32 to that as that of a wolf who's cornered
0:15:35 a doe
0:15:36 and he holds a hand out and says to
0:15:40 Britta
0:15:42 assassin or no
0:15:45 I've decided that I want you
0:15:49 come in
0:15:54 looking into the bathroom you see one of
0:15:57 Roman pendragon's soldiers she is um
0:16:00 collapsed in the little tub shower space
0:16:04 and her body
0:16:07 visibly has these blackened veins as
0:16:11 though she has been poisoned with some
0:16:15 of the deadliest the Assamites have to
0:16:18 offer very we had a quick examination
0:16:21 you can see so you've actually
0:16:22 experienced this yourself her stamina
0:16:25 has been reduced to zero and she is in
0:16:27 torper
0:16:28 Neil
0:16:30 does not want to do this
0:16:33 and the parallels of the last time he
0:16:38 made a hard choice and killed someone in
0:16:39 a bathroom
0:16:41 actively is on his mind as he's looking
0:16:43 around
0:16:46 in the ages of honesty
0:16:47 there is a mechanical thing that has
0:16:49 never come up on Neil sheet
0:16:52 I don't know if it applies to this
0:16:53 situation because he left
0:16:55 but in order to deny my sigh or anything
0:16:57 I have to make a check it is the flaw
0:16:59 Old Flame for his sire someone you once
0:17:02 cared deeply for is now with the Enemy
0:17:04 he still attempts to plan your
0:17:05 sympathies for old time's sake while
0:17:07 working against you unless you succeed
0:17:09 on a contested manipulation plus
0:17:11 expression role against your former
0:17:12 friend you cannot act against him unless
0:17:14 the situation becomes life-threatening I
0:17:16 do not know if that applies or not but
0:17:18 the interest of Odyssey I wanted to put
0:17:19 it out there I will not be considering
0:17:21 it working against him
0:17:23 okay Neil
0:17:25 Waits
0:17:27 the sun is coming
0:17:30 he can't be in this room much longer no
0:17:32 matter what he does
0:17:33 because Pandora's gonna wake up and come
0:17:36 over and either find her dead or find
0:17:38 her attacked and half the room burned
0:17:40 down it does look pretty bad yeah it
0:17:43 looks this is not good
0:17:45 solid assessment
0:17:47 and so not
0:17:49 not knowing what to do
0:17:51 Neil I guess will fall back into old
0:17:54 habits
0:17:56 and he will run a new run
0:18:01 [Music]
0:18:02 Britta finds herself looking to his hand
0:18:05 before speedily looking back up to his
0:18:07 face already terrified that she's looked
0:18:10 that low
0:18:11 does it feel like an offer
0:18:14 what hints is she getting that it feels
0:18:18 like an offer role perception empathy
0:18:21 your Beast is perplexed because it
0:18:26 recoils and fright of this elder
0:18:31 but there's this curiosity that's
0:18:35 happening so I'm going to set your
0:18:36 difficulty to eight yep yep don't you
0:18:39 have a speck in villains for this it
0:18:41 might apply I don't know last time I
0:18:43 talked about it I got [ __ ] about it and
0:18:45 the specialty in villains applies
0:18:48 yeah of course we're gonna give you [ __ ]
0:18:50 about it as you should honestly I wish I
0:18:54 could spend a will power on on this but
0:18:56 I super can't I have
0:18:58 one left and I feel like I need to
0:19:01 treasure that in this moment
0:19:04 your call
0:19:09 two successes due to the remaining ton
0:19:11 your spec serves you well
0:19:14 I will tell you in two things that you
0:19:17 notice
0:19:18 the first is that the way Roman normally
0:19:21 dresses he presents himself as
0:19:24 Invincible but without clothing you can
0:19:27 see that of course the sky is muscular
0:19:30 and incredible shape has that ridiculous
0:19:33 V going on with his hips but he has
0:19:37 scars and you can kind of see make out
0:19:42 where he has been stabbed
0:19:44 shot burns from gunpowder he has
0:19:49 definitely
0:19:50 experienced defeat and is not this
0:19:54 impossible Unstoppable thing
0:19:57 but that can go one of two ways
0:20:01 the other thing you notice
0:20:03 is that the extended hand
0:20:07 and the way he is looking at you
0:20:11 you get the impression that he has drawn
0:20:16 these lines for himself
0:20:19 that he would offer you his company
0:20:23 but seems unwilling to Simply
0:20:26 seize control of you in the same way
0:20:29 that Upton did when he demanded you
0:20:31 drink his blood and all of the various
0:20:34 attempts of control that Rowlands had
0:20:37 leveraged on you
0:20:39 there is something about
0:20:41 Roman that demands your submission
0:20:45 but is unwilling to co-opt it
0:20:48 supernaturally when Britta gays glances
0:20:51 down to the offered hand then
0:20:55 and she starts taking stock of the
0:20:59 various hints in play
0:21:01 she finds that gays Landing towards some
0:21:05 of the scars especially the ones that
0:21:08 are more readily identifiable one and
0:21:12 then especially the ones that aren't
0:21:14 and
0:21:16 it's not that her hand comes up to meet
0:21:19 his but there's a twitch upwards
0:21:22 she doesn't cover it very well because
0:21:24 she's too focus on the question that she
0:21:28 can't help but to ask
0:21:30 I thought you told me to remember that
0:21:33 I'm your prisoner
0:21:37 and
0:21:39 there are many permutations to such a
0:21:42 relationship
0:21:43 and he reaches for her hand
0:21:46 brother dips her head down and holds her
0:21:50 hand closer to herself
0:21:53 she can't help but to look up at his
0:21:56 hand there's a shyness here what
0:21:59 an attempt at concealing a bite to the
0:22:02 lower lip and she says
0:22:05 I I'm
0:22:07 not not sure
0:22:09 um
0:22:11 I'm I'm confused
0:22:14 you were
0:22:17 just a few minutes ago you were
0:22:21 threatening to put me out into the sun
0:22:24 right and
0:22:27 I don't know if this is your way of
0:22:29 telling me to convince you
0:22:32 not to
0:22:34 this is my way of telling you to come in
0:22:37 once he has her hand you can kind of
0:22:40 feel the heat from like the hot water
0:22:41 that he's been in and he pulls her hand
0:22:44 so that she's sort of tugged that step
0:22:47 closer
0:22:48 and he rests her hand
0:22:51 against one of the scars that he noticed
0:22:54 her looking at in the summoning did I
0:22:56 manage to keep hold of the throw blanket
0:22:58 or is this complete vulnerability that
0:23:02 is entirely up to you then I imagine
0:23:04 that even if it's not able to be a
0:23:07 priority it doesn't exactly get in the
0:23:09 way of following the summoning to keep
0:23:10 one hand present told that Britta
0:23:13 doesn't actually fight him moving her
0:23:17 hand I was looking up to his eyes
0:23:19 looking down to the scar does actually
0:23:21 Trace fingertips across it trying to
0:23:24 understand it
0:23:26 from your mortal life
0:23:30 Kendrick do not scar
0:23:32 there's a nod but I was under that
0:23:35 impression but she wasn't really sure
0:23:37 especially with the various levels of
0:23:39 combat that she's not even aware of
0:23:42 if he seems open to it she'll
0:23:45 try and move her hand to another not
0:23:48 moving lower on his body very much
0:23:52 exploring the possibility but this is a
0:23:56 rough transition from toxic masculinity
0:23:59 to Toxic by Britney Spears and she's
0:24:01 just
0:24:02 trying to figure out where she's even at
0:24:04 with that you're Brittany so
0:24:13 that's not really a trust that I give
0:24:16 easily
0:24:18 and
0:24:21 I don't know what it would mean to you
0:24:23 I know it would
0:24:27 um
0:24:28 Britta at that moment has a sudden awful
0:24:31 realization and her cheeks go pink due
0:24:35 to the combination of her High Humanity
0:24:37 blush of Health blushing is something
0:24:40 that she unfortunately can do without
0:24:44 her own volition and as she's talking
0:24:47 leading down this trail of what these
0:24:50 possibilities would mean to her
0:24:52 um there's a few distinct hints as to
0:24:57 what her brain might have gone to a
0:24:59 flicker of confusion of questions
0:25:02 unanswered and of embarrassment so all
0:25:07 her Humanity gives her away he actually
0:25:10 smiles at her
0:25:12 it's a very disarming perhaps
0:25:15 well-practiced smile
0:25:16 but she can see his fangs
0:25:20 and with a bit of flair for drama he
0:25:22 starts to pull her into the shower
0:25:25 something about the fangs being shown to
0:25:27 her in this moment breaks her out of it
0:25:29 and she starts to shake her head and to
0:25:33 pull back he lets you go she pulls the
0:25:37 blanket closer around herself so
0:25:40 blushing
0:25:41 um still looking she doesn't know where
0:25:44 to look every everywhere she looks she
0:25:46 feels incredibly self-conscious about
0:25:48 the floor almost seems safe until
0:25:53 realizes she at some point she would
0:25:54 have to look up so she looks at the side
0:25:56 there's it's just she's so nervous
0:26:01 as if it's not even what she really
0:26:03 meant to say the first thing that comes
0:26:05 out is
0:26:07 I don't really have a lot of blood
0:26:11 right now
0:26:12 and
0:26:14 he says kind of turning his attention to
0:26:17 just kind of cleaning himself confusion
0:26:20 is just piling on at this point the
0:26:22 fangs makes her think that he might want
0:26:25 to use them she is just quickly burying
0:26:29 herself under the realization that she
0:26:30 has no idea how this goes she's got the
0:26:33 mechanical understanding but her Amnesia
0:26:38 feels heavy on her in this moment
0:26:40 because
0:26:42 I mean [ __ ] is there any flicker of if
0:26:46 this even feels like a familiar thing
0:26:48 for her
0:26:51 this one shoulders and situations that
0:26:53 she hasn't encountered in her you know
0:26:56 months of memory they sort of spark an
0:27:00 understanding of whether or not it's a
0:27:03 reality for her and her past or no
0:27:05 unfortunately for better her mind is
0:27:07 racing so fast that if there is some
0:27:12 instinct or what have you it is crushed
0:27:17 by her pondering the many implications
0:27:20 that are all possible
0:27:22 that's fair
0:27:24 if there's an instinct it is conquered
0:27:32 I'm here to argue
0:27:35 something about her nerves mounting and
0:27:39 the self-consciousness mounting it feels
0:27:42 Cavalier for him to just start showering
0:27:45 again in the middle of what's a deeply
0:27:48 vulnerable conversation for her and yeah
0:27:51 with it uh she's too keyed up in her own
0:27:54 emotions to not feel this strange sort
0:28:00 of surge of protectiveness over herself
0:28:03 as everything in the past it hasn't even
0:28:06 been a couple days since like what the
0:28:09 the Coterie killed the Abbott and then
0:28:11 she got kidnapped and then she had a
0:28:14 long week oh no I kind of want to run
0:28:16 through it right because like
0:28:18 there's the kidnapping and then there's
0:28:20 like
0:28:21 the blood bond breaking and that strange
0:28:24 sense of like morning of a lost love
0:28:27 that she never really had I mean I don't
0:28:29 want to like linger here too too much
0:28:31 because
0:28:32 well there's no use rehashing it but at
0:28:35 the same time
0:28:36 there's been trauma after trauma being
0:28:39 piled on to her and revelation after
0:28:42 Revelation piled on to her she has
0:28:44 gotten closer to Danger she didn't even
0:28:47 know about and danger she had hoped to
0:28:50 separate herself from then she has in a
0:28:54 in basically forever
0:28:56 so out with it she says
0:29:00 and I haven't done this before and I
0:29:03 don't know if I want to and I'd rather
0:29:05 know that I would want to
0:29:08 and he kind of interjects
0:29:11 if you're not sure
0:29:13 you don't want it
0:29:15 and he turns the shower off
0:29:17 another strong surge of confusion but
0:29:21 with it even though there's just
0:29:25 self-consciousness all around almost a
0:29:28 strange reverse sense of rejection
0:29:30 but also gratitude
0:29:34 she doesn't actually mean to step closer
0:29:36 when she does but she finds herself kind
0:29:40 of taking that one step and like leaning
0:29:42 her head up against the joining of the
0:29:45 wall in the shower and um looking at him
0:29:47 while he turns off the shower eyes big
0:29:51 not actually shying away this time the
0:29:54 nervousness of like looking in his
0:29:56 Direction she doesn't seem so scared to
0:30:00 make implications now
0:30:01 and very sincerely she actually says
0:30:06 thank you
0:30:08 he steps out of the shower collecting a
0:30:10 towel and dries off without saying very
0:30:15 much
0:30:16 there's a subtle nod somewhere in there
0:30:19 at the nod Britta offers a very genuine
0:30:24 smile
0:30:25 when he's ready he steps out of the
0:30:28 bathroom
0:30:29 sees that in preparations for some
0:30:31 proofing the room have already been done
0:30:33 he finds the sofa that is in the small
0:30:36 living space lays down closes his eyes
0:30:40 and waits for Sunrise
0:30:42 but I will take the moment to if there's
0:30:45 enough time is does it seem that she
0:30:47 could take a quick shower yeah she can
0:30:49 she'll do so try to get the smell of
0:30:52 smoke out of her hair the remainder of
0:30:54 the blood and grit once she's through
0:30:56 she walks back and out into the room and
0:31:00 almost looks like she wants to argue but
0:31:03 instead of arguing she goes over to the
0:31:06 bed
0:31:07 takes the nicest of the pillows well
0:31:10 really there's usually in this kind of
0:31:13 Hotel like a couple layers like a sheet
0:31:15 a blanket whatever
0:31:17 the one that she's had wrapped around
0:31:18 herself is not the one she's giving over
0:31:20 and she's the throw blanket she makes
0:31:23 sure to place somewhere on offending but
0:31:26 she brings him like the thicker of the
0:31:30 blankets and a nice pillow and sets it
0:31:33 down next to him as if she can't tell I
0:31:36 mean she honestly can't she doesn't
0:31:37 really know if you can go to bed early
0:31:38 or not she doesn't want to disturb him
0:31:40 if he's actually asleep doesn't really
0:31:42 know how this works but
0:31:44 um regardless figures that if she sets
0:31:47 it down quietly next to him he can make
0:31:50 his own determinations
0:31:52 and taking a pillow and sheet from the
0:31:55 bed she actually finds a chair if
0:31:59 there's an armchair near the sofa there
0:32:01 is and she chooses to curl up and make
0:32:03 her own nest there and morning comes
0:32:06 with no one sleeping on the bed
0:32:15 after a series of long flights you are
0:32:17 brought to the Dallas Gentry and there
0:32:20 in a hall you find yourself waiting
0:32:23 among a handful of tremeer who are
0:32:25 waiting for the opportunity to speak
0:32:27 with counselor Melinda regarding the
0:32:29 situation going on on the East Coast you
0:32:32 don't have all of the details but you
0:32:34 were made aware that a number of
0:32:36 chantries have been toppled by the
0:32:39 combined forces of the vigos and the
0:32:41 black hand
0:32:42 as these changes were toppled
0:32:44 investigating apprentices discovered
0:32:47 among the ruins a handful of projects
0:32:51 that were undertaken by those chantries
0:32:53 that did not line up with reports that
0:32:56 would be sent being sent to on high and
0:32:58 now there are eyes on New York Boston
0:33:03 and all of the domains that reside
0:33:06 between them
0:33:07 an hour passes before the counselor has
0:33:10 the time to see you but eventually two
0:33:13 agents of house presidium bring you
0:33:16 before a large ornate mirror Apprentice
0:33:19 be advised that you are not to have any
0:33:21 rituals active during your time with the
0:33:23 counselor are there any items of
0:33:26 importance that you wish to relinquish
0:33:27 at this time before entering Ira looks
0:33:30 down at himself gives him a little nod
0:33:33 strips off the leather gloves on his
0:33:36 hands that are missing the fingers for
0:33:38 the forefinger and thumb hands them over
0:33:41 he holds his blue tie it was sort of
0:33:45 loose around his neck off hands that
0:33:47 over opens his long like sort of mid
0:33:51 thigh length blue overcoat pulls out a
0:33:54 pair of stakes hands those over and
0:33:57 looks at uh the others who were asking
0:33:59 for his things just you know obviously
0:34:02 he doesn't seem put off by the idea that
0:34:04 he has to give this stuff up pretty
0:34:06 standard pretty normal almost looks a
0:34:08 little embarrassed like he didn't think
0:34:10 quite fast enough to take these things
0:34:12 and relinquish them over before being
0:34:14 asked for them but hands them over and
0:34:16 looks at them and goes
0:34:19 that should be it yeah that's it I
0:34:23 understand who I'm talking to so we
0:34:26 appreciate your understanding the man
0:34:27 who was also unsurprisingly wearing like
0:34:30 a like a royal blue tie except the
0:34:34 occult paraphernalia and they kind of
0:34:36 lock it in this tin box
0:34:38 one of them walks away taking the
0:34:42 contents of the box to go be logged for
0:34:44 now the other one Taps on the mirror and
0:34:47 the glass kind of gives this Ripple and
0:34:50 you get the impression that you're able
0:34:53 to pass through it before passing
0:34:55 through the mirror he looks down and
0:34:57 just sort of looks himself over and
0:34:58 adjusts his clothes to be presentable
0:35:00 like using the mirror as an actual
0:35:02 mirror before he goes and speaks with
0:35:04 the counselor Ira is 5 10 ish he's got
0:35:09 like a trim build that narrows towards
0:35:11 the waist looks like he's maybe in his
0:35:13 like late 20s kind of has like a grad
0:35:16 student young hot Professor Vibe he's
0:35:18 got dark skin and looks for Kindred
0:35:20 relatively Humane his hair is black and
0:35:24 he's got like a really precisely neat
0:35:26 temp fade that goes up into these short
0:35:29 twists on top his features are
0:35:31 classically handsome he's got pronounced
0:35:33 thick cheekbones square jaw to the hyper
0:35:36 observant which is most of Clans here
0:35:39 the only marring of the symmetry of his
0:35:41 face is a slightly crooked nose from
0:35:43 when he looks like he got it broken at
0:35:45 some point before his Embrace his eyes
0:35:48 are big and brown but kind of hidden
0:35:50 behind a pair of classic black plastic
0:35:52 and silver wire brow line glasses that
0:35:55 really add to the impression that he
0:35:57 should probably be in like a coffee shop
0:35:58 or a library somewhere looking at a
0:36:00 really thick book he straightens the
0:36:03 navy blue wool Overcoat goes to a
0:36:05 Justice tie but realizes he gave it away
0:36:07 so just sort of fixes his open collar
0:36:10 with the white shirt he's got and resets
0:36:12 instead of using like the pin that kept
0:36:15 his tie neatly close to his chest so to
0:36:17 readjust it and puts it on his little
0:36:19 bell it's like a little gold pin with
0:36:21 the symbol of clintromere on it looks in
0:36:23 the mirror and straightens his gray like
0:36:25 flat front pants notices one of the
0:36:27 shoes is untied and bends down and ties
0:36:30 off the laces of a pair of Converse
0:36:34 All-Star Dennis Rodman's fixes him real
0:36:37 fast uses his thumb to like fix a little
0:36:40 bit of dirt on the white near his toes
0:36:41 stands back up and straightens his back
0:36:45 and then steps through the mirror when
0:36:48 you pass through the mirror the large
0:36:51 space that you enter has a huge glass
0:36:55 windows that show a gorgeous view of
0:36:58 Dallas and the room itself seems to have
0:37:02 a rather intriguing collection of
0:37:05 trinkets for example you see a number of
0:37:09 things that seem to tie directly to our
0:37:10 Therian Legend
0:37:12 she has a very large tapestry that kind
0:37:15 of hangs and depicts the Holy Grail
0:37:19 there are segments of an old table that
0:37:22 are kept under glass and protected with
0:37:25 powerful warts and she herself is
0:37:29 dressed as the sort of and the sort of
0:37:33 dress that a noble woman from you know a
0:37:37 thousand years ago or more might have
0:37:39 worn in the Britta Isles she herself
0:37:42 has long stunning red hair some freckles
0:37:47 and emerald green eyes
0:37:49 quickly kind of get the impression that
0:37:52 she is
0:37:53 supernaturally gorgeous a result of the
0:37:58 likely the rumors of her having been a
0:38:00 member of the order of Hermes in life
0:38:02 like a thousands year old maybe
0:38:05 sorceress before becoming a vampire
0:38:08 and the way light catches on her gives
0:38:13 her this glimmer and shine that doesn't
0:38:15 quite exist in the natural world now
0:38:18 amidst all of these
0:38:21 um her Research into these Arthurian
0:38:24 Legends you also find what looks to be
0:38:27 like some very very advanced technology
0:38:30 and there is a collection of what has to
0:38:33 be thousands of samples of blood
0:38:35 collecting from all over the world that
0:38:37 are gathered and this image of what
0:38:41 looks like DNA
0:38:43 as you enter she seems to be engaging in
0:38:46 research on multiple items of Interest
0:38:49 all at once able to divide her attention
0:38:52 seamlessly among four five six matters
0:38:56 of importance and as she does she pauses
0:38:59 and looks towards you Asta I am pleased
0:39:03 that you have arrived as quickly as you
0:39:05 have
0:39:06 time is of the essence of course
0:39:08 counselor I got the call obviously when
0:39:12 the council calls you drop everything
0:39:14 and you come immediately so
0:39:16 here I am how can I help and he gives
0:39:20 sort of like a like a nodding bow it
0:39:23 does not look particularly
0:39:25 practiced I was American he's not great
0:39:28 at you know the old formality but it's
0:39:31 kind of clear he's trying and at least
0:39:34 is pretty well versed in the etiquette
0:39:35 of the pyramid if nothing else she looks
0:39:37 amused at your attempt worry not IRA
0:39:41 your Western charm will get you far in
0:39:43 New England is that where I'm headed it
0:39:45 is I have lost contact with a woman who
0:39:50 is rather important to some ongoing
0:39:52 research by the name of Raven I believe
0:39:55 that there is a complex conspiracy
0:39:57 centered on Boston this conspiracy
0:40:00 involves house and Clan uh-huh
0:40:04 you'll be going under the guise of Aid
0:40:07 provided to Mr ambrogino Giovanni an
0:40:11 ally of the clan he can't quite help
0:40:13 himself with giving like a little
0:40:15 confused frown At The Mention Of The
0:40:17 Giovanni and Regina is an exceptionally
0:40:19 talented Necromancer and Dharma church
0:40:21 we wish to keep him close not because of
0:40:26 his value as an ally but his potential
0:40:28 as an enemy understood he has involved
0:40:32 in a project known as the red sign are
0:40:35 you familiar with it no but I guess it's
0:40:38 not real surprising considering how
0:40:41 close to the chest so many want to keep
0:40:44 their pet projects it doesn't matter
0:40:46 that the council is keeping close eyes
0:40:48 on he looks genuinely
0:40:50 surprised that the council is keeping
0:40:52 close eyes on a project like this like
0:40:55 most of the projects that people keep
0:40:56 super secret are way beneath the notice
0:40:59 of the council come she gestures towards
0:41:02 you and approaches what is like a wall
0:41:06 of thousands of samples of blood he
0:41:09 follows precisely as he's meant to there
0:41:12 is a belief that in mapping the human
0:41:15 genome or you can ascertain the true
0:41:17 name of humanity he sort of looks up
0:41:21 adjusts his glasses as he looks at the
0:41:24 Genome of blood that is presented before
0:41:26 him now this serves two-fold Apprentice
0:41:31 one
0:41:32 other allow us to initiate
0:41:34 pharmaceutical dominance over all of
0:41:36 mankind
0:41:37 a means of safeguarding the tremeer
0:41:40 through Dark Nights that are to come but
0:41:43 there is another purpose an ulterior one
0:41:46 one that may prove of even greater value
0:41:51 as we enter the final nights
0:41:53 we were formed of the ritual of
0:41:56 usurpation as a means of escaping the
0:41:59 Doom that awaited us as magic failed
0:42:02 but now
0:42:03 the Doom of the Kindred Looms
0:42:06 through the ridgel the red sign we might
0:42:09 shed this curse
0:42:11 reattane our avatars
0:42:15 and live life once again as we're meant
0:42:17 to be as Kindred fade from existence
0:42:20 consumed by the wrath of their ancients
0:42:24 a sidestep for Johanna yes he nods in
0:42:28 like scientific appreciation like huh I
0:42:31 wonder if you could do that but woe to
0:42:34 any Who challenged the curse of Cain
0:42:37 those who have attempted in the past
0:42:39 suffered well
0:42:42 suffered very little
0:42:44 so we must approach this carefully
0:42:47 by unlocking the deepest truths of
0:42:49 mankind our purpose well their purpose
0:42:53 on this planet how they came to be why
0:42:56 the deepest meanings
0:42:58 we can change our circumstance and she
0:43:02 looks to you
0:43:03 but that only works if the Sabbat don't
0:43:06 burn everything down in the meantime
0:43:08 the Carnage that they have Unleashed has
0:43:10 caused significant setbacks he pulls his
0:43:13 eyes away from the blood genome back
0:43:16 over to her and gives her a nod yeah
0:43:20 this raven part of that yes it would
0:43:24 appear that Raven has acquired pages
0:43:27 from the Codex that are needed you will
0:43:30 find her and hope that she hasn't
0:43:31 endangered herself in the process of
0:43:34 doing whatever it is that she is doing
0:43:36 and you will see to it that the camera
0:43:38 is positioned to face the onslaught that
0:43:42 is the Sabbat how's the local region
0:43:44 going to take it with Astor Shawn up the
0:43:46 region need not know that Asters are
0:43:48 showing up it will simply be advised
0:43:50 that the counselors directing those who
0:43:54 were displaced by Sabbat incursions to
0:43:57 him
0:43:58 you will be sent with three other
0:44:01 apprentices as the four of you arrive
0:44:04 the presence of the other three will
0:44:05 conceal your true purpose he will know
0:44:08 that you are an ally of Mr ambrogino

0:47:05 [ __ ] okay
0:47:06 thanks he opens the 10 box takes his tie
0:47:10 out and like kind of puts it Loosely
0:47:12 back around his neck doesn't tighten it
0:47:14 up just kind of lets it hang loose with
0:47:16 the top couple buttons of his shirt
0:47:18 undone
0:47:19 now
0:47:20 he doesn't bother saying anything else
0:47:22 and just leaves you make your way to the
0:47:24 airport and before you know it you're on
0:47:26 your way to New Haven
0:47:32 Johnny it's just you and Ramirez right
0:47:34 now in the distance you can hear the
0:47:37 sounds of people screaming running
0:47:39 this place has been torn up something
0:47:41 big came through shoved cars out of the
0:47:44 way raked massive claws along
0:47:47 Cobblestone tearing it you can almost
0:47:50 smell the scent of blood and something
0:47:54 something on the prowl the hairs on the
0:47:57 back of your neck stand you can feel the
0:48:00 presence of a predator
0:48:02 it's night time and so the lights going
0:48:05 out and the area kind of
0:48:07 allow for Long Shadows to be cast by
0:48:10 what few sources of Illumination there
0:48:12 are Johnny Grits his teeth and spends a
0:48:15 few seconds extra looking at the pools
0:48:17 of Shadow the the fact that a werewolf
0:48:21 is on the loose causing a rampage seems
0:48:24 almost a bit too convenient and
0:48:27 oily feeling of ten abrasion keeps on
0:48:31 brushing it the hairs in the back of his
0:48:33 neck but he pushes that fear to the back
0:48:36 and focuses on trying to figure out
0:48:39 where this werewolf is and how the hell
0:48:42 he's gonna do anything about it Ramirez
0:48:44 where's the rest of your group
0:48:47 um bad news man some of us scattered
0:48:51 um this thing what was your plan here
0:48:54 well we came in to find out what was
0:48:56 going on with the screaming someone's
0:48:58 panicking there was this guy he was
0:49:00 sweating confused
0:49:02 um and then we sought some of us broke
0:49:05 and ran the uh I don't know if I'm
0:49:07 supposed to tell you this but like we've
0:49:10 got this site
0:49:11 and it shows us it shows us what's
0:49:13 really going on with people the things
0:49:15 that they don't share sometimes it's
0:49:17 that you know the pawn in someone else's
0:49:20 game sometimes they're like full-on uh
0:49:22 excuse my French monster you can see
0:49:25 things
0:49:26 yeah but more importantly a site
0:49:29 protects us it shows us what's out there
0:49:32 but also keeps us from losing our minds
0:49:34 at the the the the kind of quiets down
0:49:38 realizing he's getting louder from
0:49:40 losing our minds because of the truth
0:49:42 what truth
0:49:44 that monsters are real then to look this
0:49:47 wolf man in the eye it just ascends
0:49:52 something deep Wild
0:49:53 it's like you know
0:49:55 it's like how some people
0:49:58 instinctively are afraid of like snakes
0:50:00 or or deep water you know the things
0:50:04 that would have killed you you know
0:50:05 during the Stone Age or whatever but
0:50:07 like this this is it's like it's like
0:50:10 that it's this ingrained need to get the
0:50:11 [ __ ] away from it
0:50:13 still feel it but the site lets us keep
0:50:17 control
0:50:18 I don't think all of us had it ready at
0:50:20 this at the time and
0:50:22 they lost their cool
0:50:24 and all of you guys can
0:50:26 see things like this what when did that
0:50:28 start
0:50:31 we all
0:50:33 he kind of like looks around just to
0:50:36 make sure you guys aren't immediately in
0:50:38 danger
0:50:39 it all started in this past year or so
0:50:42 with
0:50:44 what that crazy mansion sometimes you
0:50:48 know people see weird things and
0:50:51 whatever it is that gives us the sight
0:50:54 warns us that something's wrong Johnny
0:50:56 kind of frowns at all this information I
0:50:59 know
0:51:00 I know you met Sheila bartender that had
0:51:03 asked for your help on something uh her
0:51:06 eyes are open to the truth too
0:51:08 you know there's a few of us
0:51:11 few of us that had our eyes open because
0:51:15 of things that you and your friends did
0:51:18 and that's not that's not a dig it's
0:51:20 just
0:51:21 in truth there's just some parallels
0:51:26 thanks coming home to roost I guess
0:51:28 yeah
0:51:30 I'd offered that pizza kinda
0:51:32 hoping we could all get along with pizza
0:51:34 it's a freaking New Haven garbage Pizza
0:51:37 my friend
0:51:38 a classic Johnny not really
0:51:40 understanding what the whole because he
0:51:42 wasn't around for the pizza bit so no no
0:51:44 yeah so this is not really understand
0:51:45 why why New Haven trash Pizza is coming
0:51:47 into the plate uh Johnny Ramirez kind of
0:51:50 keeps stalking down the street towards
0:51:52 the sounds of uh the the few sounds we
0:51:56 get I think this this whole conversation
0:51:58 has been kind of being You Know spoken
0:52:02 while they're moving from little low
0:52:05 wall to little you know pull and mailbox
0:52:09 that they can kind of like you know
0:52:10 Scrabble some cover and just you know so
0:52:13 that they're not just walking blindly in
0:52:15 the street as you get far enough you can
0:52:18 see what looks like this said Dan that
0:52:21 had one of its doors torn completely off
0:52:24 and sitting in that now very accessible
0:52:28 passenger seat is
0:52:31 your daughter and she's got her right
0:52:34 arm and a sling and she's pretty
0:52:37 bloodied up next to her kind of honestly
0:52:41 taking care of her is Crystal
0:52:44 a person you've heard about vaguely seen
0:52:49 that one time you guys were interacting
0:52:51 with the hunters but she is Joey's mom
0:52:54 and Joey's mom is currently picking
0:52:57 glass I actually met her at her house at
0:53:01 the front door yeah she told me to get
0:53:03 the [ __ ] off her lawn yep well now you
0:53:06 know why because she saw you for what
0:53:09 you were
0:53:12 at this point Johnny just kind of breaks
0:53:14 cover and starts running towards them
0:53:16 Jessica
0:53:19 the woman that is accompanying Jessica
0:53:21 she [ __ ] brandishes this switchblade
0:53:25 and as you get close you can actually
0:53:27 feel heat coming from the knife and the
0:53:32 knife glows like a glowing like Ember of
0:53:36 coal and Jessica kind of like pushes her
0:53:40 arm with you know her free hand he's
0:53:43 like no no it's okay it's okay I called
0:53:45 him he's here to help John he kind of
0:53:47 looks down at the switch blade his upper
0:53:50 lip kind of curls a little bit you gotta
0:53:53 do something with that
0:53:54 and you're cut off as Jessica
0:53:58 leaps onto you an arm around you
0:54:01 seemingly not caring very much about
0:54:05 just how incredibly cold you are to the
0:54:07 touch and she just kind of squeezes
0:54:10 tight you can feel the heat of the tears
0:54:13 that are coming out of her eyes as her
0:54:15 face is kind of like pressed against
0:54:18 your chest Johnny just stands kind of
0:54:21 stunned for a second and then wraps his
0:54:25 arms tightly around her and just hugs
0:54:27 her dad was scared and we can't let this
0:54:30 thing kill these people we have to stop
0:54:33 it yeah yeah yeah
0:54:36 give me a second here I just um yeah
0:54:39 yeah
0:54:40 I imagine Johnny's probably just weeping
0:54:44 blood from his eyes how do we fight
0:54:46 these things
0:54:49 in my experience
0:54:51 you kind of releases his bear hug and
0:54:54 gently kind of holds her by the
0:54:56 shoulders oh Ramirez actually approaches
0:54:59 a crystal and he hugs her and kind of
0:55:05 gives her this tender kiss and is like
0:55:07 hey
0:55:08 it's all right he's on our team
0:55:10 the
0:55:12 my experience
0:55:13 the only thing that really hurts these
0:55:16 things is silver
0:55:17 he uh opens up his jacket and shows the
0:55:20 revolver I have six silver bullets in
0:55:23 this thing
0:55:24 other than that
0:55:26 my recommendation would be to run
0:55:28 I've seen one of these things tear apart
0:55:31 six of my kind in as many seconds and
0:55:34 that's saying something too because
0:55:37 we're not easy to kill
0:55:39 so where's the rest of your group
0:55:42 Suarez and Sheila
0:55:44 Sheila ran as far as one after
0:55:48 uh last thing we heard
0:55:51 uh There Was You know the howl was
0:55:53 coming from around where Suarez had
0:55:56 headed off to Crystal looks to Ramirez
0:56:01 either Suarez is holding on or he's
0:56:03 you know
0:56:05 did you see this werewolf before it
0:56:08 changed
0:56:09 I kind of look between each other and
0:56:12 Crystal speaks up in nuts
0:56:15 yeah why
0:56:17 is it a blonde man
0:56:19 grang scarred up but yeah
0:56:21 he was missing fingers
0:56:23 kind of crossed his arms
0:56:25 gotta look like a mess kept saying
0:56:28 something
0:56:29 Eater of souls Eater of souls Eater of
0:56:32 souls I have no idea what that means
0:56:35 unfortunately I'm the wrong person to be
0:56:37 asking about that kind of [ __ ] all right
0:56:41 I think our best bet is to try and find
0:56:44 your friends
0:56:46 regroup and then maybe decide whether or
0:56:48 not we want to try and fight this thing
0:56:50 Jessica gives a nod uh she has not
0:56:54 released you from her like one-armed
0:56:56 grasp
0:56:57 okay
0:56:58 that makes sense
0:57:01 I think he's being influenced by
0:57:04 something
0:57:05 I got these flashes of insight
0:57:09 um there's something happening
0:57:11 everywhere
0:57:13 and I think he's infected by it
0:57:17 I saw
0:57:19 um
0:57:19 I saw this this
0:57:22 Shadow from the East Shadow a shadow
0:57:25 Johnny's hair stand up on the back of
0:57:27 his neck like um
0:57:29 was oily impenetrable Blackness no no no
0:57:34 no it wasn't it wasn't really there
0:57:37 it was like it was like something tall
0:57:40 so tall so terrible looming over the
0:57:44 whole world and cast a shadow from
0:57:47 continents away
0:57:49 and that oppressive looming presence
0:57:53 Over The Wolf Man is what set him off
0:57:56 like
0:57:58 Like The Wolf Man could feel that this
0:58:02 this thing
0:58:04 and she kind of tries to collect her
0:58:07 thoughts uh at this point Ramirez speaks
0:58:10 hey it's all right just say what you can
0:58:13 and as it comes to you we can we can get
0:58:16 to it and she nods
0:58:18 oh
0:58:19 the world is undergoing a crisis and
0:58:23 Joni's brow was furrowed in confusion
0:58:26 and frustration like he's just been like
0:58:29 he hearing that that the shadow was not
0:58:32 the obtibration he feared it was but
0:58:34 something else and that all of this
0:58:37 about Eater of souls the fact that he is
0:58:39 so far out of his depth was kind of easy
0:58:43 to see on his his face but as she starts
0:58:46 to talk about the end of the world a
0:58:49 flash of recognition kind of comes to
0:58:51 his uh face because he has another
0:58:54 friend who's always babbling on about
0:58:56 this kind of stuff and the fact that he
0:58:59 is out of depth in both places is some
0:59:02 kind of Shimmer of pattern that Johnny
0:59:05 can grip grip dad three Buddhists what
0:59:09 does that mean to you
0:59:11 three buddhistatfas are fighting in
0:59:15 fighting a storm a storm
0:59:20 three bodhisattvas a storm
0:59:23 you know none of that makes any goddamn
0:59:26 sense to me but
0:59:28 I know someone who who really probably
0:59:30 needs to talk to you and hear this
0:59:35 and he went to a [ __ ] party
0:59:38 [ __ ] wish Neil was here almost
0:59:40 immediately after saying that a cab
0:59:42 pulls up and a tall dark-haired man in
0:59:48 like a nice suit but like some of the
0:59:50 seams are ripping he looks like he has
0:59:52 had a really bad night who Johnny you
0:59:55 would recognize as the keeper of Elysium
0:59:57 Edmund dashwood steps out of the car
1:00:00 something about the way that dashwood is
1:00:02 holding it like dashwood is usually very
1:00:04 like upright rigid posture like very put
1:00:07 together he looks disheveled he looks
1:00:10 Haggard and his posture is a little bit
1:00:12 more hunched like shoulders rolled
1:00:14 forward like he's a like he's
1:00:16 uncomfortable with his height and he
1:00:18 just stumbles out and looks directly at
1:00:21 you wide-eyed and mad Johnny immediately
1:00:25 kind of puts uh Jessica behind him and
1:00:29 interposes himself in between Johnny
1:00:31 Johnny
1:00:33 no no no no it's it's me it's it's Neil
1:00:36 I'm I'm sorry I'm so sorry sorry Neil
1:00:40 I I didn't what's [ __ ] is going on look
1:00:44 you I'm things are weird right now
1:00:47 things are weird and I'm sorry Johnny
1:00:49 I'm I'm really sorry
1:00:51 Johnny kind of looks back at the rest of
1:00:53 the uh people he's with just to see what
1:00:56 their reaction is the woman who had the
1:01:00 burning knife starts to slowly approach
1:01:05 Edmund not necessarily ready to attack
1:01:08 just yet but you're definitely getting
1:01:10 the impression that whatever she sees
1:01:12 about this guy is extremely alarming to
1:01:15 her whoa chill it chilling somehow I
1:01:19 think this is my friend Neil you you're
1:01:22 here I I I I think I I think I heard you
1:01:25 I think what's what's been going on I've
1:01:29 missed you man I it's
1:01:33 you know Johnny slowly kind of releases
1:01:36 Jessica and takes a few cautious steps
1:01:38 towards dashwood Neil
1:01:41 yeah I didn't want to be right I I
1:01:44 didn't want any of this to be right but
1:01:46 he kind of looks at the hunched posture
1:01:48 dad this guy looks like dozens of people
1:01:50 he gives a a look back at Jessica with
1:01:53 an arched eyebrow all right so your
1:01:56 daughter is that he looks back at Neil
1:01:58 dashwood whatever it is in front of him
1:02:00 and kind of puts a hand on his shoulder
1:02:02 Dash would like raises a hand and gives
1:02:04 like when he asks is that your daughter
1:02:06 like raise his hand and gives a little
1:02:08 awkward like socially awkward wave that
1:02:10 is very Neil Behavior good God man he
1:02:13 kind of grabs him by the head I'm so sad
1:02:17 it's been a weird couple of days yeah
1:02:21 um this is all actually not a bad dream
1:02:23 I don't know why everything's coming
1:02:25 together like this
1:02:26 what the [ __ ] going on around here why
1:02:28 don't I my daughter and or her
1:02:33 companions have been getting Visions I'm
1:02:36 so sorry I think she's been seeing a lot
1:02:39 more than the rest of them know he gives
1:02:41 her kind of a hard look he looks over at
1:02:43 Jessica just with like raw sympathy on
1:02:47 his face like he just looks
1:02:49 empathetically sad like yeah I've been
1:02:51 here who are the three buddhistatfas I I
1:02:54 don't know I'm not sure but they're
1:02:55 fighting the storm right it's the three
1:02:57 they have the eyes the the third eye you
1:02:59 see like like pearls shining their heads
1:03:01 fast yeah yeah that's it's the thing
1:03:04 that I don't remember when I kind of
1:03:05 freaked out a while ago it's around New
1:03:07 Years maybe a little bit after I can we
1:03:09 gotta take this conversation somewhere a
1:03:10 little bit safer there's a werewolf on
1:03:12 the prowl Jesus Christ and whatever's
1:03:15 been going on is making it crazy I don't
1:03:18 know how reliable I'm gonna be right now
1:03:20 but but I is this actually dashwood's
1:03:23 body is it he drops the second he looks
1:03:27 Dash was just unconscious on is he in
1:03:29 torper is he unconscious what I Mr
1:03:33 dashwood drops to the ground falling
1:03:35 into torpor Johnny just goes [ __ ]
1:03:39 um he Scoops up dashwood we have to find
1:03:42 somewhere safe to hide him
1:03:44 so Ramirez starts approaching the cab
1:03:47 that this weird guy arrived in and he
1:03:50 checks the front side look Johnny
1:03:53 Ramirez I think we're first name basis
1:03:55 at this point yeah uh the driver of this
1:03:58 car is unconscious well Ramirez isn't
1:04:00 your first name is it uh for now we
1:04:03 should let that be
1:04:07 then you can call me Mr Saxon all right
1:04:10 fine Mr Saxon my point is
1:04:13 the driver is out cold the car's running
1:04:15 I can get people out who needs to go all
1:04:18 right
1:04:20 um
1:04:21 you need to get dashboard out I don't
1:04:23 know what kind of state he's going to be
1:04:24 if he wakes up so let's put him in the
1:04:26 trunk
1:04:27 uh the woman who had brandished the
1:04:30 knife kind of gives a smirk and a nod at
1:04:32 the idea of mistreating a disgusting
1:04:34 vampire and she just grabs him by the
1:04:37 arm and starts dragging him towards the
1:04:39 taxi if if you don't mind just a little
1:04:42 bit of nah he kind of waves it off
1:04:45 Jessica I think you should also get out
1:04:47 of here what Dad my team's here yeah and
1:04:50 you're in no condition to fight
1:04:51 something that you need to learn about
1:04:53 working with a team is that the people
1:04:55 that actually do the punching and
1:04:57 they're they're in the front and you
1:04:58 stay safe in the back oh so now you're
1:05:00 gonna do parenting this is important
1:05:02 this is just a a lesson about how to
1:05:04 deal with werewolves I actually have a
1:05:06 little bit more experience than you on
1:05:08 this he grins at her she goes to like
1:05:10 argue about a million things at once and
1:05:13 Ramirez is like hey uh we're gonna need
1:05:17 his attention on one thing right and she
1:05:19 like nods and quietly makes her way to
1:05:23 the car she stops and reaches into her
1:05:27 jacket and pulls out a fire gun and she
1:05:31 heads over to Ramirez and hands him the
1:05:33 flare gun and if she's like just in case
1:05:37 we run into any rots or Vamps that go
1:05:39 crazy any nuts and then clearly
1:05:43 frustrated she makes her way to the cab
1:05:46 and she gets into the back seat and you
1:05:49 can kind of tell that blood loss and
1:05:52 exhaustion are really kind of starting
1:05:54 to set in
1:05:55 and turns out she gave Ramirez that
1:05:58 weapon because she probably wasn't going
1:06:00 to be able to do much fighting anyways
1:06:01 before she actually gets in the back
1:06:03 seat Johnny goes over and grabs her and
1:06:05 hugs her again thanks for coming dad
1:06:07 giving me a chance he kisses her on top
1:06:10 of the on top of the head we'll talk
1:06:11 right oh yeah
1:06:13 just make it back so we can
1:06:16 I promise
1:06:19 if dashboard in the back does wake up
1:06:21 and it's and my friend Neil is still in
1:06:24 there talk with him about what's going
1:06:26 on I will if it's not it's dashboard and
1:06:31 he's frenzying please leave the uh the
1:06:34 taxi somewhere out of the sunlight and
1:06:37 let me know where it is so I can take
1:06:39 care of him Ramirez Taps the cab hey
1:06:42 Johnny don't you worry uh Mr Saxon uh
1:06:45 I'll make sure he's taken care of Johnny
1:06:48 nods
1:06:49 and he kind of turns back
1:06:52 so as you start heading back just that
1:06:57 you know 10 feet that you had wandered
1:06:59 onto the street there is this booming
1:07:01 howl and you can see that among those
1:07:06 Mortals Who Remain those who are gifted
1:07:09 with this strange sight that they talked
1:07:11 about even with the site you can see the
1:07:15 Shivers that run up their spines you can
1:07:18 sense Their Fear from where that howl
1:07:21 had happened there's the very loud
1:07:23 crunch of a car and the Yelp of a
1:07:27 wounded man can I use iron heart on
1:07:31 Mortal companions specifically Hunters
1:07:34 uh yes you can there is not I am not
1:07:37 aware of a restriction on it and this is
1:07:40 kind of let's just [ __ ] do it yeah
1:07:42 it's awesome cool Johnny will spend a
1:07:45 it's a willpower right yes is it per
1:07:48 companion or is this per he spends a
1:07:50 point with her on Crystal at this point
1:07:53 it's just the two of you and Crystal
1:07:56 gives you a look that was Suarez we
1:08:00 gotta go all right he gives her kind of
1:08:02 he gives her kind of a devil may care
1:08:04 smile and a steel gaze let's go hunting
1:08:08 and the Avenger and the Brujah
1:08:11 go rushing down the block headed towards
1:08:15 the sound of the Raging lupine
1:08:19 [Music]
1:08:23 when you stalk New Haven streets
1:08:25 searching for Kabir
1:08:28 but every time you smell his cologne or
1:08:31 track his Beast it seems to lead you in
1:08:34 different directions that ultimately
1:08:35 converge right back where you started
1:08:38 your senses are being manipulated even
1:08:41 with Spirit tracking it's as though
1:08:43 you're blind
1:08:44 as hours of this go by you find yourself
1:08:48 right back at the motel or the news
1:08:50 playing talking about this massive storm
1:08:53 in the East and strange occurrences
1:08:55 being reported all over the place back
1:08:57 in the hotel room wind just kind of
1:08:59 slumps on the bed it's probably rained
1:09:02 at some point While She Was Out doesn't
1:09:03 seem to bother her but she's definitely
1:09:05 a little soaked she's glad she left her
1:09:09 books most of them back in the room when
1:09:11 she went out searching she hasn't
1:09:13 puzzled out yet or hasn't had the time
1:09:15 to sit and puzzle out why why reality
1:09:17 would shunt to the side but she knows it
1:09:20 has something to do with him and by that
1:09:24 logic
1:09:25 she knows Kabir she knows he's a
1:09:27 trickster and she knows that if he
1:09:31 wanted to get her attention and wanted
1:09:34 her to find him she would and so
1:09:37 whatever's going on either his own
1:09:39 reality is so distorted he doesn't know
1:09:42 where she is or doesn't know that she
1:09:44 can't see him or he feels like this is
1:09:46 something he needs to do on his own and
1:09:49 she just kind of stares blankly at the
1:09:51 TV for a minute before she just in
1:09:53 frustration just levels of Fist and
1:09:56 punches it off the stand letting it
1:09:58 crash to the floor the room becomes
1:10:01 eerily silent after that as if the TV
1:10:03 was your only company she kind of sits
1:10:06 further on the bed tucks her knees up
1:10:09 puts her head on it and just kind of
1:10:12 thinks time's been weird but she does
1:10:16 remember recently she's been rereading
1:10:17 The Aeneid
1:10:19 The Aeneid Rings true to win because the
1:10:24 author was was said to have sat down in
1:10:27 the morning with six words on a page and
1:10:29 had three by the end of the day because
1:10:31 he was so determined to find the right
1:10:34 word and to be so efficient because
1:10:37 brevity means you're more likely to
1:10:40 survive and the Aeneid is the story of
1:10:44 facing your worst days and losing
1:10:48 everything and continuing to try for
1:10:50 something after and she remembers a
1:10:53 particular line something along the
1:10:55 lines of one day even these things would
1:10:58 be good to remember and she puts some
1:11:01 measure of resilience in the idea that
1:11:05 there will be an after and so with that
1:11:08 she doesn't allow herself to dwell so
1:11:10 much and she pulls her phone out of her
1:11:13 pocket she had made a call
1:11:15 to amberjino she neglected to let miles
1:11:19 know but her mind was kind of split but
1:11:22 it would probably be good one to get her
1:11:24 mind off not being able to find could be
1:11:26 Aaron too to check in with Miles and
1:11:28 make sure he's not dead in a gutter
1:11:31 somewhere
1:11:32 because what else would he need her for
1:11:35 and so she's figured out at this point
1:11:37 how to save phone numbers have a
1:11:39 favorites shortlist and she just brings
1:11:41 up his number
1:11:42 miles here wow that any change
1:11:46 um
1:11:47 the Lots
1:11:49 um Kabir is missing I can't find him I
1:11:52 can't find his Beast some part of me
1:11:54 thinks he's still here in front of me
1:11:56 and doesn't want me to see him some part
1:11:58 of me thinks he's here in front of me I
1:12:01 can't see him and that's not his choice
1:12:02 so
1:12:04 um I did I did want to get back to you
1:12:06 on um
1:12:07 on amberjino I did make contact with him
1:12:11 good Mr Giovanni seems like somebody we
1:12:14 shouldn't have upset in our domain no
1:12:16 well you know about uh the promise right
1:12:20 no okay long story short the what he I
1:12:24 asked him at some point if he was going
1:12:25 to need hospitality and he explained to
1:12:28 me a little bit about that basically
1:12:29 there was this promise between the
1:12:31 Giovanni and the camaria uh we don't
1:12:34 [ __ ] with their [ __ ] they don't [ __ ]
1:12:35 with ours we honor one each one
1:12:37 another's sovereignty which includes we
1:12:40 kind of Otto have Hospitality but we
1:12:42 shouldn't take advantage of that I think
1:12:44 he has Auto Hospitality in which he's
1:12:46 made me clear of after I offered to him
1:12:48 in court so
1:12:52 thanks
1:12:54 well if you'd asked
1:12:57 yes I knew the rent the uh I knew that
1:13:02 Ambrogino Giovanni was showing up in my
1:13:04 court that day or before then and I
1:13:06 would have asked you I I didn't have
1:13:09 that information he just showed up so we
1:13:11 that is to say we don't
1:13:13 have any way of being precognizant and
1:13:15 therefore we still haven't heard from
1:13:16 Neil well no I haven't heard anything
1:13:20 yeah me neither
1:13:21 um anyway
1:13:23 um he's going to be bringing in an ally
1:13:26 that is camaria and needs you to meet I
1:13:31 don't know why he didn't tell you that
1:13:32 but I think part of it is he's looking
1:13:35 to see exactly how many Hoops you're
1:13:36 willing to jump through if you want
1:13:38 somebody to have Hospitality here I
1:13:40 don't have a problem with it as long as
1:13:41 he doesn't make it a problem I think he
1:13:43 wants it's his way of finding out
1:13:45 whether it's a problem I I'd rather know
1:13:47 the weird people being introduced into
1:13:49 my court anyways well that may also be
1:13:51 his thought is that he wants to
1:13:52 introduce you to this weird portion
1:13:54 before he just shows up excellent then
1:13:57 that sounds like he's a very good
1:13:59 upstanding jio I mean I think he's the
1:14:01 Giovanni but okay well I don't know
1:14:04 enough about their Clan to say one way
1:14:05 or another they haven't tried to kill me
1:14:07 recently I mean that's fair anyways you
1:14:10 probably should be around Court since
1:14:11 you are now a representative of court
1:14:13 [ __ ] me running I am aren't I I'm not
1:14:16 talking about brimagine
1:14:18 um
1:14:19 Jeff I'm gonna need you to come here so
1:14:21 we can do something [ __ ] you
1:14:23 [Laughter]
1:14:27 oh my
1:14:29 um
1:14:30 I see why you wanted me to call hmm I
1:14:33 needed you to call so that Mr Giovanni
1:14:35 was not upset that that was the most
1:14:38 pressing issue I can handle some of the
1:14:40 other things you can handle me coming
1:14:42 unhinged at you after you tell me I'm
1:14:44 the [ __ ] Sheriff I mean I'd rather
1:14:47 you've been hinged to people I need you
1:14:48 to be unhinged at I'm obviously gonna be
1:14:51 unhinged to those people miles excellent
1:14:56 also I didn't want to bother you with
1:14:57 everything developing with the career
1:14:59 situation okay that I appreciate how are
1:15:02 things on the home front
1:15:06 um I mean we had an attempted Praxis
1:15:08 already I imagine that went well well
1:15:11 not for the other party no I don't care
1:15:14 if things go well for them Johnny was
1:15:16 probably with you and you're not a
1:15:18 slouch
1:15:19 oh thank you but yes that's been handled
1:15:21 minimal damage to anything except my
1:15:24 office I feel like your office has seen
1:15:26 worse
1:15:27 I have no idea what Rowlands did in
1:15:29 there I assume everything he did is
1:15:31 worse do you know what it's like to try
1:15:33 to get brain matter off a ceiling oh
1:15:36 short answer no but I also how who does
1:15:39 do the cleaning in an Elysium we have
1:15:41 people for that yeah how do how do you
1:15:44 find people who just clean brain matter
1:15:46 and don't ask questions they're usually
1:15:47 called Ghouls yeah that's super Fair
1:15:49 chaps chaps would definitely do that if
1:15:51 you held him up okay that's not really
1:15:53 what I was talking about
1:15:54 um anyways why don't you uh put yourself
1:15:59 in some thing else because I imagine you
1:16:01 have not changed much in the last couple
1:16:03 days I that it would not be inaccurate
1:16:06 and show up a court and we can see Mr
1:16:08 Giovanni and his weird friend
1:16:11 okay
1:16:13 um yeah give me a few minutes to tidy up
1:16:15 here I'll be there as soon as I can all
1:16:17 right see you soon alrighty
1:16:20 when
1:16:21 as you head over the door of the motel
1:16:24 you hear a tapping
1:16:27 at the little hotel window
1:16:29 like fingernails on glass
1:16:33 she brushes aside the curtain as you
1:16:35 brush the curtain aside
1:16:38 you are confronted with what has to be
1:16:41 more than a dozen kindred
1:16:44 all of them bearing fangs
1:16:46 all of them were the hungry glint in
1:16:49 their eyes for the scent of something
1:16:51 that they've that's drawn them to the
1:16:54 motel room
1:16:55 then the window and the bathroom smashes
1:16:59 open and more Kindred start crawling
1:17:02 into the ho the motel room
1:17:05 those outside chart banging on the glass
1:17:07 there's banging on the door there's got
1:17:10 to be more than two dozen Kindred here
1:17:13 well [ __ ] initiative yep
1:17:18 eight they're going on 16.
1:17:21 hunger such hunger they crawl out in
1:17:25 unison as they rush you and they will
1:17:28 attack
1:17:30 [Applause]
1:17:31 with one success you suffer a level of
1:17:34 lethal damage as they start ripping into
1:17:36 your flesh and pulling you apart okay
1:17:38 I'm Gonna Roll to soak that no you take
1:17:41 one level of lethal damage to your turn
1:17:42 ravana
1:17:47 so hungry ravana wouldn't start spending
1:17:50 blood how much blood do you spending she
1:17:52 can spend one a turn
1:17:54 as wind begins to spend the blood parts
1:17:57 of her begin to
1:17:59 de-partalize from her I guess and she
1:18:02 begins to dissolve into a very fine Mist
1:18:05 we go to next round and they continue to
1:18:08 attack
1:18:11 that is seven levels of uncokable you
1:18:14 focus on shifting with their attacks
1:18:16 they're going right through the
1:18:18 fortitude that you use to defend
1:18:20 yourself and as they slam you to the
1:18:22 ground over running you 15 18 20 to 1.
1:18:27 you black out miles
1:18:36 Giovanni arrives to your office and at
1:18:40 his side is a man that you do not
1:18:42 recognize
1:18:43 Ira Nas extends a hand in that sort of
1:18:47 casual way like hey here's my hand for a
1:18:49 handshake but also we're vampires and
1:18:51 you're the prince so if you don't wanna
1:18:52 I'm not going to take any offense
1:18:54 there's definitely no handshaking uh he
1:18:56 looks over at Mr Giovanni Mr Giovanni I
1:18:59 heard you have a guest your grace
1:19:01 I'm bringing with me a member of the
1:19:05 premiere he is going to be helping with
1:19:08 some of the ongoing projects and
1:19:11 well I suppose this is a matter for your
1:19:14 courts he looks between the two of you
1:19:16 and steps aside
1:19:18 nice to meet you nice to meet you you
1:19:20 Grace uh I was hoping I could have
1:19:23 Hospitality for the time
1:19:24 I do not see a problem with that as long
1:19:27 as nothing can be toward Becomes of it
1:19:30 then I see no problem I will grant you
1:19:32 Hospitality for your stay in New Haven
1:19:36 thank you I uh plan on talking to the
1:19:39 region obviously he knows I'm coming but
1:19:41 I wanted to with Mr Giovanni present
1:19:45 myself before the prince before getting
1:19:47 settled it is odd that you're not here
1:19:50 with Reiss the Region's a busy man he was
1:19:53 notified I was coming but you know
1:19:56 lots of stuff going on if I can help it
1:19:59 all in the court in any way let me know
1:20:01 but sorry get a little ahead of myself
1:20:03 my name is Ira it's a pleasure to meet
1:20:05 you his eyes kind of flick over to the
1:20:06 ashtray that Johnny used before it's uh
1:20:09 it's okay smoking here
1:20:12 yeah that should be fine
1:20:14 thank you Grace he uh pulls a pack of
1:20:17 moralese out of like the inner pocket of
1:20:19 his coat flicks it open someone pops out
1:20:21 and offers it to you no thank you sticks
1:20:25 in his in between his lips so what kind
1:20:27 of products are going in on in and
1:20:30 around New Haven well
1:20:32 you know I heard there's a lot of
1:20:34 displaced princes in the area and that's
1:20:36 also true of a lot of chantries up and
1:20:38 down the East Coast so
1:20:40 some of us are
1:20:42 in need of new places to stay
1:20:45 so not only are we a house too princes
1:20:48 without homes currently but some which
1:20:49 were me are also whole East Coast is
1:20:51 either dead or homeless
1:20:53 thanks to the Sabbat so I'm hoping that
1:20:56 we can kind of stop some of that from
1:20:59 happening further up the chain that
1:21:01 would be good
1:21:02 sir anything you're in particular aware
1:21:06 of that we should be forewarned of
1:21:09 for wound of I mean I think everybody
1:21:12 knows what's coming with the Sabbat at
1:21:13 this point right I just mean anything
1:21:15 that I would not normally be aware of
1:21:17 don't think so other than I know Mr
1:21:20 Giovanni and he looks over at Ambrogino
1:21:22 you see him his eyebrow twitches and he
1:21:25 looks over his shoulder off in some
1:21:27 distant Direction
1:21:28 looking for some help just Arcane study
1:21:31 I'm actually admittedly
1:21:33 kind of looking forward to I heard
1:21:35 Yale's got a rare book collection so
1:21:38 admittedly little sign a little excited
1:21:41 to be in the area might I mean if I can
1:21:44 swing it take a trip up to Boston MIT
1:21:47 I'm sort of like interested in
1:21:49 electrochemistry and that kind of stuff
1:21:51 that sort of thing but that's you know
1:21:53 personal projects and things that's not
1:21:55 really the area between here and Boston
1:21:57 is very dangerous yeah that's why I said
1:22:00 if I could swing it I'm not I can
1:22:01 expecting nothing it's been the use of
1:22:04 powerful disciplines
1:22:06 your friend win is in danger yeah she
1:22:10 was supposed to be here she is fading
1:22:12 she uh remember your Coterie yes you know

1:22:40 comfortable just watching the two of you

1:22:44 reaches into his coat pocket and he
1:22:46 pulls out an amulet that kind of hangs

1:25:48 considered the coolest goddamn shoes in
1:25:50 the [ __ ] Universe they're very cool
1:25:51 they're going for 500 bucks on eBay
1:25:52 right now yeah I figured they were
