0:00:25 now let's walk the path of night
0:00:29 [Music]
0:00:35 LEX: last time on path of night Britta Wynn and
0:00:39 Neil waited together for the result of
0:00:40 the war council sharing their deeper
0:00:43 feelings with one another meanwhile
0:00:46 Johnny and Miles navigated a tense
0:00:48 meeting with Hardestadt and other top
0:00:49 names within the
0:00:51 Camarilla the council was interrupted by
0:00:53 the arrival of the coterie's allies who lied
0:00:56 that the war with the Sabbat had already
0:00:58 begun
0:01:00 the Coterie managed to escape Hartford
0:01:02 heading back to New Haven to prepare for war
0:01:04 [Music]
0:01:23 LEX: the drive back towards New
0:01:27 Haven is a a quiet somber
0:01:31 one after the initial excitement of
0:01:35 being reunited with your allies
0:01:38 passes it starts to become increasingly
0:01:42 clear that every choice you couldn't
0:01:45 make up until this
0:01:46 point every opportunity that wasn't
0:01:50 seized may cost you people people you
0:01:54 care
0:01:56 about and no matter what great things
0:01:59 you accomplish in the coming
0:02:02 nights you will lose
0:02:05 people maybe each
0:02:09 other. Johnny as you drive towards New
0:02:13 Haven, you pass by this old Mobil gas
0:02:19 station that's long out of
0:02:21 use but in the parking lot you
0:02:25 see the unmistakable image
0:02:30 of three City SWAT
0:02:32 vans from different districts, different
0:02:35 towns
0:02:38 waiting and every now and then you see
0:02:41 other small signs of the coming
0:02:45 Crusade. Birds that Circle in the air
0:02:48 displaying unusual flight
0:02:51 patterns cold
0:02:54 chills from areas where the Shroud
0:02:57 between the living and the dead has
0:02:59 grown terribly
0:03:01 thin even as you arrive to New
0:03:05 Haven you start to become
0:03:08 aware of things you couldn't have
0:03:10 considered
0:03:12 beforehand it's this thrumming in the
0:03:15 back of your mind you can
0:03:18 feel this keen awareness of your
0:03:22 thoughts of your secrets your dreams
0:03:26 everything that makes you you and
0:03:28 something scratches at the surface of it
0:03:31 intent on
0:03:34 subjugation even the people that you are
0:03:36 traveling with look between each other
0:03:39 look to you they can feel this growing
0:03:45 awareness that spans the
0:03:49 Northeast you can feel an ancient hunger
0:03:53 that is not
0:03:54 yours something that dwarfs the very
0:03:57 concept of the Beast
0:04:03 slowly the truck pulls up to its
0:04:07 stop right by the access point to New
0:04:11 Haven Johnny has an opportunity to park
0:04:15 and the group of you have an opportunity
0:04:17 to collect your thoughts and decide how
0:04:19 to move
0:04:21 forward 
BRITTA: so where do we start 
MILES: do we know
0:04:25 where the attack is coming from yet 
JOHNNY: I
0:04:27 don't think there is an attack not yet
0:04:29 anyways
0:04:30 Am I Wrong 
LEX: Weathers shakes his head 
WEATHERS: no
0:04:33 you're not wrong we
0:04:36 uh fibbed a little ploy to get you
0:04:40 pulled out of the area so you can be
0:04:41 where you need to be when things start
0:04:42 really going down 
ERICA: Wynn gives a nod of
0:04:46 appreciation 
MILES: well that gives us an extra
0:04:48 24
0:04:49 hours 
BRITTA: thank you 
NEIL: when it does come it's
0:04:55 probably coming up the I95 Corridor and
0:04:58 and up the MTA from New York right and
0:05:01 then also from the north 
JOHNNY: also probably
0:05:04 from some of the suburbs as well 
MILES: yeah
0:05:07 and based on what we know before
0:05:09 possibly from the sea 
JOHNNY: considering how
0:05:11 many shovel heads you saw they're using
0:05:13 a [ __ ] big old Hammer to smash this
0:05:16 city 
NEIL: yeah 
LEX: Jane looks like she's seen a
0:05:21 ghost she heads to the back collects
0:05:25 this backpack as she unzips it you can
0:05:28 see she's got a gun
0:05:30 and a camera in there among some other
0:05:32 notebooks and what have you and she
0:05:35 retrieves a camera
0:05:38 and
0:05:41 hesitant and
0:05:43 intimidated she approaches this spot
0:05:46 where the weeds have out have grown out
0:05:49 of a crack in the pavement and she
0:05:52 crouches down over the crack and takes a
0:05:57 picture the group of you see it some
0:06:00 recognizing what you're looking at more
0:06:02 quickly than others but you see this
0:06:06 orangey
0:06:08 fleshy
0:06:10 spongy tissue 
WYNN: [ __ ] hell 
BRITTA: it's
0:06:14 spreading out from Yale isn't it or Ogden
0:06:17 Street 
JANE: there's some weird [ __ ] going on
0:06:20 Jane
0:06:21 says we've been having this you've heard
0:06:25 stories about the dead kind of getting
0:06:28 up and walking around and
0:06:30 becoming violent and I don't mean us I
0:06:32 mean 
WYNN: getting knocked back into their
0:06:34 bodies like zombies in a movie it's been
0:06:37 happening a lot and she looks like she
0:06:41 might be a little ashamed I've been
0:06:43 having these
0:06:45 dreams
0:06:46 something surrounded by bones and skulls
0:06:51 and
0:06:52 blood I don't dream I haven't dreamed in
0:06:56 a very long time so I don't know exactly
0:06:58 what it means but I feel like it's bad
0:07:03 
BRITTA: are the sorry to ask but these bones
0:07:08 skulls are they
0:07:11 Twisted
0:07:13 strange 
JANE: they're strange in that they
0:07:15 have
0:07:16 fangs 
LEX: once finished taking the pictures
0:07:19 she tucks the camera back into her
0:07:21 backpack and returns to the truck to
0:07:25 stand a little closer to her allies 
WYNN: Jane
0:07:28 how many places have have you seen this
0:07:30 in the city 
JANE: under a dozen 
WYNN: under a dozen
0:07:35 yeah have you is there any kind of
0:07:38 pattern to it or is it kind of random 
JANE: if
0:07:40 there's a pattern I don't see it 
WYNN: okay
0:07:43 
ERICA: Wynn looks to Neil and kind of gives a
0:07:45 shrug like maybe 
ROB: he shrugs not having
0:07:51 like he hasn't seen anything yet and
0:07:54 this is just one little instance so from
0:07:56 here he can't even really look
0:07:57 necessarily
0:07:59 when Jane mentions having dreams and
0:08:02 looking a little ashamed Neil doesn't
0:08:04 even like choose to not look judgmental
0:08:07 he looks immediately supportive of like
0:08:10 yeah no that tracks that's my experience
0:08:13 too and when Britta asks about the skulls
0:08:17 goes 
NEIL: well we know
0:08:19 from uh Jan Pieterzoon's reports that
0:08:24 there are
0:08:26 ancient Kindred um the harbingers of
0:08:30 skulls who are working with um Dark Selena
0:08:35 and and others coming from the north by
0:08:38 way of like Vermont I think I I can't
0:08:40 remember 
WYNN: Maine 
NEIL: Maine 
WYNN: Maine 
MILES: yeah either
0:08:43 way North 
NEIL: and they they are necromancers
0:08:47 who have beef with the Giovani we know
0:08:49 that much so 
BRITTA: would they collect maybe
0:08:53 kindred skulls like that 
NEIL: that I I have no
0:08:57 idea their faces look like skulls
0:09:00 like like they have literal skull faces
0:09:02 in a lot of ways that's why they're but
0:09:05 they they control the dead they do the
0:09:08 same so it's 
WYNN: do call me paranoid at this
0:09:12 point I mean just let's get out the
0:09:13 Reynolds Wrap at this point and make some
0:09:15 hats but do we really want to be having
0:09:17 this conversation in area with this
0:09:19 fungus growing 
JOHNNY: I think if we're seeing
0:09:21 fungus here even on this offramp of the
0:09:25 highway it's everywhere 
WYNN: well we could be
0:09:28 in a car
0:09:30 or a house 
NEIL: it's
0:09:33 not if it's here and going through the
0:09:37 cracks it means most likely it's
0:09:40 spreading through the
0:09:41 Warrens and without most of the Nosferatu
0:09:46 around you know 
JOHNNY: and that what that tells
0:09:49 me is that first thing you've got to do
0:09:53 Neil see if you can contact Fester cuz
0:09:56 he's alive apparently 
NEIL: yeah I I need do
0:09:59 that 
JOHNNY: get a disposition on what the
0:10:01 Warrens are looking like right now two
0:10:04 I need you to conduct a ritual for miles
0:10:07 and Britta 
NEIL: now that we're away from 
0:10:09 Pendragon's if you can get the bull to your
0:10:12 Haven miles I can do it there so we're
0:10:14 at least a little protected 
MILES: I've already
0:10:16 re-routed it we'll pick it up 
BRITTA: okay um are
0:10:19 you guys sure I mean what if that
0:10:21 doesn't work we have so much else that
0:10:24 we have to plan 
NEIL: it might not work 
BRITTA: it's
0:10:26 not that I don't have faith in you Neil 
0:10:28 
CROSSTALK: it's just no it's is not 
JIHNNYthis this is not
0:10:30 me asking this is me
0:10:32 telling I trust Neil in what he's
0:10:35 capable of and you need
0:10:38 it Britta you have been putting up with
0:10:41 a lot of [ __ ] this whole time in
0:10:44 Hartford and I uh I'm
0:10:48 impressed how much you've been able to
0:10:50 take care of but being that I've known
0:10:52 you and miles this long I can see how
0:10:55 frayed the two of you are 
MILES: we need to try
0:10:58 to be at least in top shape 
WYNNL this is an
0:11:01 investment of time we need to make and
0:11:02 if the payoff is nothing we this is it's
0:11:05 fine 
JOHNNY: and Neil can do this 
BRITTA: also that in
0:11:11 in I I'm thank you but in the meantime
0:11:15 while Neil's getting ready miles are we
0:11:18 able to maybe pull more more people
0:11:20 together 
MILES: we're going to start putting
0:11:23 out dispositions of
0:11:24 forces reinforcing them with ammunition
0:11:28 weapons whatever they might need some
0:11:30 fallback points we've been looking at
0:11:33 New Haven for a while and we have a good
0:11:34 number of spots to get people situated
0:11:38 we'll be making calls defending the
0:11:40 central location we are going to try to
0:11:43 make the Sabbat more manageable 
ROB: Neil looks
0:11:46 between Johnny and Miles 
NEIL: I don't suppose
0:11:49 anything helpful came out of that war
0:11:52 council 
ROB: he makes air quotes with his
0:11:54 fingers 
MILES: yes it looks like they'll be
0:11:56 giving as much of the area's
0:12:00 um police forces for us to use the
0:12:03 Camarilla forces will be helping us out
0:12:05 on 95 
BRITTA: are you guys okay um they didn't
0:12:09 they didn't make you do anything or 
MILES: oh
0:12:12 hold on 
TIM: he takes the White Cross Pin
0:12:15 from himself 
MILES: hey Neil can you take a
0:12:17 look at this tell me if there's anything
0:12:18 magical about it 
NEIL: um I don't have I mean
0:12:24 I can try I'm not a Tremere but I can
0:12:26 
MILES: take a quick look if not hand it to
0:12:28 Johnny Johnny is then going to uh throw
0:12:30 it as far away from us as possible 
BRITTA: what
0:12:32 are you worried about it 
MILES: Madame Guil put
0:12:34 some sort of pin that disappeared into
0:12:37 it and around it and um I don't know
0:12:41 enough things right now to trust it 
BRITTA: oh
0:12:43 Neil I had some magic questions for you
0:12:45 too but I think there may be not a
0:12:46 public thing 
NEIL: oh uh okay well I mean at
0:12:49 least I can 
ROB: Lex I use senses and stuff to
0:12:53 this pin that he's talking about is it
0:12:55 just his regular White Cross Pin or is
0:12:56 there anything else there to it 
LEX: what are
0:12:58 you using 
ROB: at first I'm just going to use
0:13:00 my regular senses to see if there's like
0:13:03 a secondary thing or if it's just his
0:13:05 the thing he walked in there with
0:13:07 
LEX: regular senses don't seem to detect
0:13:08 anything at all
0:13:11 
ROB: okay 
NEIL: all right well if this goes bad
0:13:13 shake me out of it 
ROB: and I will I think
0:13:15 for the first time in this campaign
0:13:17 maybe use Spirits touch 
LEX: go ahead and
0:13:21 roll 
ROB: does my spec in either emotions or
0:13:25 intuitive count for this one 
LEX: emotions
0:13:28 
ROB: that is nine successes 
LEX: with the maximum
0:13:31 successes you gain a wealth of
0:13:33 information nearly anything you want to
0:13:35 know about the person's relationship
0:13:37 with that object the last person to
0:13:39 touch this object was Miles and has been
0:13:43 for quite some time whatever she did was
0:13:46 likely an illusion now that we're here
0:13:49 Tim 
TIM: yeah 
LEX: with no ability to conceal how
0:13:53 you actually feel 
TIM: sure 
LEX: and no ability to
0:13:56 remain stoic in this situation since he
0:13:58 has bypassed of that by holding the item
0:14:00 in his hand what is your emotional
0:14:02 attachment to this object in this
0:14:06 time 
TIM: as not one of the first pens that
0:14:08 he's received it does bear emotional
0:14:13 weight for one of the few that is taking
0:14:16 the Camarilla's fight to the Sabbat for
0:14:18 killing those that have threatened the
0:14:20 city that he lives in and carrying the
0:14:23 weight of the duty that he he
0:14:26 bears but at the same time
0:14:30 it does not hold enough significance for
0:14:32 him to not remove it to keep everyone
0:14:36 else safe 
LEX: Neil that is the information
0:14:39 that you get from the uh pin 
ROB: he um holds
0:14:44 it for a moment kind of twirling it over
0:14:46 his knuckles and then hands it back to
0:14:50 miles 
NEIL: it's
0:14:52 um I can't see anything on it to my best
0:14:57 guess um whatever Madam Madam Guil did
0:15:02 was an
0:15:03 illusion it wasn't real or at least not
0:15:07 something that I can see or interact
0:15:09 with 
BRITTA: do you think maybe I could try and
0:15:11 Fiddle with it sometimes I'm good at
0:15:13 unlocking
0:15:15 things 
NEIL: what do you mean 
BRITTA: I don't know if
0:15:17 there's something like in it I don't
0:15:20 know if it's something that I could undo
0:15:24 
NEIL: I mean if you can it's fine if miles
0:15:27 wants to to play with it but to
0:15:29 there there's as far as I can tell
0:15:31 there's nothing inside of it there was
0:15:32 nothing put in there other than I guess
0:15:34 kind of what miles put into it 
MILES: I mean if
0:15:36 you want to look at it but I'm going to
0:15:38 continue moving on 
BRITTA: if you'll hand it to
0:15:41 me 
ROB: he gives it to Britta 
REBECCA: Britta heightens her
0:15:44 sense of vision and starts looking for
0:15:48 like
0:15:48 any hint of a separate piece or a moving
0:15:54 part or something 
LEX: you don't find
0:15:56 anything unusual 
REBECCA: heightening my
0:15:59 hearing instead there's no rattling
0:16:01 noise nothing like that 
LEX: no 
NEIL: yeah it's
0:16:04 it's just a it's just the pin 
BRITTA: I guess I
0:16:08 figured It's just sometimes
REBECCA: Britta pulls
0:16:12 her vision back to the usual and she
0:16:14 pulls her hearing back to normal and she
0:16:17 hands the pin back to Miles and she
0:16:19 looks to Neil and says 
BRITTA: it's been a while
0:16:22 since I don't know since I didn't know I
0:16:24 knew something so I thought
0:16:26 maybe 
NEIL: yeah I mean it's uh second pair of
0:16:29 eyes is always good but I
0:16:33 um I looked I I looked inside and out
0:16:36 and and I couldn't find anything it's
0:16:38 just it's just your PIN miles as far as
0:16:40 I can see 
MILES: sounds good 
NEIL: if we had a Tremere
0:16:42 around 
GARRETT: Johnny's giving a wary look at
0:16:46 Miles 
JOHNNY: when we were in that
0:16:48 meeting that
0:16:51 fireplace that
0:16:53 skull 
MILES: his
0:16:56 dignitas 
BRITTA: skull
0:16:59 
JOHNNY: Jan 
MILES: yes
0:17:02 
BRITTA: oh 
JOHNNY: are you
0:17:07 okay 
MILES: probably
0:17:09 not
0:17:11 but it's not the time or place for that
0:17:15 
BRITTA: Miles I'm I'm sorry 
NEIL: it um it will
0:17:20 be 
MILES: great
0:17:23 um no need to be sorry not your direct
0:17:27 fault uh 
WYNN: your fault at all 
MILES: if she's
0:17:31 blaming herself I I can't really stop it
0:17:34 but I'm going to keep saying
0:17:38 that he's given us some information that
0:17:41 I'm going to need people to look
0:17:43 through 
NEIL: okay 
MILES: I'm not sure where it is
0:17:47 I'm going to have to assume it's
0:17:48 somewhere nearby-ish but I don't know 
WYNN: we
0:17:51 grabbed our stuff on the way out it's in
0:17:52 the
0:17:54 car 
MILES: no he's hidden it away the key 
NEIL: oh oh
0:17:58 oh so we have to find it 
MILES: yeah I have
0:18:01 this key that goes somewhere 
WYNN: oh that one
0:18:04 
MILES: that one yeah Jan's key to be
0:18:08 specific um that does change a lot of
0:18:11 
NEIL: drop box or PO Box something maybe a
0:18:13 bank vault like a banker's box 
WYNN: Bus
0:18:16 Station train station there's a lot of
0:18:18 them 
NEIL: yeah we can look I I have a thing
0:18:21 with
0:18:23 keys 
MILES: so 
BRITTA: Neil are your keys labeled do
0:18:27 you think you could match that up to
0:18:28 somewhere 
NEIL: Well, they're labeled to me uh but
0:18:30 probably 
MILES: we should be able to figure it
0:18:32 out he wouldn't give me something that I
0:18:33 wouldn't be able to track down 
NEIL: yeah
0:18:37 exactly 
JOHNNY: well first things first I want
0:18:40 you all in that ritual I want you to
0:18:42 clear your heads and then you can go
0:18:46 down this key Rabbit Hole there 
WYNN: well
0:18:49 maybe while they're doing that you and I
0:18:52 can 
NEIL: I'm I'm going to want at least one
0:18:55 of you or somebody watching over us
0:18:56 because we're going to be out of our
0:18:58 minds and bodies when we're doing it
0:19:00 
WYNN: gotcha 
NEIL: just in case for safety 
MILES: but we
0:19:04 need to get while we're getting ready
0:19:06 and getting that we need to get the city
0:19:07 mobilized 
NEIL: yeah 
WYNN: I think when and I can
0:19:10 probably start spearheading that between
0:19:12 the sen cat and Sheriff if we can't do
0:19:15 it we should probably be fired you know
0:19:17 what actually think about it you might
0:19:19 want to fire us 
WYNN: mmhmm
JOHNNY: and if not we'll give
0:19:21 you
0:19:22 reason 
MILES: we can have the discussion later
0:19:25 like a couple days from now 
JOHNNY: looks like
0:19:27 we're [ __ ] on the job
0:19:29 
WYNN: damn it 
MILES: I appreciate the enthusiasm as
0:19:31 always 
WYNN: very enthusiastic 
MILES: I think
0:19:35 it's time for us to get
0:19:36 moving and get ready for the Sabbat that
0:19:38 are coming 
BRITTA: Neil are you basically ready
0:19:41 for this if the bull is there 
NEIL: if the
0:19:44 bull is there I have some Khalif left in
0:19:48 the Haven and we can go from there and
0:19:50 that'll I need to talk to the both of
0:19:52 you about what to expect because you can
0:19:54 get lost along the way if I can even
0:19:56 bring you uh I'm kind of flying by the
0:19:59 seat of my pants on this but yes I'm
0:20:02 ready to go whenever we need to we just
0:20:03 need a few hours of night 
BRITTA: okay then
0:20:07 let's make all the preparations that we
0:20:09 need for that and if we can squeeze
0:20:11 anything in the meantime maybe we could
0:20:14 call people who might be fighting in the
0:20:16 city um 
NEIL: some calls to make and
0:20:19 preparations to you know people to talk
0:20:22 to 
BRITTA: yeah 
NEIL: meetings to 
WYNN: weathers who have
0:20:25 you got recruited working so far 
WEATHERS: well do
0:20:28 you want the the good news or the bad
0:20:29 news 
WYNN: first one then the other man 
JOHNNY: bad
0:20:32 news 
WEATHERS: first a good chunk of the princes
0:20:35 that came to this city to hide from the
0:20:37 Sabbat have fled
WYNN: where to 
WEATHERS: further north 
JOHNNY: you
0:20:40 sure that's not good news 
WEATHERS: Well it means
0:20:43 that we have a lot less Manpower than
0:20:44 initially anticipated 
NEIL: probably in Boston
0:20:47 
JOHNNY: so what is the good news
0:20:50 well [ __ ] I don't know if we have any
0:20:53 
WYNN: make up something 
BRITTA: you got us here yeah
0:20:56 
WEATHERS: there you go enjoy that some more
0:21:00 well a good chunk of the Brujah stayed and
0:21:03 some anarchs the followers of set seem
0:21:06 to have pulled resources away from New
0:21:09 Haven so at least they're not directly
0:21:12 getting
0:21:13 involved 
WYNN: I'll take that as a win 
NEIL: are the
0:21:16 children of Haqim still in the city
0:21:18 
WEATHERS: they're still here there are  Gangrel
0:21:21 too so it's not completely hopeless but
0:21:25 
WYNN: isn't it weird that the two groups that
0:21:27 were [ __ ] on the most by the Cam are the two
0:21:29 that are stepping up to defend it 
JOHNNY: I
0:21:31 think that's just called history
0:21:35 
WYNN: right 
MILES: they're not here to defend the
0:21:37 Camilla per se they're here to defend
0:21:39 their homes and the friends they've and
0:21:42 bonds they've developed 
WEATHERS: well they're
0:21:47 outnumbered I don't mean to make it
0:21:50 sound like it's already
0:21:52 over but you need to start thinking
0:21:55 about how you're going to get people out
0:21:56 of this city once things hit a point of
0:21:58 no
0:22:00 return 
BRITTA: we can be smart about this if we
0:22:03 try and get the right people to the
0:22:05 right place 
WYNN: let's talk Escape strategies
0:22:08 when we're not standing out in the open
0:22:10 anywhere again I'll buy the Reynolds wrap
0:22:14 myself but I don't want to talk about
0:22:16 this in the open when there's City 
0:22:18 Gangrel
0:22:19 around 
BRITTA: all right then let's do you want
0:22:21 to go to The Haven or somewhere else
0:22:24 
WYNN: where have you guys been using
0:22:26 weathers 
WEATHERS: same locations as the sheriff
0:22:28 offices used through the years but if
0:22:32 I'm going to be honest if the Kolduns are
0:22:35 here there's really nowhere safe to
0:22:38 talk  
NEIL: is vitel still in the city 
WEATHERS: he is
0:22:41 still at large 
NEIL: okay it's another thing
0:22:45 we can look
0:22:47 into there have some thoughts about some
0:22:49 of that but I one step at a time I guess
0:22:52 
MILES: our major push is to control the
0:22:54 transportation hubs as best as we
0:22:57 can which will also give us the best
0:22:59 chance of getting out of here when
0:23:03 things if things go sideways 
Britta: let's try
0:23:07 and figure out who we have make a list
0:23:10 start assigning where they can be based
0:23:12 on what we can expect and I know that we
0:23:15 won't know where the spots really coming
0:23:17 in and how they're going to come in but
0:23:20 if we can try and assess what strikes we
0:23:23 have who can lead them then we can get
0:23:26 started 
JOHNNY: I think the the  truth of the
0:23:28 matter is there's going to be a lot of
0:23:30 New Haven we're going to have to just
0:23:31 cede we're just going to have to give it
0:23:34 over 
BRITTA: I think you're probably right 
JOHNNY: the
0:23:37 most important thing is we got to
0:23:39 survive the initial shock of this
0:23:42 Invasion 
WYNN: guys do we have a full list of
0:23:44 our resources yet 
NEIL: more or less 
ROB: Neil says
0:23:48 kind of looking around at the truck
0:23:50 
JOHNNY: miles and I have been kind of sketching
0:23:51 out what we think we've got and it based
0:23:54 on who we've got here and what we have
0:23:56 left in the city I think we have most of
0:23:58 it and we know it's not
0:24:05 enough after the Cod and their allies
0:24:08 have driven back into New Haven and gone
0:24:11 towards you know the coder has at least
0:24:13 returned to miles's Haven before like
0:24:15 big talks and as people start getting
0:24:16 their preparations for the coming saat
0:24:19 Invasion Neil leads Tim is it reasonable
0:24:23 that uh as we were driving back cuz I
0:24:25 know you had called your ghouls or we
0:24:27 calling your G about procuring some of
0:24:30 the stuff for this ritual uh would you
0:24:32 like redirected the yeah redirect
0:24:35 anything we needed yeah I just sent
0:24:37 texts they're they're on call they're
0:24:39 waiting for me at all times so after
0:24:41 they get back Neil goes down to the room
0:24:45 that Miles had prepared for him and
0:24:47 comes back up after maybe a little bit
0:24:49 too long with one of those like big blue
0:24:52 tupperware buckets brings it out to the
0:24:55 backyard is out there for maybe half an
0:24:58 hour
0:24:58 before coming back in and going uh okay
0:25:01 everybody C can you you want to come
0:25:03 back to the
0:25:06 um could you you guys join me outside
0:25:08 under the stars and um uh leave any any
0:25:12 you can leave your Sho just any anything
0:25:14 that you you don't want to get dirty
0:25:16 could probably stay in the house um cuz
0:25:19 what we're trying is different something
0:25:23 that hasn't really been done and um I
0:25:25 need uh well we'll see how it goes
0:25:30 um I'll talk you through it when we get
0:25:31 there but can you guys join me outside
0:25:33 please sure sure and outside Neil has
0:25:36 built you know those like metal fire
0:25:40 pits people have like the little cheap
0:25:41 portable ones MH he's got one of those
0:25:43 in the backyard and there is a bull
0:25:46 staked up
0:25:47 nearby and there are tarps down so
0:25:51 there's not like unlike last time where
0:25:53 he had like a bucket or whatever like
0:25:55 because there's three of them there are
0:25:56 tarps down and placed like objects in
0:26:00 circles around them that clearly he like
0:26:03 pilfered from other members of the Cod
0:26:06 like took from Miles took from brda
0:26:09 probably without them giving permission
0:26:11 that are like arranged around and then
0:26:13 some of his own things are arranged
0:26:14 around a circle on on another part of
0:26:16 the tarp there is smoke coming out of
0:26:19 the fire pit already and the bull looks
0:26:23 woozy and one of the objects that is set
0:26:28 slightly aside from Neil's circle of
0:26:30 things is a very sharp curved knife
0:26:35 um Johnny when I I am I know there's
0:26:38 things to do but we're if this works and
0:26:40 and and I I don't know if it's going to
0:26:42 work but we're going to be out
0:26:44 for a while a normal Ascension is is
0:26:49 hours almost a whole night um this is
0:26:52 Johnny puts a hand up yeah and kind of
0:26:55 has a look on his face of just
0:26:59 skepticism annoyance and also weirdly
0:27:03 acceptance I don't need to know do your
0:27:06 thing you'll be fine I'll keep an eye
0:27:09 out okay oh CU but like I said I don't
0:27:13 need to
0:27:13 know just keep the details to yourself
0:27:16 and miles and Britta and I'll be outside
0:27:21 he pops him morally in his
0:27:23 mouth well I I just I wanted to
0:27:26 like Neer actually is a detail I kind of
0:27:29 you haven't done this before with us
0:27:31 right with others no this is a a sort of
0:27:34 a I I hate to say perversion of but a a
0:27:39 it's a deviation from a deviation is a
0:27:41 good a deviation of um when I ascended
0:27:45 the ladder myself okay so with
0:27:49 this are your spirits still going to be
0:27:51 in your bodies or are you going to be
0:27:54 empty husks for all intents and purposes
0:27:56 were I don't know
0:28:00 okay I mean even if we're in our selves
0:28:04 our minds are not in ourselves okay um
0:28:07 as far as I know so ordinarily you're
0:28:10 still within yourself right like there
0:28:12 is no silver cord you are not traveling
0:28:16 the the psychic
0:28:17 realm but because I'm going to try and
0:28:21 sort of Shepherd others up the ladder I
0:28:24 I might be okay I I I don't I wish I had
0:28:27 a stronger answer but everything I'm
0:28:29 trying here is he shrugs and then looks
0:28:33 over at Miles and br br has readied
0:28:36 herself she's Barefoot and wearing a
0:28:39 very very large like sweatshirt
0:28:43 something that could get ruined for sure
0:28:46 but she is kind of looking around at the
0:28:48 objects that Neil has placed around and
0:28:51 she turns to him and she says are are
0:28:54 these things going to get ruined too
0:28:57 they're going to get blood on him what
0:28:59 kind of things has Neil taken I was
0:29:02 going to leave that up to you guys it
0:29:04 would be things that were around miles's
0:29:06 Haven although for each of you there's
0:29:08 probably one or two things that you
0:29:10 thought you misplaced over the last few
0:29:12 months that or miles the last few years
0:29:15 maybe that are just here now all your
0:29:19 left socks this
0:29:21 [ __ ] are they like big emotional
0:29:23 things or are they just things that you
0:29:25 would probably think that either Neil
0:29:28 believes have an emotional connection to
0:29:30 you or are maybe representative of how
0:29:35 Neil thinks of you so Miles none of your
0:29:39 like dignitas would be here right but
0:29:41 like a tie pin that you may have
0:29:43 misplaced at one point would be like
0:29:46 like a little silver tie pin or some
0:29:48 cuff links or something would be there
0:29:49 like whole box of business cards yeah
0:29:51 some old business cards things like that
0:29:53 like U specifically yeah there a go like
0:29:55 a a business card from like your mortal
0:29:58 life when you were a producer gotcha
0:30:00 brda it would be it would be something
0:30:02 along the lines of like it's like a
0:30:04 hairbrush that you
0:30:05 misplaced there's a shell casing or like
0:30:09 a bullet casing that's there that you
0:30:11 know there's no way to prove it but but
0:30:14 it matches the guns I used it matches
0:30:16 the guns you used in the very early
0:30:18 nights of your arrival possibly one of
0:30:21 the ones that shot veto it's a good
0:30:23 guess solid um there's also uh some like
0:30:26 loose black threads that almost just
0:30:28 look like hair until you would recognize
0:30:32 them as probably just a loose spare
0:30:34 thread or two from the Night At the Gala
0:30:37 just things that are there Neil's
0:30:39 objects are a random hodg podge of
0:30:42 [ __ ] like none of them seem to have
0:30:44 any connection but they clearly do to
0:30:47 him miles approaches some of his stuff
0:30:49 wearing a luxurious black robe with silk
0:30:54 black pants he's also Barefoot and kind
0:30:56 of toes one of them like like all right
0:30:59 Neil strips out of his clothes while
0:31:02 he's talking folds them up and puts them
0:31:05 off to the side and puts on that same
0:31:09 like Gauzy black robe with the hood that
0:31:12 at least brida and Wynn remember from the
0:31:16 first ritual the first time when they
0:31:18 went out to Wallingford I think M and
0:31:20 goes okay so what we're going to do is
0:31:23 we're all going to sit um crisscross
0:31:26 applesauce in the the middle of our
0:31:28 things here okay um and When the Smoke
0:31:33 happens when it comes to you and it will
0:31:37 just breathe and breathe deep until the
0:31:39 world starts to fade away uh I am hoping
0:31:43 that I can be there to guide you through
0:31:45 this um because I've done this for
0:31:48 myself uh a couple of times before um
0:31:51 there are layers to where we're going uh
0:31:54 the first layer is uh you have to
0:31:56 confront your fears um this is there's
0:31:59 no lying to yourselves or each other
0:32:02 it's the things you are truly deeply
0:32:05 afraid of even if you've been telling
0:32:07 yourself you haven't um this whole thing
0:32:10 is designed to strip us all bare down to
0:32:13 the psychic level the core of who you
0:32:15 are that's who we're going to try and
0:32:16 find um you have to overcome your fears
0:32:19 if if you can't overcome those fears
0:32:21 it's not going to we're not going to be
0:32:22 able to get to the next
0:32:23 part it's an awful
0:32:26 experience uh but it's also the easiest
0:32:29 part uh because after that it's
0:32:33 um it's Temptation it's so for the
0:32:37 longest time um Sorcerers would just
0:32:41 kind of go to the second layer of this
0:32:43 just to have a good time just stay there
0:32:45 for hours because it is pleasure
0:32:48 incarnate and you're not going to want
0:32:50 to leave because it great it feels good
0:32:54 uh but we have to get past that part too
0:32:57 to try and find some sort of
0:32:58 Enlightenment some sort of um missing
0:33:01 fracture of your psyches Neil yeah how
0:33:06 did you learn to leave um the the
0:33:11 pleasure denying myself good feeling has
0:33:13 never been something that was that hard
0:33:15 for
0:33:16 me um speaking of which you can spend
0:33:21 hours in there I just want you all to
0:33:24 remember Sunrise is a little bit after
0:33:27 six
0:33:28 if you are not out of this by 5:30 I do
0:33:32 not give a [ __ ] what is happening in
0:33:34 your head I am taking you out of this
0:33:36 room and putting you to bed slap the
0:33:37 [ __ ] out of us and get us awake get us
0:33:39 out of here that is that is that is the
0:33:41 hard out whether you like it or not if
0:33:44 if you
0:33:45 can any if you canot disturb us before
0:33:48 that there will be no disturbances
0:33:50 before that but I'm telling you now I am
0:33:53 not playing around and at 5:30 you're
0:33:55 coming out of this that's that's fine I
0:33:57 I Johnny gives one kind of last
0:34:00 reproachful look at the whole kind of
0:34:01 summoning Circle looks up at the sky
0:34:05 kind of nods over to Neil and then heads
0:34:07 back in towards the Haven to go
0:34:10 inside
0:34:14 um so in the psychic realm which is not
0:34:19 100% where we're going but we might
0:34:22 because again I I'm sort of trying to do
0:34:23 two things at once here uh if you find
0:34:26 yourselves floating in
0:34:28 a realm of ideas and thought rather than
0:34:31 your dreams and your pleasures and
0:34:33 whatnot um you'll be fine you'll be safe
0:34:36 you can always follow if we get there a
0:34:39 a silver chord that connects your spirit
0:34:42 to your body um do not let it get
0:34:45 severed you could be lost
0:34:48 forever I don't think we're going to get
0:34:50 there but I would be remiss if we didn't
0:34:52 talk about it
0:34:53 now uh it's um sounds like good safety
0:34:57 instuctions yeah um oh and don't be
0:35:01 embarrassed uh cuz I'm going to try and
0:35:03 bring us through this together I don't
0:35:05 know how this is going to work but we're
0:35:07 going to see possibly each other's um
0:35:11 stuff so oh extremely vague this is kind
0:35:15 of a vague Prospect miles I don't know
0:35:17 it sounds like it's going to be more
0:35:20 than personal yeah
0:35:22 yeah
0:35:24 yeah okay um
0:35:28 when when I make the cut I need you to
0:35:30 drink deep of the bowl and then we're
0:35:34 just going to breathe
0:35:37 okay okay you guys you guys ready let's
0:35:41 do this I don't think we're going to be
0:35:42 any more ready before they go Neil looks
0:35:45 up at the stars looks at each of them
0:35:48 and goes
0:35:50 okay we're going to recover your will
0:35:53 your psyches your
0:35:55 spirits so I'm going to try and bolster
0:35:59 you as best I can here before we
0:36:02 go uh minus one uh everybody has five if
0:36:07 you give me a trade of your blood to do
0:36:09 this you each have five extra willpower
0:36:12 for the purposes of this climb I do I do
0:36:16 also knel with uh a hand on like the
0:36:20 Rope around the bowl brings it
0:36:22 Forward picks up the knife and makes one
0:36:27 AK istically Swift and sharp cut across
0:36:30 its neck drinks deeply of the incensed
0:36:34 blood that is coursing through it and
0:36:36 then before the bowl like collapses sort
0:36:39 of pushes it guides it towards the two
0:36:42 of you to drink as well BR drinks as
0:36:45 instructed how much blood do we recover
0:36:49 so four pints of this blood is one blood
0:36:55 trait even though it's much larger than
0:36:58 a human the blood within its body
0:37:01 provides less sustenance to Kindred so
0:37:04 maybe one trait then yep okay as BR is
0:37:07 finishing up miles will move in the do
0:37:09 is instructed drinking deeply of the
0:37:11 bull and then it sort of wanders away
0:37:15 like a few steps and collapses dead and
0:37:20 Neil looks up at the sky and sort of
0:37:23 raises his hands out getting comfortable
0:37:25 in the middle of the circles of items
0:37:27 and and looks at the stars there are no
0:37:30 cloud cover right now if there was
0:37:32 earlier tonight Neil has clearly made it
0:37:35 so that the clouds are gone and the
0:37:36 stars are bright and starts chanting and
0:37:40 breathing as the smoke from the pit
0:37:43 starts to like you know when you sit
0:37:45 around a campfire and like the smoke
0:37:47 kind of always seems to follow wherever
0:37:49 the hell you're sitting yep the three of
0:37:51 them are sitting in a circle around the
0:37:52 smoke and it is sort of unnaturally
0:37:55 going like a like an felt Breeze pushing
0:37:58 it to each of them in turn and it's just
0:38:00 making this
0:38:02 counterclockwise smoke breathing Circle
0:38:05 and that like Bitter Sweet Smoke of the
0:38:09 clear scent of khif comes in and you
0:38:11 just take it into your lungs and breathe
0:38:14 out and it happens for a while until
0:38:17 presumably Lex the world begins to fade
0:38:19 for each of them I hope BR fixes her
0:38:23 eyes on Neil this master of the weather
0:38:26 who is C ly directing the sky the fire
0:38:31 just trying to put her faith entirely
0:38:33 into him asite magic isn't as strange to
0:38:35 her as others something deep in her
0:38:38 memory but he's definitely the
0:38:40 Touchstone of this when watches as it
0:38:44 begins and watches as they each go under
0:38:47 the transes of the smoke and keeps a
0:38:50 weather eye so to speak on the world of
0:38:53 the spirits and the world of the dead
0:38:56 because she does remember that this
0:38:58 magic has a tendency to get the
0:39:01 attention of the
0:39:03 spirits miles will follow instructions
0:39:06 kind of relax into it close his eyes
0:39:09 prepare to see where this goes I need a
0:39:12 willpower rule from everyone who is
0:39:15 attempting to climb the ladder of Heaven
0:39:18 what difficulty do you want Lex your
0:39:20 difficulty is
0:39:23 seven one success
0:39:29 one
0:39:31 success at
0:39:32 first you're not really sure if this is
0:39:36 working you watch Neil you watch each
0:39:38 other you stare off into
0:39:41 space your faces go a little numb you
0:39:46 find your senses
0:39:49 becoming less reliable perhaps actually
0:39:53 more
0:39:55 reliable and in time
0:39:58 your minds begin to
0:40:01 drift and
0:40:03 [Music]
0:40:04 eventually you are less
0:40:07 aware of the backyard por
0:40:10 lighting you can't feel the breeze
0:40:13 anymore and the world as you know it
0:40:17 becomes this
0:40:19 distant irrelevant thought and
0:40:24 then there is
0:40:29 Darkness not just some mere absence of
0:40:35 light but the very
0:40:37 concept of evil and cruelty made
0:40:41 manifest around
0:40:43 you and you can feel yourself beginning
0:40:46 to move with great
0:40:48 speed and as you
0:40:51 ascend this great Darkness gives way to
0:40:55 Briny deep and
0:40:59 water and in the distance there is what
0:41:01 is at first a very small
0:41:04 Speck and as you draw
0:41:07 close this globe begins to come into
0:41:12 view like the whole universe
0:41:15 encapsulated into this
0:41:17 sphere and you can see a beautiful blue
0:41:22 sky illuminated by a just
0:41:25 Sun its warmth is every bit as
0:41:28 real as the world you left behind but
0:41:31 this does not burn you it does not
0:41:34 strike fear into your heart you
0:41:37 recognize it as the symbol of just that
0:41:41 which stands in opposition of
0:41:44 ariman and you draw closer still and
0:41:48 half of this globe is dark earthy
0:41:53 Caverns half of this
0:41:55 globe is beautiful blue skies and
0:41:59 somewhere in the middle is where you
0:42:07 arrive and as though what comes next is
0:42:12 cobbled from your own
0:42:15 memories you begin to smell the familiar
0:42:19 scents of
0:42:22 cigarettes
0:42:24 whiskey cocaine
0:42:27 and synth
0:42:30 music and
0:42:32 Miles you are in an
0:42:36 office a cheap radio playing you haven't
0:42:39 made it big yet but you remember this
0:42:42 being one of the moments where you
0:42:44 realized with some
0:42:46 certainty that you
0:42:49 would and high
0:42:51 drunk and in your company is your friend
0:42:55 and rival
0:43:01 Marcos he's sitting on the
0:43:04 desk you're in the chair kind of sitting
0:43:07 back and the two of you are just
0:43:09 chatting over various ideas you listen
0:43:12 to mixtape after
0:43:14 mixtape just the two of you hanging out
0:43:17 with big plans on getting rich and maybe
0:43:19 not necessarily being good friends but
0:43:23 interacting with enough regularity that
0:43:25 you're part of one another's world
0:43:29 I remember the night fondly and not Jing
0:43:35 with what everything I was told about
0:43:37 our Ascent on this ladder uh decide to
0:43:40 go along with it and just
0:43:45 enjoy reliving this particular
0:43:48 memory of some of the few good times
0:43:51 that I recall prior to being a kindred
0:43:59 just playing the music enjoying the
0:44:03 banter getting probably very [ __ ] up
0:44:07 enjoying the night in a way that I don't
0:44:10 necessarily do
0:44:13 anymore knowing all of the words to Like
0:44:16 a Prayer the two of
0:44:19 you sing and enjoy it neither of you are
0:44:24 very good
0:44:25 singers but it's not really about the
0:44:28 way it sounds it's about how loud you
0:44:31 think
0:44:35 yep
0:44:38 and there is a knock at the
0:44:41 door signaling for him to keep seated
0:44:44 out I will go and check who's at the
0:44:45 door he gives you a high five pours some
0:44:50 more whiskey and just Waits and you step
0:44:54 away from the desk you cross the room
0:44:56 you open the door and waiting as though
0:44:59 he had an
0:45:01 appointment is John
0:45:04 Reiss ah miles how good it is to see you
0:45:09 again far from your usual
0:45:14 workplace what are you doing
0:45:17 here I am here to very predictably kill
0:45:21 Marcos I see you find yourself welcoming
0:45:24 him
0:45:25 in I um
0:45:27 attempt to change the script somehow I
0:45:31 feel based on everything that I've told
0:45:33 that that is not possible but I
0:45:36 will somehow try to intercede maybe
0:45:39 between myself of course perhaps Neil
0:45:44 can't change his fate but you're not him
0:45:48 are you that's correct man this is super
0:45:52 weird I would try to attack this John
0:45:56 ree I have whatever's at hand
0:46:00 and I would hit him with
0:46:02 it well you've got this big thick heavy
0:46:07 like whiskey glass in your hand uh why
0:46:11 don't you give me a DEX plus melee and
0:46:14 you may add automatic success is equal
0:46:15 to your permanent willpower am I
0:46:17 Celerity adding into this if you'd like
0:46:20 I think the answer we're looking for is
0:46:21 [ __ ]
0:46:22 yeah cocaine
0:46:29 difficulty three
0:46:32 1115 okay so with 15 successes you smash
0:46:37 the glass of marcos's head and he
0:46:39 crumbles down you Splash over gree's
0:46:43 head right I no I said what I said oh
0:46:45 [ __ ] okay with 15 successes well
0:46:49 earned miles you strike at Marcos
0:46:52 delivering an incapacitating
0:46:55 blow I
0:46:57 drop what I was holding John gives you
0:46:59 this nod everything you do Full Speed
0:47:03 Ahead and to my
0:47:05 benefit thank you again and he rests a
0:47:09 hand on Marcos and with a mere touch
0:47:13 marcos's body begins to wither and waste
0:47:16 away probably just about to where it
0:47:19 would be right now where you'd gaze upon
0:47:23 his
0:47:25 corpse I gives you a
0:47:28 nod you have it look how powerful you
0:47:31 are just a gas at how fast things are
0:47:34 moving uh I feel like at this point in
0:47:38 time I have picked up a lamp or whatever
0:47:40 and tried to hit him with it again you
0:47:42 smash the lamp against John Reiss and
0:47:45 harestad dusts the chunks of lamp off of
0:47:49 himself there it is my boy consequences
0:47:53 aren't for you they're for the people
0:47:55 around you and so long as you make
0:47:57 friends there will be people to suffer
0:47:59 in your stad good that you're so
0:48:01 Charming yes this is not how any of it
0:48:05 is supposed to
0:48:07 go
0:48:08 well I don't know if that's exactly true
0:48:12 optin
0:48:14 says you don't have plans you're an
0:48:18 opportunist why should the people that
0:48:20 fall in your way can matter at
0:48:22 all your plan is to be great to be
0:48:24 successful to be recognized
0:48:26 the ashes of the people around
0:48:29 you those don't matter why
0:48:32 pretend miles grimaces at the appearance
0:48:36 of rolands don't you call me rolands boy
0:48:39 I'm miles now you made that I'm just
0:48:44 what you really look
0:48:46 like maros sits up and the corpse is
0:48:51 so wet and withered that it doesn't
0:48:55 really seem like it should be able to
0:48:58 move and still he sits
0:49:00 up
0:49:02 miles did my death ever matter at all of
0:49:05 course then why did nothing come of it
0:49:09 why did you side with reys over and over
0:49:11 giving him every opportunity to have
0:49:13 what he wants so long as you get what
0:49:15 you want but no justice for
0:49:18 me [ __ ]
0:49:21 trying the best that I can out here I
0:49:25 don't believe you
0:49:27 no one ever does often shakes his head
0:49:30 of course they do they believe you every
0:49:32 time every time you are given the
0:49:34 benefit of the doubt because of how hard
0:49:36 you are
0:49:37 working don't they you attended a bruh R
0:49:42 and known deist and convince them that
0:49:44 they should side with you in order to
0:49:46 avoid the wrath of well diabl ists it's
0:49:49 very silly when you think of it but
0:49:51 unlike them unlike those filthy sabat at
0:49:55 least you're trying
0:49:57 as I'm looking out for them I'm trying
0:50:00 to protect
0:50:02 them protection Marcos looks at you
0:50:07 cross and frustrated you mean like from
0:50:11 Reiss I couldn't do anything to stop
0:50:14 reys you had all the
0:50:16 power the entire reason everyone's been
0:50:19 so afraid of your quarter is because
0:50:20 you're the ones with all the
0:50:22 power and it's like you can do anything
0:50:27 anything but help the people that
0:50:31 matter we've
0:50:34 been God damn it everything we've done
0:50:38 we've tried to do to protect the people
0:50:41 that
0:50:42 matter I can't fight
0:50:45 everyone miles this is not like
0:50:49 you a woman speaks in Upton's
0:50:54 place you recognize her
0:50:57 immediately Arabella
0:51:00 rolands and as she addresses you there's
0:51:03 this neon green sickly spark to her
0:51:08 Aura
0:51:10 miles you're not going to get to where
0:51:12 you need to be by apologizing for the
0:51:15 past the past is come and gone it's
0:51:17 behind you all you can do is move
0:51:20 forward take the power that you need and
0:51:24 win why are you trying to travel to
0:51:26 heaven for some salvation Enlightenment
0:51:29 that's dumb miles that's not what you
0:51:33 do you need power you need it now and
0:51:39 you need it more than ever and you've
0:51:41 known all
0:51:43 along that I can give you those
0:51:47 things give me one good reason to say
0:51:54 no the cost what is the cost miles your
0:51:58 soul you diabl [ __ ] you don't have one
0:52:00 of those we're past that not my soul
0:52:04 then what it'll be too much for those
0:52:07 around me don't tell them they will
0:52:10 inevitably find out that's just how this
0:52:12 works and then they'll forgive you
0:52:13 that's just how this works I I've done
0:52:17 one thing too far you've done like 10
0:52:19 things too far come
0:52:22 on the choices for easy power have
0:52:26 almost pushed everyone else away you're
0:52:28 absolutely right miles
0:52:32 almost I don't get to keep doing
0:52:35 that and sometimes I have to make the
0:52:38 harder
0:52:40 decision I would love to know what you
0:52:42 think is the harder
0:52:44 decision
0:52:46 because let's be honest you're not going
0:52:49 to pass these
0:52:50 tests but you don't need to pass these
0:52:53 tests you just need the power to win
0:52:57 and buddy I've got
0:53:02 that I need to trust the
0:53:05 people around me my misstep before was
0:53:09 not doing that they'll trust you if you
0:53:11 have the power of a
0:53:14 methusa no they
0:53:18 will
0:53:20 wait what do you mean they will wait
0:53:22 wait for what they will wait till the
0:53:23 problem is done and then they will leave
0:53:27 it's the end of the [ __ ] world miles
0:53:30 there's nowhere for them to
0:53:32 go well I don't think it's the end of
0:53:35 the
0:53:36 world take the power have
0:53:42 it I
0:53:45 refuse fine give it back
0:53:50 then no [ __ ] Hollow
0:53:53 words give back the power you stole from
0:53:55 up and roll have powers and what you
0:53:57 need I'm not letting you leave this room
0:54:01 until you come with me or you give it
0:54:05 up I've paid the prices for that you
0:54:10 haven't paid [ __ ] miles that's kind of
0:54:12 what I like about
0:54:15 you I am going to go forward oh yeah no
0:54:19 absolutely as soon as you turn the soul
0:54:22 over what do you think that this is a
0:54:24 thing where you just say that you've
0:54:27 learned your lesson and Zach Morris gets
0:54:29 a
0:54:30 pass prove
0:54:33 it spit him
0:54:39 out
0:54:41 fine how do I do
0:54:45 that which one which one are you doing I
0:54:48 will return Upton to you are you insane
0:54:51 take the
0:54:54 power I know Arabella that's the road
0:54:58 and path you've gone that's the road
0:55:00 you've gone the road I went come on you
0:55:03 know we're so much
0:55:05 alike hell if you knew about my plot to
0:55:09 overthrow Upton you would have [ __ ]
0:55:10 been there with me you said
0:55:13 that yes come with me let's do
0:55:17 this you still got a chance to take
0:55:20 everything you
0:55:21 deserve it's already weird enough that
0:55:24 you're climbing the ladder like a Neil
0:55:26 it was the soltion how desperate did you
0:55:28 have to get to get what you want there's
0:55:30 so many better ways to do it miles I
0:55:32 don't know any of them I
0:55:35 do so I put the trust in the people
0:55:38 around me I'm around you you made that
0:55:41 happen I'm almost sure that you're a
0:55:44 figment then what do you have to lose if
0:55:47 none of this is real and I'm just a
0:55:48 figment of your mind have some [ __ ]
0:55:52 fun and then return to your own
0:55:54 life but that's not how it works and I
0:55:57 think you know that I think you know
0:55:59 that the power that I have for you is
0:56:00 real the power to change your generation
0:56:03 at a
0:56:06 whim and the cost isn't just my
0:56:10 soul
0:56:12 actually I'm not charging you anything
0:56:14 just come with
0:56:17 me I'm going to move forward I am
0:56:21 not taking any more
0:56:24 deals mil wait Marco
0:56:30 says a shadow looms over him for a
0:56:34 moment and you can
0:56:36 feel Neil's
0:56:41 Obsession it
0:56:44 wasn't Reiss that killed
0:56:46 me
0:56:48 [Music]
0:56:52 remember I haven't forgotten
0:56:58 and there will be a time and a place for
0:57:02 that and an
0:57:06 explanation Marcos gets
0:57:10 up he puts his hand on your
0:57:13 shoulder and he says
0:57:17 well then you've made it through the

0:58:53 good can I give a suggestion
0:58:57 take that
0:58:58 deal arl's like just do it it's like
0:59:01 what happens if you take a demon deal on
0:59:04 Heaven if I take your deal can we still
0:59:09 bang um she is controlling the narrative
0:59:13 right now start saying I don't owe you
0:59:15 an explanation for the choices I make
0:59:17 I'm not doing it [ __ ]
0:59:20 off it's fine I'm I'm just ready I'm
0:59:22 ready to engage you it's just like Tim
0:59:25 just needed a
0:59:26 I think this ritual backfires on Neil
0:59:28 completely just miles Rises
0:59:32 start I've become more powerful
0:59:35 Neil you strike me down with your
0:59:37 incense and your Trinkets and I come
0:59:39 back power I got Insight NE isn't that
0:59:42 what you wanted you know to be
0:59:46 fair it would be really funny if you're
0:59:48 like can can uh can you fix what the
0:59:51 dragon did to me Char offer well then
0:59:55 [ __ ] Heaven let's
0:59:57 go that sounds much easier and more
1:00:01 expeditious and I have people to
1:00:07 protect God I'm such a bastard I might
1:00:09 take the
1:00:12 deal it's important for Tim to not feel
1:00:16 alone look that's the whole point it's
1:00:19 so much easier to just take the
1:00:22 deal you know what I'm want Bor [ __ ]
1:00:25 go that
1:00:27 till he's not on
1:00:29 board till Neil's body starts glow or
1:00:32 till uh miles's body starts glowing
1:00:36 green look I get a really cool sword
1:00:39 with one of those pants I'm just saying
1:00:41 you have you have a cool no I can make
1:00:42 it cooler I can quite literally make it
1:00:45 more powerful not if you never W up
1:00:47 already said I would help you do that
1:00:50 yeah I'm sorry
