0:00:43 died her death was
0:00:46 unexpected and my family is still
0:00:48 reeling from her
0:00:51 loss she was
0:00:53 um very
0:00:55 important not only to my family but to
0:00:58 our whole community of friends in the
0:01:00 area
0:01:02 um path of night um has a large support
0:01:06 base of of family and friends in the
0:01:08 area who've all bonded around gaming
0:01:11 telling stories and just being in each
0:01:13 other's lives and my sister was a big
0:01:16 part of that
0:01:17 Community she was responsible
0:01:22 for most of the friendships in my life
0:01:26 um the people that I game with around
0:01:29 the path of night um table are all
0:01:32 people that I would not know if it
0:01:35 weren't for my
0:01:37 sister she set me up with people um in
0:01:41 high school that I may not have reached
0:01:44 out to um and those people are sitting
0:01:48 at the table with me
0:01:49 today um she introduced me to Lex at um
0:01:54 a liveaction role playing game said I
0:01:57 think you might like this
0:01:58 guy I continued in that live action role
0:02:02 playing Circle um and met other people
0:02:04 at this
0:02:06 table I think she's just had a huge
0:02:09 impact on a lot of the people that we
0:02:12 know um a lot people to game with um in
0:02:17 fact I probably wouldn't be really
0:02:20 interested in in the world of Darkness
0:02:21 if it weren't for my sister I remember
0:02:23 seeing her role play with her friends
0:02:26 and thinking oh man that's
0:02:28 cool
0:02:30 so this is a small dedication to my
0:02:33 sister the impact she's had on me my
0:02:37 family our community and this
0:02:42 show Sarah I miss you so
0:02:46 much I love you so
0:02:52 much thank you for everything you've
0:02:55 done for
0:02:58 me and thank thank you to our listeners
0:03:01 for hearing this small dedication to a
0:03:04 wonderful woman that was taken too
0:03:19 [Music]
0:03:26 soon last time on path of night
0:03:30 BR and Pendragon confront one another
0:03:33 about their feelings and it quickly
0:03:36 devolves miles accidentally disrupts the
0:03:38 make out session between Roman pen
0:03:40 dragon and
0:03:41 brda mil sends brda to the stage in
0:03:44 order to end the rave on a high note and
0:03:46 maintain the support that the cery has
0:03:49 gained the song she performs raises the
0:03:52 energy of the event and just before the
0:03:54 night closes additional allies
0:03:56 arrive Xavier an army of Gangrel and Fel
0:04:00 arrived to The Venue intent on lending
0:04:01 their
0:04:03 [Music]
0:04:16 support when where are you right now and
0:04:19 what are you
0:04:21 doing she and Kabir have wandered off
0:04:25 definitely not into the sunset but
0:04:27 wandered off taking a break from the
0:04:28 party
0:04:30 nominally under the guise of talking I
0:04:32 don't think she really knows how to
0:04:33 start that conversation so I think
0:04:35 they've just been walking holding hands
0:04:38 fingers
0:04:39 interlaced and I think wi is just kind
0:04:41 of using this as a chance to kind of
0:04:44 come back when she was fully intent
0:04:47 earlier this evening that maybe this was
0:04:49 not maybe this was the last night and
0:04:53 there's probably some guilt going on
0:04:56 about that probably decompressing a
0:04:59 little little bit from Talking weathers
0:05:01 out of destroying the
0:05:04 city still probably a little pissed at
0:05:07 Kabir for destroying the car there's an
0:05:09 awful lot bottled up that she just
0:05:11 doesn't know how to start saying at this
0:05:14 moment as
0:05:17 you of all people find
0:05:20 yourself too lost in thought to take
0:05:23 action you notice something you might
0:05:26 not have noticed otherwise as you wander
0:05:30 the woods the two of you mhm every now
0:05:34 and again a crow perches onto a branch
0:05:38 and watches you at first it's one or two
0:05:42 then three or four and slowly but
0:05:46 surely their number reaches the
0:05:49 dozens when is deeply
0:05:53 suspicious you've seen them before mhm
0:05:57 they don't behave like animals
0:06:00 they're not natural they're's something
0:06:03 wrong at a certain point Kabir stops
0:06:07 having noticed them win yeah I see them
0:06:11 too you know the story of these no which
0:06:16 is here New England there are a faction
0:06:20 of people that almost no one is aware of
0:06:23 but their hand is behind
0:06:26 much
0:06:27 coven when kind of raises an eyebrow and
0:06:31 oh that Old Chestnut sort of expression
0:06:35 I've heard
0:06:36 stories You See The Witches who make use
0:06:39 of the
0:06:41 rodex she looks visibly aggravated by
0:06:45 the mention of the ER codex they
0:06:47 wouldn't just destroy their
0:06:49 enemies they'd cast a spell upon them
0:06:53 and turn them into
0:06:55 crows pet spies
0:06:58 minions yeah I figured it had to be
0:07:00 something like that Raven knows more of
0:07:04 this she was one of them yeah
0:07:08 these these ones always followed her but
0:07:11 she's not home right
0:07:13 now they still serve me does Kabir look
0:07:18 like he heard that no he doesn't seem to
0:07:20 he's still sort of oddly protective of
0:07:23 you he is watching these
0:07:26 crows at the sound of zopi voice when
0:07:31 instinctively shoves Kabir behind her
0:07:34 it's we can make a contested action but
0:07:37 well now's not the time he kind of like
0:07:40 get a little cozy hands on
0:07:43 ass she doesn't want to be amused by
0:07:45 that but she definitely is but I must
0:07:47 admit I do not fear an
0:07:50 audience we'll we'll come back to that
0:07:52 at some point
0:07:54 but kir there's something bad here and I
0:07:56 need you to I need you to make yourself
0:07:58 safe I don't know how to do that babe
0:08:01 you can do anything this is too much
0:08:03 responsibility all at once what do you
0:08:06 want me to do I can protect
0:08:10 you she kind of like she doesn't move
0:08:12 his hands from her ass but she like
0:08:15 grabs his hands with hers just he's got
0:08:18 like he's got like A's holding on to
0:08:20 like no that's fine that's he seized the
0:08:24 moment I'm going to embroider that on
0:08:26 her
0:08:27 jeans um I don't know I just need you to
0:08:31 be safe from him he's in my head and
0:08:35 he's going to try and hurt you because
0:08:36 that's what he
0:08:38 does well and he can't hurt me let us
0:08:42 see if he is prepared for
0:08:43 illusion
0:08:45 and a
0:08:47 tree kind of grows and appears around
0:08:50 the two of you and you can kind of see
0:08:52 the tree from within
0:08:54 it a very peculiar angle you can s you
0:08:58 can feel like cuz he's like pressed
0:09:00 right up against you you can feel he's
0:09:02 like super confident that that worked is
0:09:04 that what we're calling
0:09:06 it
0:09:09 yes inside the tree when for at least a
0:09:12 brief second she feels oddly safe inside
0:09:14 the tree with Kabir grabbing her ass
0:09:18 while the two of you hide you can see a
0:09:21 figure moving through the darkness of
0:09:24 the woods and then another and another
0:09:29 and then comes this loud swooping noise
0:09:33 and something big lands right next to
0:09:36 the
0:09:37 tree and from the corner of your eyes
0:09:40 you recognize them and have not seen
0:09:42 them for a very long time is this
0:09:45 hulking winged figure made from Stone
0:09:49 God damn it when moves her hands to like
0:09:52 she tries to like wrap her arms
0:09:54 backwards around kabir's waist just so
0:09:56 she can hold on to more of him and puts
0:10:00 herself between Kabir and the gargoyle
0:10:03 but she makes no other move to blow
0:10:05 their cover the gargoyle sniffs the air
0:10:08 from its fingers extend claws not
0:10:12 terribly unlike
0:10:13 yours and that other figure draws closer
0:10:18 the ones that walk with it right
0:10:21 alongside and as they get close enough
0:10:26 you can see them clearly with the this
0:10:29 gargoyle is a handful of
0:10:32 Kindred oh [ __ ] is that those [ __ ]
0:10:35 the
0:10:36 Constantine Hot Topic looking tremier
0:10:39 [ __ ] her name is
0:10:41 constant and yes she is one of them
0:10:45 right alongside her holding her hand is
0:10:47 Carrie with them is also Arabella
0:10:51 rolands great the other two send this
0:10:55 shiver up your spine your hackles rise
0:10:59 and you see Raven she's covered in dirt
0:11:04 filthy with this wild look in her eyes
0:11:07 she is not there and while the group of
0:11:10 them don't seem to actually clearly see
0:11:13 that there's anything unusual about this
0:11:14 tree she's watching you and with
0:11:18 absolute
0:11:20 certainty you know that
0:11:24 Zio the thing inside of Raven is staring
0:11:28 right at you
0:11:30 the other is a man with uh a slightly
0:11:34 hagged and overgrown
0:11:36 beard hair that comes down past his ears
0:11:40 has this uh very um he has a very cult
0:11:44 leader vibe to him he is wellb built for
0:11:49 whatever reason the button-down shirt
0:11:51 that he's wearing no longer has its
0:11:53 buttons and it's just wide open showing
0:11:56 off his abs around his neck hangs this
0:12:00 uh kind of the silver very thin chain
0:12:04 that has an ank hanging at the end of it
0:12:08 wind closes her eyes just so no one sees
0:12:10 her roll them yes this is a very bad
0:12:12 situation but this guy is a little too
0:12:14 much the people gathered seem to defer
0:12:18 to him and
0:12:20 interestingly when he walks Raven walks
0:12:24 it's stays close it stays to his right
0:12:28 weird you get the impression that zofi
0:12:31 might be
0:12:32 bound Kabir does not whisper to you but
0:12:36 he definitely just holds on to you and
0:12:39 remains perfectly still intent on doing
0:12:42 whatever it is that you need him to
0:12:44 do and then the man who is showing off
0:12:49 his sick
0:12:50 abs speaks
0:12:52 up when friend you are not in any sort
0:12:56 of trouble right now in fact
0:12:59 I've come all of this way to help you wi
0:13:03 has been watching and trying to
0:13:07 formulate a plan in her head for how
0:13:09 they can get out of this because she is
0:13:11 certain that this is going to come to
0:13:13 combat and while she is fairly confident
0:13:16 in her own ability to survive the
0:13:18 onslaught as always it is the people she
0:13:22 cares about that she worries about more
0:13:24 I know that
0:13:26 ambrin has been lying to you
0:13:29 using you towards nefarious ends that I
0:13:31 know you would never support I know that
0:13:33 he has bribed you with necromancy and I
0:13:36 know that he has been manipulating the
0:13:39 spirit of a boy that you care for
0:13:41 driving him to a darker path he means to
0:13:45 make you desperate and helpless he has
0:13:48 done the same to me and others
0:13:51 here when kind of Kabir will feel her
0:13:55 body tense when he brings up Joey and
0:13:59 that someone is harming him Kabir
0:14:03 responds by holding you in a grapple
0:14:05 like making it very clear he intends to
0:14:08 keep you in that tree even if you don't
0:14:11 want to and unfortunately he not it does
0:14:14 not feel like it's to hold strong enough
0:14:15 to contain you but he he he could get
0:14:18 lucky he's done it before
0:14:21 um she puts her cheek on her shoulder to
0:14:25 kind of Whisper back to him I need you
0:14:27 to call Johnny
0:14:29 and I need you to let him know where I
0:14:32 am you don't need to give him any other
0:14:35 details but let the Cod know where I am
0:14:38 you could feel one hand hesitate and
0:14:42 reluctantly leave your ass to reach for
0:14:45 his own pocket she will reach down and
0:14:47 pull his phone out of his back pocket
0:14:49 and move it to his hand he kind of
0:14:52 accepts the pass off and then flips the
0:14:56 flip phone open and while he's doing
0:14:59 that you travel in some very odd company
0:15:02 for someone who claims to call me a
0:15:04 friend the man
0:15:06 Smiles you're not wrong but I don't hide
0:15:09 it from you either I have gone down dark
0:15:13 roads but I have done so because it is
0:15:17 only there that I have found the answers
0:15:18 to the very troubles that you are
0:15:21 attempting to stop is that how you lost
0:15:23 the buttons on your shirt yes it was
0:15:26 quite the struggle sure looks like it
0:15:29 she kind of takes a breath that no need
0:15:31 for air sort of inflection more than
0:15:34 anything Kabir raises the phones that
0:15:38 you can see that it says no
0:15:41 signal she nods and lets him keep
0:15:43 holding
0:15:45 her why are you coming to me I am coming
0:15:48 to you to offer an alternative to what
0:15:52 to the lie that is the red sign to the
0:15:56 lies of ambro Giovani
0:15:59 an alternative
0:16:00 to this illusion that there is no hope
0:16:05 and no options available to
0:16:07 you I'm
0:16:09 listening the toms that they
0:16:12 seek one of them in
0:16:15 particular pertains to the secrets of
0:16:17 life and death Mastery over it the ex
0:16:21 librus necro yes he tells you that he
0:16:24 will give you all of the means that he
0:16:27 has available to him in order to help
0:16:30 however the to is all you need that to
0:16:34 carries with it the power to bring life
0:16:37 to the dead it allows you to fabricate a
0:16:41 body a permanent vessel for the
0:16:45 dead your boy need not be
0:16:48 lost and and Regina would see you pass
0:16:51 off this opportunity for salvation to
0:16:53 him so that he might claim it for
0:16:56 himself I think you should use it I
0:16:59 think you should have it for yourself
0:17:01 how
0:17:02 altruistic there's certainly something I
0:17:04 gain out of it but all I want is amrun
0:17:07 to lose why and is as I told
0:17:11 you what he is doing to you he has done
0:17:14 to
0:17:15 others my master his grace Roman pen
0:17:20 dragon has demanded that I seek all
0:17:23 manner of means to defeat the Sabbat
0:17:25 once and for all not just the Sabbat but
0:17:28 the thing in that dreaded house as
0:17:30 well he is a wise
0:17:33 leader and trusted me to safeguard the
0:17:37 camaria from the occult of threats that
0:17:39 haunt it I consider ambren one of these
0:17:42 threats when listens to all this and
0:17:45 there's an awful lot that
0:17:48 resonates some of it's conveniently
0:17:51 timed which does definitely get her
0:17:54 suspicion train rolling and she knows
0:17:57 that she's a sucker for keeping her
0:17:59 people safe and I don't think that's
0:18:02 ever been something subtle historically
0:18:05 this is how people take advantage of her
0:18:08 and of all the things she's tired of
0:18:10 being it's a tool but she does
0:18:14 listen I
0:18:16 intend to use the erod deex to harvest
0:18:20 the power of zofi he says its name out
0:18:25 loud very casually and not caring at all
0:18:28 she tenses a little bit oh tear its
0:18:30 Essence apart and do what with it wield
0:18:34 it against our enemies what are these
0:18:37 people getting out of it Define these
0:18:39 people the ones you're with right now
0:18:42 the gargoyle The Witches they are loyal
0:18:44 to me they have learned Mystic Arts
0:18:49 infernalis infernalis he nods they have
0:18:53 gained power and more importantly
0:18:56 control over their un lives all of them
0:19:00 liberated from their
0:19:02 masters how are they liberated if they
0:19:04 require a demon to give them power well
0:19:08 I should tell you the Fate that awaits
0:19:11 Kindred who die after the final death is
0:19:16 no
0:19:16 better when it is over for
0:19:19 you you will go to hell your spirit will
0:19:23 be ravaged by the things that wait
0:19:26 there how long have you been watching me
0:19:29 does it matter yes well a long time I
0:19:34 watched your triumph over the premen of
0:19:38 the clan that you
0:19:41 serve I watched you fall in
0:19:44 love I watched
0:19:47 you see to it that her mother knew the
0:19:50 story of her
0:19:52 son I watch your struggles with Mr
0:19:56 Perfect you see
0:19:58 your past your
0:20:01 future much of it is laid bare to me I
0:20:04 don't need to have been
0:20:06 there I can simply
0:20:08 know and I
0:20:11 know that amberino is not going to get
0:20:13 what he wants without
0:20:16 you and how do I get what I want if you
0:20:19 know all this information you know what
0:20:23 I want I already gave you
0:20:25 that the toome
0:20:29 if I'm not
0:20:31 Kindred well no no no don't use it on
0:20:36 yourself then how do I get what I want
0:20:39 you use it on the boy I want more than
0:20:42 one thing out of my life you have more
0:20:44 than one use of the
0:20:46 book but I think the thing you want most
0:20:50 is to help that
0:20:52 boy you're not
0:20:56 wrong what friend fresh hell am I going
0:20:58 to unleash this time in the name of
0:21:02 protecting someone I love all that
0:21:05 happens is there's one less demon one
0:21:07 more triumph over the
0:21:09 sabat one
0:21:11 less Shard of an anti deluvian
0:21:14 threatening your
0:21:15 people and one more boy living his life
0:21:19 again and what's the
0:21:22 cost a bit of danger there is something
0:21:25 I need which is pages from the ER
0:21:30 codex they were collected from a shantry
0:21:32 not long
0:21:33 ago within those pages are what I need
0:21:38 in order to tear zofel apart and use its
0:21:43 energies to accomplish our
0:21:45 ends so wi
0:21:48 contemplates for a moment trying to
0:21:50 think of what pages he wouldn't have
0:21:53 because Arabella had the book and Johnny
0:21:57 had the pages
0:21:59 which he gave to win which she gave to
0:22:02 Raven wi considers
0:22:05 this is that a decision I need to make
0:22:08 now no you have a great deal going on
0:22:12 and very much to think about and I do
0:22:14 not feel a need to rush
0:22:16 you what will happen to Raven
0:22:19 ideally she would no longer be
0:22:22 possessed there would be nothing to
0:22:24 possess her is she still in there some
0:22:29 suppressed and you can control something
0:22:32 that could suppress her oh my
0:22:35 yes feel like I should probably ask at
0:22:38 this point who the [ __ ] are you I am
0:22:42 Zachariah slain of the
0:22:45 trir Lord Reiss's oldest
0:22:48 enemy wind has a lot of feelings at the
0:22:53 moment they're not all bad but they're a
0:22:56 lot and right now she just wants another
0:22:59 khif joint on a
0:23:02 rooftop how tight a rain on his leash do
0:23:05 you have right
0:23:07 now KNE he says and it
0:23:11 kneels can you command him to tell you
0:23:13 where I
0:23:14 am he looks at it I can control its
0:23:18 physical
0:23:20 actions for
0:23:23 example bring me wind and Raven starts
0:23:26 marching towards you
0:23:30 [Music]
0:23:32 that's enough it stops she stops
0:23:35 standing right in front of the tree see
0:23:37 here's the thing our buddy here is under
0:23:41 orders not to harm me or my Cod but that
0:23:44 does not extend to all the people I care
0:23:47 about and I need some degree of
0:23:49 assurance that whatever you're going to
0:23:52 do with him is not going to cause more
0:23:55 harm to the people that I care about
0:23:58 I see no reason that anyone you care
0:24:00 about should be harmed in all of this
0:24:01 but you can't control him fully I'll put
0:24:04 it to you this way there is what control
0:24:07 I have and there is no control at all
0:24:11 one of these is to your
0:24:14 benefit how would I reach you he looks
0:24:17 to Constance and she whips out a cell
0:24:20 phone and tosses it next to the tree she
0:24:24 Ponders looking at it is there a time
0:24:28 limit the gargoyle starts to prowl kind
0:24:31 of circling the tree a time limit sort

0:25:46 to need to have a Coterie chat uh I don't
0:25:48 know what you're calling for but maybe
0:25:50 start that process rolling I I assume
0:25:53 we're going to have to have one anyway
0:25:54 since we had a few visitors tonight oh
0:25:57 what is has happened since I last saw
0:25:59 you I genuinely don't know how to
0:26:02 explain okay there were people someone
0:26:07 you may or may not want to see that
0:26:09 describes a lot of
0:26:10 people anyways your child oh sorry took
0:26:15 me a minute what a great
0:26:17 dad she passed her accounting already
0:26:19 it's
0:26:20 fine she's off to college you don't give
0:26:22 a [ __ ] about her anymore she got her own
0:26:24 life to live I you know anyways uh um
0:26:28 have you seen Neil recently I smoked a
0:26:31 joint with him on the roof okay well I
0:26:33 can't find him I mean I would start by
0:26:35 like leaving a box of disorganized
0:26:37 receipts out and see if he shows up to
0:26:39 fix it I don't have a box of
0:26:41 disorganized receipts you [ __ ]
0:26:43 wouldn't would you if he's gotten
0:26:45 kidnapped again I swear to God I'm not
0:26:47 kidding about the Baby Bjorn as when
0:26:49 hangs up with Miles She reaches out and
0:26:52 picks up the
0:26:56 phone
0:26:58 [Music]
0:26:59 Neil you've jostled about moved through
0:27:03 water at least you hope
0:27:06 so and after what has to be 20 minutes
0:27:10 of non-stop
0:27:11 movement you're plopped down into a
0:27:15 chair you hear and feel
0:27:18 chains securing you your eyes are
0:27:22 forcibly opened revealing to you a dark
0:27:26 room
0:27:28 but all of the walls are cement there's
0:27:31 pipes everywhere you're not sure where
0:27:33 the hell you are but you
0:27:36 recognize the
0:27:38 smell as the the as you remain still
0:27:42 long enough for the scent to really
0:27:45 affect your nostrils since you can't
0:27:47 quite breathe or anything right now
0:27:50 you're in the Warren deep deep
0:27:53 underground this is the realm of the NOS
0:27:56 veratu and where the Coterie was able
0:27:59 to find one of its missing members in a
0:28:01 hidden tremier facility you know they
0:28:03 would never find you here especially now
0:28:06 without you because your eyes can't move
0:28:10 you quickly lose track of the man who
0:28:13 has kidnapped you but eventually you
0:28:17 hear the sounds of a chair being
0:28:21 dragged to you he flips it to its facing
0:28:25 backwards and run sit
0:28:29 the two of you are face to face he
0:28:31 reaches out he pulls the steak from your
0:28:36 heart you try
0:28:38 anything
0:28:40 well don't try
0:28:42 anything Neil blinks his eyes and rolls
0:28:45 them around because you know having them
0:28:47 forced open and unable to move he just
0:28:50 sort of adjust the chains clink a little
0:28:53 bit as he kind of like moves his body uh
0:28:55 in relief uh and then looks at Renwick
0:28:58 and goes I would have come willingly if
0:29:05 maybe what was the point of that I don't
0:29:07 know why aren we going that you're just
0:29:09 going to come willingly I also don't
0:29:10 know whether or not this guy who has
0:29:14 Fester has you under his sway you hurt
0:29:16 Fester Fester's terrified of you that
0:29:21 visibly puts like a look of just utter
0:29:23 despair on Neil's face his eyes narrow
0:29:28 if fer can't trust you how can
0:29:33 I
0:29:34 not terrible point I I I guess
0:29:38 um why aren't we uh why aren't we doing
0:29:43 something though like what what do we
0:29:45 need what what do I need to do fester in
0:29:49 a box you need to focus on answering the
0:29:50 questions that I have so I can get to
0:29:52 the bottom of
0:29:53 this you've been witnessed to a lot okay
0:29:56 well then hurry up with the questions
0:29:58 then because I I'm worried about my
0:30:00 friend on the night you were being held
0:30:03 awaiting trial for sins against the
0:30:07 camaria what happened how did you get
0:30:10 out of that get out of the trial for the
0:30:14 for the blood yeah the ASM my ties are
0:30:17 obvious now you're literally guilty of
0:30:19 everything you were accused of not
0:30:22 everything I was being accused of being
0:30:24 a diabl I was accused of being my sire
0:30:26 in disguise I think's made it stance on
0:30:29 diabl pretty [ __ ] clear it has
0:30:32 not
0:30:34 I I have
0:30:36 not or maybe I have but not in the way
0:30:39 that you're accusing me of explain I'm
0:30:42 not a deist don't [ __ ] me I'm not a
0:30:45 [ __ ] diabl you look [ __ ] me then
0:30:47 look how do I know that you haven't
0:30:50 reduced your generation not just Soul
0:30:52 masking and hiding
0:30:54 it because I can't do that you want to
0:30:56 go find a TR test my blood is that a
0:30:59 [ __ ] joke everyone knows that the TR
0:31:01 pulling out of this area be almost
0:31:04 impossible to find
0:31:06 one and you would know that because
0:31:08 you've been providing information to
0:31:10 Marcus
0:31:11 vitel I've never even met Marcus Vel the
0:31:15 first time I've even seen the guy was
0:31:17 when I looked back in the bathroom that
0:31:19 guy spends a third of his time up your
0:31:21 Prince's ass what do you mean you've
0:31:22 never seen him before I haven't even
0:31:24 been around all I know is that now I'm
0:31:26 back
0:31:28 and immediately before we had to deal
0:31:30 with everything with a rave miles was
0:31:32 like you got to keep an eye on this guy
0:31:33 because he's constantly around he keeps
0:31:35 being the places I am and I don't trust
0:31:37 him [ __ ] that what happened between you
0:31:41 and
0:31:43 fester the nighty burnt is that what
0:31:46 you're talking about or you talking
0:31:47 about in general what happened to the
0:31:49 nighty burnt fester and I went to the
0:31:52 party the gala that that Prince Warick
0:31:56 was the kill box the what the killbox
0:32:01 well yeah that's what it became he gets
0:32:04 quiet when all the [ __ ] saat showed
0:32:06 up yeah I
0:32:08 didn't I was there to get BR back from
0:32:11 Pendragon and you were involved in the
0:32:13 Pendragon Escape yeah because we were
0:32:16 surrounded by sabat [ __ ] dying and
0:32:20 fester got left behind left to just what
0:32:23 die because I saw all the nas ratu
0:32:25 disappear but he was still there alone
0:32:27 in a truck trying to get away thank God
0:32:29 I found him and and and
0:32:32 and yeah Pendragon was there and BR was
0:32:35 there and a couple other bruha I don't
0:32:37 know their names but yeah of course we
0:32:39 got out of there we escaped it was it
0:32:40 was a saat Invasion and why'd you light
0:32:43 down on fire if you on the same side if
0:32:45 you're a hero why is he so terrified of
0:32:50 you sometime I I have theories on this
0:32:53 one I I don't know but sometime I think
0:32:56 the night before my trial when I was
0:32:57 being held or just before the dawn I I
0:33:02 vaguely remember somebody somebody I
0:33:03 didn't recognize coming into the room
0:33:05 where I was being held I now have reason
0:33:07 to believe that was my sire coming back
0:33:10 for like your sire and he he he got in
0:33:13 my head back from the dead just to get
0:33:15 in your head dead he's not dead your
0:33:18 sire's dead pal what happened between
0:33:21 you infester what do you mean my sire's
0:33:22 dead no he isn't he's been in alamut for
0:33:24 like decades he abandoned the Mar in Ran
0:33:27 what do you mean tell me what happened
0:33:28 with you infester I'm getting there I'm
0:33:30 trying to get there get there my sire
0:33:34 got in my head and it was just fester
0:33:37 and I we managed to escape with
0:33:38 Pendragon and BR and Pendragon took Bri
0:33:41 to a room with another bruha and then
0:33:44 the other brewha and then the other
0:33:48 brewha she brought fer and I out into a
0:33:52 different hotel room on the way back
0:33:53 because the sun was coming up and so is
0:33:55 she she was was uh she decided to just
0:33:58 take a shower I guess and and who was
0:34:01 she I don't know to one of bruha one of
0:34:03 bras one of Pendragon's like guards and
0:34:06 okay so it's you fester and a nameless
0:34:08 guard I don't know her name I'm so maybe
0:34:11 that was rude but I was terrified of
0:34:12 Pendragon and everything that had
0:34:14 happened earlier in the night with the
0:34:15 sabat okay what happened next then uh it
0:34:19 was just me and fester talking um trying
0:34:22 toig alone yeah go on what to do next
0:34:26 and then all I remember is just these
0:34:30 words and and images
0:34:32 and uh the way the way will be be open
0:34:36 Through Fire something something like
0:34:37 that it was confused and then all I
0:34:40 remember after that is there were Scorch
0:34:43 marks and the shattered remains of a of
0:34:46 a Molotov and a broken window and fester
0:34:48 running screaming into the Dawn I was
0:34:51 terrified and then my sire came out of
0:34:55 the bathroom and the the the bruha was
0:34:57 Stak she was staked on the floor in the
0:35:00 shower not not staked um on in torper
0:35:06 though she she had been tored uh through
0:35:10 abilities of my sire has that he's
0:35:12 learned from the asites and we had a
0:35:14 discussion and he said you have to walk
0:35:18 the path of blood and reclaim the
0:35:19 heart's blood and he wanted me to deize
0:35:21 this bruha and I I couldn't do that
0:35:23 that's insane that's monstrous and I he
0:35:25 he left and and I I I ran I I panicked
0:35:28 and I ran and just ran away who else can
0:35:31 corroborate this
0:35:34 story BR and Pendragon know that like
0:35:37 everything at least up to the point
0:35:38 where we got into the hotel room but
0:35:40 after that it would just be the two of
0:35:41 us and and whoever Pendragon's guard is
0:35:45 she your sire would died to a blood hunt
0:35:47 almost a half decade ago he didn't die
0:35:50 to a blood hunt who said he he died to a
0:35:52 blood hunt it's recorded I've got the
0:35:54 logs well somebody lied then because
0:35:56 he's not dead then who else saw him who
0:35:59 else saw him yes well they saw him a few
0:36:01 times but he's always wearing a disguise
0:36:02 Who's the who else the who else saw and
0:36:05 Ed him Ed him nobody just me just you
0:36:10 but he came after us in in in Boston
0:36:13 okay fine who saw him then uh well no
0:36:16 nobody cuz he was in obvious gate then
0:36:18 how do you know then how do I know what
0:36:21 that someone else saw him how do you
0:36:23 know that you saw him well because I
0:36:25 could see him
0:36:27 you could see him but no one else could
0:36:29 he was wearing a different face so how
0:36:31 do you know it was him I didn't put that
0:36:33 together until afterwards when we were
0:36:34 talking in the hotel and the same with
0:36:37 the the woman who ate juw ear in New
0:36:39 York okay fine who saw him uh the woman
0:36:43 in New York the whole Coterie did but did
0:36:45 they see him they saw a woman cuz he was
0:36:47 wearing a different
0:36:48 face which so he came in he threw a mol
0:36:51 aough cocktail or was it
0:36:54 you it was
0:36:58 it was me but
0:37:01 because because he got in my head
0:37:04 because apparently unlike me unlike the
0:37:08 rest of
0:37:09 us he's still capable of dominating
0:37:13 people around him how much do you trust
0:37:15 your own
0:37:17 memories I I would have said I trusted
0:37:20 them a lot but
0:37:23 now I didn't even remember him coming I
0:37:26 didn't even remember when things were
0:37:27 put into my head until the bottle was
0:37:30 out of my hand so I don't
0:37:33 know you want me to be totally honest I
0:37:35 don't
0:37:39 know what do you know about the coming
0:37:41 saas Siege I know that a a pack called
0:37:45 The Killing Spree has been here for a
0:37:47 little while trying to sew chaos I know
0:37:50 that there's a mole somewhere in the
0:37:51 city feeding information to the sabat uh
0:37:55 specifically one of them
0:37:57 ran a wore a ghoul suit to go talk to um
0:38:01 I don't know this I don't know their
0:38:02 ranks in the saat but the a l Sombra
0:38:05 named Carmen um from the killing spray
0:38:07 when they were all in New York uh
0:38:10 talking I I know that much um miles
0:38:14 wanted me to look for the mole I I
0:38:16 haven't had much of a chance yet like I
0:38:18 said in the same with the Marcus Vitel
0:38:20 thing I was looking I was waiting until
0:38:21 we were going to hold court again and
0:38:23 start looking for the
0:38:25 patterns when I looked at the ghoul suit
0:38:28 whoever it was was strong enough to to
0:38:30 hide who they were
0:38:32 and it's hard to hide things for me so I
0:38:36 was but you didn't think this possession
0:38:37 suit using offu skate was your
0:38:39 sire no
0:38:42 why it
0:38:45 didn't because my sire was a zealot but
0:38:49 a different kind than the sabat and the
0:38:52 what if this was just another face I
0:38:53 don't get it where do you draw the line
0:38:55 Neil actions
0:38:57 actions have patterns and whoever was in
0:39:00 the ghoul suit was being promised
0:39:02 Archbishop ship of New Haven and that is
0:39:04 not a thing my sire gives a [ __ ] about
0:39:06 my sire is obsessed with Justice of
0:39:09 killing the get of Cen except you
0:39:11 haven't seen him in decades I saw him no
0:39:13 idea we ago and before
0:39:16 that it was a long
0:39:19 time because he
0:39:21 left because he ran after whatever
0:39:26 change in him
0:39:27 changed or maybe nothing ever changed
0:39:29 and I just started seeing him
0:39:30 differently I don't know vital as Fester
0:39:34 yes I saw it I've been looking into
0:39:37 vel's past it's not
0:39:40 good I thought he was the prince in
0:39:43 Washington he was the prince in DC but
0:39:47 he came in as some sort of young neonate
0:39:49 early on took the place by storm and
0:39:51 then no one expected he's
0:39:55 powerful powerful ful in ways that no
0:39:57 young Kindred could be he swept in he
0:40:01 took over he started looking for
0:40:03 information on intercontinental
0:40:06 ballistic Weaponry what this guy is
0:40:10 insane he was influential and extremely
0:40:13 powerful but someone had something on
0:40:15 him that forced him to leave his City
0:40:18 and go with the fleeing
0:40:20 princes and if my information is right
0:40:24 it's the
0:40:25 vios he's in touch with the Vykos in
0:40:28 some way that
0:40:31 would
0:40:33 miles for whatever reason I I haven't
0:40:36 gotten a chance to look into yet was
0:40:37 pretty convinced that vital was bad
0:40:42 news and when I came back with the idea
0:40:46 uh with the knowledge that there was a
0:40:48 mole in the city like directly feeding
0:40:51 Secrets uh I I knew well that's I think
0:40:55 there's a reason that was where I was
0:40:56 going to
0:41:00 start
0:41:02 so I mean if he's a a vent powerful vent
0:41:06 wouldn't be that hard to get a
0:41:08 possession suit I was trying to track
0:41:11 down or I might bad news buddy I don't
0:41:12 think this guy's a
0:41:14 Ventrue what what do you
0:41:17 mean on more than one occasion when
0:41:19 being watched he's demonstrated control
0:41:21 over darkness is L Sombra their City My
0:41:25 City
0:41:27 my city yeah we don't know yet I
0:41:31 know my City's got a Las Sombra stalking
0:41:34 it hand up the prince's ass puppeting
0:41:37 him he's not puppeting miles how do you
0:41:40 know how do I know you're not being
0:41:42 puppeted by this guy I mean I guess you
0:41:45 don't but I can I can say pretty
0:41:49 definitively that
0:41:51 miles is by nature resistant to being
0:41:54 someone's puppet he worked for in plenty
0:41:57 long time and look where that went looks
0:41:59 like Roman Pendragon's got a an
0:42:02 interest in his Affairs every time I see
0:42:05 this guy he's involved with some kind of
0:42:07 Elder what the [ __ ] do you mean he's not
0:42:08 interested he's not resilient he leans
0:42:13 in a
0:42:15 neonate who is constantly being harassed
0:42:21 or challenged or tried to be bought by
0:42:24 elders and he's
0:42:27 he's still in charge of the
0:42:28 city he hasn't buckled he said no to pen
0:42:32 Dragon
0:42:34 he's made deals with Elders to keep
0:42:39 things moving in the city but someone's
0:42:44 puppet it would surprise
0:42:47 me how do I know that I can trust you it
0:42:51 kind of finally says just
0:42:54 flustered the the honest answer is I
0:42:58 don't know trust has been kind of hard
0:43:01 to come by these days here's what I know
0:43:03 the camel has been falling apart turning
0:43:06 on itself in this city that's by Design
0:43:09 the
0:43:10 attack the one the Happ on the maner the
0:43:13 one where Elsa Lyon bit it Leo like
0:43:16 looks sad when that is mentioned there
0:43:18 was information of a coming attack wait
0:43:22 the web knew that was going to happen
0:43:23 agents were sent to Monitor and then
0:43:26 watched them close in on the
0:43:28 location Warick abandoned us Warick left
0:43:32 political Rivals to be destroyed that
0:43:35 was just a just a move on the board in
0:43:37 the Jihan that's that's all that was
0:43:38 everything is just a move on the board
0:43:40 that's why I'm trying to figure out your
0:43:41 involvement you're a move on the board
0:43:43 Neil but who's whose move are
0:43:47 you I'd love to say mine but I
0:43:52 don't I don't know I'm just trying
0:43:55 to how much am I and Neil stops and
0:43:59 looks around shifts a little bit uh in
0:44:02 the
0:44:03 chains went for a [ __ ] penny I guess
0:44:07 um have you looked in the sky recently
0:44:10 I'm going to punch you in the face can
0:44:12 we please stay on topic this is on topic
0:44:15 no it is not on top yes it is you asked
0:44:16 me whose move I'm I am and then you ask
0:44:20 me if I look at the sky because I need
0:44:22 to know the Baseline that I'm working
0:44:23 here with because my answer doesn't make
0:44:25 sense unless I know you're on the same
0:44:28 page that I'm on and that means looking
0:44:30 at the sky have you seen the red
0:44:33 star have you seen the signs of gehenna
0:44:38 Renwick the end times the final nights
0:44:41 it's a fairy tale it's not they went
0:44:43 through the same thing in the dark AG
0:44:45 they thought it was the end of the world
0:44:47 and they thought that the coming of the
0:44:48 13th generation would be the Doom of
0:44:51 Kindred kind guess what pal it wasn't it
0:44:54 just sucked and it's going to suck again
0:44:57 and then things will be fine and then
0:44:59 there's going to be another GNA problem
0:45:02 and things are going to suck again for a
0:45:04 while Shaw was trafficking pages of the
0:45:05 book of
0:45:07 not and I got my hands on them your sire
0:45:10 I used to do a lot of work for your sire
0:45:11 and then you read the Sabbat propaganda
0:45:14 no this is older than sabat propaganda
0:45:17 oh come on and I saw the signs okay you
0:45:20 and I both traffic saw sign I did see
0:45:22 the sign what were the signs Neil what
0:45:24 are the signs the signs are everywhere
0:45:26 they are small and big they are the star
0:45:29 in the sky they are the the a lot of
0:45:32 stuff that I don't necessarily know if I
0:45:33 want to talk about okay fine you see all
0:45:35 the stuff where's your
0:45:37 sire somewhere W okay so you see the end
0:45:40 of the world literally everywhere and
0:45:42 can't say where the [ __ ] your sire is
0:45:44 yeah this guy who's been dead by the way
0:45:46 for five years whose name is on that

0:46:12 yeah yeah I absolutely
0:46:15 am no question as sure as I
0:46:19 am that the end is coming so you want to
0:46:22 know whose side I'm on I'm on the side
0:46:24 where I just want to be close to the
0:46:25 people I care about when the world Burns
0:46:29 and everything falls
0:46:30 apart and nothing else really matters
0:46:33 I'm just trying to do a little bit of
0:46:34 good before it all
