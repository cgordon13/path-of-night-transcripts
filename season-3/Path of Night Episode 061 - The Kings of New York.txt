0:00:41 last time on path of night
0:00:44 the group finally escaped from The Shane
0:00:45 trip miles introduced the quotery IRA
0:00:48 and Eden to their New Haven
0:00:51 Neil woke to visions of ravana familiar
0:00:54 faces and new a red star hung in the sky
0:00:58 and the bruja introduced him to
0:01:01 Catherine and asked him to secretly
0:01:03 investigate the Sabbath
0:01:05 Neil began his infiltration
0:01:09 [Music]
0:01:16 foreign
0:01:16 [Music]
0:01:28 Falls
0:01:30 one at a time
0:01:32 in the group of you become aware again
0:01:35 of your surroundings
0:01:37 and recall with vivid memory
0:01:40 what took place just last night
0:01:43 some of you have not found peace and a
0:01:46 safe place
0:01:48 or multiple nights at this point
0:01:50 I'm gonna go around in a circle and I
0:01:53 want each of you
0:01:55 to describe how you make your way
0:01:59 to the den the Gathering Place Within
0:02:02 this New Haven
0:02:04 if you go at all
0:02:06 Johnny
0:02:09 's eyes open up
0:02:12 and for a second he's kind of confused
0:02:14 about where he is
0:02:16 and then seeing all of the decorations
0:02:19 that Miles has put in
0:02:22 with Johnny in mind he immediately kind
0:02:25 of puts things back together and centers
0:02:28 himself is okay all right
0:02:31 he sits up from the bed a little bit too
0:02:34 soft for Johnny's tastes
0:02:36 he kind of feels over the damage from
0:02:38 last night at this point his hair has
0:02:41 grown back
0:02:43 his eye is now starting to work again
0:02:46 the vampiric curse does have its
0:02:50 benefits
0:02:52 and being able to survive a night like
0:02:54 he did last night and already be
0:02:56 recovering is one of them
0:02:59 so he celebrates with the morally he
0:03:01 grabs the pack of cigarettes he pilfered
0:03:04 from IRA and he probably smoked most of
0:03:09 them in the early morning before he fell
0:03:12 into sleep but there's still a couple
0:03:14 left so he pops her in his mouth
0:03:17 lights it up and then looks over to see
0:03:19 what kind of clothes have been tucked
0:03:23 away in this room so you have a variety
0:03:26 of your normal wear between flannels and
0:03:30 various Levi's 501s and whatnot but
0:03:33 there's also a closet containing a
0:03:35 number of things more
0:03:36 uh suitable for a center shawl baby
0:03:39 there's a number of dress shirts and
0:03:41 pants and and fitted belts with like
0:03:44 Blazers and stuff like that and like
0:03:45 actual dress shoes he knew your sizes
0:03:48 there's also like there's a pretty
0:03:50 decent looking like sound system there
0:03:53 it's like the only real major
0:03:54 accommodation besides like a couple
0:03:56 signed posters from bands we've talked
0:03:58 about they're like framed and whatnot in
0:04:01 the room late 80s early 90s kind of um
0:04:04 so there's like a cassette player but
0:04:06 there's also like a record thing on top
0:04:08 of it with like those huge ass speakers
0:04:09 in like one corner with a bunch of
0:04:11 different uh records and cassettes based
0:04:13 on things we've had discussions about
0:04:15 she only fiddles with the sound system a
0:04:17 little bit and puts on some some music
0:04:19 not blaring it he's doesn't want to wake
0:04:22 everybody in the house up but just
0:04:24 enough to kind of calm down Center him
0:04:27 as he looks through this weird wardrobe
0:04:30 of clothes that he would definitely wear
0:04:31 but just you know it's not his and takes
0:04:34 out some some jeans puts on yeah a
0:04:37 t-shirt kind of looks through some of
0:04:39 the the fitted shirts and and dress
0:04:41 pants with a little bit of unease
0:04:44 it's almost like looking into a future
0:04:46 of being a respectable
0:04:47 that he really does not want to ever get
0:04:51 to
0:04:53 and then looks through the collection of
0:04:54 shoes doesn't really see any work boots
0:04:57 like he's used to but uh there is a pair
0:04:59 of cowboy boots that he ends up putting
0:05:02 on
0:05:03 and after he uh kind of stretches out a
0:05:06 bit
0:05:07 gets the clothes on heads out to the uh
0:05:10 living space to see where the rest of
0:05:12 the codery is
0:05:17 what kind of bed did Miles pick out for
0:05:20 a win
0:05:21 um they all have about king-sized beds
0:05:23 typically these rooms are not small even
0:05:26 the individual rooms are not small so
0:05:29 the the beds are huge it's pretty
0:05:31 normalish overall miles doesn't really
0:05:33 think about the beds too much because
0:05:34 we're not really around to experience
0:05:37 them half most of the time the wind is
0:05:39 coming from pretty much she hasn't slept
0:05:41 on something that's not an army cot
0:05:45 or in the ground so before she goes to
0:05:49 bed when kind of walks around the
0:05:52 circumference of the room just taking it
0:05:56 in kind of instinctively learning the
0:05:58 borders of her space it's probably
0:06:01 unnecessary at this point but she does
0:06:02 take a shower noting how very weird the
0:06:06 water feels hitting where her hair used
0:06:08 to be where her eyebrows used to be and
0:06:11 as she showers she notices that the
0:06:13 scrap of flannel from her dad's shirt
0:06:15 that she's worn on her wrist for a while
0:06:18 now was a casualty of the Dragon Fire
0:06:22 as she realizes that it's not there she
0:06:25 starts
0:06:26 processing
0:06:28 how close to the end she could have
0:06:30 gotten
0:06:31 and it's probably a fair amount of time
0:06:33 goes by that she just kind of stands in
0:06:36 the shower thinking and eventually she
0:06:39 some noise in the house maybe a heater
0:06:41 kicking on maybe a you know just a fan
0:06:43 somewhere maybe the smell of Johnny
0:06:45 cigarette smoke just brings her back out
0:06:48 of her head and she turns the water off
0:06:50 and towels off heads to bed she doesn't
0:06:54 really remember falling asleep she just
0:06:57 remembers that this must be what luxury
0:06:59 feels like to lie in a bed like this
0:07:02 and when she wakes up there is just a a
0:07:06 fountain of her hair in her face where
0:07:09 it has regrown
0:07:10 it's probably in her mouth she blows it
0:07:13 past her lips and it's stands up and
0:07:15 kind of wraps one of the blankets around
0:07:17 herself as she goes to investigate the
0:07:19 clothes that Miles has procured and kind
0:07:22 of takes a minute to appreciate the
0:07:24 details that he's added your initial
0:07:26 clothing offering is not terribly
0:07:28 different than Chinese
0:07:31 your room is different in the sense that
0:07:33 there's no real electronics that exist
0:07:35 in here Yuri is a a very large bookshelf
0:07:38 that takes up a wall and you can tell by
0:07:40 perusing over it that each shelf is a
0:07:43 different kind of genre like there's a
0:07:45 collection of occult books there's a
0:07:46 collection of like prose and poetry and
0:07:49 there's a collection of like philosophy
0:07:50 and stuff like that all on different
0:07:52 shelves that he's either noted you'd
0:07:54 been reading before or just kind of
0:07:56 asked somebody else that knew more about
0:07:58 the stuff than he did and then other
0:08:00 than that there's some like framed
0:08:01 artwork around there that he he decided
0:08:05 that would be I don't know appropriate
0:08:06 for his like Landscaping type deals but
0:08:10 like there's always like a hint of like
0:08:12 darkness and all of them to like at the
0:08:14 same time they're not like oppressive
0:08:16 but they're just not they're not just
0:08:18 idyllic in a lot of ways
0:08:21 um you also have a closet full of
0:08:23 clothes that
0:08:24 um much like Johnny or fitted to there
0:08:28 are a couple dresses just in case
0:08:31 what what are these like ball gowns or
0:08:34 these like cocktail dresses uh they're a
0:08:37 little bit of both but like most of them
0:08:38 are just not they're not gonna hamper
0:08:40 your function or whatnot they're just
0:08:41 dresses to be more dressy in a lot of
0:08:44 ways like to change it up if you wanted
0:08:46 to completely surprise an individual
0:08:49 that's that's what they exist as and a
0:08:52 couple of the like at least two of them
0:08:54 go along well with the snake pattern
0:08:57 that you have in terms of coloring but
0:08:59 other than that yeah you have fitted
0:09:00 shirts and pants and stuff like that you
0:09:02 in in the same way that you could also
0:09:05 look like some sort of enforcer uh
0:09:07 a series of different boots and work
0:09:09 shoes and and whatnot all exist in there
0:09:12 including some heels
0:09:14 Wayne definitely looks at them like with
0:09:16 all right maybe I won't wear it but if I
0:09:18 could carry it I could definitely do
0:09:19 some damage with that but she
0:09:22 takes a moment to appreciate
0:09:25 the time and effort it must have gone
0:09:27 into the money means very little to
0:09:29 Miles she understands that it's just
0:09:31 it's a he's a venture money is gonna be
0:09:33 there but the care he's taken is a much
0:09:37 more precious commodity and she is kind
0:09:40 of overwhelmed for a minute that he has
0:09:42 taken this much time to ensure that she
0:09:45 is understood via her clothing and
0:09:48 aesthetic choices so she puts on some
0:09:51 jeans and a tank top and then throws a
0:09:54 flannel over it she kind of cuffs the
0:09:56 jeans and doesn't bother putting on
0:09:58 shoes her feet look like someone who was
0:10:00 barefoot most of the time and she just
0:10:03 kind of pads up the stairs kind of gives
0:10:06 Johnny a nod
0:10:11 right now I think the first question
0:10:13 before I get into the description is how
0:10:16 you've differentiated bretta's room and
0:10:19 what clothing you've left for her I
0:10:21 think there's a lot of things from the
0:10:23 cafe that you had kept around that I
0:10:26 replicate in some ways the one for your
0:10:28 specific room in terms of like General
0:10:30 textures and whatnot there seems to be
0:10:33 an area where there's a generous amount
0:10:35 of like art supplies and whatnot going
0:10:37 on there there is your own little stereo
0:10:41 system type deal with the number of CDs
0:10:43 and whatnot that we discussed about plus
0:10:45 the collection that we talked about
0:10:47 before so in a sense you have it in two
0:10:49 different places a series of books also
0:10:52 exist in there but different and more
0:10:54 towards the the art and the pros but
0:10:57 different than the ones that we might
0:10:58 have there's definitely some art in your
0:11:01 wall but there's more looks like spaces
0:11:03 have been left
0:11:04 specifically like frames with nothing in
0:11:07 them for you to add to your own things
0:11:09 later you have a variety of clothing
0:11:11 that was existed previously when you
0:11:14 lived with Miles a number of things that
0:11:16 can be used both business wear and
0:11:17 whatnot and he paid attention to some of
0:11:19 the stuff you wore before but you also
0:11:21 were kind of chameleon-esque in some
0:11:22 ways so like there's just a whole lot of
0:11:24 variety for you to utilize including a
0:11:28 number of very very expensive very well
0:11:30 tailored dresses and business suits if
0:11:33 you wanted to go that way you have a
0:11:34 much larger selection of the nicer stuff
0:11:37 than uh when in Johnny we're setting our
0:11:41 ways and they're kind of easy predict
0:11:42 it's almost like you're giving her this
0:11:44 like weird space that she can kind of
0:11:46 grow into right
0:11:48 how do you address you know I mean you
0:11:52 also unlike the other two will have an
0:11:54 extensive makeup collection that you
0:11:56 have access to there's a lot more stuff
0:12:00 per se in your room than there is in a
0:12:02 way they're kind of a little bit more
0:12:04 Spartan on top of that like you go into
0:12:07 the bathroom and there's just a lot more
0:12:09 stuff in the bathroom well that's
0:12:11 actually irrelevant because I think the
0:12:13 the previous night Beretta would have
0:12:15 taken a very long shower and basically
0:12:19 tried to scrub her skin off so if
0:12:21 there's a collection of products there
0:12:24 she would have spent a very long time
0:12:27 getting every trace of any anything off
0:12:32 of herself not that it would help shoot
0:12:34 so feel like it's there but after she
0:12:38 took that shower and tried to feel clean
0:12:41 and failed she would have gone around
0:12:45 the room and collected all the pillows
0:12:48 off the bed anything soft the the
0:12:51 comforter off of it dragged it into the
0:12:54 closet in the closet she would have
0:12:55 grabbed the cheapest softest thing that
0:12:59 you've provided that she could wear put
0:13:01 it on and set up this clean very hidden
0:13:06 away very tightness almost like she's
0:13:09 trying to replicate the feeling of her
0:13:11 sleeping bag or like she's trying to
0:13:15 hide from the world and when she finally
0:13:19 wakes up hidden away in that closet and
0:13:22 all the blankets and everything that
0:13:23 she's put there she doesn't she doesn't
0:13:26 leave it the codery doesn't see her come
0:13:29 out of her room
0:13:35 Ira Ira wakes up in miles is nice but
0:13:42 unpersonalized unadorned guest room the
0:13:45 way that he fell asleep
0:13:47 which is sitting with his back against a
0:13:50 wall in the corner of the room where he
0:13:53 can see the doorway and the window he
0:13:57 fought sleep as hard as he could for as
0:14:00 long as he could but he is Kindred and
0:14:03 succumbed to the sun just like everybody
0:14:04 else
0:14:06 his mind filled with thoughts he has
0:14:10 never in some ways failed like this
0:14:13 before he has always managed to keep
0:14:16 cover long enough to call a council of
0:14:19 the Asters so that a perpetrator could
0:14:22 be taken in
0:14:24 he has never outed himself before
0:14:26 certainly not for some [ __ ] kid
0:14:30 and he falls asleep with thoughts that
0:14:33 at any second from somewhere in the
0:14:36 astral plane his head will fly from his
0:14:39 shoulders his blood will boil in his
0:14:41 body and he won't he can stop it if he
0:14:43 just stays awake
0:14:45 so when he wakes up the next evening he
0:14:47 is
0:14:48 sort of awake with a start back to the
0:14:50 wall still looking around checking to
0:14:53 make sure he's not dead hand going up to
0:14:56 his face where his like jowls his face
0:14:58 got pulled off into jowls like even
0:15:00 though he healed it yesterday it still
0:15:02 reflex of snapping back from that Panic
0:15:04 about you know the uh the perp got away
0:15:07 and knows my ID to the horrors that were
0:15:11 underneath the Chantry the feeling of
0:15:13 his face getting pulled apart uh and
0:15:15 then his hand goes down to his gut where
0:15:17 most but not all of the damage from the
0:15:20 chainsaw has been healed at this point
0:15:22 there's not like clothes in the guest
0:15:24 room yeah there's a variety of just
0:15:26 generic stuff sweats and a t-shirt kind
0:15:28 of deal sweats and a t-shirt there's
0:15:30 some just like a couple different sizes
0:15:31 of buttoned up shirts some jeans in
0:15:34 various sizes it's pretty extensive but
0:15:36 nothing interesting
0:15:39 he gets up
0:15:42 once he realizes he's not dead
0:15:44 shakely looks around
0:15:46 looks through the clothes in the drawers
0:15:48 finds like a pair of jeans and a
0:15:51 button-up shirt and his size takes his
0:15:53 sneakers into the bathroom and like uses
0:15:56 like a guest toothbrush
0:15:58 to like clean them off make sure they
0:16:00 look okay and puts those back on and
0:16:03 heads out with like a purpose of where
0:16:06 he's going like he has an idea of maybe
0:16:08 this situation could still be salvaged
0:16:10 and seems surprised to see Johnny and
0:16:13 Wynn out in the den already and looks at
0:16:16 Johnny and says
0:16:19 I'll be back in a minute
0:16:21 um I assume there's got to be a corner
0:16:23 store near here I'm gonna get
0:16:25 some smokes Johnny nods and uh hats down
0:16:30 his pants
0:16:31 um and uh reads into his pocket and
0:16:33 pulls out a couple of bills and says it
0:16:36 might give me a couple packs too Ira
0:16:38 takes the money yeah I'll um I'll be
0:16:41 back I appreciate everything that y'all
0:16:45 are doing here but
0:16:47 I assume you folks want him a minute
0:16:50 amongst yourselves so I'll I'll be back
0:16:53 stay safe Ira you're not bad for extra
0:16:56 mirror when kind of gives a begrudging
0:16:58 nod to what Johnny says but definitely
0:17:01 gives Ira a no but seriously take care
0:17:04 of yourself he goes over the counter
0:17:06 pulls like a little paper and a pen and
0:17:09 writes a phone number on it and then
0:17:13 can't quite decide which of the two of
0:17:15 you to give it to and sort of just puts
0:17:16 it down in the table in front of you all
0:17:18 folded up
0:17:19 if I don't come back in an hour or so
0:17:21 just uh do me a favor and give this
0:17:23 number a call tell them that uh no I'm
0:17:27 missing a new Heaven are there gonna be
0:17:29 follow-up questions not for you okay
0:17:32 when
0:17:34 takes the number and folds it puts it in
0:17:37 her phone pocket but she I don't think
0:17:39 she got her phone back from Miles yet
0:17:40 you are coming back though right I want
0:17:43 to smoke and I got your money so
0:17:45 that doesn't we appreciate the times
0:17:48 that we can talk to ourselves but I'm
0:17:50 pretty sure we all want to talk to you
0:17:51 some more as well I assume we all got
0:17:54 questions and there's a there's only a
0:17:57 little bit of trust to go around I have
0:17:59 an idea on how maybe we could trust each
0:18:02 other at all be on the level all right
0:18:04 we'll look forward to hearing about it
0:18:05 go get those smokes first he nods and
0:18:08 there's like a hesitation before he
0:18:10 opens the front door almost like he
0:18:11 expects someone to be there outside the
0:18:13 front door and then takes a breath and
0:18:16 close the door behind him and walks out
0:18:19 into the night
0:18:24 wind kind of looks over toward Johnny
0:18:26 any sign of miles and Brita yet not yet
0:18:30 all right give him 15 more minutes about
0:18:33 Eden I haven't seen her
0:18:40 miles
0:18:41 you wake up alone
0:18:43 just like you do much every night
0:18:46 and tonight you are sunken into a
0:18:50 massive Posh bed with silks and the most
0:18:55 expensive comfortable sleepwear you can
0:18:59 afford
0:19:00 the house is quiet
0:19:01 you know at least for the moment the
0:19:05 quarter you care for is safe but
0:19:08 something just doesn't feel right
0:19:11 like a piece of you was left behind in
0:19:15 the depths of that century
0:19:17 but you begin your ritual you prepare
0:19:19 for the evening
0:19:21 and as you do what do you put on I think
0:19:24 it's more of a casual miles look of just
0:19:27 a button-up shirt and a pair of slacks
0:19:30 taken from various different colors I
0:19:32 think at this point he's gone with a
0:19:34 very comfortable blue that is he was war
0:19:37 for a very long time and he looks over
0:19:40 at where the katana is stored and
0:19:43 checks in on it a bit but just kind of
0:19:46 as with the first few moments tries to
0:19:48 remember that things are going well
0:19:50 currently for the most part and try to
0:19:52 ground himself in that with all of the
0:19:55 everything going on with the city and
0:19:57 then the Chantry bad stuff happening out
0:19:59 of nowhere and then just
0:20:02 that mental attack from something Beyond
0:20:06 Comprehension that stripped him of every
0:20:10 inclination that he was strong enough
0:20:12 for the things to come
0:20:13 as you ponder it it's as though it's
0:20:16 made manifest
0:20:18 and in the mirror you see your
0:20:20 reflection
0:20:22 lost in a sea of bone and flesh and with
0:20:27 like a buzzing sensation you are snapped
0:20:31 back to the point you're at back into
0:20:34 the room that you're in your Haven and
0:20:37 you're again staring at your image in
0:20:39 the mirror taking a few
0:20:41 deeply unnecessary breaths at this point
0:20:43 he strains himself out as best he can
0:20:47 smooth backs his hair and
0:20:50 proceeds to go out and see what kind of
0:20:52 trouble the coder he's gotten up to so
0:20:55 far
0:20:56 upon exiting the room uh almost right
0:20:59 away you see winning Johnny win is
0:21:02 sitting on the kitchen counter
0:21:04 her legs crossed brushing her hair a
0:21:07 little lost but easily comforted by the
0:21:11 the ritual of brushing her hair which
0:21:13 probably is not commonly seen she
0:21:16 doesn't seem to do much with her hair
0:21:17 other than braided keep it out of the
0:21:19 way she gives him a nod when he comes up
0:21:22 Johnny is fiddling with his Zippo
0:21:25 lighter looks a little bit unease
0:21:27 because he's out of cigarettes at this
0:21:28 point how you doing miles you look just
0:21:31 like I feel miles returns wins nod and
0:21:35 gives a small smile at that from uh
0:21:37 Johnny
0:21:39 rough night last night I don't know if
0:21:42 you guys got any of that
0:21:44 whatever
0:21:45 attack that it did but no what are you
0:21:48 talking about yeah I I didn't get
0:21:50 anything that wasn't very easy to see it
0:21:54 had some sort of psychic attack
0:21:57 must have been directed Johnny lowers
0:21:59 his head a little bit and looks at you
0:22:02 through past his brow and gives you a
0:22:05 very cautious look
0:22:07 it got into your head
0:22:10 um
0:22:11 completely and utterly but it wasn't
0:22:13 there to do things like Venture normally
0:22:16 did it was there to strip me of
0:22:19 everything that I am when's brow kind of
0:22:22 furrows not in anger but in concern
0:22:25 okay
0:22:27 um
0:22:28 can you elaborate
0:22:30 on that I don't know a lot more but it's
0:22:35 not gone away with sleep let's put it
0:22:37 that way there is a a wearing at my core
0:22:43 some of the worst things that Kendra do
0:22:45 to one another has nothing to do with
0:22:47 claws or fangs
0:22:49 considering you had a demon make a nest
0:22:52 in your head
0:22:53 the fact that this thing wore away your
0:22:55 core does not sound good well the demon
0:22:58 I had an agreement sure you did
0:23:02 this thing was out to destroy I get the
0:23:06 sense that over enough time I can build
0:23:09 it back but it was it's essentially a
0:23:11 very deep wound is there anything we can
0:23:14 do to help
0:23:15 I'm unaware if you've gotten anything
0:23:17 else in terms of repairing mind or
0:23:20 possibly Souls not so much but what I
0:23:24 can tell you is that that thing was a
0:23:26 predator and predators hit people
0:23:29 that can do them harm and he saw you as
0:23:32 someone who could really do damage if he
0:23:35 hit you with something like that so [ __ ]
0:23:38 him I think it may have been for the
0:23:40 best my job was not in that particular
0:23:43 scenario fighting the dragon per se not
0:23:47 the way Johnny and I were but it was to
0:23:49 make sure that the team fought and
0:23:52 killed it that's all those things
0:23:54 raining from the sky yeah they were dead
0:23:56 thanks to you yeah I don't move as fast
0:23:58 as Johnny if we'd had to stop and deal
0:24:00 with those that Dragon would probably
0:24:02 still be standing and I'd probably still
0:24:03 be stuck inside it that was the
0:24:05 intention I'm glad that they never came
0:24:07 down in quite the mass that they could
0:24:09 have but miles just wounds like that do
0:24:13 heal they take time but I promise you
0:24:17 they do heal we all carry wounds Johnny
0:24:20 gives win a sideways glance
0:24:22 I'm not sure all wounds heal they don't
0:24:25 but when things are broken you don't
0:24:27 always put them back together the same
0:24:29 way they were sometimes you take the
0:24:31 fragments and you build something new
0:24:32 like a mosaic it's change it's not
0:24:35 necessarily bad even though it feels
0:24:37 incredibly intensely bad and shitty in
0:24:39 the moment that's why you're an optimist
0:24:41 am I I see the classes twice as big as
0:24:45 it needs to be man he gives a halfway
0:24:47 smile at that I think if nothing else
0:24:49 since this is a piece of a greater whole
0:24:52 it has given us an idea of some of the
0:24:54 capabilities of the whole and maybe we
0:24:57 can do things toward against it in the
0:24:58 future so a positive to be drawn
0:25:02 well
0:25:04 way to be The Optimist well I'll go
0:25:06 ahead and be the the pessimist here if
0:25:08 there's a [ __ ] hole I have no idea
0:25:11 how we're gonna kill that thing I'm
0:25:13 pretty sure we're [ __ ] it's good to
0:25:15 know
0:25:16 um I would like to think that everything
0:25:19 that exists on this plane can be killed
0:25:21 one degree or another so hopefully well
0:25:23 hopes and dreams aren't going to get us
0:25:25 very far if we decide to try to tangle
0:25:28 with that thing or even worse if it
0:25:29 decides it wants to leave New York and
0:25:31 come tangle with us we may not be able
0:25:34 to control the outcome but we determine
0:25:35 how we fight it sure I mean it's dying
0:25:39 does not mean you don't survive what
0:25:41 just I'm going all
0:25:43 philosophy major on you I'm sorry I'm
0:25:46 hoping we'll pick up more tools more
0:25:48 weapons now that we know all the
0:25:50 chainsaws and [ __ ] within a hundred
0:25:52 miles aren't going to help us against
0:25:53 whatever the [ __ ] is in New York we need
0:25:56 to find some actual answers right I was
0:25:58 speaking more metaphorical
0:26:02 so who's going down to get Brita I was
0:26:04 about to ask if she had been out yet no
0:26:06 uh Ira went out on a cigarette run but
0:26:10 Berta and Eden have yet to be seen can
0:26:13 you check on Eden yeah I'll check on
0:26:14 Bretta
0:26:16 been through a few things and yeah I
0:26:19 have some knowledge of some of those so
0:26:21 we'll see how it goes all right and when
0:26:24 uncrosses her legs and slides off the
0:26:26 counter and again pads down the stairs
0:26:29 miles NASA's head towards Johnny and
0:26:31 moves towards the room that he had uh
0:26:33 made up for Brita
0:26:39 Neil
0:26:41 you look around
0:26:43 and everywhere you see is some future
0:26:45 consequence
0:26:47 and then you see your face that you
0:26:49 recognize But first you hear the sound
0:26:53 of his boots
0:26:54 his Spurs
0:26:57 and there you see Johnny sire Delgado
0:27:00 having Pleasant interactions with some
0:27:03 of the gathered Sabah he has a
0:27:06 tempestuous expression in his eyes
0:27:09 something has stressed him out he's
0:27:12 displeased despite how joyous the S
0:27:16 button is
0:27:18 a young man who is clearly a la Sombra
0:27:20 largely because his T-shirt says well
0:27:22 Sombra across the chest
0:27:24 very subtle rushes over to Delgado
0:27:28 hey hey man
0:27:30 we support the black hand and all things
0:27:32 we got your back sign us up we're down
0:27:34 for Crusade let's do it you know we
0:27:37 heard about the situation and you know I
0:27:39 got packmates the guy gets renew
0:27:42 whatever you need if you need more black
0:27:44 hand we'll do it nightwatch has you
0:27:46 nogada reaches for this young La Sombra
0:27:50 grabs the lick by his face and shoves
0:27:53 him aside but as he walks he raises the
0:27:57 clipboard and adds another name to the
0:27:59 list
0:28:00 Neil
0:28:02 has seen Delgado in person
0:28:06 has annoyed Delgado in person
0:28:10 and wants to get nowhere near this man
0:28:14 still not completely clear what black
0:28:18 hand means I mean there was a time when
0:28:20 based on what Johnny said he thought
0:28:22 Delgado was the black hand that was just
0:28:24 who that was and then with everything
0:28:27 with Brita and the explanations later
0:28:29 he's not clear but it's definitely
0:28:32 something and he has a clipboard and
0:28:35 that kid the the member of the Night
0:28:37 Watch said he would join the Crusade
0:28:39 wanted to fight and Delgado looks
0:28:41 annoyed like something is I don't know
0:28:43 holding up the Crusade so what he's
0:28:45 going to do is peel off and skulk
0:28:49 through this Gathering and hope to
0:28:52 [ __ ] God not to get caught and he's
0:28:55 gonna try and follow Delgado to listen
0:28:58 to other conversations that's going on
0:28:59 with this man and to see if he can the
0:29:04 list because one of the things he needs
0:29:06 to find is who's coming Which packs are
0:29:09 going to fight in the Crusade
0:29:11 as you follow Delgado
0:29:13 there are others about that approach all
0:29:16 of them again we support the black hand
0:29:19 don't worry we have faith those traitors
0:29:22 will find them but God will nods
0:29:25 continue is on his way and eventually he
0:29:28 makes it to this space where there is
0:29:33 a circular table
0:29:35 seats that are assembled
0:29:38 and there is a man who you recognize
0:29:41 from the attack on Warwick
0:29:44 and he is dressed exquisitely
0:29:47 a white shirt a white vest subtle
0:29:52 jewelry silver accents
0:29:54 sort of like how the women before raw
0:29:57 dress bright and stood out in this this
0:30:00 sea of Gothic black outfits
0:30:03 he is clad and white as hair slicked
0:30:07 Bang is a Widow's Peaks and facial hair
0:30:09 eyes that are almost all black
0:30:12 and Delgado bows his head to him as the
0:30:16 man turns you see the subtle signs of a
0:30:19 sunburn on the side of his cheek some
0:30:23 Remnant from whenever he was embraced
0:30:26 Garden all Delgado says to him I have
0:30:30 some updates regarding Connecticut
0:30:32 I've also got a list of volunteers for
0:30:35 Crusade what else do you need
0:30:38 bologna nods pleased
0:30:40 an ally
0:30:42 from North is coming to meet with us
0:30:45 I want no interruptions I want it made
0:30:49 clear that the turncoats who fled the
0:30:52 black hand and ventured to Alamo
0:30:55 are not seen as weakness on our part
0:30:58 these are the final stages
0:31:01 with neomons
0:31:04 that hang in the sky our brothers and
0:31:07 sisters will be hungry to show the
0:31:10 Ancients that we are ready for war
0:31:13 do you understand
0:31:15 Delgado nuts
0:31:16 understood
0:31:18 who is the guest
0:31:20 the Cardinal takes an unnecessary breath
0:31:23 a sister of the brutes
0:31:25 doc Selena I'll get refreshments
0:31:29 returns and starts marching all the way
0:31:32 back towards the Blood Feast
0:31:35 do you continue to follow Delgado
0:31:41 the right response
0:31:44 the list or does he still have so first
0:31:46 I'm looking at the clipboard the
0:31:48 clipboard is left on the table but I
0:31:50 have to get closer to the table leaves
0:31:52 the clipboard on the table and then
0:31:53 heads back but I have to sort of float
0:31:55 closer to the table to get a look at it
0:31:58 yes you do
0:32:00 for a second Neil is Frozen in
0:32:03 indecision not for the first time in his
0:32:06 life but based on the things he's been
0:32:09 trying to do and where he's at he is
0:32:12 going to try and look at that list at
0:32:16 the clipboard under the reasoning that
0:32:18 if Delgado has been walking around and
0:32:20 he's ready to present this list to
0:32:22 Polonia then it's if not a final list
0:32:25 then at least reasonably well-rounded so
0:32:28 we'll give him a decent idea of the
0:32:31 number or types of packs that are coming
0:32:33 and he's going to try and get a little
0:32:35 closer I didn't get like a sense of when
0:32:37 this dark Selena is going to be coming
0:32:39 just that Polonia doesn't want to be
0:32:41 interrupted correct okay that sounds bad
0:32:44 don't know if I want to be in the room
0:32:45 for that [ __ ] so I'm going to uh try and
0:32:50 approach the table just to get a peek at
0:32:53 the list and kind of linger near Polonia
0:32:55 for a second Delgado has a presence I
0:32:57 feel like if I need to find him again I
0:32:59 probably can a zero approach to become
0:33:01 keenly aware there are powers here that
0:33:04 can see into the astral plane and I need
0:33:07 a stealth check I will be spending one
0:33:10 of those auspicious willpower
0:33:13 six successes
0:33:18 10 successes
0:33:21 [Music]
0:33:24 you make your way to the list
0:33:28 the Cardinal sits
0:33:30 and seems to take his time preparing a
0:33:32 cigar
0:33:33 enjoying the
0:33:35 cacophony of Sabbat that fill this place
0:33:41 and you start to read from a list
0:33:44 the first you see is Children of the
0:33:46 crone
0:33:47 there is an addendum added
0:33:49 it would appear that Delgado suspects
0:33:53 that they are barists
0:33:55 Messi's reason to bring them anyway as
0:33:58 many boots on the ground as they can get
0:33:59 is what they want
0:34:01 another is The Wrecking Crew another
0:34:04 Deliverance of the Unworthy
0:34:06 another
0:34:08 is written noctis regum
0:34:11 the list goes on
0:34:13 miseries company the aftermath night
0:34:16 watch you recognize them the sugars Here
0:34:20 Comes Trouble in Midnight gland
0:34:24 ba bytes radamahara
0:34:27 the Crimson Tide a name you recognize
0:34:30 from up North
0:34:32 the givers
0:34:34 steak and bake the last as blackbone
0:34:37 Crusade you sort of survey the room and
0:34:41 you actually see two guys big puffy
0:34:45 coats backwards red New York Yankees
0:34:48 caps one is gold chain that says the
0:34:51 word steak across it another a gold
0:34:55 chain that reads bake how is steak
0:34:57 spelled
0:35:00 s-t-a-k okay wait that's not okay
0:35:07 this man the other one has nine red
0:35:11 tears under his right eye and the rest
0:35:15 of your cordery would recognize this man
0:35:17 to be a dog accompanied by his best
0:35:19 friend and brother and Kane Sea Dog
0:35:24 you chilled your head to the side
0:35:25 fixating under the misspelling of this
0:35:28 chain
0:35:30 and that's when you see it
0:35:32 a beautiful but horrifying androgynous
0:35:36 creature perfectly symmetrical an
0:35:38 utterly alien
0:35:40 you remember it from the attack on
0:35:42 Warwick it wielded Pharma turkey with
0:35:45 terrifying might incinerating crowds of
0:35:48 camera like kindred in this moment you
0:35:51 see the vikas and Sasha vaiko sees you
0:35:55 [Music]
0:35:59 finding the door closed he knocks
0:36:02 it's extremely difficult to hear but
0:36:04 there is a very very muffled
0:36:07 hey hello
0:36:10 can I open the door
0:36:11 again very very difficult to hear
0:36:15 yeah
0:36:16 miles uh you know slowly opens the door
0:36:20 taking in the General State of things
0:36:22 what mile sees is a room that's mostly
0:36:27 not very much touched from the way that
0:36:30 he set it up except for the major
0:36:31 difference being that the bed has been
0:36:34 stripped of anything comfortable
0:36:36 all the pillows are gone all the
0:36:38 blankets are gone and it's empty you in
0:36:41 the bathroom
0:36:43 from the closet muffled
0:36:46 no
0:36:47 all right miles Paces around the room
0:36:50 and looks at the things that he's placed
0:36:52 here before taking a seat on the bed
0:36:54 facing the closet door Brett has used
0:36:56 some of it things like there being a
0:36:59 towel neatly draped to dry and some of
0:37:02 the hygiene stuff that you'd left kind
0:37:04 of just quietly sits there for a little
0:37:06 bit
0:37:07 after a little while he goes
0:37:09 so you've been gone for a few days
0:37:15 how'd that go
0:37:16 it seemed to have gotten more
0:37:19 interesting than originally anticipated
0:37:23 there's a soft
0:37:24 noise Brita
0:37:26 choose the door the Closet open
0:37:29 probably to facilitate conversation but
0:37:32 she doesn't come out you can see that
0:37:34 she's built a Ness and she's so laying
0:37:37 down she's so curled up she's made
0:37:40 herself very small within the space and
0:37:43 she kind of curls back in tighter even
0:37:47 to respond to having opened the door but
0:37:50 she looks up at you and she says
0:37:57 a lot
0:37:59 miles can we
0:38:00 as as kindred
0:38:03 can we
0:38:05 can we go back to bed
0:38:08 I don't think we go back to sleep
0:38:11 do you do you have to spend blood for it
0:38:14 I don't think we get to rest like that
0:38:17 Bretta looks saddened further
0:38:21 I'm not done it a lot myself funny
0:38:23 find I am the opposite I keep myself
0:38:26 occupied and busy instead
0:38:29 Bretta chews on a response she's trying
0:38:33 to think of something to say but that
0:38:35 usual conversational skill for her it
0:38:38 doesn't seem as present
0:38:40 do you want to go over the general
0:38:43 events
0:38:44 we're not really sure what happened to
0:38:46 you after the attack on the Abbot
0:38:49 I mean I guess everyone should there's
0:38:52 so much I have to tell everyone and
0:38:54 there's so much we have to do and
0:38:57 always there's always a hundred things
0:38:59 to do
0:39:01 I chose
0:39:03 I feel like I make all of it worse and I
0:39:08 drag to you guys
0:39:10 into me making it all worse and I don't
0:39:14 know how to keep on
0:39:17 handling it
0:39:19 I'm not sure what you think you've made
0:39:22 worse you guys wouldn't have been in
0:39:24 that Chantry without
0:39:26 me I don't think we would have had a
0:39:28 chance in the Chantry without you
0:39:31 but I think we may have ended up there
0:39:33 regardlessReiss had called for us and
0:39:36Reiss was in a bad way Britta
0:39:39 closes her eyes once more like
0:39:42 she is testing whether the idea is
0:39:45 correct that she couldn't go back to
0:39:48 sleep but after a few moments of
0:39:51 frustration there's a Russell as she
0:39:54 sits herself up her hair is little must
0:39:57 up in the way of someone who's gone to
0:39:59 bed with it wet and she looks like she
0:40:02 is picked out just the cheapest most
0:40:05 comfortable things you've bought slouchy
0:40:07 sweatshirt sweatpants that kind of thing
0:40:09 and even though you're more casual did
0:40:13 you still kind of put yourself together
0:40:14 is your hair brush nicely or I mean I'm
0:40:17 still me so yes
0:40:20 casual miles it's like a 12 for anybody
0:40:22 else right
0:40:25 it's pretty rare you've seen Bretta in
0:40:27 various odd forms of disarray but she
0:40:30 just
0:40:31 she doesn't seem to have it and her to
0:40:33 fix her hair or that kind of thing kind
0:40:36 of nods there's not a lot that needs to
0:40:39 be done for most of us than the next few
0:40:42 days at least there's some stuff that I
0:40:45 should probably do as quick as possible
0:40:47 but you're you're right I I have to go
0:40:50 over everything
0:40:52 um I think I
0:40:54 I think I'm gonna have to probably make
0:40:56 a list a list they're a spin like really
0:41:00 like like a lot yeah it seems like it
0:41:03 you left with Pendragon and came back
0:41:07 with interesting friends and somewhere
0:41:10 along the line Neil has vanished have
0:41:13 you in this room provided Brita with a
0:41:15 landline I don't see why not At The
0:41:18 Mention Of Neil Bretta makes herself
0:41:20 stand up and she shuffles over to the
0:41:22 landline you've gotten tries to dial an
0:41:24 eel's number
0:41:25 and rings and rings
0:41:28 and then there is an answer hello Neil's

0:42:26 how do you spend enough time in the
0:42:27 office that he he actually knows how to
0:42:29 operate a uh like a clunky device like
0:42:32 this he's been sent to Charlotte yeah
0:42:35 even before that you know bully boy and
0:42:38 the sheriff's office I had to take calls
0:42:39 like that yeah this is Johnny
0:42:41 Johnny old man what are you doing we're
0:42:45 in New York why are you in New York wind
0:42:47 just kind of her face goes through a
0:42:49 series of Expressions that relief at
0:42:51 hearing that weathers is in fact alive
0:42:53 and oh [ __ ] why is he in New York at
0:42:56 you're in New York there's some sort of
0:42:58 disaster going on it's far-reaching your
0:43:01 uh understatement of the year old man
0:43:02 your little Scourge bait friend Kabir
0:43:05 it's got something to do with this clan
0:43:06 oh [ __ ] you and Kabir are both down in
0:43:08 New York wait what make him check his
0:43:10 phone for now Johnny holds up an
0:43:13 exasperated finger towards when is there
0:43:15 anybody else this party down in the city
0:43:17 that's now what's important this is what
0:43:20 matters we're working on making an
0:43:22 exchange if it works
0:43:24 we may be able to get support to keep
0:43:26 the animals sustained against the coming
0:43:28 Invasion maybe more importantly to your
0:43:32 well-being or getting information on the
0:43:34 Sabbath there's a big move coming
0:43:36 whether it's I'm sure the Sabbat is on
0:43:38 everybody's Minds right now but there is
0:43:40 some complications happening that makes
0:43:42 that [ __ ] look tiny that's a little hard
0:43:44 to believe but I'll hear you out once we
0:43:47 get back I think you need to hear me out
0:43:49 now whether it's New York is not the
0:43:51 place you want to be thanks Johnny I
0:43:53 wasn't [ __ ] sure I just barely made
0:43:56 it out of the Chantry it has collapsed
0:44:00 under the weight of Flesh from
0:44:03 vicissitude gone wild ah God damn it you
0:44:06 two weathers I'm not [ __ ] around here
0:44:09 you know me
0:44:11 and you know the fact that I am not one
0:44:15 prone to Flights of Fancy or [ __ ]
0:44:18 Legends there's weird stuff out there
0:44:20 but I'm not I'm not one of these Gahanna
0:44:22 cultists Johnny I need a favor
0:44:25 all right the bra Rave we need it
0:44:29 soon we needed to go well we need to
0:44:33 recruit every Ally we can get against
0:44:36 the storm that's coming
0:44:37 which storm is that because I think
0:44:40 you're thinking too small whatever
0:44:42 you're worried about what are we gonna
0:44:44 do about it if the Sabbat comes kicks Us
0:44:46 in and we die what do we do
0:44:48 I'm not trying to say you're crazy or
0:44:50 that I need to ignore you I get it
0:44:52 you've seen some [ __ ] you've seen some
0:44:54 bad [ __ ] but you cannot
0:44:57 underestimate the Sabbat and what's
0:44:59 coming
0:45:00 we have to be ready and I need you I
0:45:03 need you to start the Call to Arms get
0:45:07 every Brew out we can get to help us
0:45:08 this bruja on the side of the Sabbat too
0:45:11 you know well then don't invite them
0:45:12 Johnny come on I'm just saying maybe we
0:45:15 do no I'll leave that up to you ask him
0:45:18 how far out he is how far out are you in
0:45:21 before coming back I can't relay any
0:45:23 information like that yet all right but
0:45:25 it's it's you're not gonna see me
0:45:27 tonight I can tell you that whether so
0:45:29 I'll get this Rave started I'll put the
0:45:31 call out I'll do you that favor I'll do
0:45:33 that solid you just do me one favor if
0:45:36 what we saw up here is as bad as I think
0:45:39 it came from New York
0:45:42 you're talking about the santosa thing
0:45:43 yeah yeah I might have something for you
0:45:46 all things up I think it's a very like
0:45:48 sudden almost as if he didn't hang up uh
0:45:52 it's a little difficult to tell you know
0:45:54 that it was not like it was not a
0:45:56 natural end to a conversation Johnny
0:45:59 takes a few moments puts the phone down
0:46:01 shoot to look at when I'm sorry I kept
0:46:03 you out of that I know Kabir is
0:46:06 weathers is with him
0:46:08 and he's probably one of of the people
0:46:10 that I would trust with my life kabir's
0:46:13 life anybody else's I mean you're not
0:46:15 going to get any art
0:46:21 once she hangs up the phone then the
0:46:24 line is transferred out to Johnny good
0:46:26 news it seems
0:46:27 yeah weather says he has Neil all right
0:46:32 didn't really get a lot more information
0:46:33 than that seemed like they were doing
0:46:35 something dangerous but well it's good
0:46:39 to know that he's alive
0:46:42 he'll have something to tell us when he
0:46:45 comes back yeah
0:46:47 so did he find you
0:46:50 um yeah that kind of Skips a lot of
0:46:54 steps but yeah he he um
0:46:57 he found me when I was in Rhode Island
0:47:00 I mean the facts are
0:47:02 an event or one thing but
0:47:04 seems like there was a lot more going on
0:47:08 and
0:47:10 being a more social vampire sometimes
0:47:13 has some
0:47:14 odd consequences
0:47:17 miles I
0:47:19 the last time we saw each other we had
0:47:23 killed the Abbot
0:47:24 and
0:47:27 I already didn't feel okay
0:47:31 um that
0:47:32 we killed her and
0:47:36 I I
0:47:37 going back and forth about whether we
0:47:40 even should have if there was a way out
0:47:42 of it or
0:47:45 or if even if we took a way out would
0:47:47 that be damning ourselves because then
0:47:49 we'd not be killing Sabbat and
0:47:52 just the circle of how that goes and I
0:47:56 there's been so much since then and
0:48:00 and I'm gonna I'm gonna make a list
0:48:04 Bretta goes over to the art supplies
0:48:07 that you've got her picks out like a
0:48:09 nice not like one of the nicer pens but
0:48:13 I figure you kind of got her generally
0:48:16 high quality materials that would be
0:48:18 correct like a high quality black pen
0:48:20 and a drawing pad she starts scribbling
0:48:23 and she is writing a list for an
0:48:25 uncomfortably long amount of time about
0:48:28 what seemed to be bullet points he
0:48:31 glances at it occasionally but he lets
0:48:33 her continue he kind of continues to he
0:48:36 gets up and he walks around the room
0:48:37 some and pokes at things keeping an eye
0:48:39 on her but letting her do what she
0:48:41 thinks she needs to do
0:48:43 she finishes and then realizes that she
0:48:46 hasn't finished and adds something back
0:48:48 into the middle but then gets back up
0:48:51 seems to feel cold despite that not
0:48:53 being all that natural for a vampire
0:48:55 finds some slippers that you've bought
0:48:57 for her in the room and holding her arms
0:49:00 in close to herself slips them on and
0:49:03 tries to shuffle closer to leave the
0:49:05 room looking at the door with
0:49:07 apprehension
0:49:09 there are things you
0:49:12 don't necessarily need to share
0:49:15 yeah
0:49:17 I am
0:49:19 I'm kind of scared that if I talk about
0:49:21 some of it it'll make things worse
0:49:24 like what
0:49:26 you guys get mad really easily I mean
0:49:30 some of us are more prone to that than
0:49:31 others
0:49:33 we'll try to keep that in mind that I I
0:49:34 don't have to I mean you could always
0:49:36 start some of it with me
0:49:42 to kill us and then really [ __ ] that
0:49:45 up
0:49:45 I'm going to need to apologize and I
0:49:50 I don't know how to
0:49:53 um
0:49:55 I don't know if you guys have like
0:49:58 Prince's phone numbers or something I I
0:50:02 can get in contact with Pendragon if
0:50:04 necessary
0:50:06 um
0:50:07 I I am
0:50:09 I felt when Roland died
0:50:13 and it didn't feel
0:50:16 it felt like I lost someone that I loved
0:50:19 and it didn't it didn't feel like it it
0:50:22 broke the way that
0:50:24 people had talked about
0:50:26 and and your
0:50:28 Prince and um
0:50:31 Brita treasoff she doesn't seem to
0:50:32 really know how to follow that idea
0:50:34 through
0:50:35 what is it about me taking prints you
0:50:38 want to know
0:50:40 I get that I would have been a dangerous
0:50:42 person to tell if you guys were gonna
0:50:45 make a move
0:50:47 is that what happened
0:50:49 yes we had to keep you
0:50:53 out of the loop
0:50:55 because of the effects of the blood Bond
0:50:57 that could have gotten me hurt too there
0:51:00 are always risks
0:51:02 but taking Roland's by surprise was
0:51:04 necessary
0:51:07 okay
0:51:09 he had started trying to demand your
0:51:11 presence there
0:51:12 he was looking to
0:51:15 make that bomb more permanent Beretta
0:51:18 shrinks
0:51:19 very physical wince and she looks at the
0:51:22 ground
0:51:24 and she
0:51:25 shuts up how much of his behavior before
0:51:28 do you remember
0:51:31 what do you what do you mean I don't
0:51:33 know how much the blood Bond shaded how
0:51:35 much you remember of how he was acting
0:51:38 this as time has passed I am
0:51:42 feel like I'm able to hate him more and
0:51:46 what he did and
0:51:48 that feeling of of losses
0:51:52 I guess it feels like it's it's um
0:51:56 souring back to what it should be just
0:51:59 slowly I've heard some things like this
0:52:03 but with I remember as it was the
0:52:07 displaced princes coming
0:52:10 we could not have rolands in charge
0:52:12 anymore it would have caused
0:52:15 I can't even imagine how it would have
0:52:17 gone it would have been a bloodbath
0:52:19 yeah
0:52:20 and they're here
0:52:21 yeah
0:52:23 all of the princes are already here
0:52:25 she nods she remains crunched up
0:52:30 any other questions
0:52:32 she shakes her head
0:52:34 what about this bothers you
0:52:37 I am
0:52:40 I can't really untangle
0:52:42 it like that I
0:52:45 I felt I felt a lot of it and I don't
0:52:48 know how to explain that other than I I
0:52:51 had
0:52:51 I had a nightmare during the day and I I
0:52:54 felt like the fear and the sense of the
0:52:58 coming knife and I and I knew it was
0:53:01 coming and I knew it was coming when I
0:53:03 felt the bond and and then it snapped
0:53:06 and I and I didn't know for a while that
0:53:10 you guys were gonna have taken the
0:53:13 position I mean I I guess I hoped but I
0:53:15 didn't know if you guys were gonna
0:53:17 try to vacuum and practice or something
0:53:20 and I am
0:53:22 I don't know
0:53:24 this isn't the last time you have
0:53:26 opportunities to ask questions
0:53:31 how about Pendragon Beretta Peaks up at
0:53:34 Miles trying to assess out what he wants
0:53:37 not in a suspicious way just she's
0:53:41 feeling lost and overwhelmed
0:53:43 he shrugs just what did he do where did
0:53:46 you go
0:53:48 I don't want to have to say everything a
0:53:51 bunch
0:53:52 um
0:53:53 basically we he summoned me to his limo
0:53:58 and we talked and we went back to
0:54:01 Hartford and I stayed at his Haven for a
0:54:04 bit and then we went to we went to a
0:54:07 Gala warwicks
0:54:10 and that went really really badly and
0:54:13 the tomorrow were there and then the
0:54:15 Sabbat attacked and then I need to tell
0:54:17 you
0:54:18 Elsa's gone
0:54:22 miles pauses
0:54:24 questions
0:54:26 gone how
0:54:29 teamed I mean I couldn't see it but it
0:54:32 seemed like Carmen
0:54:34 killed her miles closed his eyes and
0:54:37 rubs the bridge of his nose
0:54:41 where's everyone
0:54:45 I guess we should go talk to everyone
0:54:47 yeah
0:54:49 I'll lead the way come on British
0:54:51 shuffles behind you
0:54:57 all looks at this utterly terrifying
0:55:01 being and
0:55:04 Alex I just saw the sun open up over
0:55:08 ravana we roll forward off screen and
0:55:11 I've been jumping into other people's
0:55:12 scenes without my knowledge but I would
0:55:15 love a distraction right now as I do I
0:55:19 got nothing in the face of the Vic house
0:55:21 so if I could I still have four week of
0:55:25 nightmares tokens so to speak left I
0:55:28 would love a distraction right now okay
0:55:30 you stare at it it stares at you it
0:55:33 extends a long spindly finger and
0:55:38 beckons a man to approach it this man
0:55:42 I was wearing sunglasses at night has a
0:55:44 trench coat on as bleach blonde hair
0:55:47 slicked back and on his neck there is a
0:55:51 black spiral tattooed onto him and it
0:55:54 says to him
0:55:56 tally we have a guest
0:55:59 and as tally starts to turn his head in
0:56:02 the direction that the vikos is looking
0:56:05 you hear an audible
0:56:07 from the group of people that he had
0:56:09 been watching like a dog
0:56:11 and Men crumbles to the ground
0:56:13 collapsing to Ash
0:56:16 and standing over him in a black corset
0:56:20 and possibly tight leather pants and
0:56:24 knee-high boots is lucida
0:56:27 and the room to Hearns towards her and
0:56:31 quick too quick she steps back into a
0:56:35 shadow and is gone
0:56:37 you have just a moment Neil immediately
0:56:41 as soon as he sees that I think in all
0:56:44 honesty is also stunned for a second by
0:56:46 the appearance of lucida but Serendipity
0:56:50 being what it was maybe is a half second
0:56:52 quicker to get his [ __ ] together and in
0:56:55 that Split Second Neil flees the room
0:56:57 away from the vicos and whatever Tali is
0:57:00 and just goes back into the horror show
0:57:04 of this you know Blood Feast and then
0:57:08 for a moment wants to just say okay I've
0:57:11 got enough I've got enough I don't want
0:57:12 to do this anymore and flee back to his
0:57:14 body but looks around
0:57:17 and decides
0:57:19 to stay
0:57:21 to get a little bit more to say it a
0:57:23 little more curiosity flees into the
0:57:26 crowd sort of if you could just see him
0:57:28 in the astral realm it would look
0:57:30 ridiculous because he's like ducking
0:57:31 behind cover and like running back and
0:57:33 forth hiding in the crowd that doesn't
0:57:34 exist where he exists
0:57:36 but is doing all of these like you can't
0:57:40 catch me Maneuvers to hide and then like
0:57:43 jumps basically into a room through a
0:57:46 door to hide out so he can linger a few
0:57:49 moments longer just to make sure he
0:57:52 knows and can see what the Sabbat is up
0:57:55 to hoping that he has lost the attention
0:57:57 of the vikas with the appearance of
0:57:59 lucida well roll me a stealth check I
0:58:04 will uh absolutely be spending my second
0:58:08 auspicious willpower on this understood
0:58:12 and with my does my lurking spec apply
0:58:15 it does well with my lurking spec that
0:58:18 is 10 successes
0:58:20 I find a spot to hide
0:58:22 a new way
0:58:24 and you're back in looking around
0:58:26 and there's one more familiar face
0:58:30 she's very well dressed and carries her
0:58:33 sword with her but you recognize the
0:58:35 darkness of The Killing Spree
0:58:37 conducting a minor meeting
0:58:41 and she is speaking to a mortal someone
0:58:45 who lives and breathes and is dressed in
0:58:49 you know a little jacket black cargo
0:58:52 pants way too baggy and has like a
0:58:56 little chain that goes from like the
0:58:58 front pocket and hangs and loops around
0:59:00 to their back pocket and he says to her
0:59:03 there are cracks in the armor that have
0:59:05 been found so far
0:59:07 Prince as a diabolist
0:59:10 the moment this reaches Josiah's ears he
0:59:13 will be obligated to destroy him the
0:59:15 moment this reaches the ears of the
0:59:17 runaway kindred
0:59:20 they will burn the city to the ground to
0:59:24 replace him
0:59:26 provides the necessary window
0:59:28 she shifts in her seat pleased
0:59:31 and diablarist
0:59:33 he nods he devoured the prince took his
0:59:38 place seized power she kind of smiles
0:59:40 impressive
0:59:42 what do you want done
0:59:44 she tilts her head from side to side
0:59:46 Messiah is conducting a meeting when he
0:59:49 is finished this information will be
0:59:51 brought to him and we he will utilize it
0:59:54 for the Crusade
0:59:55 for now continue monitoring the domain
0:59:59 succeed
1:00:00 and you shall serve as the bishop of New
1:00:03 Haven
1:00:04 from where I'm standing I can see both
1:00:06 these people right you can are they the
1:00:08 only two here having this discussion
1:00:11 yes they are you said this is clearly a
1:00:13 mortal man like breathing and stuff I
1:00:15 have a weirdly paranoid thought right
1:00:18 now
1:00:19 can I use or perception to see if this
1:00:21 is somebody riding around inside a ghoul
1:00:23 suit or yes you can
1:00:25 actually don't think that's paranoid
1:00:28 s
1:00:33 paranoia
1:00:35 nine successes you do not possess enough
1:00:38 aspects to see the aura however is that
1:00:42 not an answer enough
1:00:44 yeah
1:00:45 I'm getting an error message and I only
1:00:48 get error messages if it is Elder level
1:00:51 [ __ ] or above indeed Neil from his
1:00:56 hidden location just
1:00:58 dares between Carmen and whoever the
1:01:02 [ __ ] this is someone from New Haven who
1:01:06 is working with the Sabbat who not only
1:01:08 knows the domain but knows
1:01:11 I mean this is the first time I've heard
1:01:13 I think that the current Prince of New
1:01:15 Haven is a diablarist it is
1:01:19 Rollins is a diablarist
1:01:22 do you even know that he's actually
1:01:23 Prince yet no I don't know that he
1:01:26 succeeded but we did talk and it ended
1:01:28 off with a good luck on your Praxis so
1:01:32 that's a tomorrow night problem
1:01:35 there's chaos happening outside as
1:01:38 people are scrambling chasing lucita
1:01:40 trying to be the one who took down
1:01:43 lucida and the door starts to open
1:01:46 Carmen leaps onto the Mortal sinking her
1:01:49 fangs into his throat and she starts
1:01:51 feeding the door opens and it is the
1:01:53 vicos
1:01:55 what is this Carmen looks up
1:01:58 feeding what do you do
1:02:01 Neil as
1:02:04 has like a weird moment of
1:02:07 wanting to do something to to lash out
1:02:10 at Carmen specifically this like woman
1:02:12 who has consistently terrorized him
1:02:16 and then immediately thinks better of it
1:02:19 and we'll just flee and now that he's
1:02:23 not
1:02:24 trying to look around for things needs
1:02:26 to get this back unseen is no longer
1:02:28 willing to push his luck and Lex I'm
1:02:30 going to immediately follow my thread as
1:02:33 fast as I can back to my body you
1:02:35 fleeing in an instant you are back to
1:02:38 your body which is in a car peeling out
1:02:42 as weathers attempts to drive the group
1:02:44 of you to safety
1:02:46 and as you sit up and look out the
1:02:47 window you can see ravenous
1:02:51 frenzied vampires almost a dozen of them
1:02:55 rushing towards the car hungry
1:02:59 for Kabir
1:03:01 [Music]
1:03:05 Ira even walking the streets of New
1:03:07 Haven alone for a bit now
1:03:10 and to keep seeing people walk by mind
1:03:12 of their business having no idea just
1:03:15 how close this city just came to who
1:03:20 knows what
1:03:21 and it isn't long
1:03:23 walk in the main strip that you come to
1:03:26 a gas station not too far off from a
1:03:29 Stop and Shop
1:03:31 at the gas station right outside
1:03:33 a three pay phones lined up side by side
1:03:37 every time one of those people walks by
1:03:39 IRA has that sort of internal you don't
1:03:43 even know you almost died or Worse
1:03:45 thought and he also has that paranoid
1:03:48 like is this really it are you really
1:03:50 you is somebody he's got that energy of
1:03:53 someone who's expecting to get jumped at
1:03:55 any minute
1:03:56 and he sees the pay phones which is what
1:03:59 he's coming for but first he goes in
1:04:02 and just go straight to the counter and
1:04:06 look to the guy is like
1:04:07 um uh curtains you sell cartons here
1:04:10 they look at you like you have three
1:04:11 like it's an insane question but he's
1:04:13 like not really in the right headspace
1:04:16 right now and he just slaps an amount of
1:04:19 cash down probably too much there's two
1:04:22 cartons of morally so is that gonna be
1:04:24 Menthol not mental no not Menthol oh
1:04:27 okay
1:04:29 27s
1:04:31 you want that uh Blend 27 it's a new
1:04:34 thing no just goddamn we can't get rid
1:04:37 of these [ __ ] boys and get he pulls
1:04:40 up a carton it's gonna cost you 40. uh
1:04:43 Ira looks at the cash he slaps down and
1:04:44 then like takes them back off until
1:04:46 there's just like two twenties left down
1:04:48 there you uh you want to grab some
1:04:50 scratches too could be your lucky day
1:04:53 no and he just picks up the cartons and
1:04:57 like walks back out as you head back out
1:05:00 even in your own head
1:05:02 this whole time but you start to notice
1:05:05 more and more people are just kind of
1:05:07 like what do you see that do you see
1:05:08 that and they look to the sky
1:05:11 and there you see a baleful red star
1:05:18 looming over the world
1:05:21 Ira with his naked eye no heightened
1:05:25 senses just stares at this thing
1:05:27 probably longer than he means to
1:05:30 and just thoughts of the things that
1:05:34 Melinda told him about like oh yeah
1:05:36 we're planning to bail on the apocalypse
1:05:38 asterisk the Apostle of the apocalypse
1:05:40 is real uh thinking about damp here and
1:05:44 the last daughter of Eve thinking about
1:05:47 all the cultists and people who said
1:05:50 [ __ ] inside Clan Premiere that he has
1:05:52 snuffed out over the last many years
1:05:56 and this red star in the sky and what
1:05:59 all that means and like he often does
1:06:01 when he's a little bit overwhelmed by
1:06:03 too much like I was a very methodical
1:06:05 person so he tries to focus his mind
1:06:07 back on okay one step in front one thing
1:06:11 that I have to do one thing in front of
1:06:13 me and he focuses his mind back onReiss
1:06:17 as if like okay if I can just take care
1:06:19 of this job then I can start to worry
1:06:21 about the bigger things and he while
1:06:23 everybody else is still looking at the
1:06:25 sky and distracted or in their own
1:06:27 little worlds he goes over to that bank
1:06:29 of three pay phones and he takes the one
1:06:31 that's furthest down the wall like most
1:06:34 away from the street picks the phone off
1:06:36 the receiver and reaches into an inner
1:06:38 pocket and pulls out basically what
1:06:39 looks like a little metal like washer
1:06:42 and around the outside our little Arcane
1:06:45 like hermetic runes hermetic uh symbols
1:06:48 that are inscribed onto it and instead
1:06:50 of putting a quarter in the machine he
1:06:53 drops in the slug and then dials a
1:06:57 number he has committed to memory upon
1:06:59 dialing the call tone when the phone has
1:07:03 like a series of beeps and clicking
1:07:05 noises and behaves unusually and after
1:07:10 moments of this you hear a crystal clear
1:07:15 voice on the other side
1:07:18 uh Apprentice
1:07:20 we were just discussing you you hear
1:07:22 Melinda say when I call the aster line
1:07:25 through this little phone ritual usually
1:07:28 do I get the inner Council or do I get
1:07:31 the Asters usually is it unusual that
1:07:34 Merlin is picking up the phone usually
1:07:36 uh it is an aster that answers on the
1:07:39 other end however the disasters do work
1:07:42 under Merlinda yeah so it is something
1:07:45 that she has access to she sees the
1:07:47 calls when they come in makes sense
1:07:49 she's more than able to I I wasn't
1:07:51 questioning ability just how often does
1:07:54 like the boss answer when you don't
1:07:56 often hear from Melinda hello counselor
1:07:59 it is an unexpected pleasure
1:08:04 for you to pick up the call I
1:08:08 was just calling to give a report to
1:08:11 hopefully convene a council
1:08:14 of esters
1:08:16 well I was actually just reviewing a
1:08:19 report to me that was afforded by
1:08:20 pontifix Diamond written by the newly
1:08:24 minted LordReiss
1:08:27 it speaks of you quite favorably
1:08:31 LordReiss's report yes speaks of me
1:08:36 favorably I am to understand that the
1:08:40 situation in New England has been
1:08:44 cleaned up
1:08:46 the
1:08:47 blowback from the camarilla uh you're
1:08:51 already in a position to mitigate and
1:08:53 additionally you have acquired an object
1:08:57 that we have a vested interest in
1:09:00 maintaining
1:09:03 so Arrangements will be made for you to
1:09:07 fly out to Dallas tonight
1:09:09 and we will be discussing a promotion
1:09:13 that is due to you
1:09:16 Iowa is silent for a very long time
1:09:22 unclear I have no idea if Merlinda can
1:09:24 see me right now probably not but with
1:09:27 the council you never know his face is
1:09:32 set in stone and his mind is racing
1:09:37 congratulations Regent
1:09:40 he's again quiet way longer than he
1:09:43 should be
1:09:45 thank you
1:09:46 counselor
1:09:48 your silence is indicative of questions
1:09:53 might I
1:09:56 be able to read the report
1:09:59 I was calling to make one myself I like
1:10:01 to be thorough so I am surprised that
1:10:05 one was sent so quickly without my
1:10:09 awareness yes of course and LordReiss
1:10:13 submitted the report last night Before
1:10:17 Dawn now what is your report
1:10:23 IRA has been having a total crisis of
1:10:25 Faith obviously within indeed playing
1:10:29 Premiere and while it may be an
1:10:32 extremely stupid move I think the honest
1:10:35 answer is that he answers honestly
1:10:40 because despite the fact that he has no
1:10:43 reason to have any trust in the system
1:10:46 right now he is who he is and I think
1:10:49 still somewhat trusts that like well if
1:10:51 the truth comes out the system will
1:10:53 understand that and so he breathes for a
1:10:55 second
1:10:56 who knows it
1:11:00 was going to be my
1:11:02 recommendation that a Council of the
1:11:06 Asters be convened to
1:11:09 discuss Lord
1:11:13Reiss
1:11:15 go on
1:11:16 it was my understanding that there were
1:11:22 several facets of
1:11:26 the code that were
1:11:29 broken
1:11:31 in both spirit and letter
1:11:34 by LordReiss in his actions here
1:11:39 that many are dead
1:11:42 of our clan because of
1:11:45 his actions and negligence and that
1:11:49 the Masquerade as a whole and the
1:11:52 entirety of this region were jeopardized
1:11:55 because of
1:11:58 a lack of oversight
1:12:00 I would say
1:12:02 based on
1:12:04 I have observed and
1:12:07 that the camera as a whole would not
1:12:09 take kindly to it
1:12:12 that
1:12:13 he is going to be in contact
1:12:17 with an individual who
1:12:20 I understand the Lord's
1:12:24 records when it comes to the things that
1:12:27 happened in Salem and that I won
1:12:31 Zechariah slain was
1:12:33 deemed responsible and that
1:12:36 he was properly commended for dealing
1:12:39 with the one responsible but I have
1:12:42 evidence that suggests
1:12:45 the Regent the Lord
1:12:47 knew
1:12:49 that Zacharias Lane was still at launch
1:12:51 was perhaps aware of his ties to this
1:12:55 particular area and was going to seek
1:12:58 him out
1:12:59 that they are enemies and yet
1:13:01 previous accolades and Records may not
1:13:04 be as truthful as one might expect Mr
1:13:07 grave accusations and you are prepared
1:13:10 to make presentation to the Astra
1:13:12 Council I was very well collect the last
1:13:15 daughter of Eve the two of you will have
1:13:17 your flight sent from Logan airport and
1:13:20 we will speak when you arrive
1:13:24 yes counselor
1:13:26 well done
1:13:28 she disconnects
1:13:30 Ira just holds the phone in his hand for
1:13:34 a while in the dark
1:13:36 and then hangs up the phone and hits the
1:13:40 like coin return button and pulls the
1:13:43 little Arcane slug back out of the slot
1:13:47 and
1:13:49 head full of thoughts
1:13:53 turns on his heel
