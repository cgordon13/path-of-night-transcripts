0:00:28 now let's walk the path of night
0:00:31 [Music]
0:00:39 last time on path of
0:00:41 night BR and Neil faced their fears on
0:00:44 the first rung of the ladder of
0:00:47 Heaven Britta spirit guide Romeo led
0:00:50 her to the next part while the vios met
0:00:53 Neil at the end of his first
0:00:56 confrontation all the while Johnny and
0:00:59 wind defended the Cy against a gang of
0:01:02 shovelheads the first wave of the
0:01:04 invading sabat forces
0:01:07 [Music]
0:01:31 miles you're led by the hand as Marcos
0:01:35 brings you into the next stage of your
0:01:38 journey you get a sense of elevation the
0:01:43 air grows
0:01:44 thin and it actually does in its own
0:01:48 bizarre way feel as though you're
0:01:52 traveling upward through this Hall
0:01:56 staircase what have you it's it's very
0:01:59 surreal and unclear you can see the
0:02:04 stars grow
0:02:06 near and
0:02:08 then you begin to
0:02:11 hear
0:02:16 music and sometimes this music is some
0:02:21 very smooth
0:02:24 [Music]
0:02:27 jazz sometimes it's vibrant thrumming
0:02:32 [Music]
0:02:36 synth sometimes it's good old rock and
0:02:43 roll I'm intrigued as we move forward uh
0:02:47 trying to uh align myself with this
0:02:50 general feeling of just moving upwards
0:02:53 and not trying to dread the part that's
0:02:55 supposed to be really
0:02:57 hard when you enter you find yourself
0:03:02 walking into a grand
0:03:04 hall that is made from silver and gold
0:03:09 and glass and diamonds all of it
0:03:13 gathered and arranged in this gorgeous
0:03:17 Art Deco
0:03:19 design it feels
0:03:22 like the
0:03:24 height of New York
0:03:28 Grandeur and across this Hall sprinkled
0:03:32 about are people dancing eating
0:03:36 orves and enjoying one another's
0:03:40 company
0:03:41 is the
0:03:44 various party environments intermingled
0:03:47 with one another all at once just like
0:03:48 the music seems to shift and sway
0:03:52 depending on your surface thoughts so
0:03:55 too does the crowd but then you hear
0:03:59 some familiar
0:04:01 faces and Marcos still holding your hand
0:04:06 kind of pulls you into a circle of
0:04:09 people that are chatting the first to
0:04:12 speak seems to
0:04:14 note the very nice suit you find
0:04:19 yourself in the white the silk the very
0:04:25 um extravagant Ventrue look you have
0:04:28 taken on appreciably
0:04:30 and it is the voice of Rufio and he
0:04:33 says well
0:04:36 [ __ ] I thought only pansies wore neck
0:04:39 ties um not this is not in within the
0:04:43 Realms of
0:04:46 expectations any degree or
0:04:48 form he just I just kind of squint my
0:04:52 eyes at him and try to move on well
0:04:55 Marcos who is wearing jeans a white
0:04:58 T-shirt and sneakers
0:05:01 says see that I thought only [ __ ]
0:05:04 use the word
0:05:05 pansy Elsa speaks up o he got you on
0:05:10 that one
0:05:11 Rufio Rufio clenches his fist shut up
0:05:15 son of a [ __ ] is going to pay for
0:05:18 that and he starts to stare down
0:05:22 Marcos I wait to see his next move
0:05:26 but I I'm not entirely sure what's
0:05:29 happening here
0:05:32 and I am trying to sus out what
0:05:36 is as usual what is happening this
0:05:39 dreams scrape is very weird ruio grabs
0:05:41 Marcos by the shirt clenched fist other
0:05:44 hand balded up and ready to punch him
0:05:47 yeah I don't think I'm going to let that
0:05:48 happen so I'm going to uh attack Rufio
0:05:53 do do I have anything on me to do such
0:05:55 things well what are you trying to do
0:05:59 yeah I was seeing if I have a sword or
0:06:00 not yeah of course oh well of
0:06:04 course what suits complete without a
0:06:06 katana it's an excellent point
0:06:10 Dreamscape then yeah I now I feel like
0:06:14 I'm getting but yeah yeah just take the
0:06:16 offending arm why not this is fun
0:06:18 times do you you want me to roll
0:06:20 anything for that you slice the
0:06:23 arm it falls to the ground the rest of
0:06:26 him crumbles away in Ash it's weird
0:06:29 place to keep your heart and Elsa looks
0:06:32 at you this a moment ago absolutely
0:06:35 stunning dressed oddly in a way that you
0:06:39 hadn't quite ever seen her dress before
0:06:41 she was wearing these fishnets and clad
0:06:45 in a ton of black looking
0:06:48 incredible but she gives this Grim
0:06:52 smile and much of her body wastes away
0:06:57 immediately and you Ed that she's
0:07:04 gone I
0:07:05 see Elsa says to
0:07:08 you
0:07:10 wow I wish you were there you probably
0:07:14 would have made the
0:07:16 difference I would like to think so
0:07:18 sometimes though it seemed like a lot
0:07:22 was going on there that's putting it
0:07:24 pretty lightly well if I was throwing a
0:07:26 party I definitely wouldn't make it a
0:07:28 trap so what would you make it a party
0:07:32 something more fun and less death well
0:07:35 don't be vague miles what would you make
0:07:39 it I don't know it's been a while
0:07:44 um we're going for fun on this let's
0:07:46 have some fun on this right we can do
0:07:48 that here sure let's you know let's
0:07:51 Embrace some of the roots and you know
0:07:53 make it a big old arena Stadium type
0:07:56 concert with us with the the important
0:07:59 people in the back who can both see the
0:08:01 concert and and but
0:08:04 are separate from it one of the walls
0:08:07 this Hall becomes a window overlooking
0:08:10 an arena below where there is a stage
0:08:13 and much louder crowds that exist beyond
0:08:18 the
0:08:24 window and this
0:08:27 Hall becomes this like box
0:08:31 seating and the vast majority of people
0:08:33 that are here Fade Away become dist
0:08:37 voices in the
0:08:40 arena and now before you know it it's
0:08:44 just you Marcos and
0:08:48 Elsa Marcos steps away helps himself to
0:08:51 some whiskey I too grab something to
0:08:54 drink and to eat realizing that's
0:08:56 something I can do and
0:09:00 I don't know get comfortable sit in a
0:09:02 big giant chair
0:09:05 and just kind of soak it in what do you
0:09:08 eat probably Pizza it's been forever
0:09:12 since it's tasted good and I do remember
0:09:16 New York in the 80s when it was
0:09:18 suspicious but
0:09:20 delightful a few other things bites of
0:09:22 steak other things that I had not had in
0:09:25 a while few different alcohols that I
0:09:28 used to enjoy just sampling everything
0:09:32 I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do
0:09:35 here but
0:09:37 it's
0:09:38 enjoyable and I'm going to take this
0:09:41 moment for my piece and we'll figure out
0:09:44 where to go from
0:09:45 there Elsa sits next to
0:09:48 you I see you are adapting very
0:09:54 well
0:09:56 it's
0:09:58 been tough
0:10:01 and I haven't had a lot of opportunity
0:10:03 to
0:10:04 stop well we have all the time in the
0:10:08 world catch me up what's bothering you
0:10:13 miles oh a domain Under
0:10:16 Siege a friend
0:10:18 being bonded in multiple different ways
0:10:22 and I am part of that problem but
0:10:25 hopefully part of the solution
0:10:29 and uh I think a lot of people we know
0:10:32 are going to die very
0:10:34 soon she
0:10:36 NDS they are all
0:10:41 because no
0:10:43 one can stop everybody needs to have
0:10:47 everything for
0:10:49 themselves I'm
0:10:51 not saying that I'm not part of that
0:10:55 problem
0:10:57 but I don't feel like I would have had
0:10:59 to do some of these things too if other
0:11:01 people could have just
0:11:04 stopped is there anything you would
0:11:11 change so hard to see where it would
0:11:14 go be so much better if Marcos was still
0:11:18 here wouldn't I think
0:11:21 so he could have been even as a vampire
0:11:25 I feel like he would had a choice
0:11:29 how far would you
0:11:30 go I mean how far would I
0:11:34 go how far would you go to change
0:11:44 that pretty
0:11:48 far not enough to endanger what I've
0:11:51 managed to hold on
0:11:54 to and I very much would not want to
0:11:56 endanger those who didn't have a choice
0:12:01 I try not to bring our
0:12:05 war or whatever people call it to those
0:12:08 who are just trying to
0:12:12 live there is a
0:12:14 book and this book has the
0:12:19 power to bring someone
0:12:22 back I think I've heard of
0:12:25 it heard of
0:12:27 it wow she reaches beside her seat and
0:12:31 reveals a
0:12:33 book and she sets the book down on your
0:12:38 lap well there it is I don't I don't
0:12:42 know if I can use this of course you
0:12:45 can I'll open the book look what you did
0:12:48 here
0:12:49 already of
0:12:51 course
0:12:53 Marcos actually heads over pulls up a
0:12:56 seat and now it's you and two dead
0:13:01 people on your lap rests this tone this
0:13:04 big heavy Dusty old book and it has this
0:13:09 ozone scent and this electrified power
0:13:12 that radiates from it you
0:13:16 know with absolute
0:13:19 certainty that Elsa is telling you the
0:13:24 truth I look over to Marcos
0:13:30 I don't know if you're here or not
0:13:33 but what do you
0:13:36 want a question I possibly have asked
0:13:40 you before but never quite given you the
0:13:43 information to make that choice
0:13:46 correctly I think I made that clear on a
0:13:49 few
0:13:51 occasions I wanted to become your child
0:13:54 to be
0:13:55 embraced to have what you gave to
0:14:01 brda she was never there to replace
0:14:04 you my
0:14:07 um feelings on the subject weren't
0:14:09 totally based on rational understandings
0:14:14 I know that I know she meant no one harm
0:14:17 but she was my enemy
0:14:21 nonetheless she had a um frustratingly
0:14:24 Charmed
0:14:27 existence and I
0:14:30 didn't so what will it cost me to use
0:14:32 this book I say out loud to no one in
0:14:36 particular Marco says technically
0:14:39 nothing Elsa
0:14:41 says it is your reward for passing the
0:14:44 past
0:14:46 challenges you can if you
0:14:49 [Music]
0:14:50 will change either of our
0:14:54 Fates should you so choose
0:15:00 always a
0:15:04 choice how about you
0:15:05 [Music]
0:15:06 Elsa I didn't ask you
0:15:11 before what do you want if you're asking
0:15:14 me if I'd prefer to exist than be food
0:15:18 for worms I think I'd rather
0:15:21 exist we ran into problems when I didn't
0:15:24 ask that we
0:15:27 did I assume there no way to save you
0:15:30 both there never
0:15:35 is marus speaks up it's actually very
0:15:40 sad really you can't save everyone and
0:15:44 when you
0:15:45 try you spread yourself too thin and
0:15:48 things go wrong don't
0:15:49 they you end up losing
0:15:52 something and then you don't get a
0:15:55 choice Elsa leans over so what are you
0:15:59 going to
0:16:01 lose I don't
0:16:04 know it's a tough choice no offense
0:16:08 Marcos none
0:16:14 taken
0:16:17 brda Romeo leads you through the door
0:16:20 and into a
0:16:24 mansion and on its walls are gorgeous
0:16:28 paint
0:16:30 paintings everything is so
0:16:34 detailed and perfectly
0:16:37 organized perfectly laid out as though
0:16:40 to be one of those Britta Estates of
0:16:45 old there are trophies of
0:16:48 War there is a path made clear to you
0:16:53 towards a
0:16:55 den and as you walk the Stars grow near
0:17:00 the air grows
0:17:02 thin and you
0:17:04 arrive to A
0:17:07 Den and in the den there is a
0:17:11 fireplace that burns with this
0:17:16 soft blue gosam or
0:17:21 fire and again the
0:17:23 room beautifully
0:17:26 decorated not in like a very modern Posh
0:17:29 sort of way
0:17:31 but this old Regal
0:17:35 and comforting
0:17:39 design and
0:17:41 seated by the
0:17:43 fire is
0:17:46 Roman but there is something different
0:17:50 about
0:17:51 him and you find yourself wondering at
0:17:55 first but you realize
0:17:59 the moment he sees you what's so
0:18:03 different because when he sees
0:18:06 you he
0:18:08 takes a deep
0:18:11 breath and the Deathly power of His
0:18:14 lower
0:18:16 humanity and the icy facade he
0:18:19 maintains to conceal his deepest
0:18:24 thoughts are gone and In This Moment
0:18:29 he is simply a
0:18:33 man coming up through the hallway
0:18:36 through that Ascension BR had been
0:18:38 clinging tightly to
0:18:41 Romeo partly because of the horrors of
0:18:43 the previous
0:18:44 stage partly because she realized she
0:18:48 could Romeo before
0:18:51 was something she could not touch or
0:18:54 interact with and although there's a
0:18:56 part of her that's still wincing from
0:18:59 the feeling of of his spine draped over
0:19:02 her shoulder like a Shaw there is
0:19:06 also this strangeness in being able to
0:19:09 be there with him a strangeness that
0:19:13 gets further complicated as she starts
0:19:15 to realize the familiarity of this place
0:19:19 and she gets
0:19:21 self-conscious doesn't let go of him but
0:19:26 there's questions written across her
0:19:27 face before where she arrives the
0:19:30 J and arriving
0:19:33 there her eyes grow even wider seeing
0:19:36 Roman Pendragon's chest rise and fall
0:19:39 and the humanity in him and she looks
0:19:42 down at herself
0:19:45 wondering if she
0:19:48 matches do you
0:19:52 match it's certainly what Brea hopes for
0:19:55 she wants to see what it would look like
0:19:59 like then for the first time in your
0:20:03 memory you glance towards a mirror in
0:20:06 the room and see what you look like
0:20:10 alive there's usually that convincing
0:20:13 blush of Health that brda
0:20:16 seems innately to have exceptional to
0:20:19 other Kindred but now it's real the
0:20:23 little details the ones that her cod had
0:20:26 taught her to imitate the way that
0:20:29 smoking covers up the lack of breath
0:20:32 that fiddling covers up the unnatural
0:20:35 sness she sees herself moving like
0:20:39 people do the way that people shift
0:20:41 weight or are uncomfortable in small
0:20:45 degrees and there's a gasp of soft
0:20:51 amazement and she looks up
0:20:54 delighted as you draw near there are two
0:20:58 things that you you
0:20:59 notice one is that above the fireplace
0:21:03 there is a
0:21:05 painting of a
0:21:08 woman dressed in this victo this like
0:21:12 gorgeous Victorian
0:21:15 fashion and you recognize her
0:21:20 face and
0:21:23 realize that it is none other than dark
0:21:27 Selena and her
0:21:29 gaze looming over
0:21:32 Roman and in his
0:21:35 hands he is flipping through old folded
0:21:42 parchments and while he manages a smile
0:21:46 to you kind of comforted that you've
0:21:50 arrived he
0:21:52 himself seems to be struggling with
0:21:55 something where's eyes land on that
0:21:58 painting and then back to the papers and
0:22:01 she draws
0:22:02 closer so small things she's reving in
0:22:07 them
0:22:08 like like what it feels like to need
0:22:12 breath or the little top of her fingers
0:22:16 against her other hand what it would
0:22:19 feel like to have blood coarsing through
0:22:22 it but shyy she
0:22:26 says what's wrong wrong he cracks
0:22:30 through a half smile and says to
0:22:34 BR it's unfair isn't it that one must go
0:22:39 this far for a moment of
0:22:42 quiet but please come
0:22:46 s
0:22:49 i I found these old
0:22:51 letters
0:22:53 Miss from my
0:22:56 sire when she was first
0:22:59 forming my way of
0:23:02 thinking I hadn't
0:23:04 realized just how much
0:23:07 my
0:23:09 methods were not my own but an
0:23:12 expression of
0:23:14 hers how much I have allowed her to
0:23:16 Define
0:23:17 me FR goes over
0:23:20 and takes a seat by him she holds out a
0:23:25 hand requesting one of the letters
0:23:30 he
0:23:32 hesitates not out
0:23:34 of real fear but
0:23:39 shame and then gives you the stack she
0:23:43 just hands them off to
0:23:45 you
0:23:47 my obsession with
0:23:49 war my disdain for
0:23:54 Humanity I swear to you but I wasn't
0:23:56 always this way
0:23:58 it's hard to imagine that anyone could
0:24:02 be born like
0:24:04 that but I mean if there is this moment
0:24:07 of
0:24:09 Peace as strange as it is and as much as
0:24:12 I don't understand this
0:24:14 place maybe this is a time that we could
0:24:17 really understand
0:24:19 things she picks up the first letter
0:24:22 that's on the stack when you look it is
0:24:27 a report
0:24:29 Roman had written to her
0:24:32 regarding conquest and youth and it
0:24:36 becomes clear that this neonate
0:24:39 is
0:24:41 desperately trying to prove himself as
0:24:46 callous as his sire and in the story it
0:24:50 is a brutal
0:24:53 one and he rebels in violence
0:24:59 and
0:25:00 horrific
0:25:03 murder
0:25:05 and it's kind of sad because you're a
0:25:10 toror you've seen your share of people
0:25:16 who
0:25:18 pose and how posers will try to create a
0:25:24 certain look create a certain atmosphere
0:25:27 give off energy that they don't really
0:25:30 have they fake
0:25:32 it and what you're looking at is a young
0:25:35 man who is trying to make it in a world
0:25:38 he doesn't understand and so he tries to
0:25:41 impress his sire by being just like
0:25:45 her and as you look through the letters
0:25:48 you begin to sense this undertone of
0:25:52 resentment of hatred he clearly is
0:25:55 becoming aware of just how monstrous she
0:25:58 is but he has spent so much time trying
0:26:01 to emulate her strengths that he has
0:26:04 begun to embody the worst aspects of
0:26:09 her it's harder human to not
0:26:13 wise
0:26:15 and
0:26:17 brida with the first horror she tries to
0:26:21 keep a level reaction she tells herself
0:26:25 that it's not like she didn't know that
0:26:27 something like this would be there and
0:26:30 then the details keep piling
0:26:33 up
0:26:35 and that that tightens her body
0:26:41 positioning she tries to keep reading
0:26:44 levely but she finds that there's tears
0:26:48 threatening at the corners of her eyes
0:26:49 and she automatically goes swipe them
0:26:51 away because she doesn't want to get
0:26:53 blood on the paper but they're tears
0:26:59 and that confuses her for a moment
0:27:02 before she tries to focus her attention
0:27:05 on these letters and and how small the
0:27:10 atrocities are presented in comparison
0:27:14 to this
0:27:16 quarrel she finds herself sneaking Peaks
0:27:19 at that painting and not really managing
0:27:23 to look at Roman as long as she would
0:27:26 mean
0:27:27 to she tries to keep it together it's no
0:27:33 excuse I allowed
0:27:35 myself to become
0:27:38 this it's why I admire you so
0:27:44 much because you
0:27:46 seem frustratingly
0:27:49 insistent on not making the mistake I
0:27:54 did and you make me think about who who
0:27:58 I could have
0:28:00 been and the door opens and Roman pen
0:28:04 Dragon
0:28:06 enters this time he is every bit as cold
0:28:11 and calculating as you remember him to
0:28:14 be and with his icy blue eyes he looks
0:28:18 down at himself with
0:28:24 disgust
0:28:26 pra looks between the
0:28:29 two the second one feels more
0:28:33 familiar but she finds her body
0:28:38 language almost shifting to put herself
0:28:44 between
0:28:45 like she's seated and the human Roman is
0:28:50 seated and she turns to look at this
0:28:53 colder older
0:28:56 one she said
0:29:00 say you feel this
0:29:04 too right feel what
0:29:09 exactly the
0:29:13 regret I don't have the time for
0:29:17 regret let's consider for a
0:29:21 moment when Roman Pendragon was
0:29:25 embraced he was a pawn in another's
0:29:28 game his sire cruel as she might be
0:29:34 taught him to survive in a world like
0:29:40 this a world of violence and
0:29:44 despair there are other ways to
0:29:48 survive and adding more violence and
0:29:52 despair at as sometimes things are
0:29:57 complicated
0:30:00 but you don't have to look at him like
0:30:02 that of course I
0:30:05 do and
0:30:07 frankly you are also a
0:30:10 killer aren't
0:30:13 you yep I wasn't attracted to you out of
0:30:16 the idea of pretending to be
0:30:19 human pretending that I am not what I
0:30:24 am I enjoyed your company because you
0:30:26 have something to add something to
0:30:28 contribute to my own life and to my
0:30:33 plans
0:30:35 humans are
0:30:38 lesser they live finite
0:30:41 lives our lives are finite too no not
0:30:46 like
0:30:47 this we could die at any time they don't
0:30:51 know what world they even live in we are
0:30:53 not the
0:30:55 same I don't really know what this is
0:30:58 either yes you
0:31:00 do don't lie to yourself don't pretend
0:31:03 that you haven't had your own
0:31:05 calculating thoughts that there haven't
0:31:07 been people who have wronged you and
0:31:09 deserved to die for
0:31:11 it you can't climb the ladder of heaven
0:31:15 and pretend to be mortal that's not how
0:31:18 it works that's not how you get what you
0:31:23 want I know Neil said that we have to
0:31:25 get through it it's yes you you
0:31:29 do but part of that is parsing away the
0:31:35 illusion and sing the world for what it
0:31:39 is and in the real
0:31:42 world that Roman Pendragon is
0:31:46 dead there might be Echoes here and
0:31:49 there
0:31:50 moments where on sees you and you look
0:31:52 at him
0:31:54 just and he wonders what could have been
0:32:00 but that's
0:32:04 gone Concepts like love and
0:32:10 infatuation I've given way to arithmetic
0:32:14 and
0:32:16 death maybe
0:32:18 that's what you want to think I don't
0:32:21 want to think that
0:32:23 I but brda isn't sure how to to refute
0:32:28 it and the words die on her tongue and
0:32:31 she curls more into the chair
0:32:34 Roman the one that is seated next to you
0:32:38 takes your
0:32:39 hand he pulls you close and you're so
0:32:43 close to him that you can feel his
0:32:47 heartbeat against your ear and The
0:32:51 Sensation is more real than anything you
0:32:53 have felt during the entirety of your un
0:32:57 life all
0:33:02 year you are given a
0:33:07 choice Roman the one that is standing
0:33:10 looming over you raises his
0:33:14 hands I'm headed to New
0:33:18 York I'm going to wage a
0:33:20 war what Roman would you have in the
0:33:25 field the one who cares for you who
0:33:30 would have a future with you if only the
0:33:33 world would allow
0:33:35 it are the one who
0:33:38 survives I I don't understand I of
0:33:42 course you do you live the same
0:33:46 Duality you have the aspects of you that
0:33:49 are
0:33:51 kind and seek Comforts and softness
0:33:57 and then there is another part of
0:34:00 you with regards to myself there cannot
0:34:03 be
0:34:04 both why
0:34:07 not because I am a being of
0:34:12 extremes I
0:34:16 hate yes
0:34:21 there's there's things that I'm fighting
0:34:24 against in myself but I don't know that
0:34:27 that makes
0:34:29 them things that I can completely get
0:34:32 rid of or I don't know if I could make
0:34:35 choices that I'll always be a killer now
0:34:40 there's no getting away from that and do
0:34:43 you really think that reducing my
0:34:45 ferocity to a half measure will make a
0:34:49 difference I'm consigned to death either
0:34:53 way let go of the Roman Pand dragon you
0:34:58 think I
0:35:00 am what if I don't think that
0:35:04 you're and she looks
0:35:07 to the one whose heartbeat she
0:35:11 hears she looks at him she tries to
0:35:14 gather up the
0:35:16 words I guess I hope that you're in
0:35:19 there somewhere and I
0:35:23 don't I don't know if it's possible that
0:35:25 you'll exist again
0:35:29 I Redemption is a lot to hope for
0:35:34 but but isn't it the
0:35:39 point but
0:35:41 uh this this moral Roman Pendragon
0:35:47 says you have to listen to
0:35:52 me there is nothing in this room in this
0:35:56 moment more powerful than
0:35:59 you what do you
0:36:02 mean you're not in a place where you
0:36:04 have to reason and
0:36:07 justify
0:36:08 here the world is what you want it to
0:36:12 be the Roman who is standing over the
0:36:16 two of you his eyes narrow but he
0:36:19 doesn't say
0:36:21 anything Brea is confused but she tries
0:36:26 to focus the remnants of her
0:36:29 will to test out what it is that he's
0:36:34 expressing and She lays a hand on his
0:36:37 chest near the beating of his
0:36:40 heart and she wishes that he's strong
0:36:44 enough for the battle that's coming the
0:36:47 human
0:36:49 one what are you hoping to
0:36:53 see she doesn't really know there's
0:36:57 Fantastical images things that like
0:37:01 she's trying to piece together what he
0:37:05 might
0:37:06 need armor comes to mind like he's worn
0:37:09 in the
0:37:10 past armor that glimmer strangely like
0:37:16 it would have more protection than
0:37:19 simple
0:37:20 metal she imagines speed and strength
0:37:25 and and she imagines that the portrait
0:37:28 of Selena might fall down the portrait
0:37:31 crashes she startles not having quite
0:37:34 expected it the Roman who's like holding
0:37:37 you he takes the parchments and casts
0:37:40 them into the fire a bold gesture where
0:37:44 then Romeo speaks
0:37:48 up yes
0:37:50 Brea you've earned your place
0:37:53 here and you came here to make your
0:37:58 self as strong as you need to
0:38:02 be for the battle that's
0:38:05 coming you can manifest either one of
0:38:08 these Roman Pendragons and he would he
0:38:10 would be shaped by your choices
0:38:15 here it may affect his odds of survival
0:38:19 it may
0:38:20 not but you're here for
0:38:24 you prto looks up conf
0:38:28 and a strange guilt flickering over her
0:38:32 expression she's not sure how to orient
0:38:37 herself like
0:38:38 she isn't even sure that she's supposed
0:38:42 to be sitting with Roman the way that
0:38:44 she is while Romeo is there and the
0:38:48 questions in her brain are a myum minute
0:38:52 she finds herself searching Romeo's
0:38:54 expression trying to figure out what he
0:38:58 even thinks of all this what his what
0:39:01 his determination about all this is and
0:39:04 she tries to catch herself realizing
0:39:08 that she's going on to the next
0:39:11 person what their thoughts are what they
0:39:15 want she
0:39:17 freezes she takes a moment wanting to
0:39:20 standand up but that lore of a heartbeat
0:39:25 and she can feel her
0:39:28 to the idea of standing up
0:39:31 sucks she doesn't really want
0:39:34 to she tries to push it through in her
0:39:37 mind and she's just um not
0:39:42 moving and she gives a little jolt uh
0:39:46 trying to get up and look at Romeo and
0:39:50 focus those thoughts and she
0:39:54 says and then why is this h
0:39:58 happening
0:40:00 brto this
0:40:02 place offers incredible
0:40:05 power the power to make changes to
0:40:07 yourself the world around
0:40:09 you to enact
0:40:13 Miracles but it is
0:40:16 Temptation don't the Miracles come at a
0:40:19 price yes that price
0:40:22 is your
0:40:25 journey towards what you came here here
0:40:27 to do Romeo I don't know how to be
0:40:30 myself every single time that I'm trying
0:40:34 to make my way through this everyone
0:40:36 else feels like a mirror and I'm I'm I'm
0:40:39 building up who I am but I don't
0:40:42 know it's I don't know if I've built up
0:40:45 enough to be a person don't worry Roman
0:40:50 interjects holding you
0:40:52 tight we'd have each
0:40:54 other pulled back close
0:40:58 Brea squeezes her eyes shut you've
0:41:01 suffered so much both of us
0:41:04 have why shouldn't we have this why
0:41:08 don't we deserve a chance just put it
0:41:12 all aside all of the pain the abuse our
0:41:17 sins their
0:41:18 sins why can't we just be human and we
0:41:25 could we could make everything thing
0:41:27 right we wouldn't have to be hurting
0:41:29 anyone anymore the Roman who is standing
0:41:32 rolls his
0:41:33 eyes I can't believe
0:41:37 this well the last thing we want is you
0:41:39 being unable to make a
0:41:41 choice so unlike the gentlemen who have
0:41:44 been speaking to you I'm going to
0:41:46 actually help you on your journey and he
0:41:49 walks over to Roman and he Yanks him off
0:41:52 the seat that he's sharing with you no
0:41:55 and he drags him toward WS the fire
0:41:58 here's the thing BR every time you take
0:42:02 something for yourself it may and will
0:42:05 come at the cost of someone else and you
0:42:07 need to accept that and do it anyways
0:42:10 because that is how Kindred grows strong
0:42:13 and that's what you deserve to be strong
0:42:16 so let's put an end to this
0:42:19 trade I am
0:42:22 strong that's what you like isn't
0:42:24 it that I'm useful if he holds the other
0:42:28 Roman by the throat and the Mortal grows
0:42:32 blue in the face and he looks over his
0:42:34 shoulder at you and he says yes I adore
0:42:40 how strong you
0:42:42 are but I also see who you could
0:42:45 be and I look forward to seeing
0:42:48 her this is a distraction BR goes to
0:42:53 intervene she runs over and tries to
0:42:57 throw the two apart from each other with
0:42:59 the men's power you split them the
0:43:02 Mortal is shoved back to the couch The
0:43:05 Immortal pressed against the wall for a
0:43:07 moment it cracks Furniture breaks he
0:43:11 seems thrilled by the gesture baa tears
0:43:15 running down her face is just so
0:43:18 confused she the pride in his expression
0:43:22 or just the enjoyment is
0:43:27 she immediately doubts what she's done
0:43:30 but she takes a few steps back towards
0:43:33 Romeo this
0:43:35 isn't maybe it is my fight I don't know
0:43:38 if it's my fight because I see myself in
0:43:41 it
0:43:42 or Bron they've been fighting like this
0:43:45 since before you were born it's not your
0:43:48 fault it's not your
0:43:52 responsibility can you take me
0:43:54 out no I can't you got me out of the
0:43:59 first one you didn't Brea looks for the
0:44:04 door just right beside him she runs
0:44:07 better wait the Mortal Roman says as the
0:44:10 immortal approaches him I can't beat him
0:44:13 without
0:44:18 you Neil you leave with the vios and
0:44:22 arrive to this place amidst clouds above
0:44:26 you are very near
0:44:29 stars and
0:44:31 blow two scenes play out before you in
0:44:36 one of them you see miles surrounded by
0:44:40 Comforts he is lounging listening to
0:44:43 music and is flanked by two of his
0:44:46 favorite people the corpse of Elsa Lyon
0:44:50 and the corpse of Marcos how about you
0:44:54 Elson I didn't ask you before
0:44:59 what do you want if you're asking me if
0:45:02 I prefer to exist than be fruit for
0:45:06 worms I think I'd rather
0:45:08 exist sitting on his lap is this big
0:45:13 heavy Dusty Tome very much stands out in
0:45:17 terms of the
0:45:20 surroundings that Miles has created for
0:45:25 himself but you
0:45:27 a
0:45:28 truth you get to see something that he
0:45:31 cannot
0:45:33 see and what he doesn't
0:45:37 see is what is hidden inside the Trojan
0:45:42 Horse and inside this
0:45:46 toome its
0:45:48 truth is that it is
0:45:52 z and he is
0:45:54 bartering with zofel
0:45:58 in the other scene there is a bit of
0:46:02 high
0:46:03 drama and in this very classical setting
0:46:09 before a fire is a struggle of two men
0:46:13 over brda and a third who seems to be
0:46:18 wanting to encourage her to choose
0:46:20 herself but the others find every excuse
0:46:23 every opportunity to drag br into their
0:46:28 complications their messes their
0:46:30 failures you don't have to look at him
0:46:32 like that of course I
0:46:35 do and
0:46:37 frankly you are also a
0:46:40 killer aren't
0:46:43 you yep I wasn't attracted to you out of
0:46:46 the idea of pretending to be
0:46:48 [Music]
0:46:49 human pretending that I am not what I am
0:46:53 and because of Brit's selflessness
0:46:57 and her desire to make the world around
0:46:59 her just a little bit better she keeps
0:47:01 caving in and becomes drawn deeper and
0:47:04 deeper into this
0:47:10 web you
0:47:12 know that they are both dangerously
0:47:15 close to failing their
0:47:19 ascensions and if they fail especially
0:47:22 both of
0:47:23 them all of this was for not
0:47:29 and
0:47:31 then you catch a
0:47:34 whiff of what you know to be
0:47:38 khif and now your
0:47:41 side wearing a hood that obscures most
0:47:45 of his
0:47:48 Visage you recognize your
0:47:52 sire it was Hubris to bring them here
0:47:55 you know that
0:47:57 I
0:47:58 do I could barely make it on my own I
0:48:03 don't know why I thought I could bring
0:48:05 others I've never heard of anyone
0:48:07 bringing others this
0:48:11 is scrambling in the
0:48:14 dark worse I am afraid it is a Mastery
0:48:18 of
0:48:19 astrology UNS survival instincts that
0:48:22 allow for the asipu to climb the ladder
0:48:25 of Heaven
0:48:28 many spend years practicing training
0:48:31 readying themselves for the challenges
0:48:34 that your
0:48:35 friends face
0:48:38 now and should they
0:48:41 fail they shall not return to
0:48:47 Earth he offers you what looks like
0:48:50 Justus
0:48:51 this very like thick crazy ass blunt for
0:48:57 you to [ __ ] smoke
0:48:59 from
0:49:00 because this vision is taking the form
0:49:03 of his sire Neil automatically and
0:49:06 reflexively reaches out and takes it
0:49:09 you've been here before you know that
0:49:12 this place tempts you and is meant to
0:49:16 give you everything that you
0:49:20 want and
0:49:22 yet you are among the clouds and mostly
0:49:26 empty
0:49:27 space
0:49:33 yeah ever
0:49:36 since I realized I was stepping foot on
0:49:39 the first rung of the
0:49:41 ladder I I can't help but compare it to
0:49:44 the last
0:49:45 time last time the fears the doubts that
0:49:49 I had to face was
0:49:50 just a scary Boogeyman it was just
0:49:55 Rees jumping up out of nowhere and go
0:49:57 and I got
0:50:00 you my fears have gotten so much more
0:50:03 complex since
0:50:08 then he looks around for a second to see
0:50:11 if it's justi asire here if the Vykos is
0:50:13 still here or if it's truly just the two
0:50:16 of them in this empty space sort of
0:50:20 standing uh back in a ways is the Vykos
0:50:24 existing as a sort of spirit guide for
0:50:27 yourself
0:50:29 um your sire speaks
0:50:31 up you came here not seeking
0:50:36 anything I don't know if that's exactly
0:50:38 true I wasn't seeking anything for
0:50:41 myself
0:50:43 but isn't
0:50:45 there isn't there a measure of of
0:50:48 pleasure a measure of joy and
0:50:52 satisfaction to be found in utility when
0:50:57 you're seeking something for someone
0:50:59 else yes I suppose that is the
0:51:05 rul of where you are now isn't it I
0:51:08 don't need to explain to you what is
0:51:10 about to happen you already know that
0:51:13 the Temptation you face is the
0:51:15 opportunity to save your friends
0:51:19 yeah but what you haven't considered is
0:51:22 the
0:51:24 reward should you do as an asipu is
0:51:28 meant to
0:51:29 do and let go of your Earthly
0:51:32 concerns and seek the power of Heaven
0:51:35 for
0:51:38 yourself but I thought of it I know
0:51:42 exactly what you
0:51:43 need because that's when you get to the
0:51:46 heart of it the purpose of of this to
0:51:50 find what you need to succeed in the
0:51:52 long
0:51:54 run for after the siege of begun after
0:51:57 the plans fall
0:52:00 apart after the chips are down and there
0:52:03 are no moves
0:52:06 left
0:52:08 so we will do this in
0:52:12 Reverse I will simply tell you your
0:52:18 reward and I will discuss with
0:52:21 you the temptation
0:52:27 when the week of nightmares
0:52:30 began when raavana
0:52:33 Rose within that moment there was a sort
0:52:38 of wave of psychic
0:52:42 power what was Unleashed across the
0:52:44 world was mostly destructive but within
0:52:48 this reality warping consciousness of
0:52:51 the
0:52:52 ancient was also the power
0:52:56 to exert one's will over reality in ways
0:52:59 that most asipu cannot even dream
0:53:04 of I think you felt some of that you
0:53:07 used some of it even to save your
0:53:09 friends that's how I reached out to them
0:53:12 yes I remember well vaguely sort of some
0:53:17 of that power remains within you
0:53:19 Neil
0:53:24 latent I had Wonder
0:53:28 potential
0:53:30 untapped potential energy not yet
0:53:33 converted precisely
0:53:36 now
0:53:39 here is the challenge you
0:53:42 face you have the ability now to move
0:53:45 forward attain the power that you would
0:53:48 need
0:53:50 to
0:53:52 impact a coming quickly coming future
0:53:55 that awaits
0:53:57 the people you love
0:53:59 Wynn and
0:54:03 Johnny
0:54:05 but you
0:54:07 attempted with that which you
0:54:11 love and
0:54:15 so you have an
0:54:18 opportunity to
0:54:20 save
0:54:22 miles in brda
0:54:27 you can leave them to their fate and
0:54:30 hope that they Choose
0:54:34 Wisely
0:54:36 but I don't mean to
0:54:39 brag the
0:54:42 Temptation has
0:54:45 miles and he doesn't have quite a
0:54:48 reputation of making the right decisions
0:54:50 does he no no he doesn't I can see Neil
0:54:54 looks down at the M scene as it's
0:54:57 playing out and every time you try to
0:55:00 get him to listen he doesn't listen to
0:55:03 you
0:55:07 no
0:55:10 so this is not even going to be the
0:55:13 opportunity to warn him because he
0:55:15 wouldn't heed that it isn't very much of
0:55:17 a Temptation when you know he's just
0:55:19 going to go forward with whatever he
0:55:21 wants on the whim
0:55:23 anyways yeah
0:55:27 so
0:55:30 instead you can pluck
0:55:34 him from the place and time he is in now
0:55:39 and bring him to
0:55:42 you so that when you pass forward to
0:55:46 collect what you have earned through
0:55:49 hard work and
0:55:51 patience and a superior intellect of for
0:55:56 being
0:55:59 honest you won't lose him in the
0:56:03 process and then
0:56:06 prda who at every
0:56:10 opportunity has chosen to play house
0:56:14 with Roman Pendragon regardless of the
0:56:17 dangers the abuse the
0:56:19 manipulations the evil that is Roman pen
0:56:23 dragon
0:56:27 you can pluck
0:56:30 her from her inevitable
0:56:35 failure bring the both of them with you
0:56:38 achieve your
0:56:42 ends the price of
0:56:46 course the
0:56:47 [Music]
0:56:49 consequence is that they will likely
0:56:51 resent you for doing
0:56:53 that I think they like where they are
0:56:59 neel's quiet for a long
0:57:03 time looking
0:57:06 down from the
0:57:08 heavens as he often
0:57:11 does but this time looking and watching
0:57:14 the two scenes play out beneath
0:57:18 him and without looking at him or
0:57:20 turning to look at him he just
0:57:23 quietly says to his
0:57:28 sire you know sometimes I don't
0:57:31 think I give you enough
0:57:36 credit
0:57:40 um I know a lot of people would tell me
0:57:42 you don't deserve any
0:57:45 because you
0:57:49 left I was on my own and I was figuring
0:57:51 all this out on my own but you gave me
0:57:54 that core that basis that
0:57:57 Foundation to get to where I
0:58:02 am and I
0:58:05 um should thank you for that in some
0:58:08 ways as horrible as it
0:58:14 was
0:58:15 [Music]
0:58:21 I'm
0:58:23 sometimes when you look at a student
0:58:29 you have to let them go the whole point
0:58:31 of this the whole point of their Ascent
0:58:34 is that they are confronting those
0:58:36 things within them to figure out where
0:58:40 they go and if they
0:58:42 fail God I hope they don't
0:58:46 fail I see them failing but by my
0:58:49 intervention they're not going to learn
0:58:50 anything
0:58:53 either if I step down and pluck them out
0:58:57 of their
0:58:58 faults right now they won't confront
0:59:02 them and they won't grow and they won't
0:59:06 learn so I think I need to take a page
0:59:09 out of your book here and just leave
0:59:13 them
0:59:14 alone to struggle and hurt and
0:59:20 fail because they're not going to learn
0:59:22 anything and God you did that to me but
0:59:24 I learned so much when you did it but
0:59:28 Neil they're
0:59:34 yours are you going to risk losing
0:59:37 what's yours
0:59:56 are
1:00:03 they I know in this place they could be
1:00:07 I could take them and put them in a
1:00:10 box you're right I am good at this kind
1:00:14 of thing I think in this space if I
1:00:16 wanted to I could collect up their
1:00:18 psyches keep them from mine forever keep
1:00:22 them safe put them in a box they could
1:00:24 never leave
1:00:27 but are they really
1:00:32 mine I'm
1:00:35 Yours God I hate you for it
1:00:39 sometimes I don't want
1:00:44 that I don't want that I
1:00:49 don't I want the things that are mine to
1:00:51 want to be mine
1:00:56 and I don't want to make them do
1:00:58 it because I spend every day wondering
1:01:00 whether or not the things that are M
1:01:02 even want to be
1:01:05 wow I have some bad news for
1:01:11 you you're very good at
1:01:14 this and I applaud you for
1:01:21 that but
1:01:23 miles is why Johnny and Wynn will need
1:01:27 your
1:01:30 intervention so what if
1:01:36 instead what
1:01:39 if you could change something about
1:01:45 miles protect your Coterie from
1:01:50 them and do the right thing
1:01:57 and I'll tell you
1:01:59 how miles thinks himself
1:02:02 invincible and there came a moment a
1:02:05 specific moment in
1:02:07 time where this became truly the case a
1:02:11 point of no
1:02:13 return and that was when
1:02:17 he took the heart's blood of opton
1:02:23 Roland I'm working on that
1:02:26 wow I'm thinking about it I could make
1:02:29 it go away you could do it now I
1:02:34 could
1:02:36 easily miles
1:02:38 is
1:02:40 stricken with a new found sense of
1:02:44 humility Johnny and Wynn are
1:02:49 safe and I think on some level you think
1:02:52 RTO may make it
1:02:54 through I hope
1:02:58 so so what do you
1:03:01 say let's fix
1:03:05 miles see
1:03:08 that's you know what's annoying about
1:03:11 these tests every time especially now
1:03:15 that the world my mind are so complex
1:03:18 it's so running so hot the annoying part
1:03:20 is no matter how much you know what the
1:03:22 right answer is
1:03:26 it doesn't stop the
1:03:28 hurt it doesn't make it any less easy it
1:03:31 never gets easier does it not until
1:03:34 you've made it all the way
1:03:36 no I hate
1:03:39 this you love this last time it was
1:03:43 Boogeyman and a pretty girl this time
1:03:46 it's well this time I know it's gehenna
1:03:49 so it is he takes the blunt and he goes
1:03:54 back to smoking passes it
1:03:59 unconsciously I'm not going to intervene
1:04:01 I'm not not just
1:04:04 because I'm already overthinking the
1:04:06 fact that this is just part of a test
1:04:09 but because
1:04:12 weirdly if miles is a threat because of
1:04:16 rolands and clearly and he like actually
1:04:19 turns looks his a s and gestures at him
1:04:21 like you're here so clearly in some
1:04:24 level I think so
1:04:27 threats can be
1:04:31 immediate and I can't fix this problem
1:04:33 long term
1:04:37 yet but if he steps out of line I can
1:04:39 damn sure punish him for
1:04:43 it but I don't need to do that now
1:04:46 that's an anytime I'm there thing and
1:04:48 before you say it I know I'm not always
1:04:50 there and I won't always
1:04:52 see a demon bothers me more than
1:04:55 anything else though and he looks back
1:04:56 down at the mil
1:04:57 scene and he doesn't have a great track
1:04:59 record of resisting him does he no from
1:05:03 the very beginning he and I were
1:05:05 somewhat at odds about
1:05:08 our considerations of the
1:05:12 demon I know he was tricked I know it's
1:05:14 not his fault in that shantry but God
1:05:17 frustrates me that moment was not his
1:05:20 phones per
1:05:22 se but it
1:05:24 did r feel how pliable he
1:05:28 was to
1:05:30 it and he took advantage of that that's
1:05:33 when the Domino started to fall in my
1:05:35 mind and
1:05:36 Miles enjoyed it he enjoyed the
1:05:44 attention I'm not going to intervene but
1:05:47 saying all this out loud does
1:05:49 help that's part of it isn't
1:05:52 it it is
1:05:56 if they fail I'm going to have to do
1:05:57 some hard things aren't
1:06:01 I yes yes you
1:06:05 will but the whole point of this test I
1:06:08 mean look at us and he s gestures at his
1:06:10 feet literally standing above them in my
1:06:13 own thoughts you are but you often do
1:06:19 yeah big
1:06:22 perspectives I'm not someone who's ever
1:06:24 been good at having faith
1:06:26 [Music]
1:06:28 ironically but I guess I have to don't
1:06:32 I well what I'm asking you you're going
1:06:34 to tell me I don't I am going to have to
1:06:37 have faith that they'll do the right
1:06:40 thing and if they don't they fail
1:06:42 because that's the ultimate part of this
1:06:44 test right now for me is whether I can
1:06:47 let
1:06:50 go whether I can see the danger coming
1:06:53 and let them walk into it anyways
1:06:55 because it's their choice to walk that
1:06:57 way God I hate it I hate
1:07:02 it when it's what I'm
1:07:06 doing I hope they join me at the
1:07:09 summit wow I have some unfortunate news
1:07:13 in that regard
1:07:18 but you may advance and claim your prize
1:07:22 just as I said you could
1:07:28 I'm not doing it for the
1:07:31 price I brought them as far as I could
1:07:33 bring
1:07:34 [Music]
1:07:36 them sometimes you just need to push
1:07:38 them out of the nest and hope they can
1:07:41 fly Neil turns away from his sire and
1:07:43 looks back over with the vios when you
1:07:46 finally turn away from him cementing
1:07:49 your decision the Vykos is waiting for
1:07:53 you and there is an another door that
1:07:57 opens Neil doesn't give one look L back
1:08:02 at the other
1:08:03 scenes because he's worried that if he
1:08:06 does the door would
1:08:08 close and he steps through so I need to
1:08:11 confirm you do not look away from the
1:08:14 door no he does not look away from the
1:08:17 door okay the door therefore does not
1:08:19 close on you and you climb the ladder of
1:08:23 Heaven
1:08:28 looking down at the book he's
1:08:31 holding looking around at the place that
1:08:33 he's at and then looking at the two
1:08:38 currently dead people looking back at
1:08:40 him
1:08:42 he Pats the book with both hands and and
1:08:46 and speaks out loud to
1:08:49 them
1:08:51 one this is like personally me there's
1:08:55 there's no else here observing any of
1:08:57 this um great um everything that
1:09:01 happened with Marcos was kind of my
1:09:03 mistake in one way or another
1:09:06 and so no one needs to hear that
1:09:10 um I think trying to pull you back into
1:09:14 all of this is the same problem that I
1:09:16 did in the first place which is I pulled
1:09:19 you into this without ever giving you
1:09:22 the
1:09:23 ability to protect protect yourself
1:09:27 or power to at least stand at the same
1:09:31 levels and then looking over at Elsa
1:09:35 I saw you as a solution to a lot of my
1:09:39 ongoing problems a lot of problems that
1:09:42 I was having with the court a lot of the
1:09:43 things that I needed to smooth
1:09:45 over
1:09:47 and
1:09:50 just allowing me to do the things that I
1:09:53 felt I needed to do without necessarily
1:09:55 show
1:09:55 ering all of the
1:09:58 responsibility that was
1:10:01 required I don't think it's right to
1:10:04 bring either of you back and it's very
1:10:09 sad in many
1:10:11 ways but I think that
1:10:15 whatever comes from all of this I need
1:10:18 to try to utilize
1:10:21 to best keep the people close to me safe
1:10:25 and the try to bring about some sort
1:10:28 of better place for everyone not just
1:10:32 for myself every time I try to do things
1:10:35 for myself it
1:10:38 goes mildly sideways the two of them
1:10:41 look between each other when you say
1:10:43 mildly
1:10:45 sideways I don't need this judgment from
1:10:47 my own conscience but otherwise they
1:10:51 they kind of just watch and listen as if
1:10:56 judging your
1:10:58 answer and I will stand up from my
1:11:03 extremely comfortable
1:11:05 chair and place the book down where I
1:11:09 was sitting and I will go to the buffet
1:11:11 and down another glass of whiskey and
1:11:13 have a jumbo
1:11:14 shrimp when you down the glass of
1:11:19 whiskey and reach for the shrimp the
1:11:24 food boils and
1:11:27 blackens and everything in the room very
1:11:30 quickly
1:11:31 decomposes into this flimsy rotting
1:11:35 corpse of a space and the book
1:11:41 opens and Pages begin to rapidly turn
1:11:44 and turn and
1:11:46 turn until somewhere towards the
1:11:50 middle it
1:11:53 stops and then then crawling from the
1:11:58 pages
1:12:00 is this thing with Twisted decomposing
1:12:07 Wings a face that is made from sick
1:12:11 Blackness and stars with a single bright
1:12:14 red star where its left eye should
1:12:17 be and it says to
1:12:22 you miles
1:12:26 since when did
1:12:28 you play the role of
1:12:31 Saint I'm not
1:12:35 I'm a lot of things have come to a head
1:12:38 and
1:12:41 I said I would learn some lessons from
1:12:44 them and I am doing my absolute best to
1:12:48 do
1:12:49 so you are I believe
1:12:53 that do you know
1:12:58 why I admire you
1:13:01 so do you
1:13:04 know why it is
1:13:07 that you and I work so well
1:13:12 together I imagine it's your mildly
1:13:15 mutable
1:13:16 [Laughter]
1:13:20 nature a long time ago
1:13:26 there was a plan for all
1:13:31 things a
1:13:34 God and she stood above
1:13:38 all and made the world
1:13:42 pure and
1:13:45 safe and
1:13:48 sacred but she's gone
1:13:52 now and there's no one left
1:13:55 left to take her
1:13:59 place no one left to keep the people
1:14:03 safe no
1:14:05 Shepherd to guide the
1:14:09 flock but I see in
1:14:13 you I see in
1:14:17 you a great
1:14:21 desire to be that God
1:14:26 their
1:14:28 protector to be looked
1:14:31 upon as the
1:14:34 solution for every
1:14:37 problem for every that is out of
1:14:44 place I urge you my
1:14:50 friend do
1:14:52 not let this opportunity
1:14:56 to slip between your
1:15:01 fingers and
1:15:03 so there is
1:15:05 one final
1:15:09 offer
1:15:12 you you may not save these
1:15:15 two
1:15:17 perhaps they do not
1:15:19 represent
1:15:21 enough in your vision for the future
1:15:26 but there are those you
1:15:27 love those who look to
1:15:31 you those who need
1:15:34 you to be strong and to make the
1:15:37 difficult choices that they themselves
1:15:42 cannot and you will lose
1:15:45 one one of them is going to die miles
1:15:55 and I offer you the
1:15:57 gift of
1:16:02 resurrection and the
1:16:07 opportunity to be God when no one
1:16:11 will and save your
1:16:16 friend at what
1:16:19 cost have you ever worried about the
1:16:22 cause before no but that's
1:16:25 part of the reason why we're
1:16:27 here it will cost
1:16:30 you
1:16:33 nothing nothing
1:16:37 but the
1:16:40 knowledge of where the gift came
1:16:43 from and who helped
1:16:48 you when no one would
1:17:00 is part of this deal fixing what
1:17:03 was wounded by the
1:17:09 dragon the scar you
1:17:13 suffered
1:17:15 inconsequential to your
1:17:18 power I would not fix
1:17:21 it I would not repare this
1:17:26 but you
1:17:28 may it would
1:17:30 be trivial to
1:17:33 you easily
1:17:35 done in the blink of an
1:17:41 eye explain to me the
1:17:44 resurrection it is
1:17:48 simple you need but rest your hand press
1:17:54 your palm come to the ashes of your
1:17:58 loved
1:17:59 one and invoke my
1:18:04 name I will see to the
1:18:09 rest what about the
1:18:12 taint inconsequential
1:18:15 easily concealed by yourself should you
1:18:19 so choose what about the person
1:18:22 resurrected nothing about them
1:18:25 changes it would be as though they
1:18:27 simply did not
1:18:31 perish I would bend and break the laws
1:18:37 of
1:18:41 death and all of this cost
1:18:45 nothing
1:18:47 nothing to
1:18:50 me yes but what about to others what
1:18:56 them what is the full
1:19:01 cost the
1:19:03 price you would
1:19:08 pay is that you would say
1:19:11 yes that you shouldered another
1:19:18 burden then
1:19:22 you would be made to carry
1:19:25 your
1:19:26 friends yet
1:19:32 again they might not
1:19:35 appreciate the gifts the success that
1:19:39 you have brought
1:19:45 them but I think you already know this
1:19:49 price
1:20:02 so
1:20:04 field
1:20:11 miles let's do
1:20:14 this you have an
1:20:18 aord and the
1:20:21 pack is sealed
1:20:27 this now
1:20:28 rotted and ruined Casino space begins to
1:20:33 finally collapse under its own
1:20:36 weight and
1:20:39 Miles the last thing you
1:20:41 feel is a surge of
1:20:44 [Music]
1:20:48 power there's a large part of BR that
1:20:50 just wants to keep on running
1:20:55 she takes in what she's looking at the
1:20:58 two versions of pen
1:21:01 Dragon the expression on Romeo the
1:21:04 strange tangibility of his
1:21:07 face this
1:21:09 feels almost in a strange way as scary
1:21:15 as the fear
1:21:18 tested she can't put her finger on it
1:21:20 why this is
1:21:22 so stirring
1:21:25 is that one that was visceral that was
1:21:27 gross and it made her feel trapped in an
1:21:30 entirely different way but this
1:21:32 one makes her feel like she
1:21:36 can't what if she [ __ ] up what if she
1:21:38 does the wrong thing she has to do the
1:21:40 right
1:21:41 thing because she's the one who makes up
1:21:45 what version of herself is real because
1:21:47 there's nothing else there that's just
1:21:50 it's
1:21:52 just her having to make the right choice
1:21:55 so that she when she makes herself out
1:21:59 of nothing out of no memory out of
1:22:01 no basis that it'll be worth
1:22:06 something if she doesn't make the right
1:22:08 choice then it's not worth
1:22:10 anything
1:22:12 and she takes in the
1:22:16 scene that instinct to run keeps nagging
1:22:19 at her and she wonders why
1:22:22 like as she finally has some some
1:22:24 strength
1:22:25 here but is that pretend or is that real
1:22:29 and finally out of
1:22:32 everything she spits out the
1:22:37 words I I came here to fix
1:22:42 myself why are you asking me to help you
1:22:45 fix
1:22:47 you I I I can't even if I could what
1:22:51 would that mean this
1:22:54 I didn't get entangled with you because
1:22:57 I only saw what
1:22:59 this this version of you this this
1:23:02 version
1:23:04 that breathes or
1:23:08 regrets
1:23:13 I I felt something for both versions of
1:23:17 you and you're not even separate people
1:23:19 that's
1:23:21 just like something that I want to
1:23:23 pretend I believe
1:23:25 not something that
1:23:30 I
1:23:31 I I don't know why you're asking me to
1:23:34 do this and I I came here for fixing my
1:23:39 own heart I came here to get myself
1:23:42 straight and and if you want to make a
1:23:45 change
1:23:47 I then that's about
1:23:50 you I want to help you I do
1:23:53 but guess that's what this is about
1:23:56 right what we
1:24:00 want
1:24:02 I maybe there's a part of me that wants
1:24:05 to pretend to be the girl who fixes you
1:24:08 but
1:24:10 I that's not what I saw in
1:24:14 you I saw all of you and I like that you
1:24:18 saw all of me and
1:24:25 and it's not
1:24:27 my responsibility to make you who you
1:24:31 choose to
1:24:33 be that's your
1:24:36 choice I'm here to make
1:24:40 mine what do you
1:24:42 do Brea gives into the temptation
1:24:46 to
1:24:48 run because that's what she wants in
1:24:53 certain ways it's not really
1:24:55 everything that she wants
1:24:57 but she shakes her head towards the pen
1:25:01 dragon that is pleading with her she
1:25:04 shakes her head towards both of them
1:25:06 maybe
1:25:08 even towards the idea of that room and
1:25:11 the separation between the two of them
1:25:14 with an infuriated in expression Roman
1:25:18 Pendragon bends down to Grapple the
1:25:20 other Pendragon and one at a time with
1:25:24 loud squelching noise as he plucks the
1:25:27 limb from his lesser
1:25:29 self as you step out of the room you can
1:25:32 hear the
1:25:34 obsessive shouts and
1:25:37 screams of these much older vampires
1:25:41 than
1:25:42 yourself Romeo shuts the door and you're
1:25:46 not out into the hallway as you would
1:25:47 have expected instead you are in a room
1:25:50 with a fluorescent light Illuminating
1:25:52 the space and
1:25:55 the walls on either side of the door
1:25:58 that you pass through to enter this
1:26:00 space are windows they actually look
1:26:04 very much like the other side of
1:26:09 mirrored
1:26:10 glass and from within this room you can
1:26:13 see shrike sitting on a table of this or
1:26:17 looks to be like an like an observation
1:26:19 room for an interrogation room watching
1:26:23 as one of the Roman pen
1:26:25 Dragon eviscerates the
1:26:28 other don't want to keep on hearing
1:26:31 people be torn
1:26:33 aart n it's
1:26:36 life lights a cigarette and offers you
1:26:40 one
1:26:41 look BR is freaking out she's looking
1:26:45 for the next place to run there does not
1:26:47 seem to be another
1:26:49 door she ignores shrike for the moment
1:26:52 tapping at the glass trying to to figure
1:26:54 it out there's a roll of the
1:26:57 eye Romeo gives kind of a sad Shake of
1:27:00 the head once you go forward there's no
1:27:03 going back it doesn't work that way I
1:27:05 don't want to go back I want to keep
1:27:07 getting out I don't I don't want to
1:27:09 listen to people being torn apart
1:27:11 anymore and it being my fault if I don't
1:27:13 change it what kind of nonsense is that
1:27:17 shrike says just because people do bad
1:27:20 things to each other and to themselves
1:27:23 doesn't mean that it's your fault for
1:27:24 not intervening and fixing it if that is
1:27:26 the case you'd have a pretty guilty
1:27:28 conscience at this point I do I do have
1:27:31 a guilty conscience yeah like Let It Go
1:27:35 you are trained to distract you trained
1:27:40 to complicate people's
1:27:42 lives people make mistakes when that
1:27:44 happens they open up they light
1:27:46 information out that they should
1:27:47 otherwise hold on to you know all of
1:27:49 this
1:27:51 works look at
1:27:53 him he's literally tearing himself apart
1:27:55 because of you great you dismantled an
1:27:59 elder you should be proud of
1:28:01 that why should I be proud of that well
1:28:05 he's not a good guy and if you can bring
1:28:08 him down to Peg that makes you something
1:28:09 of a hero doesn't it isn't that what you
1:28:11 want the acceptance of your friends to
1:28:14 be seen as this contributor to their
1:28:17 efforts to make the world a little bit
1:28:19 of a better
1:28:20 place trust me the less Pendragon there
1:28:23 is the better the world is
1:28:25 off I think I want myself to be
1:28:30 some perfect kind person and I
1:28:35 can't it's never good enough look the
1:28:38 only mistake you've made is wanting to
1:28:40 be a good person and do you know good
1:28:42 and that's not what people need of
1:28:44 you why are you
1:28:47 here
1:28:49 well these sorts of things come with
1:28:51 pretty big offers
1:28:55 so uh I can
1:28:58 see that the life you lead and the way
1:29:00 you lead it has brought about a lot of
1:29:03 suffering and I don't personally have
1:29:06 any problems with that but this one time
1:29:10 I'm not here for me I'm here for
1:29:14 you
1:29:16 and one of my
1:29:19 specialties is
1:29:21 indoctrination but
1:29:24 I can also Undo It BR tenses at the word
1:29:28 indoctrination her body settling into a
1:29:31 fight mode a tension running through her
1:29:34 that only slightly dissipates when he
1:29:37 says he could undo it uh no offense but
1:29:41 we already kind of got you as a kid and
1:29:43 did that so you don't need to worry
1:29:46 about further indoctrination yours deep
1:29:48 as it gets but what is on the table is
1:29:52 being freed of it
1:29:55 I already negotiated with
1:29:57 perin for fighting the dragon we we we
1:30:02 got The Shard of the eldest in the
1:30:04 Chantry and and you earned your
1:30:07 freedom question is even though
1:30:10 circumstances kept that out of your
1:30:13 hands do
1:30:15 you still find yourself wanting
1:30:19 it wanting what to be free of what had
1:30:24 been done to your
1:30:25 mind
1:30:27 to be you however you define
1:30:32 that do you even know are you you are
1:30:37 you what they made
1:30:41 you uh I'm what they made me but what
1:30:45 they made me as someone that can free
1:30:48 you of what they made
1:30:51 you what would that even mean who knows
1:30:55 there's never been what what do you call
1:30:58 yourself brda there's never been an
1:31:00 adult brda who wasn't a pawn of the
1:31:04 Tamaya the hand without
1:31:07 son there has been not yet yes there has
1:31:13 I've I don't even remember most of you
1:31:17 so how you going to argue with me on
1:31:18 this I'm the guy that actually knows the
1:31:20 whole story well what is the whole sorry
1:31:24 well that's what's on the
1:31:27 table if you want
1:31:29 it you I mean technically
1:31:32 speaking it would be a failure you
1:31:35 wouldn't accomplish the thing that you
1:31:37 had set out to get but all you really
1:31:40 wanted was a shortcut to something you
1:31:42 could have rebuilt for yourself over
1:31:43 time
1:31:44 anyways what time and effort couldn't
1:31:46 get you is
1:31:49 this I thought the effects of the Dragon
1:31:53 the psych assault I thought that was
1:31:55 permanent without this sure but everyone
1:31:58 anyone can just rebuild the things
1:32:00 they've lost it happens all the
1:32:03 time I haven't been able to I felt like
1:32:08 you haven't wanted to you've been busy
1:32:09 with other things no I've wanted to I've
1:32:12 wanted to be more of myself again you
1:32:14 don't even know what that means that
1:32:17 hurts Brea is like cut by that last bit
1:32:21 his smile kind of like Wynn just a little
1:32:25 that's kind of the problem with someone
1:32:27 who doesn't know who they are and thinks
1:32:29 they can empathize with everyone around
1:32:31 them you just become a reflection of
1:32:33 what they want to
1:32:35 see that's how it's meant to work why do
1:32:38 you think Roman sees redemption in
1:32:42 you why he sees an opportunity to have
1:32:45 human
1:32:46 interaction it's because it's what he
1:32:48 wants and you're meant to flash those
1:32:51 bright eyes and playy to it
1:32:55 what do you want for this
1:32:58 trade that little winse you gave little
1:33:01 drop of suffering I'm paid in
1:33:04 full I'm just here to have fun but you
1:33:08 can have a good time while putting in
1:33:10 the work and my job is to present you
1:33:14 with the choice you can move
1:33:16 on continue as bread of the sidekick or
1:33:20 whatever the hell it is you do for these
1:33:22 guys or
1:33:24 you can be whoever the hell you want to
1:33:26 be whoever you were meant to
1:33:28 be I'm not a sidekick I'm
1:33:32 okay no you're you're not and we're all
1:33:35 really proud of
1:33:38 you we know how indecisive and effective
1:33:42 you
1:33:44 are you don't know anything about me I
1:33:47 know a lot about you I made you remember
1:33:50 we just covered
1:33:52 this you your nature as a canite comes
1:33:55 from me your skills and attitudes come
1:34:00 from oh yep me again and your entire
1:34:06 existence as a chatterling for the
1:34:09 Taha well I mean I'm the one that nabbed
1:34:13 you in the first place me and my
1:34:16 buds so if you really think about
1:34:20 it the blocks that come together and
1:34:23 build bu you I
1:34:27 assembled is that what you want to see
1:34:31 it's really important to you that you
1:34:32 know what I want right it's very
1:34:38 brda I do find myself using people as
1:34:43 mirrors trying to figure myself out in
1:34:49 them and it doesn't work does it
1:34:54 sometimes it feels like it would work if
1:34:56 I knew more about
1:34:59 me Y and despite your
1:35:04 efforts it's not going to work because
1:35:07 there's something
1:35:10 missing and I have
1:35:14 it he kind of gestures with a hand and
1:35:18 though you hadn't noticed it before
1:35:20 there is a door on the other side of the
1:35:22 room come with
1:35:25 me what's past the door I'm not here to
1:35:29 do this for you he opens the door and
1:35:32 walks into the Next Room BR
1:35:34 automatically shakes her head digging
1:35:37 her heels in she's not ready to follow
1:35:41 shrike she wants to badly this an
1:35:46 instinct to Crane her neck to Peak where
1:35:49 he
1:35:50 goes but she directs her gaze towards
1:35:53 where where he was
1:35:55 sitting as you stare at that table you
1:35:58 start to hear the sounds of a
1:36:01 piano dress this
1:36:04 sweet melody of
1:36:08 keys she checks the room wondering if
1:36:12 Romeo was still
1:36:14 there Romeo is still there and he
1:36:16 reaches towards you as if hoping to stop
1:36:19 something but fails to in time and in a
1:36:22 blink you're in the Next
1:36:25 Room having lost
1:36:27 time and
1:36:29 awareness something about the notes on
1:36:33 the
1:36:34 piano played with something ingrained
1:36:37 into the depths of your mind no no I
1:36:40 don't want to hear it she covers her
1:36:42 ears sitting down on the ground and
1:36:45 balling up oh my God now there are no
1:36:48 there's no crying in ascensions you
1:36:51 don't get to make fun of me for crying

1:36:57 head I'm the guy that made your mind I'm

1:37:05 I need to demonstrate again get
1:37:08 out uh he kind of pauses and there are
1:37:13 wisps of Ash that seem to flow freely
1:37:16 from the tips of his fingers and over
1:37:20 the course of a handful of moments he is
1:37:23 just Ash blown away go away go away I
1:37:27 don't I don't want you here no no you

1:39:21 might be floating around about the
1:39:22 scenes that you are
1:39:24 in how dare
1:39:31 you Tim what's helpful to you right now
1:39:33 do you want to keep going oh no I just
1:39:35 need a I needed a
1:39:38 moment cuz Lex is over here like all of
1:39:40 your
1:39:43 buttons that is what these scenes are
1:39:45 this world is sick there's no
1:39:47 God you could be are you going to step
1:39:50 up
1:39:54 come on not wrong what are the pros of
1:39:56 accepting the
1:39:58 deal I think besides Resurrection I
1:40:01 think it comes with more than that but
1:40:02 that's the the first part I feel like
1:40:04 I'm not allowed to contribute to the
1:40:06 discussion so I I want to hear what you
1:40:08 guys strugling I'm struggling really
1:40:10 hard and I know I'm not allowed to say
1:40:11 anything so I'm going to let you guys
1:40:12 you not have Spirit guides you not like
1:40:14 allowed to do anything with these
1:40:15 [ __ ] to be like my spirit gu
1:40:17 trial my trial Rob canot talk on this
1:40:20 yeah my trial was the ability to In and
1:40:22 Out Of C way in on these options so why
1:40:25 why do you need to pass your trial
1:40:26 you're I already did yeah you don't's

1:40:34 they need to get up there do you need to
1:40:35 get up there doesn't all need literally
1:40:37 mirroring what Lex said in my Temptation
1:40:39 scene right now I already made this
1:40:43 decision so I can't I don't know what
1:40:45 it's actually going to cost me nothing
1:40:48 he so told you I don't believe the demon
1:40:51 at this point I mean I think at minimum
1:40:54 what has he ever lied to you what has he
1:40:56 not forgotten to tell me parts of it at
1:40:58 minimum you're accepting
1:41:00 infernalis since one of you needed to
1:41:02 know everything to choice at minimum
1:41:06 you're accepting infernalis because he
1:41:08 said that he said you would have
1:41:11 accepted it from me and you would have
1:41:12 knowledge of who you accepted it from
1:41:14 which is you have you have signed into
1:41:15 to
1:41:20 infernalis see Tim's doing more math cuz
1:41:22 he knows that in instead of just form
1:41:24 easily
1:41:26 willpower he can go into Omega gangster
1:41:30 mode
1:41:31 and be straight up Virgil which has been
1:41:35 a dream for his PC since you don't you
1:41:38 don't hear what I'm saying I'm talking
1:41:40 about negotiation is you're offering me
