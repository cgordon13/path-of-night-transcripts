0:00:28 now let's walk the path of night
0:00:32 [Music]
0:00:38 last time on path of night Johnny found
0:00:41 Neil and Jane in a compromising position
0:00:43 Neil followed Johnny back to the
0:00:45 quartering put found miles and wind with
0:00:47 their dates just before Kabir found them
0:00:49 too Kabir sought conflict with weathers
0:00:51 over wind the cery prepared then the
0:00:54 group heads to the roof there Johnny
0:00:57 rallied the bruha fight dark Selena
0:00:59 revealed her your and exerted power and
0:01:01 influence the discussion went back and
0:01:03 forth eventually involving miles's
0:01:05 reputation when challenged dark s Neil
0:01:09 spoke on humanity and Johnny attempted
0:01:11 to convince the brah to stand their
0:01:13 ground when violence seemed inevitable
0:01:17 Pendragon
0:01:18 [Music]
0:01:28 arrived Roman is dressed in a black
0:01:33 finely tailored
0:01:35 suit as Tai has subtle red threads that
0:01:41 glint in the
0:01:43 light and around his neck draped over
0:01:46 the tie as a silver
0:01:50 gorget his hair is tied back with a few
0:01:54 loose strands that hang along the sides
0:01:57 of his face his expr ression is
0:02:02 menacing and as he joins that Circle
0:02:07 quietly those who wear uniforms and
0:02:11 serve him move to
0:02:15 join him he doesn't seem to have looked
0:02:19 towards any one of you just yet the only
0:02:24 person who has caught his attention is
0:02:27 his
0:02:28 sire and he visibly
0:02:33 seeds when he
0:02:36 arrives many of the bruha present
0:02:39 including chane Amaya and even weathers
0:02:43 who has otherwise been actually rather
0:02:45 stoic letting Johnny and you guys do
0:02:47 what you need to do they give this look
0:02:51 like things may have gone from bad to
0:02:54 worse they do not see him as any sort of
0:02:58 Cavalry or
0:03:00 Ally they remember the Roman Pendragon
0:03:03 who threatened the entirety of New Haven
0:03:06 casually and yet again things grow quiet
0:03:10 and uneasy Johnny steps forward to place
0:03:15 himself in the middle of the circle to
0:03:17 break a little bit of the tension and
0:03:19 reaches out to get his cigarette back
0:03:22 from dark Selena it's almost completely
0:03:25 done but she hands you what remains
0:03:28 Prince pend dragon
0:03:30 we're all
0:03:32 grateful that you'd come to the
0:03:34 Rave to be perfectly honest it wasn't
0:03:37 complete without your presence he kind
0:03:39 of turns his head and looks at you with
0:03:43 these unsettling piercing blue eyes and
0:03:47 gives a slight nod what did I miss oh
0:03:52 well the subot here is been Illuminating
0:03:56 us on all kinds of reasons why their
0:04:00 Victory is inevitable in the
0:04:02 Northeast in fact some of the younger
0:04:04 members of the clan were curious how we
0:04:08 could possibly win a Siege Johnny
0:04:10 motions over to the young bruha that had
0:04:13 despaired and questioned that they take
0:04:17 one look at Pendragon and blanch and go
0:04:21 and sit down like anywhere they can get
0:04:24 like out of his away from his gaze young
0:04:29 lck it's fine ask those questions don't
0:04:32 be afraid we need to know how do we
0:04:35 possibly stand a chance against The
0:04:37 Siege my sire thinks we don't have a
0:04:40 chance he looks over at Delgado he gives
0:04:43 a ND you're right he says looking at pen
0:04:47 Dragon Pendragon looks at him and they
0:04:49 seem to recognize each other but I think
0:04:52 perhaps your Tactical Acumen could back
0:04:55 us up on this while a Siege may not be
0:04:58 winnable
0:05:00 a counteroffensive
0:05:01 might although there'd have to be a
0:05:04 force able to actually contend and take
0:05:08 New York wouldn't there it would need to
0:05:10 be worth my time I distinctly recall
0:05:15 offering New Haven protection before
0:05:18 with all due respect you Grace it seems
0:05:21 that New Haven is going to be in the
0:05:23 crosshairs of quite a few members of the
0:05:25 sabat as it is and he glances back at
0:05:28 dark
0:05:30 and the Kut they've sent some very
0:05:34 powerful members of their sect to
0:05:38 contend with us
0:05:39 here perhaps New Haven could offer you a
0:05:43 chance for
0:05:44 Glory
0:05:47 Glory it's
0:05:49 interesting and I
0:05:51 appreciate your
0:05:55 suggestion but I
0:05:58 wonder when when I first came
0:06:01 here I was called a monster a
0:06:06 barbarian you was indicated that I was
0:06:09 in many ways no different from the
0:06:12 sabat wasn't
0:06:14 I I actually recall you
0:06:18 yourself shaming me for my
0:06:21 methods and
0:06:23 now now that they are here it would seem
0:06:27 that you suddenly see the difference
0:06:30 that was there all along between myself
0:06:32 and the Sabah so I must
0:06:35 ask what is
0:06:38 changed well when you're a bully boy
0:06:41 you're afford afforded the luxury of
0:06:43 making all kinds of stupid suggestions
0:06:46 once you're given the title of primagen
0:06:48 and seneshaw then you have to start
0:06:50 looking at things in a much different
0:06:52 light then tell me your
0:06:55 grace what do you
0:06:58 see
0:06:59 Prince pen
0:07:01 Dragon you came in like a
0:07:05 thundercloud making many demands to the
0:07:08 City of New
0:07:09 Haven it
0:07:11 was difficult to understand where you
0:07:16 were going with this and to understand
0:07:18 you as more than just the rumor and the
0:07:22 legend at the time I find at this point
0:07:25 that not only do we have more common
0:07:28 ground but a real chance for a victory
0:07:32 against an enemy who promises nothing
0:07:35 but Bloodshed and
0:07:37 fire and has also been made aware to me
0:07:39 more of the man that makes
0:07:43 up the legend some of the B actually
0:07:46 shout at you and call a [ __ ] that he is
0:07:48 a
0:07:49 monster he is just like the [ __ ]
0:07:52 sabat and in your
0:07:56 defense dark Selena shushes them and
0:08:00 says You must forgive my child I made
0:08:04 him the way he is it isn't his fault and
0:08:08 Pendragon gives this look like he has
0:08:10 been instantly wound up by this
0:08:13 statement three to a
0:08:16 10 like you thought he came in at like a
0:08:19 nine that was a two it turns
0:08:22 out r as this exchange happens you
0:08:28 recall a painting a portrait that was
0:08:33 kept in Roman Pendragon's Haven and you
0:08:36 realize that this woman who claims to be
0:08:39 his sire is the woman in that portrait
0:08:42 taking a deep breath deeply nervous BR
0:08:46 stands to face the crowd looks to one of
0:08:49 the faces that said those things and
0:08:53 says those of us who stood At The Gala
0:08:56 in Rhode Island stand here to today
0:08:59 because he was there to help us Prince
0:09:03 pandragon is brave and strong and
0:09:08 capable and can face down this threat
0:09:11 that doesn't make him a part of it some
0:09:14 of the brewha who have seemingly heard
0:09:17 about what happened at the Galla kind of
0:09:18 give each other
0:09:20 looks interesting dark Selen says as
0:09:23 though she's seen you for the first time
0:09:26 and she walks towards you br tried to
0:09:30 keep her cool when dark Selena walks
0:09:33 towards BR and she takes her eyes off
0:09:36 where Johnny is Johnny will pinch out
0:09:38 the last Embers of that cigarette and he
0:09:41 will slip the butt into his pocket
0:09:44 almost reflexively BR ends the
0:09:47 heightening of her vision she doesn't
0:09:49 cut the connection to Johnny though not
0:09:51 in this
0:09:52 moment you think he's valorous BR tilts
0:09:55 her chin up in front of the crowd and
0:09:57 says yes
0:09:59 was he
0:10:02 enough no one here stands
0:10:05 alone and I'm sure he didn't
0:10:08 then was he
0:10:12 enough then how about an
0:10:14 alliance BR looks over to miles to
0:10:20 strengthen all
0:10:22 parties as I stated before Pendragon is
0:10:25 more than his Legends and I believe that
0:10:27 we can work together and in audence I
0:10:31 wonder and in this moment she moves at a
0:10:36 speed that you were unaware as possible
0:10:38 and as she raises a
0:10:41 hand there's this Rippling effect
0:10:44 through the crowd of everyone starting
0:10:48 to shift from tense
0:10:50 conversation to explosive violence as
0:10:55 weather's begins moving at celarity
0:10:57 speeds and Pendragon's Army starts to
0:11:00 move at cerity speeds and everyone
0:11:03 begins to whip up into this flurry of
0:11:07 [Music]
0:11:12 combat but perhaps more
0:11:15 importantly Roman begins to move in
0:11:17 Celerity speeds and take steps to
0:11:21 intercept
0:11:23 her and she seems surprised and
0:11:27 flustered that he chose to do so and
0:11:31 lowers her hand experiment over and
0:11:34 everyone who had begun to move at
0:11:36 incredible speeds stops and you can
0:11:40 almost hear this sigh of
0:11:44 relief to all the non bruha on the
0:11:47 rooftop that must be a [ __ ]
0:11:49 terrifying experience br's eyes are
0:11:52 bigger than you've ever seen them she is
0:11:54 doing all that she can to stand in front
0:11:57 of this but that there is no hiding that
0:12:00 part of her expression for a millisecond
0:12:03 the roof is impossibly fragile like it
0:12:06 might just come apart under the duress
0:12:09 of these angry bruha but then it stops
0:12:13 once Neil's speed of thought starts to
0:12:16 catch up with the speed of the bruha he
0:12:20 and Eden and wi and brida and Johnny and
0:12:24 Miles stop starting to disappear like
0:12:28 breuh violence kicks up Neil is not fast
0:12:31 enough to do this before they're going
0:12:32 to all kill each other but starts to
0:12:34 disappear everyone reflexively what does
0:12:37 that look like what is what is happening
0:12:38 they start to Shimmer out of everyone's
0:12:40 awareness don't don't disappear Johnny
0:12:42 don't let him if he's going to die let
0:12:44 him die with his clan bro this was a
0:12:45 this was a total reflex that he
0:12:48 unclenches once violence doesn't happen
0:12:51 once
0:12:52 the once the moment slows down Roman
0:12:56 approaches Brea and
0:12:59 and with this scooping motion that feels
0:13:03 like being pushed by a bulldozzer he
0:13:06 tucks the toror behind him and out of
0:13:09 the very small woman's reach and though
0:13:12 he looms over dark Selena it weirdly
0:13:16 feels like he's standing in front of
0:13:18 this towering presence br's still not
0:13:22 fully ready to make substantial eye
0:13:25 contact but she is absolutely she is
0:13:28 making herself no obstacle she is in
0:13:31 every way cooperating cooperating yes
0:13:34 thank you yep I don't know that I have
0:13:36 the patience for any more of this so I
0:13:39 will stay for two things s
0:13:43 AA I will warn every brua here that
0:13:47 should they consider working with the
0:13:51 Sabbat I will kill them for the
0:13:54 thought and whatever ugly mess remains
0:13:57 will serve as a reminder
0:13:59 to What Becomes of those who join the
0:14:03 Sabbat the other thing I will
0:14:05 do is spare a handful of
0:14:09 minutes for you to make whatever
0:14:11 proposal you intend
0:14:13 to the brah presents
0:14:16 seem less inclined to consider siding
0:14:20 with the
0:14:22 Sabbat yeah that'll [ __ ] do it
0:14:25 marginally
0:14:27 Johnny hearing the opening that pen
0:14:29 Dragon gives him squares off with pen
0:14:34 Dragon Your Grace this conversation is
0:14:38 happening at a brewha rave for a
0:14:42 reason our
0:14:44 clan is the Lynch pin in this entire re
0:14:48 region clam bruha will decide what
0:14:51 happens
0:14:52 here I did not
0:14:55 Sherk from telling your sire exact ly
0:14:59 what's going to go down here that we're
0:15:01 going to stand and we're going to oppose
0:15:03 the
0:15:04 spot so I'm not going to Sherk from
0:15:07 doing the same to you New Haven is going
0:15:10 to stand in the way of the Sabbat and it
0:15:12 is going to stop them we're not simply
0:15:14 going to just sit on our heels in a
0:15:17 Siege and let them pick us off one by
0:15:19 one we're going to go on the counter
0:15:21 offensive and the only way that works is
0:15:25 if you bring your army to Bear Your
0:15:28 Grace we need you to assault New
0:15:32 York the prince of New Haven sire Yan
0:15:36 petersun is prepared to work with you
0:15:39 and give you the Intel Intel you need to
0:15:43 succeed and the Sabbat is not nearly as
0:15:46 dangerous as they say they
0:15:48 are Neil has already seen the fact that
0:15:51 they have been abandoned by the
0:15:54 asites their sect is weaker than ever I
0:15:57 need to make a
0:15:59 [Laughter]
0:16:04 roll one
0:16:06 member of this Blackhand group who is
0:16:09 present their bones crack and shape
0:16:13 starts to
0:16:15 twist as their
0:16:18 frustration with what you just said
0:16:21 causes them to begin assuming the horrid
0:16:23 form your
0:16:26 sire resists the urge to frenzy and
0:16:30 attack you just long enough to grab his
0:16:34 brother by the horn and restrain him to
0:16:38 his side
0:16:40 careful he warns the group present
0:16:44 that's not all that he has seen Neil
0:16:48 tell Prince Pendragon what you have
0:16:50 seen in the future why some of the
0:16:52 really high turn look towards Neil Neil
0:16:56 looks deeply put off by having the
0:16:58 attention put right on him but looks at
0:17:00 Johnny and nods and then looks over at
0:17:03 Pendragon and goes I I I did I saw um
0:17:07 if when you go to New York City you and
0:17:12 others but you will cross
0:17:14 blades with Cardinal ponia and with
0:17:19 lambach you will fight them directly in
0:17:22 the streets I've seen it you'll have
0:17:24 your chance at their
0:17:25 heads when Neil moves in to speak when
0:17:28 kind of slips in where he was and keeps
0:17:30 a hand on Eden's shoulder all of our
0:17:33 sers have had different plans for
0:17:36 us let's prove them
0:17:39 wrong our clan was once warrior poets
0:17:43 and
0:17:45 Kings we need leadership to show the
0:17:49 rest of the clan that that's exactly
0:17:51 what we can be
0:17:53 again not
0:17:55 monsters
0:17:57 bruha and what is it exactly that is
0:18:01 being offered to me and mine in exchange
0:18:05 for support to Yan
0:18:09 Peterson what is the favorite Child of
0:18:11 the camaria
0:18:13 offering seeing that Pendragon has kind
0:18:16 of shifted Focus towards
0:18:18 miles Johnny kind of swells up a little
0:18:21 bit and steps in the
0:18:24 way I understand that you want answers
0:18:27 from the ventu and miles but this is
0:18:29 still a brewha
0:18:31 rave and I am asking you to do the right
0:18:35 thing for our clan and New England and I
0:18:38 am willing to swear a life Boon to you
0:18:41 and Johnny takes a
0:18:42 knee I Johnny Saxon am asking you to do
0:18:48 this your life isn't worth New
0:18:53 York here is what I
0:18:56 want and I will not accept
0:18:58 anything
0:19:01 less the
0:19:04 ventre stands to
0:19:06 benefit should the camaria achieve
0:19:10 victory over the
0:19:13 Sabbat The
0:19:15 Ventrue who have torn down all that this
0:19:18 Clan has built through the
0:19:20 centuries needs
0:19:23 us for without
0:19:25 us their Tower Falls
0:19:30 so you will indulge my
0:19:33 clan Beyond
0:19:36 Peter hardest
0:19:39 stand those who rule over the camaria
0:19:42 from the
0:19:43 Shadows they will do
0:19:47 this to defeat the
0:19:50 sabat you must
0:19:52 introduce a fear that is new to
0:19:56 them that they have not seen before and
0:20:00 you must be willing to become
0:20:02 that call me monster if you want I don't
0:20:05 care you have now reached the point
0:20:09 where you might actually understand the
0:20:12 Jihad is only one by
0:20:16 monsters every instance of
0:20:19 diablerie that the invading Camala Force
0:20:22 performs against Sabbat shall be
0:20:26 sanctioned we do not come to wage war
0:20:29 against the Sabbat we come to hunt
0:20:35 them if yam prun prefers
0:20:39 his methods he is welcome to
0:20:44 them but that is what I
0:20:47 demand and he looks around at the brewha
0:20:53 present and you may all want to
0:20:57 consider that the opportunity to climb
0:21:00 the ladder amongst Kindred kind does not
0:21:02 come
0:21:04 often don't be
0:21:07 cannona claim your own
0:21:10 prizes the sabat
0:21:13 seem very
0:21:15 unpleased by this and he walks towards
0:21:19 you miles I move to meet him I will be
0:21:24 informing the Kindred across the world
0:21:27 across the entire entirety of the
0:21:29 Camara that those who they hunt and kill
0:21:32 in New York is a sanctioned
0:21:35 kill they may claim The Souls of the
0:21:38 sabanus
0:21:39 trophy I think when needs to make a
0:21:41 frenzy test he's talking about taking
0:21:44 people's Souls Roman has introduced a
0:21:46 level of evil that the Sabbat had not
0:21:48 considered
0:21:50 yep I will spend that willpower
0:21:54 though one success willpower well spent
0:21:57 yep
0:22:00 wi makes a feral sound and her muscles
0:22:04 stiffen like like her hackles would rise
0:22:08 had she
0:22:09 fur but she pulls back and she opens the
0:22:13 door to the roof and removes herself
0:22:16 dark Selena looks
0:22:19 displeased but also kind of
0:22:21 [Music]
0:22:22 impressed uh New York only yes the siege
0:22:26 of New York that that is the price and
0:22:29 the only
0:22:30 price then at this time I will state my
0:22:34 agreeance he Narrows his eyes looking at
0:22:37 you I suspected you wouldn't
0:22:40 mind and he turns and heads back to the
0:22:44 door having decided he's done with the
0:22:47 conversation for now and he goes back
0:22:54 inside Johnny stands up runs a hand
0:22:58 through his hair grabs another morly and
0:23:00 sticks it in his lip lights
0:23:04 up takes a long drag on his on his
0:23:08 cigarette and then kind of glances over
0:23:10 at his
0:23:11 sire his eyes are
0:23:14 definitely
0:23:17 defeated and ridden with
0:23:21 guilt but he has a stoic expression on
0:23:23 his
0:23:24 face what does he see in his sire
0:23:28 in his
0:23:29 sire it is like a
0:23:33 calm that washes over
0:23:36 him like
0:23:38 an understanding of the
0:23:40 stakes in the time to
0:23:43 hesitate the time to
0:23:47 negotiate the time to see opposition as
0:23:51 people has come and
0:23:54 gone and a clearcut black and white
0:23:57 [Music]
0:23:59 War seems to be almost a comfort to him
0:24:03 it's like he has
0:24:04 acknowledged that for all of the love
0:24:08 for Humanity and morality that the
0:24:12 Camara claims to have it's like he knows
0:24:16 he knows that people will come from all
0:24:19 over for the chance to engage in the
0:24:23 most depraved sin known to Kindred kind
0:24:27 without consequence maybe not
0:24:30 you Johnny walks over to
0:24:33 him he takes a long dragon as
0:24:36 morle I made the wrong bet didn't
0:24:40 I you have dark Selena we have pend
0:24:43 Dragon but they're one and the same
0:24:45 aren't
0:24:47 they why do you think the struggle is
0:24:50 eternal he kind of gives those who are
0:24:54 with him a look like it's time to head
0:24:56 out
0:24:58 I'll see you on the field you know I've
0:25:01 hated you so badly for so
0:25:04 long because of everything you stole
0:25:07 from me as I decided to stop at some
0:25:10 [ __ ] little pit stop along my
0:25:16 route are you just my inevitable
0:25:20 Future No weathers says interjecting and
0:25:26 approaching no matter how bad it gets
0:25:29 Johnny there's always a
0:25:32 choice
0:25:33 dogado and
0:25:35 weathers give each other a look as
0:25:39 though maybe he's referencing something
0:25:42 from the
0:25:44 past Johnny looks at weathers with just
0:25:48 this utter expression of just like hope
0:25:54 and Blood starts to well up in his eyes
0:25:56 a little bit
0:25:58 Delgado says to
0:26:00 you I wish you didn't
0:26:04 run there's a lot less pain on my side
0:26:06 of the
0:26:08 fence and he walks away and
0:26:13 weathers kind of he's got like these
0:26:16 huge arms and he pulls you into this hug
0:26:22 and he says to
0:26:24 you pain is kind of what makes us feel
0:26:27 alive
0:26:28 kid Johnny grips weather's back it's the
0:26:33 difference between us and them they run
0:26:35 from the pain and it just leaves them
0:26:39 numb yeah well why do I feel like it
0:26:41 just set off a nuclear
0:26:43 bomb consider if you
0:26:46 will that bomb's been primed a long
0:26:49 time there's not a lot of people trying
0:26:52 to stop
0:26:54 it that's not something to be ashamed of
0:26:58 Johnny just kind of hugs weathers for a
0:27:00 while and uses him to Shield the fact
0:27:03 that he just is at this point very
0:27:06 desperately trying to hold in between
0:27:08 sobs a lot of the Rave that's going on
0:27:12 on the roof starts to dissolve into more
0:27:15 casual mingling you start to hear like
0:27:19 jokes being fired off to kind of lighten
0:27:21 the mood a little bit everyone kind of
0:27:25 feels like something
0:27:28 bad happened but they're not sure and
0:27:32 certainly can't seem to agree on what
0:27:35 that thing is you even notice that more
0:27:40 than a handful of bruha don't openly
0:27:43 State why but seem to have warmed up to
0:27:46 pen
0:27:47 Dragon baa has sted exactly where
0:27:50 Pendragon put her exactly she hasn't
0:27:53 even really changed her foot position it
0:27:56 takes her that sort of
0:27:59 break people trying desperately to
0:28:02 return to some sort of Rave atmosphere
0:28:05 with that she kind
0:28:07 of wakes up I
0:28:10 guess unlocks from the necessary bravery
0:28:14 and looks around for her
0:28:16 people she disconnects mentally from
0:28:19 Johnny walks over to Miles looking
0:28:23 around for a win looking around for Neil
0:28:25 only spotting one Neil is also standing
0:28:29 where he is but having sort of delivered
0:28:32 the the statements that Johnny prompted
0:28:36 uh and seeing everyone start to disperse
0:28:38 is doing that thing where you're alone
0:28:41 in the middle of a crowd and no one's
0:28:42 really paying attention to you and
0:28:45 rather than feeling lonely seems to be
0:28:46 feeling some sort of like respit from
0:28:49 the mood of the roof just washing over
0:28:52 and through him so has turned did wi
0:28:56 take Eden with her or is Eden still up
0:28:57 here here she probably shoved Eden back
0:28:59 at Neil okay um on her way out she's not
0:29:02 going to just leave the kid unprotected
0:29:04 but also she's not going to risk hearing
0:29:06 the answer to that question and not
0:29:08 being able to stop the frenzy this time
0:29:10 so has like kept half an eye has turned
0:29:12 his body so that Eden is still in his
0:29:15 periphery nearby is she just standing
0:29:17 there kind of looking low key Lex when
0:29:20 you kind of look at her she is staying
0:29:23 very very still and you get the
0:29:25 impression that she's just kind of
0:29:27 sitting sitting there nervously and 
0:29:29 Obfuscate perhaps having bit off more than
0:29:33 she can chew by choosing to come here
0:29:36 and when she knows that you were looking
0:29:39 at her she Whispers to you what what's
0:29:42 Deery since she's off to the side Neil
0:29:45 sort of steps a little closer but isn't
0:29:47 looking directly at her doesn't want to
0:29:48 blow up her spot so instead just kind of
0:29:50 stands at the roof Edge nods at BR when
0:29:53 he he notices her looking around just in
0:29:55 a like yeah I'm here I'm here way and
0:29:58 then looks up just staring straight at
0:30:00 the star so like Eden's still in his
0:30:02 periphery and nearby so you can hear him
0:30:04 and just
0:30:05 goes it's
0:30:07 um it's one of Kindred devours another
0:30:11 kindred's
0:30:13 Soul it
0:30:15 is the most horrific act that any
0:30:19 Kindred
0:30:21 could could
0:30:23 commit it doesn't just go against the
0:30:25 laws of the Camara
0:30:27 it goes back to the very very oldest
0:30:33 laws ever laid
0:30:35 out for Kindred predating the camaria by
0:30:40 God who knows how
0:30:42 long it
0:30:44 is it is an act of Pure Evil
0:30:50 and ATT tempting one as all paths are
0:30:55 because it is a path to power at least
0:30:57 that's how some see
0:30:59 it I think a lot of people are tempted
0:31:02 that
0:31:03 way and I know and he looks like away
0:31:06 from the Star and towards the door where
0:31:08 wind left and I know a lot of people are
0:31:11 worried I myself have been worried about
0:31:12 other people doing it but I don't
0:31:16 know I think at the end of the day maybe
0:31:19 all we have are the choices we make and
0:31:22 a lot of people are going to do a lot of
0:31:24 a lot of harm after today
0:31:30 but he looks back up the star maybe
0:31:34 we're not going to be some of
0:31:35 them now maybe that's
0:31:38 enough for now she gives you a look like
0:31:42 she super regrets asking the
0:31:45 question but gives a nod clear that she
0:31:49 was listening
0:31:50 and understands the gravity of the
0:31:52 situation now also um I know we don't
0:31:56 know each other very well but as a side
0:31:59 note this kind of [ __ ] when like w and
0:32:02 BR say hey don't leave the
0:32:04 house this is what they're [ __ ]
0:32:06 talking about so maybe maybe put that in
0:32:08 your pocket for next time I got it I got
0:32:11 it but she actually looks a little
0:32:13 confused when you say you don't know her
0:32:16 very much and she's like oh okay and she
0:32:19 steps away maybe it's best we move back
0:32:23 in and continue to mingle can we please
0:32:26 I don't want to be up here anymore let
0:32:28 things sit for a bit do we have to
0:32:31 restart the party atmosphere is that I
0:32:34 don't think it's going to take possible
0:32:36 really not everyone was here up here
0:32:39 there were still people partying down
0:32:40 there no people will want to I if we go
0:32:45 down there and we put this behind us and
0:32:48 we act like dancing is the only thing
0:32:50 that we're here to do people are going
0:32:52 to want to do that all I want to do is
0:32:54 stay on this roof and not going to the
0:32:58 party but you think it'll make
0:33:00 everything better and he looks at bro
0:33:01 like not sarcastically but truly like is
0:33:05 that is going and doing a party going to
0:33:07 make me feel better I don't know what's
0:33:09 going to make you feel better I I mean
0:33:13 for you probably not but we'll go down
0:33:15 no I'll come with you I don't think
0:33:17 anybody should be alone right now
0:33:18 somebody's got to catch up with wind too
0:33:20 dark Selena approaches Johnny Johnny
0:33:23 looks up at her you did very well
0:33:25 tonight and I
0:33:27 find your efforts
0:33:31 inspiring so I'm going to give you
0:33:35 something when The Siege
0:33:38 comes I'll be taking you
0:33:42 away and I'm going to make you into
0:33:44 something
0:33:45 great she kisses you on the
0:33:49 cheek walks off to some corner of the
0:33:52 roof and simply steps off its Edge
0:33:57 unbidden Johnny kind of realizes that
0:34:00 he's already been touching his cheek
0:34:02 kind of just dumbfounded at the
0:34:03 interaction he just
0:34:05 had and kind of slumps down on the uh
0:34:08 edge of the roof where he had been
0:34:11 wallowing from where you were sitting
0:34:13 when you slumped down you see that she
0:34:16 had just very casually stepped off the
0:34:19 roof plummeted down a few stories landed
0:34:22 on her feet and walked away Johnny
0:34:25 continues smoking his morally doesn't
0:34:27 make any effort to leave where he's
0:34:32 at after the complicated and exhausting
0:34:38 events that took place on the rooftop
0:34:41 Johnny as you return to the
0:34:44 partying it is in fact a party people
0:34:49 are having a good time they're a bit
0:34:52 more subdued than things were before the
0:34:54 rooftop but overall despite
0:34:57 circumstances there seems a concerted
0:34:59 effort to be as positive as possible you
0:35:04 welcomed with nods and Tiny comes over
0:35:07 and he gives you like this big hug and
0:35:10 he's like that wasn't easy brother that
0:35:12 was not easy at all thanks
0:35:15 tiny yeah and we're still all intact and
0:35:18 no one got thrown off a roof though
0:35:20 right so far so
0:35:22 good uh you need anything is there
0:35:25 anything I can do to
0:35:28 yeah I need another cigarette right this
0:35:30 way boss man it kind of clears a path
0:35:34 for you in a way that only someone with
0:35:37 the stature of tiny can and as you make
0:35:40 it outside there's a small circle
0:35:42 there's always a small circle that's
0:35:44 there right on the curb traffic is shut
0:35:47 down in this area the quote unquote
0:35:51 block party seems to be in full effect
0:35:55 as you get outside in this circle there
0:35:59 is a woman who drudging by her posture
0:36:04 was waiting for you and as you approach
0:36:08 she approaches you and offers you a
0:36:13 morly your favorite
0:36:15 brand now something unique about this
0:36:18 woman is that she's very light skin
0:36:22 Auburn in hair there's you can smell the
0:36:26 perfume that's on her and despite her
0:36:29 actually very attractive features she
0:36:32 covers the bottom half of her face with
0:36:35 a
0:36:36 mask this cloth that she
0:36:40 wears I'm guessing you found this morly
0:36:42 just for me I take it you don't really
0:36:45 smoke he kind of Mo motions at the fact
0:36:47 that she's wearing a mask she shakes her
0:36:50 head no not particularly well what can I
0:36:54 do for you I can at least I can do to
0:36:57 something to repay for that Morley he
0:36:59 pops it in his mouth and lights up a
0:37:01 moment of your attention will do I
0:37:03 listened to the conversation you had
0:37:05 upstairs on the roof Johnny kind of
0:37:08 shakes his head I listened to the
0:37:10 direction it
0:37:12 took and my angle here my hope is to arm
0:37:19 you my name is Katarina does that name
0:37:23 spark anything for Johnny what's your
0:37:26 give me an academics role if you dare
0:37:28 intelligence plus
0:37:31 academics that's a wash uh it doesn't
0:37:34 seem to ring any bells however she goes
0:37:37 on to state that she is one of the
0:37:42 rapple just like you
0:37:44 and she has some
0:37:47 experience dealing with some of the
0:37:50 elders that you are contending with
0:37:53 I I have some information regarding
0:37:56 during the return of dark
0:37:58 Selena really yes you see there is an
0:38:02 occasion that has drawn her to come out
0:38:04 of her hiding while this conflict
0:38:07 represents an opportunity it is an
0:38:10 opportunity for her to take the power
0:38:12 that she
0:38:13 seeks ever since whatever it is that is
0:38:17 happening East among the children of
0:38:22 hakeim there has become
0:38:25 a
0:38:27 an opening among the sabats black hand
0:38:31 so all those vacancies that the asites
0:38:34 Left
0:38:35 Behind is opening up a way for her yes
0:38:39 she seeks alliance with jalana jaav who
0:38:43 he is the leader of the black hand
0:38:48 normally it is four who ride
0:38:51 forth but some of their number is gone
0:38:54 now dark Selena sees the opportunity
0:38:58 to establish herself as a leader of the
0:39:01 black
0:39:02 hand and this
0:39:05 Crusade is the event she is using to
0:39:09 catapult herself into the
0:39:12 position but Cardinal ponia has risen to
0:39:16 power in this area and has done so with
0:39:19 her support but what she seeks in
0:39:22 exchange is a position within the Black
0:39:25 Hand a position they call
0:39:28 saraf Johnny kind of just rubs his
0:39:32 Temple a little bit and kind of sigh as
0:39:35 he
0:39:36 exhales I bring this to your
0:39:39 attention because I believe that there
0:39:41 are few who truly understand the stakes
0:39:44 like you
0:39:45 do I think I'm sorry she pauses and you
0:39:49 were going to say by Stakes you mean the
0:39:52 thing that's coming out of New York
0:39:58 in a
0:40:00 way two apocalyptic events will contend
0:40:03 with one
0:40:04 another one is a devil you have wared
0:40:08 with for some time you and your
0:40:11 friends but if dark Selena were to
0:40:14 attain what she wants if she was to have
0:40:17 her
0:40:18 way she would rule over the Mortal
0:40:21 masses as a god taking blood tithe when
0:40:26 whenever she saw fit you
0:40:29 see dark Selena is truly
0:40:32 ancient she is powerful in a way
0:40:36 that North American
0:40:38 Kindred do not well
0:40:41 understand
0:40:43 Karina how do you know all of
0:40:46 this I have a network a means of
0:40:49 attaining information normally it's used
0:40:52 to acquire important ult
0:40:55 texts you say you're part of the
0:40:58 Rabel
0:41:00 well why haven't I ever heard of you
0:41:03 before why should I trust you for that
0:41:06 matter well I put it to you this way I
0:41:10 think you understand the stakes I think
0:41:12 you understand that what I'm about to
0:41:15 tell you you can't
0:41:19 ignore the person that this information
0:41:22 comes from is
0:41:23 irrelevant what matters is what you
0:41:26 choose to do once you
0:41:31 know our ancient
0:41:33 story is tied
0:41:36 intrinsically with the experiment that
0:41:38 was
0:41:40 Carthage are you familiar with it it's
0:41:43 the ancient city that Rome went to war
0:41:47 with Carthage
0:41:51 was
0:41:53 birthed through a vision of a future
0:41:57 that at the time only troyal could
0:42:01 see
0:42:04 who the oldest of our blood Johnny kind
0:42:07 of Shivers at that Revelation troyo
0:42:12 believed in a world where the Kindred
0:42:16 and Mortals coexisted in the open and
0:42:20 believed that Kindred were deserving of
0:42:24 worship he believed in a violent
0:42:31 existence
0:42:34 selfish and
0:42:36 ultimately
0:42:39 Limitless the amount of energy that the
0:42:41 Kindred dedicate to concealing their
0:42:44 existence is
0:42:46 significant the things they could do the
0:42:48 wars that they could wage were they not
0:42:51 compelled to secrecy by the world we
0:42:53 live in would be
0:42:57 an unmitigated
0:43:02 disaster there are
0:43:04 Tales over the darkness that this Vision
0:43:08 brought Carthage became a place a den of
0:43:14 monsters and most
0:43:17 bruha remember coring is a place of
0:43:20 peace and Enlightenment and
0:43:22 ideal and in some ways they are right
0:43:25 but they don't see Carthage the way that
0:43:27 dark Selena does dark Selena envisions
0:43:32 herself as the inheritor of this dream
0:43:36 she envisions a world or Kindred rule as
0:43:42 Gods Crush all opposition and slake
0:43:47 their thirst on
0:43:49 lives should she attain the degree of
0:43:53 influence that she
0:43:55 seeks she will turn every city that she
0:43:58 can bring into her sway into this
0:44:00 reality and I don't think that the black
0:44:02 hand or the sabat really understands the
0:44:05 sort of Terror that they will awaken in
0:44:08 this process she's playing games on the
0:44:11 level of the eldest then think of this
0:44:14 she wants she wants to form her own
0:44:17 sect I think she wants I think she
0:44:21 built the
0:44:23 sabat to dream of a tyrannic age where
0:44:27 they would rule over man she has
0:44:31 convinced so many canites to see as she
0:44:37 sees and if she has her way she will
0:44:40 give it to them and only then will they
0:44:43 understand that this was not something
0:44:45 they should have ever asked
0:44:48 for dark Selina has to be
0:44:52 stopped and the only means that I am
0:44:55 aware of of preventing dark Selena from
0:44:57 getting what she wants is curbing this
0:45:02 Crusade well thank you for
0:45:05 that bit of wisdom but I don't know how
0:45:09 the hell I'm going to oppose
0:45:11 her I don't know if you're aware of this
0:45:13 but apparently our blood my blood is
0:45:15 tied to
0:45:17 hers I'm not sure if you're aware of
0:45:19 what she can do with that I don't think
0:45:22 that anyone can really predict the
0:45:24 extent of her power but I do know
0:45:28 this there is one person in the saat
0:45:32 that I know sees this matter as I do
0:45:35 perhaps as you
0:45:36 two Johnny laughs a little bit who your
0:45:43 sire she rests a hand on your
0:45:47 shoulder good
0:45:50 luck thank you and she disappears into
0:45:55 the club
0:45:56 Johnny just kind of watches her go the
0:45:58 dumbfounded expression on his
0:46:01 face and returns to smoking his morally
0:46:05 and trying to look
0:46:07 contemplative figuring it' be a better
0:46:09 look than the growing Terror that's in
0:46:12 his
0:46:17 gut time Johnny you end up the last
0:46:22 person in the
0:46:23 circle everyone else has gone in inside
0:46:26 for a bit more partying looking around
0:46:29 the uh parking lot Johnny kind of just
0:46:31 takes in all of the vehicles checks on
0:46:34 his rat bike makes sure and that's still
0:46:36 still in good
0:46:37 shape and then he notices over by the uh
0:46:41 SUVs that the SUV that weathers came in
0:46:45 he sees that uh unmistakable white braid
0:46:49 that belongs to Wi and starts making his
0:46:52 way over to the
0:46:53 SUV wi is leaning up against
0:46:56 the Escalade having somewhat wrangled
0:46:59 her Beast into compliance she has a
0:47:02 joint in her hand it's lit the
0:47:05 unmistakable Aroma is in the air her
0:47:09 gaze seems fixed on a point somewhere
0:47:11 deep within the asphalt how you holding
0:47:14 up there
0:47:16 when still
0:47:18 here John he comes walking over his
0:47:21 boots thudding on the uh pavement and he
0:47:25 kind of stands next to but he doesn't
0:47:26 look at her he's kind of just appraising
0:47:28 the Escalade next to her admiring the uh
0:47:31 the vehicle and the care that weather's
0:47:34 has put into maintaining it got heated
0:47:37 seats too yeah it's a nice looking
0:47:40 vehicle when doesn't seem to make any
0:47:43 attempt to further
0:47:45 conversation she is aware of Johnny but
0:47:48 she is thinking far beyond where she is
0:47:51 at the
0:47:52 moment I feel like we just ushered in
0:47:55 the end of the world
0:47:56 world it would be easier if it was just
0:47:59 the end of the world he glances over at
0:48:02 that not really understanding what could
0:48:04 be worse than the end of the world but
0:48:08 he kind of gives her a slow nod
0:48:10 understanding that wind sees deeper than
0:48:13 the the world of the physical world and
0:48:15 that sometimes these things are lost on
0:48:17 Johnny people die in their sleep all the
0:48:20 time it's quiet usually they don't
0:48:23 suffer if that were the end of the world
0:48:25 we had ushered in maybe it wouldn't be
0:48:28 so
0:48:29 bad that's not the world we ushered in
0:48:32 Johnny I
0:48:34 know the hell that's going to descend on
0:48:37 New York is going to have
0:48:39 such
0:48:41 reverberations cute that you think it'll
0:48:43 stop in New York it
0:48:45 won't that's just going to be the center
0:48:47 of it it's going to be like
0:48:50 earthquakes earthquakes that are gon to
0:48:52 cause tsunamis the whole world is it's
0:48:56 not going to be same M after this I
0:48:58 [ __ ] thought I
0:49:01 could I thought I could Bank on the
0:49:03 nobility of Roman Pendragon I'm a
0:49:06 [ __ ] idiot for thinking that I
0:49:08 thought I could Bank on my own I think
0:49:11 Roman's Cut From the Same Cloth as his
0:49:14 sire darkk
0:49:16 Selena I don't know whether this is true
0:49:19 or not but I just had a
0:49:22 conversation apparently she wants more
0:49:25 than just the sabat Color Me shocked I
0:49:28 think Pendragon wants more than than
0:49:30 the camaria mhm further up the food
0:49:34 chain you go it's not enough It's never
0:49:38 enough to just
0:49:39 maintain and that's a universal truth
0:49:42 whoever you are wherever you
0:49:45 are nature appor a vacuum and so you
0:49:48 never reach for worse than you have is
0:49:52 it with the
0:49:54 Gangrel I think I think this is somewhat
0:49:57 true with the brewha too but it seems
0:50:00 like most members of the clan are like
0:50:02 the salt of the earth type but with the
0:50:04 bruha the further you get up our
0:50:07 elders the Jihad makes them the worst
0:50:10 [ __ ] vampires you could possibly
0:50:12 imagine they get corrupted and changed
0:50:15 into these I don't
0:50:17 know what's it like with the
0:50:20 Gangrel [ __ ] if I know I feel like your
0:50:23 elders just disappear yep
0:50:27 because they've learned the lesson that
0:50:29 other people will weigh you down that
0:50:32 attachments are
0:50:35 anchors and at a certain point you have
0:50:38 to choose between survival and not dying
0:50:42 and most of them have chosen not to
0:50:44 die but to me survival
0:50:47 is
0:50:49 the you have to be able to be you
0:50:52 regardless of how long you live and if
0:50:55 you
0:50:56 I don't want to find a point where I'm
0:51:00 not me anymore for the sake of just not
0:51:05 dying
0:51:08 yeah that's something I've thought about
0:51:10 a lot
0:51:11 too don't do anything stupid while your
0:51:14 kids are still around
0:51:16 Johnny get as much time with them as you
0:51:19 can Johnny Smiles it's a little bit
0:51:22 half-hearted but he he makes a
0:51:25 legitimate attempt at smiling at her he
0:51:28 nods that's why I haven't done anything
0:51:30 stupid yet that in the fortitude I
0:51:34 taught you staring into the sun would be
0:51:36 extremely painful way to
0:51:38 go he gives her a a hard stare yes it
0:51:43 would
0:51:44 when she's still staring at the
0:51:47 asphalt you still got
0:51:53 attachments probably still got you
0:51:57 guys so you're not going to seek
0:51:59 Solitude yet
0:52:03 yeah I don't want to just survive
0:52:10 Johnny I what kind of an afterlife
0:52:12 exists for people who Damn the
0:52:16 world who are complicit in the suffering
0:52:19 that we are going to
0:52:22 cause I think you probably have more
0:52:24 insight into the afterlife than I
0:52:27 do I've kept my eyes peeled for people
0:52:32 on the other
0:52:33 side haven't seen
0:52:35 them so either there's another
0:52:38 place or there's just
0:52:42 Oblivion and I don't want to hurt my
0:52:44 chances you know we're not just
0:52:46 surviving by the way we're not dying
0:52:50 that's
0:52:51 fair but I'd say this whole year or so
0:52:55 so
0:52:56 far we've been fighting against forces
0:52:58 that would otherwise have this
0:53:01 place already in
0:53:04 service to the likes of people like
0:53:06 Roman Pendragon and dark
0:53:09 Selena how does that weigh against the
0:53:12 fact that one of my best friends
0:53:14 committed a sin beyond my scope of
0:53:17 reasoning and not only have I not
0:53:20 punished him for that I have stood by
0:53:22 him while he condoned that crime to
0:53:25 spread to an entire city unleashing a
0:53:29 wave of suffering on humanity and the
0:53:32 natural world unlike anything this world
0:53:36 has seen in recent
0:53:40 nights I don't know
0:53:43 when I certainly don't have any answers
0:53:47 about why this curse
0:53:50 exists why we're allowed to feed on one
0:53:53 another and consume The Souls of one
0:53:59 another it puzzles me that you call it a
0:54:04 sin I think there's a lot of other
0:54:06 things we do that could also be be
0:54:08 categorized as sins they
0:54:10 could I'm not absolving anything we do
0:54:13 you shouldn't but that's where my line
0:54:16 is between what can be forgiven and what
0:54:19 can't be you don't think diablerie can
0:54:22 be
0:54:23 forgiven I wouldn't
0:54:28 I
0:54:29 think I think there needs to be the
0:54:31 chance for forgiveness I think that
0:54:33 chance is not taking that route so I
0:54:36 think the depravity goes a whole lot
0:54:38 deeper than just
0:54:39 diablerie it does you're not
0:54:42 wrong I think the nature of forgiveness
0:54:45 means that you can come back from
0:54:47 wherever and I know for a fact that
0:54:49 miles is not gone to us where has his
0:54:54 apology been
0:54:55 regret for what he did that's the first
0:54:58 step in
0:54:59 forgiveness we're still in the middle of
0:55:01 this [ __ ] I don't think he's had
0:55:03 time to even reflect on what he's done
0:55:06 he
0:55:08 has we've
0:55:11 talked and I want to make it
0:55:14 clear I would follow miles to the ends
0:55:17 of the Earth until my last
0:55:20 hours but maybe those hours need to come
0:55:24 sooner
0:55:26 if I want to survive and just not
0:55:34 die what would you do for your family
0:55:37 Johnny if you had a chance at going and
0:55:40 being with
0:55:42 them I'd pretty much do anything I could
0:55:44 in my
0:55:46 power whatever it took to be with them
0:55:49 right
0:55:52 yeah here we are now you see the
0:55:55 position I'm in I don't think you
0:55:58 understand what you just asked me
0:56:00 though if I had the chance to be with my
0:56:03 family
0:56:04 again I would condone a whole lot of
0:56:08 sin to be with them your family is still
0:56:12 alive Johnny they are mine's
0:56:17 not life and death and the entropy
0:56:21 therein puzzles
0:56:23 me but in general it's a cyclical thing
0:56:28 in my book I don't believe in any
0:56:32 dogmatic
0:56:34 teachings okay but there is a cycle of
0:56:37 rebirth and stasis and destruction that
0:56:42 we witness over and over and that's why
0:56:47 the utter destruction of a soul is the
0:56:50 crime that it is for me
0:56:53 maybe it is for me it's not a maybe for
0:56:56 me for you it still a maybe I'm not
0:57:00 looking for absolutes or truths or to
0:57:02 impose my belief on anyone I am telling
0:57:05 you so you have the context for what I
0:57:07 am
0:57:08 thinking well the reason I'm just saying
0:57:11 maybe it's
0:57:14 because I don't know what any of this is
0:57:18 I think anybody who says they know what
0:57:19 it is is
0:57:21 lying it's just the beginnings of of
0:57:24 that system of Oppression you're talking
0:57:26 about I do not deny the fact that in the
0:57:30 pit of my stomach I know diablerie is
0:57:36 awful but I don't
0:57:38 know what the purpose of any of this
0:57:41 curse that is being a vampire
0:57:45 is I do know that it has afforded me
0:57:49 time after
0:57:51 death to continue to look out for my
0:57:53 family I am blessed in that they are
0:57:56 still
0:57:59 alive and for
0:58:01 them I need to make sure that this world
0:58:04 does not end in a torrent of
0:58:10 Bloodshed I think we still
0:58:13 have some chance at
0:58:16 averting what we likely just
0:58:20 started you should go back and try and
0:58:23 avert that then
0:58:25 because I'm not done wallowing in this
0:58:28 god- aul
0:58:30 weed well I ask that
0:58:32 you go back first that's not going to
0:58:37 happen for
0:58:40 me because this is the bruha
0:58:44 Rave I'm asking you please come back to
0:58:49 the party I'll be in when I'm done with
0:58:51 this
0:58:53 joint
0:58:55 I've made no decisions Johnny I
0:58:59 know but you're the man of the
0:59:04 hour and big parties make me
0:59:08 nervous Johnny kind of rests a hand on
0:59:11 the
0:59:12 Escalade I've got to do some stupid [ __ ]
0:59:15 out here and' be better if you weren't
0:59:17 here
0:59:19 anyways would would you like me to leave
0:59:22 then because I need to be outside
0:59:26 okay she snuffs out the joint in her
0:59:29 hand and unrolls it just so she has a
0:59:33 sheet of paper and she pulls out a pen
0:59:36 from her hair jots down a quick note to
0:59:39 weathers sticks it under the windshield
0:59:42 wiper you suck some gross [ __ ] under
