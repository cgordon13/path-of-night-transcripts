0:00:32 [Music]
0:00:38 last time on path of night Neo Kabir and
0:00:41 the Brujah were running away from the
0:00:43 horde of ravnus when the wakavian
0:00:45 realized the possibility of an illusion
0:00:47 with the assistance of Neil's lost specs
0:00:49 weather led the group to Young Peterson
0:00:51 the archon revealed more about the
0:00:52 movements of the Sabbat and The Plains
0:00:54 of the kamerola and offered to provide
0:00:56 transportation for the group back to New
0:00:58 Haven win sent a message to Xavier but
0:01:01 encountered zoofil instead hiding within
0:01:03 Raven's body the demon gloated about the
0:01:05 arrival of the Maelstrom miles and
0:01:07 brother discussed what has happened to
0:01:09 Elsa and but his emotional conflicts
0:01:11 since her kidnapping attended the Tori
0:01:12 at her salon and found that Marcus Vitel
0:01:14 was posturing there that informed the
0:01:17 Roses about Elsa's disappearance and
0:01:19 promised further assistance
0:01:21 [Music]
0:01:31 brother
0:01:32 you return to your room
0:01:34 just gather your thoughts and prepare to
0:01:36 make your phone call
0:01:38 and as you sit down with the phone in
0:01:40 hand and start planning
0:01:44 what you're going to say and how
0:01:46 you hear an urgent knock at the door
0:01:50 come in Britta manages to say the come
0:01:52 in but win is already opening the door
0:01:53 when she says it hey um whatever you're
0:01:55 doing I need you to drop it and we need
0:01:57 to go we need to go get Ramirez and see
0:02:00 if they can help us about storms here
0:02:03 storms here it's in the shadow lands
0:02:05 it's gonna it's gonna be the end of the
0:02:06 ghost I don't know how much time we have
0:02:08 but Romeo and Joey are in trouble Romeo
0:02:12 um and Britta will look around and see
0:02:15 just in case Romeo's around she'll
0:02:17 heighten her senses you do not see Romeo
0:02:19 here you see Bruno's eyes go wide and
0:02:21 that scan of the room but no flash of
0:02:24 Revelation but it looks down at the
0:02:27 phone in her lap and with hesitation she
0:02:29 puts it back on the Cradle is it a quick
0:02:33 call
0:02:35 um
0:02:35 I really should apologize to Prince
0:02:38 Pendragon soon but for being an
0:02:40 inconvenient kidnapping victim no it can
0:02:42 wait let's go
0:02:44 maybe in the car you do what you gotta
0:02:46 do
0:02:47 okay win stopped by her room and gets
0:02:51 like a pair of just like slip-on
0:02:52 sneakers or something just so she has
0:02:54 something on her feet but she's really
0:02:56 not looking for boots to break in or
0:02:58 flip-flops that are going to come flying
0:02:59 off she's just grabbed some shoes and
0:03:01 goes wind just grabs one of the more
0:03:04 convenient sets of keys she takes like a
0:03:07 Ford or a Chevy or a Dodge nothing do
0:03:10 you have those
0:03:11 there is the
0:03:14 um the Blazer that we use it's like a
0:03:17 little bit taller up a little bit more
0:03:18 inventory but as are more casual going
0:03:22 around vehicle that's still very
0:03:24 noticeable she just grabbed she doesn't
0:03:25 want to ruin one of the one of the nice
0:03:28 cars she's she grabs the Chevy keys and
0:03:31 heads out to the garage Brit is hurrying
0:03:33 along with you she stops kind of hopping
0:03:37 into her shoes poke her head into
0:03:38 wherever miles is and ask do you think
0:03:41 the cell phone's working yeah it should
0:03:42 be working by now all right I'm heading
0:03:44 out with Gwen all right keep me updated
0:03:45 yep as when gets outside she unlocks the
0:03:49 car gets in starts it up and once
0:03:52 British inside she starts pulling out
0:03:55 and mentions by the way
0:03:58 um Z's out he's back in the area
0:04:01 like free he's in Raven like like he was
0:04:05 in Miles all he said was she wasn't
0:04:07 there and she was
0:04:10 ravidly anti him yeah does she look good
0:04:15 but he's not allowed to hurt us
0:04:18 right there's a very
0:04:21 fine knit to be picked
0:04:23 he can't cause us harm but he can
0:04:25 certainly watch while we suffer all
0:04:27 right the rundown on what's Happening to
0:04:29 Joey and Romeo the storm is here it's
0:04:32 starting to pick up I don't know how
0:04:35 much time we have but it moved from the
0:04:37 East to here and it I haven't seen any
0:04:39 wraiths around so I maybe you make your
0:04:43 phone call or send text messages I need
0:04:45 to call Ramirez because I know he has a
0:04:47 way he probably has one of Joey's last
0:04:49 things that might be a safe place for
0:04:51 him yeah do you while I'm doing that
0:04:54 think of
0:04:56 and I know this is heart but I also know
0:05:00 things are starting to come back to you
0:05:02 think of anything any place you know if
0:05:05 you can find anything that was dear to
0:05:08 him any place that was important to him
0:05:10 any you know sometimes even bones can
0:05:13 work as Britta thinks about that a
0:05:15 particular idea comes to mind it's her
0:05:18 piano she's thinking about she's
0:05:20 thinking about specifically the music
0:05:24 piece that Romeo played to get her
0:05:26 attention when he first showed up as a
0:05:28 wraith that was something played on
0:05:30 piano too right it was I think it was
0:05:32 Clair de Lune it was something that you
0:05:34 would both kind of play as I'm kind of
0:05:37 rocking my mind and thinking through
0:05:39 what little I can remember before
0:05:41 Amnesia took over but also what I know
0:05:44 of Romeo to this day does a piano ring
0:05:46 does my piano ring true for an item of
0:05:49 great importance it is certainly
0:05:50 possible Britta for us her brow incest
0:05:53 maybe my piano would work
0:05:56 it usually has to be from before they
0:05:57 were dead but I don't I'll take anything
0:06:00 if you can think of anything it's worth
0:06:03 a try it's the item in my Haven that I
0:06:06 know that he's interacted with the most
0:06:07 and he would have been there when he was
0:06:09 alive I think all right that it could
0:06:12 work there's no absolutes in this yeah
0:06:15 and as she's driving she kind of like
0:06:16 Wiggles and gets her phone out of her
0:06:18 pocket okay
0:06:19 um I'm are you I'm not I don't remember
0:06:23 if I can drive no I'm just gonna put the
0:06:25 phone on the dashboard and yell at it
0:06:27 okay I'm do you mind if I um
0:06:30 can I move to the back of the car for
0:06:31 this yeah that's fine and she like pulls
0:06:33 over she probably mounts the curb a
0:06:35 little bit because she's not being super
0:06:37 careful yeah Brett is not waiting either
0:06:39 she's not trying to cause you any delay
0:06:41 but she sees that you intend on Yelling
0:06:44 into a phone while she's going to have
0:06:46 an important conversation herself and so
0:06:48 she's just gonna put as many rows of the
0:06:50 car between the two of you as she can
0:06:52 makes sense so as Brit is climbing back
0:06:55 when we'll use that moment while the car
0:06:58 is not in motion to bring up the cab guy
0:07:00 entry on her phone which is her entry
0:07:03 for Ramirez's number and she dials
0:07:07 hello Ramirez hey how you doing I I've
0:07:12 been better Ramirez have you seen Joey
0:07:14 uh it's not totally how it works for me
0:07:18 but uh I haven't seen him lately if
0:07:20 that's what you mean okay
0:07:22 um there's there's trouble for race
0:07:26 um
0:07:26 so I know shit's been bad for you guys
0:07:29 lately yeah you know it's been hard yeah
0:07:32 and I'm really sorry
0:07:35 um I gave Crystal something of Joey's
0:07:37 and I need it to keep him safe
0:07:40 talking about like the the whistle yeah
0:07:43 okay
0:07:44 do you have it yeah yeah where are you
0:07:48 and can I come get it
0:07:50 um
0:07:50 where I'm at right now is not uh really
0:07:53 a place where you can have visitors but
0:07:55 you know you let me know where you are
0:07:57 and I can I can make sure to get it to
0:07:58 you I'm on my way to Crystal's house uh
0:08:01 yeah sure why don't I why don't I head
0:08:03 out there are you at Hell house right
0:08:04 now no
0:08:06 are you safe
0:08:08 yeah but we can't really I've agreed
0:08:11 that where I am is a place that does not
0:08:13 get disclosed all right that's fair
0:08:15 enough
0:08:16 uh I'll be there in about five ten
0:08:18 minutes okay I'll see you then all right
0:08:21 thank you Ramirez
0:08:22 of course anytime he hangs up she hangs
0:08:26 up and she tries to ignore britta's
0:08:28 phone call in the back as she drives
0:08:33 during your phone call there is a longer
0:08:36 pause than perhaps necessary
0:08:38 Britta is hesitating she's
0:08:41 trying to hide and stifle nervousness
0:08:45 Britta curls her body to prevent
0:08:48 sound from up front from coming towards
0:08:51 the phone and
0:08:53 dials the number
0:08:55 the phone rings
0:08:58 and rings and rings
0:09:01 as if
0:09:03 it might not have an answering machine
0:09:05 or voicemail
0:09:06 she says on the line each ring is making
0:09:09 her more
0:09:11 just when you start to feel like you
0:09:14 can't take it anymore someone picks up
0:09:16 on the other end
0:09:19 ragon's office
0:09:21 do I recognize the voice yes is it Maria
0:09:24 it is
0:09:25 hello Maria this is Brother Ashcroft
0:09:30 and how are you Miss Ashcroft
0:09:33 things have been a little
0:09:36 wild but I was calling to try and
0:09:40 apologize to Prince Pendragon
0:09:43 his grace doesn't have a reputation for
0:09:46 being overly forgiving
0:09:48 no he he's meeting someone right now
0:09:51 would you like me to perhaps take down a
0:09:53 message
0:09:54 if you could please do that and
0:09:58 leave this number
0:10:01 I'd be very happy to what is your
0:10:03 message
0:10:05 I realize I'm over the phone I'm not
0:10:08 getting the sense that she's actually
0:10:09 going to do this as a person is this an
0:10:12 empathy role or what is this you can
0:10:14 make an empathy role
0:10:17 four successes
0:10:22 here
0:10:25 Britta thanks for everything that she's
0:10:27 practiced to say
0:10:30 everything that she's gone over in her
0:10:32 mind and she says
0:10:36 I realized that an apology over the
0:10:38 phone
0:10:39 isn't enough
0:10:41 especially not left as a message like
0:10:45 this
0:10:46 but
0:10:48 I wanted to tell you
0:10:50 um
0:10:51 I wanted to tell him that
0:10:53 that this isn't like Boston
0:10:56 that
0:10:57 things wouldn't have ended that way if I
0:10:59 had a choice
0:11:01 that I'm
0:11:03 sorry is he supposed to understand this
0:11:05 code
0:11:07 I think you would know what I'm talking
0:11:08 about
0:11:09 write this down then it's very vague
0:11:12 yes
0:11:14 if you could write that down that would
0:11:16 be
0:11:17 best of course and is this the
0:11:20 stammering part of the code
0:11:23 if you wanted to include the samurai you
0:11:25 could
0:11:26 and and the Sheepish tongue
0:11:29 you could narrate that too if you wanted
0:11:33 it's the words that I feel are important
0:11:36 I understand you're just not saying very
0:11:38 many words so
0:11:39 I wonder if the tone is important as
0:11:42 well
0:11:45 I just want to make sure I have this
0:11:46 down right for you
0:11:50 I think if you write the words
0:11:53 that's what I'm asking of you okay give
0:11:56 me just a moment okay I'm sorry from the
0:11:58 beginning what were the words
0:12:00 it would have been different from Boston
0:12:03 please write that I am trying to reach
0:12:07 out to apologize
0:12:09 that I didn't mean to run away that I
0:12:12 wouldn't have if I had a choice
0:12:15 and that
0:12:16 he didn't deserve my reaction and that I
0:12:19 know that there's more needed than just
0:12:23 a message left
0:12:24 but that I'm sorry
0:12:27 right
0:12:30 well I'm going to get this message to
0:12:32 him right away
0:12:34 but it is only fair that I warn you that
0:12:37 he doesn't like phone calls very much
0:12:40 okay
0:12:41 I'm sure he can make his own decision on
0:12:44 how he chooses to contact me if he does
0:12:47 right I just
0:12:48 want to make sure you manage
0:12:50 expectations
0:12:52 I think that will be all right
0:12:55 all right you have a good night she
0:12:57 hangs up
0:12:59 about two minutes later the Blazer
0:13:01 arrives
0:13:02 and British phone rings I'll go deal
0:13:05 with this you do this all right thank
0:13:07 you I'm sorry I you don't need to
0:13:09 apologize to me it's fine Britta steps
0:13:12 off to take the call and win pops out
0:13:15 slams the door and hurries up to the
0:13:17 house
0:13:22 when hurry's up to the house and sort of
0:13:25 meeting her on the sidewalk out in front
0:13:27 is Ramirez and he's like hey sorry for
0:13:31 no pizza how you girls doing it's been a
0:13:33 hell of a week man I don't know how it's
0:13:35 been for your folks it's uh well from
0:13:37 what Johnny told us it was pretty bad
0:13:40 some of us made it and I'm grateful for
0:13:42 that class is half full sometimes that's
0:13:46 the way it's got to be
0:13:48 otherwise that I'm not gonna go there
0:13:51 not tonight
0:13:53 um
0:13:54 his hand shakes a little like he's
0:13:56 developed some sort of like a nervous
0:13:58 tick and he reaches into his coat pocket
0:14:01 and he takes out like a little plastic
0:14:03 like sandwich container and something is
0:14:08 super wrapped up in like a little bubble
0:14:11 wrap and he's got masking tape that his
0:14:13 use like secure the lid and with a
0:14:16 marker over the top and like kind of
0:14:19 shitty handwriting someone has written
0:14:21 Joey's whistle and he's like I was told
0:14:23 to take care of it and protect it with
0:14:26 my life I know you guys are close so I
0:14:31 feel like I can trust you with this
0:14:32 burden Ramirez I'll be very honest he's
0:14:36 probably safer with you than me so my
0:14:38 goal is to get him
0:14:40 to know that he can go in this whistle
0:14:42 and escape the storm in the shadowlands
0:14:44 but I want him to be safe and I don't
0:14:46 care who it is that keeps him safest I'm
0:14:48 gonna be honest I understand most of
0:14:51 what you said but you let me know what I
0:14:53 can do to help and I'm gonna do it
0:14:55 how much wind kind of closes her eyes
0:14:58 and thinks for a minute
0:15:00 so I know
0:15:03 you guys know about the storm in the
0:15:05 Middle East in Bangladesh yeah I follow
0:15:09 the news from time to time okay that
0:15:11 same storm that's killing everybody it's
0:15:14 happening in the place where ghosts
0:15:16 exist the shadowlands show the storm
0:15:20 that's been going on for a while is not
0:15:21 going to get any better I have no idea
0:15:23 what it means for this side but it's
0:15:25 destroying all of these souls in the
0:15:27 shadowlands which is where Joey is
0:15:30 I don't know if there's anything I can
0:15:32 do to help that I don't I'll be very
0:15:34 honest I don't really know your skill
0:15:36 set I know one of you held a werewolf at
0:15:39 Bay until Johnny got there but he points
0:15:41 at the Tupperware and it's like that's
0:15:43 pretty much my skill set I can I can
0:15:45 taxi but I'm just a guy
0:15:48 we all were at some point man and then
0:15:50 we we stepped up to be something
0:15:52 different
0:15:59 I want to get as many out as I can but
0:16:01 they have to have safe places to go and
0:16:04 things that were important to them
0:16:06 either before or after they died are
0:16:08 their best chances of being able to
0:16:10 escape wait hold on
0:16:12 dead don't belong here this is like
0:16:15 it's like Rod Central if you do that
0:16:18 kind of thing only if they go back to
0:16:19 their bodies
0:16:20 they're here they've been here I trust
0:16:23 you you said like firmly I've I've
0:16:26 fought rots man they're no good and
0:16:28 they're that may be one of the saddest
0:16:30 things I've ever seen so do you want the
0:16:32 Tupperware or I do all right well here
0:16:36 you go
0:16:37 and uh does it look like the whistle yes
0:16:40 okay it's just I mean it's hard to see
0:16:42 like he's got it like literally bubble
0:16:46 wraps yeah you clearly did not
0:16:47 understand entirely what you meant by
0:16:49 like keep it safe but he's like just
0:16:51 he's just doing everything that comes to
0:16:54 mind to accomplish that thank you do
0:16:57 don't tell me anything you think would
0:16:59 get me and get you in trouble with your
0:17:01 people
0:17:02 do any of you see the undead do you see
0:17:06 the wraiths do you see any of the
0:17:08 spirits that are all around us
0:17:10 uh
0:17:12 we are shown
0:17:14 what we need to see that's the only way
0:17:16 I can explain it and I understand that
0:17:18 might not make a lot of sense
0:17:20 man the the level of [ __ ] this week
0:17:23 that doesn't make sense that I still
0:17:25 have to deal with is off the charts so
0:17:28 at this point I'm I'm okay with the
0:17:30 answers you're willing and able to give
0:17:31 I think that's just the best way to
0:17:33 explain it it's not that we're special
0:17:36 and see it's that we're shown well
0:17:39 something's choosing you to see so yeah
0:17:42 well may not mean that you're special
0:17:44 but it means that you're the right
0:17:46 person for it I think it's just a part
0:17:49 of the human condition you know
0:17:51 which part like 90 of the brain doesn't
0:17:54 get used
0:17:56 that's not true and uh I'm not gonna
0:18:00 argue
0:18:01 I I studied psychology back in the day
0:18:04 man you used 10 of your brain for
0:18:06 conscious thought the rest of the 90 is
0:18:08 used for autonomic reflexes and stuff it
0:18:10 all gets used yeah well maybe this is a
0:18:12 reflex could be so you agree you kind of
0:18:16 like correct smile I agree that there is
0:18:19 a possibility in all the things we've
0:18:22 ever known being wrong I'll take it
0:18:24 you'll be safe you too man
0:18:27 um to that end what do you guys need
0:18:31 for everything to slow down that'd be
0:18:33 nice that would be really great wouldn't
0:18:35 it
0:18:36 if there's anything I can do to help if
0:18:39 there's anything I don't know I'm not
0:18:40 going to speak for everybody else if
0:18:41 there's anything I can do to help you've

0:19:38 back to the car with the Tupperware
0:19:42 foreign
0:19:44 [Music]
0:19:47 hello
0:19:48 so are you using heightened senses or
0:19:53 um
0:19:54 I do think our heightened senses is up
0:19:56 purely because she's probably been
0:19:58 standing here and about of paranoia and
0:20:00 upset and I think also that she would
0:20:04 put her height and senses up just in
0:20:05 case there's anything going wrong with
0:20:07 win so yes okay
0:20:10 I see you've survived whatever it is
0:20:13 yes
0:20:15 I'm sorry to call um
0:20:18 wasn't sure which would be worse calling
0:20:21 or coming over to apologize
0:20:25 I suppose that explains the unusual note
0:20:28 unusual
0:20:30 I received a note from Maria saying you
0:20:32 said something ridiculous but the
0:20:33 details weren't included
0:20:35 what
0:20:37 ridiculous thing did you have to say
0:20:40 oh
0:20:42 um
0:20:44 I guess it probably is a ridiculous idea
0:20:47 to try and apologize
0:20:49 but I thought it was worth a go
0:20:52 so you left a message
0:20:54 there was a lot more to the message and
0:20:57 it was settled up no I don't know if it
0:21:00 was said a lot better the first time but
0:21:01 very much a product of the 90s I suppose
0:21:05 I honestly
0:21:07 I'm not sure but I'm
0:21:10 apologies what I mean to say is
0:21:13 normally something
0:21:15 said with meaning
0:21:18 is expressed with a letter or direct
0:21:21 conversation
0:21:23 would you prefer a letter or a direct
0:21:27 conversation it's not my apology
0:21:29 but it is for you then make it good
0:21:33 I understand that you are drawn away
0:21:36 because of your affiliations
0:21:38 is that correct
0:21:41 I wouldn't have tried to run or done any
0:21:44 of the stupid things to get away that I
0:21:47 did if I had a choice
0:21:50 are you apologizing for not staying
0:21:53 longer
0:21:54 that's part of it why should that matter
0:21:57 to you
0:21:59 one part of what I'm apologizing for is
0:22:03 how I treated you I wouldn't have lashed
0:22:06 out if I could have chosen not to but
0:22:10 I'm still I still did it and I wanted to
0:22:14 apologize for that and then I really
0:22:17 didn't want it to be at all like Boston
0:22:20 you said that
0:22:22 you really didn't like us running away
0:22:24 like cowards and that was the last thing
0:22:26 that I wanted to do again
0:22:28 I wanted to show you that I appreciated
0:22:31 you keeping your word and
0:22:34 I I didn't I didn't want to leave
0:22:38 what did you want
0:22:40 important now am I still alone for this
0:22:44 conversation I need to actually to know
0:22:46 when when comes out you see when and
0:22:49 Ramirez hugging
0:22:52 brother what do you want when you came
0:22:55 to get me I felt like like I had to take
0:22:58 the chance to set things right between
0:22:59 you and the Coterie and I was scared that
0:23:02 you were going to kill me or Worse kill
0:23:04 them and
0:23:05 I'm so ashamed of knowing so little
0:23:07 about myself and about losing my memory
0:23:10 about about being controlled and
0:23:11 manipulated about the people I told you
0:23:13 about in the hotel room and I'm ashamed
0:23:15 of my lack of autonomy and and my
0:23:16 confusion and my confusion about you in
0:23:18 the shower and how you make me feel and
0:23:20 I keep thinking about how your scars
0:23:23 felt when I was touching you and I think
0:23:24 you could really [ __ ] me so hard that I
0:23:26 wouldn't have to think so much about all
0:23:27 this and
0:23:29 and brother realizes what just came out
0:23:31 of her mouth and she immediately hangs
0:23:34 up and pulls the phone close to her
0:23:36 chest like she's hiding it from herself
0:23:37 well as you hold on to the phone you
0:23:41 sense a looming presence
0:23:44 and as you turn it would seem that a
0:23:47 wind had arrived just in time for the
0:23:49 tail end of that
0:23:52 um
0:23:54 hey
0:23:56 oh well
0:23:58 how'd your call go
0:24:04 Britta immediately spends the blood just
0:24:08 enough to at Full Tilt speed run from
0:24:12 win to the passenger seat clip herself
0:24:15 in and just be as ready to leave as
0:24:18 possible
0:24:20 when
0:24:21 she doesn't want to be amused by this
0:24:23 but she's vaguely amused by this and
0:24:26 just kind of like sucks her lips into
0:24:28 her mouth to not laugh as she walks to
0:24:31 the car gets in on the driver's side
0:24:34 Britta just keeps her body rigidly like
0:24:38 not quite forward turned away from me a
0:24:40 little bit like she's hiding but she's
0:24:42 here to do what they're there to do when
0:24:45 starts the car kind of looks over to
0:24:48 Britta you look over and Britta just turns
0:24:51 the radio on well she was gonna say hey
0:24:54 do you wanna do you want the radio
0:24:56 as you say hey do you want the radio
0:24:58 it's just on and loud my wind starts
0:25:02 driving
0:25:05 she lets the silence linger for a couple
0:25:08 minutes
0:25:12 we don't have to talk about that phone
0:25:15 call
0:25:17 but it sounded like you've been holding
0:25:19 back some thoughts
0:25:21 and if you need to bounce ideas off of
0:25:24 someone I am happy to help and she
0:25:27 doesn't say anything else Britta in
0:25:29 response curls up into the seat she
0:25:32 tucks her feet beneath her makes herself
0:25:35 small hides the cell phone I think I
0:25:38 don't it rings what's the number is it
0:25:41 the same one I called yeah I don't hang
0:25:44 up or anything I just put it to the
0:25:46 bottom of the bag this happens twice it
0:25:49 is on silent but I'm sure I hear the
0:25:51 rumbling yep you both do
0:25:54 glove compartment might dampen the sound
0:25:56 a little more oh and how does vampire
0:25:58 sex even work okay jumping in both feet
0:26:01 I love it let's do this
0:26:03 um Britta has covered her face but she
0:26:06 says I mean I I know how regular sex
0:26:09 works I think I mean I don't remember if
0:26:10 I've had it or not but I remember like
0:26:12 an academic sense but I don't know if
0:26:13 it's different if you're a vampires and
0:26:15 I when kind of lets her keep going as
0:26:17 long as she needs to there's a lot of
0:26:19 nervous energy that she doesn't really
0:26:21 want pent up that is not going to help
0:26:23 your objective okay so you can see even
0:26:26 longer that Brit is going the worse
0:26:29 that's getting okay Britta Britta you
0:26:32 don't need to but you need to take a
0:26:33 breath for it it tries so first of all
0:26:36 if you don't remember having sex I'm
0:26:39 sorry
0:26:39 because I will tell you that while it
0:26:41 can still be very good vampire sex I
0:26:44 don't think is as good as mortal sex
0:26:47 so what parts are you trying to figure
0:26:49 out attraction are you trying to figure
0:26:51 out mechanics whether we need to spend
0:26:54 blood for it are you talking about like
0:26:56 the beast's role insects Britta looks
0:26:59 as far as you can tell of her hiding her
0:27:01 face
0:27:02 horrified that there's that many
0:27:04 categories to get into
0:27:06 okay I'll just start and you you ask
0:27:09 questions when you need to okay
0:27:11 Okay
0:27:12 so
0:27:13 nothing it sexually is really ever gonna
0:27:16 feel as good as the kiss does
0:27:18 all right mechanically it works pretty
0:27:20 much just like it always would
0:27:22 you know in lots and lots of fun and
0:27:25 exciting ways
0:27:27 there is some
0:27:29 what we'll call it some kind of Primal
0:27:32 element of it when it comes to being
0:27:35 Kindred and having sex all right the
0:27:38 reptile brain which is what I say I am
0:27:41 dominated by but clearly I am not
0:27:43 reptile brain basically governs your
0:27:45 three most Basic Instincts which are
0:27:48 fighting fleeing and [ __ ] and usually
0:27:52 when those emotions are involved in what
0:27:54 you're doing your fangs are going to
0:27:55 come out and that's okay because it has
0:27:57 a reaction when you say that it's not a
0:27:59 reaction of surprise based on her
0:28:01 previous conversation with miles but she
0:28:03 kind of like bangs her forehead against
0:28:05 her hand
0:28:06 if you want to have sex that's up to you
0:28:11 clearly me [ __ ] Kabir is not the best
0:28:13 idea I've ever had both City politics or
0:28:16 personal life-wise
0:28:18 but at least you feel that way towards
0:28:21 someone nice I honey I'm attracted to
0:28:24 lots of people I I'm pretty much always
0:28:27 ready to go with anyone willing he's a
0:28:30 he's one of the ones who was brave
0:28:32 enough to ask me
0:28:35 and that's that's where my attraction to
0:28:37 him came in most people are too afraid
0:28:39 of me to approach and ask
0:28:41 so I feel like there's something wrong
0:28:42 with me for even for even what Britta
0:28:45 all the time sexuality just feels bad
0:28:48 either it's me using it to hunt because
0:28:52 that'll make some guy walk off with me
0:28:55 and not care about what I'm doing to get
0:28:58 blood or or it's something like like
0:29:02 veto and what Vito did was wrong
0:29:05 what veto did was not what vampire sex
0:29:07 is it's not what any sex is Britta that
0:29:10 was assault
0:29:11 and just it always
0:29:14 feels bad and it when I was at the hotel
0:29:18 room with pen Dragon if seemed like it
0:29:21 would be nice actually and like it could
0:29:24 there is no judgment on Wynn's face
0:29:26 there is no shock or shame or anger I
0:29:31 think I get it it's not like I feel safe
0:29:33 but that's not that's not nothing ever
0:29:36 feels safe nothing ever feels clear and
0:29:39 and in the moment you wanted something
0:29:41 and it felt wrong I don't know I'm
0:29:44 confused it's okay to be confused
0:29:47 sex is weird when you're not an undead
0:29:50 killing machine
0:29:52 not that you're a killing machine but
0:29:54 but I am we're monsters honey it's we're
0:29:58 not human there are Graves all over this
0:30:01 country marked as there's a monster
0:30:03 buried here because it was just how they
0:30:06 explained people who looked different
0:30:07 back in the day I can't even remember
0:30:09 the basics about myself and what I try
0:30:12 to think about if I had sex with anybody
0:30:15 or if I was even in love with anyone or
0:30:18 what any of this means to me I
0:30:22 it's a bad time to feel like this it
0:30:25 doesn't
0:30:27 it's not
0:30:28 good for what we're trying to do
0:30:30 Britta
0:30:32 the storm is coming
0:30:35 we still have work to do
0:30:37 but I'll be very honest you have been
0:30:39 through so much that I this is gonna
0:30:41 help you get through that
0:30:43 this normal weight of a few minutes
0:30:46 it sounds like you went through a great
0:30:49 deal more both as a person and through
0:30:53 circumstance
0:30:55 than anyone thought of
0:30:58 not knowing yourself
0:31:00 losing yourself
0:31:03 It's A Hard Road to come back from I
0:31:06 have been
0:31:07 very fortunate that
0:31:09 I've almost always known what I want
0:31:12 who I am
0:31:14 there was a time I didn't
0:31:16 I felt very close to losing myself
0:31:21 I was a monster
0:31:24 it takes taking the time to rebuild
0:31:26 yourself sometimes
0:31:28 to know what you want
0:31:31 or that's even that's not even right to
0:31:34 know why you want what you want but it's
0:31:36 always okay to want what you want
0:31:39 not always okay to take it
0:31:41 but there's no shame in feeling
0:31:45 when when gets vulnerable to her own
0:31:48 past that's when British starts to try
0:31:51 to either let or make herself uncurl and
0:31:55 sit at least a little bit more
0:31:57 openly her posture opens more as wind
0:32:01 keeps talking there's still that
0:32:04 fear and shame and defensiveness
0:32:08 but she's looking when in the face now
0:32:11 sexuality is a part of who we are either
0:32:14 wanting it or not wanting it it is a
0:32:16 thing that exists in the world and I
0:32:19 happen to enjoy it a lot
0:32:21 have since I was very young
0:32:23 but that's not for everyone attraction
0:32:26 is different you can think something's
0:32:28 beautiful and not want to [ __ ] it
0:32:31 like I don't know there's
0:32:34 I'll be I've already told you there's
0:32:36 not a whole lot of things that I don't I
0:32:37 wouldn't be willing to have sex with if
0:32:39 they were willing but Britta gives when
0:32:42 a look of confusion at that sentence the
0:32:46 confusion does seem focused on the word
0:32:48 thing
0:32:50 people
0:32:53 I am I I'm horny I'm not that horny it's
0:32:57 a slight knot
0:32:58 but that's for you to decide and
0:33:02 I just feel like I shouldn't feel this
0:33:04 way with
0:33:06 I I don't know if it makes me an idiot
0:33:08 to
0:33:09 I don't know
0:33:11 go through what I went through and then
0:33:14 I don't know it keeps getting tangled
0:33:16 like I like I want to be able to help
0:33:20 the Coterie in the ways that I can when
0:33:22 it comes to
0:33:24 just keep it's it's confusing it's like
0:33:27 I get my intentions tangled up with what
0:33:28 I'm feeling and then that helps because
0:33:30 what I'm feeling makes it more real for
0:33:32 me to try to like to politics for the
0:33:36 Coterie but then politics are getting all
0:33:38 tangled up and being a
0:33:41 vampire and how that feels and
0:33:44 I don't know
0:33:47 you are on probably the steepest
0:33:49 learning curve of any neonate I've ever
0:33:52 met so honestly I'm really not shocked
0:33:55 that there's confusion at this degree
0:33:58 so
0:33:59 I need you to kind of just for yourself
0:34:01 not because it's what I need or what
0:34:04 miles means or Neil or Johnny or anyone
0:34:08 but I think it would be good if you
0:34:10 could ariadne's string your way back
0:34:12 through this Maze and find yourself at
0:34:15 the center I don't remember that myth I
0:34:18 know there's a spider but no that's
0:34:20 Arachne okay ariadne gave the hero a
0:34:24 ball of string
0:34:26 so that he wouldn't get lost
0:34:28 in the minotaurs maze
0:34:31 apparently no hero had ever thought of
0:34:33 that before
0:34:35 [ __ ] takes time
0:34:37 it's okay to be confused it's a I
0:34:39 realize me telling you this is not the
0:34:42 same as you understanding and
0:34:44 internalizing it
0:34:45 there is nothing wrong with being
0:34:46 sexually attracted to people it is not
0:34:48 smart to be sexually attracted to
0:34:51 there is no shame in feeling sexual
0:34:54 attraction Britta
0:34:55 there is no shame in having sex
0:34:59 as long as you and the other person are
0:35:01 in on it it's nobody's else's goddamn
0:35:04 business
0:35:06 okay that said
0:35:09 I think you're honey I love you but I
0:35:11 think you're a little bit of a mess
0:35:12 right now
0:35:13 yeah and if sex will make you feel
0:35:16 better
0:35:17 then do it but if it's gonna cause you
0:35:19 to get knotted up like this you don't
0:35:22 need that complication right now because
0:35:24 it does change things
0:35:27 I don't know if I can even look at the
0:35:29 phone again let alone I well for what
0:35:31 it's worth I think he still has your old
0:35:33 one because that's definitely not the
0:35:35 phone I remember you having and you
0:35:37 definitely responded to a text that I
0:35:39 sent a few days ago
0:35:41 breath and tries to kind of like rock a
0:35:44 bit and untangle the stress that win has
0:35:48 verbally noted
0:35:50 um and she nods yeah I definitely lost
0:35:53 my phone somewhere I I think I must have
0:35:56 left it at Prince pendragons
0:36:01 well it's probably still there for what
0:36:03 it's worth
0:36:06 um
0:36:07 honestly turn the phone off honey
0:36:09 you're with me if miles needs one of us
0:36:12 I've got my phone if we need to you can
0:36:14 turn it back on
0:36:15 I'm gonna do that I'll text Miles saying
0:36:18 to text you or call you if he needs me
0:36:20 first but okay and Britta does that
0:36:23 you're putting a lot of expectations on
0:36:27 yourself
0:36:28 and I think you feel like this is just
0:36:30 my outside perspective looking in
0:36:33 that the domain is going to fall apart
0:36:35 if you make one wrong move and I don't
0:36:38 blame you for feeling that way there was
0:36:39 a lot of stress put on you your first
0:36:41 night here
0:36:42 I thought it was do or die I don't think
0:36:44 the domain's gonna fall apart if I make
0:36:46 a wrong move
0:36:48 I think that I've
0:36:50 I don't know if you heard the part where
0:36:52 I was
0:36:54 ashamed of being a part of The tomahi
0:36:57 Rock
0:36:58 I
0:37:00 I've always been a burden to you guys
0:37:03 and it's always been a problem that I
0:37:06 can't that I don't always have control
0:37:09 over who I am and what I do and I
0:37:12 remember the way that you guys felt when
0:37:15 I started scratching the moon into my
0:37:17 palm and I remember the way that you
0:37:19 guys looked at me when I shot veto to
0:37:23 death at Hell House and
0:37:25 other times that I just clearly
0:37:28 um
0:37:30 a lost cause and I am trying to build
0:37:33 back from that and pay pay you guys back
0:37:35 for everything that you've done and I
0:37:38 know that you guys can do better without
0:37:40 me but I'm here and I have to try to
0:37:42 help
0:37:43 she kind of lets that sit for a minute
0:37:48 Britta to me burdens are something forced
0:37:51 upon people
0:37:52 and at no point were you forced upon us
0:37:55 we not only chose you we fought to have
0:37:59 you
0:38:00 we do not perceive you as a burden
0:38:03 what you see inside yourself that's
0:38:05 between you and yourself but you are not
0:38:09 our burden
0:38:10 you are our Britta
0:38:12 and I don't think any one of us regrets
0:38:15 the choices we made that brought you to
0:38:16 us
0:38:18 yeah you're you're a Cracker Jack box
0:38:20 sometimes you never know the surprises
0:38:22 that are inside but
0:38:24 but it's always something interesting
0:38:27 and it's always something that
0:38:29 ultimately
0:38:30 I'll be real honest it gives us greater
0:38:33 insight into the world
0:38:34 I don't like sitting in the dark not
0:38:37 knowing what's going on
0:38:39 I don't always jump full tin foil hat
0:38:41 like Neil does but I
0:38:43 I like that knowing you has
0:38:46 made us smarter
0:38:49 you are not a burden you are a gift
0:38:57 miles even setting the throne for about
0:39:00 a half hour people watch they socialize
0:39:03 they interact and on the surface it
0:39:05 looks like you're running a perfectly
0:39:06 peaceful domain there are artists who
0:39:10 are painting as people socialize part of
0:39:14 you can't help but notice the loss of
0:39:15 Elsa room is a little less bright right
0:39:18 there's just something she brought that
0:39:22 may never be replaced as you enjoy a
0:39:27 more social interaction than what you've
0:39:29 been getting for a while you are
0:39:31 approached by a bearded man very
0:39:35 dark-skinned you recognize him as one of
0:39:38 the Assamites who had come to The Domain
0:39:40 earlier I give him a nod for him to
0:39:43 approach he bows and steps forward
0:39:46 what can I do for you your grace
0:39:49 we are grateful for the kindness that
0:39:52 you have shown us
0:39:53 it has been discussed then in the near
0:39:57 future it would seem that your domain
0:39:59 may be challenged by Outsiders I was
0:40:02 hoping that you might be able to
0:40:04 Enlighten us as to what this Sabbat is
0:40:08 the Sabbat we do not have a conflicts
0:40:12 with them very much at least not in the
0:40:15 past but now we are much closer to their
0:40:17 Mexico City it's about our
0:40:20 a cult of some kind and one of the main
0:40:25 objectives at least from our perspective
0:40:26 is they wish to tear down everything
0:40:28 we've built up
0:40:30 are mere presence is an affront to them
0:40:34 so as we try to maintain and keep the
0:40:38 order to keep our lives going as Kindred
0:40:42 they seek to undermine it to destroy the
0:40:45 peace and security that we've brought
0:40:47 are they dangerous
0:40:49 very much so they do not care for the
0:40:52 rules that we live by if you were to
0:40:54 make a list of needs your grace
0:40:56 I would see to it that the children of
0:40:58 Hakeem
0:41:00 he kind of pauses
0:41:03 I would see to it that the asamites
0:41:05 are prepared to Aid you I will do so I
0:41:08 planned on making
0:41:10 how come having a conversation with you
0:41:12 at some point
0:41:14 so I will start discussing it with my
0:41:17 officers and we shall have a sit down
0:41:19 and see what the Assamites can offer we
0:41:22 are at your disposal he bows again he
0:41:26 didn't introduce himself dating what's
0:41:28 that
0:41:29 he did the last time you met him no what
0:41:32 are you trying to remember his name yes
0:41:35 Tim doesn't remember because it's been
0:41:37 like a year I don't think his name was
0:41:38 actually said okay so do you give him
0:41:41 that weird look he's like Ishmael
0:41:43 I like this guy already
0:41:47 thank you Ishmael I will be in contact
0:41:49 with you soon he gives a nod after
0:41:51 stepping away out of the you know the 10
0:41:53 foot radius around his grace and he then
0:41:57 politely excuses himself as that is
0:42:00 happening
0:42:01 some of the Toyota present gasp looking
0:42:04 at a painting and more and more of the
0:42:07 domain starts to kind of clutter around
0:42:10 to get a look at this painting that
0:42:13 seems to have caused a stir within the
0:42:17 court can I see it from here you cannot
0:42:20 because of the angle of the easel uh
0:42:22 it's like more facing you or the rather
0:42:25 the back the back that feels suspicious
0:42:30 clear that your eyes are like narrowing
0:42:32 and you're like that feels suspicious
0:42:35 um people start scampering away I will
0:42:38 go to different Corners to gossip
0:42:40 I've been up here for a little bit I
0:42:41 will start taking a walk around I won't
0:42:43 make a b line for the painting but I
0:42:45 understand everyone's stance
0:42:47 I give them the wave to continue their
0:42:49 business I have not gotten used to them
0:42:53 and I I moved down I I make a
0:42:56 meandering-ish walk but I'm definitely
0:42:58 heading towards that thing okay what you
0:43:01 see is a myriad of graves that are used
0:43:05 to make up the figure of a man but
0:43:08 around his form is this beautiful array
0:43:13 of colors each of them clearly having
0:43:16 some sort of meaning where this painting
0:43:18 would otherwise be just very very pretty
0:43:21 watercolors there are these hideous
0:43:24 black veins that are drawn throughout
0:43:28 this Aura the painter stands and Bows to
0:43:32 your grace when you approach and she
0:43:34 says to you your grace I have titled it
0:43:38 kingslayer
0:43:39 Court looks at you
0:43:41 who is this painter is this one of the
0:43:44 torreidos uh she is one of the Kindred
0:43:46 that arrived from the city of Baltimore
0:43:48 as a refugee from the Sabbat okay which
0:43:51 is not a prince she came with as an
0:43:54 Entourage uh she did not come as part of
0:43:56 an Entourage but she definitely kind of
0:43:58 she's enough of a social butterfly or
0:44:00 more than one of these traveling princes
0:44:02 very likely believes that she is part of
0:44:04 their Entourage and her name is Vicki
0:44:08 Summers I see Miss Summers and what is
0:44:11 inspired this
0:44:14 it is a ruthlessness that I have seen
0:44:18 since the arrival of the Sabbat
0:44:21 to the East Coast
0:44:22 a symbol of the way that it is twisted
0:44:25 or politics and allowed Kindred to make
0:44:29 concessions
0:44:31 casting out decide their honor and favor
0:44:33 of brutality and savagery for power and
0:44:37 so I name it kingslayer your grace
0:44:40 she bows quite humbly there have been
0:44:43 many sacrifices the domain has made to
0:44:46 keep our residents safe so I have heard
0:44:49 your grace
0:44:50 it is good to remember those things I am
0:44:53 sure we will all be certain to remember
0:44:57 I would like to see more of this work in
0:45:00 your other work when you are finished
0:45:01 with Summers
0:45:02 of course your grace however
0:45:05 I think you might be surprised
0:45:08 by our little events like this she
0:45:11 gestures to the black veins how
0:45:14 infrequent they are among the camarilla
0:45:17 Marcus vitel approaches
0:45:20 um sometimes it's beautiful
0:45:22 if I may I would offer a major Boon for
0:45:25 possession of it
0:45:27 being that it is in my domain I would
0:45:29 like to see the finished product first
0:45:32 well
0:45:33 surely you would not supersede
0:45:35 prestation on this matter
0:45:37 I would not
0:45:39 as hard as to offer to who she wants
0:45:41 very long
0:45:43 she looks at him I accept Mr vital
0:45:47 I'm not already in the other office and
0:45:49 he's like wow their loss
0:45:51 if you wish it your grace perhaps I will
0:45:53 allow you to see it when she is finished
0:45:56 I raised my eyebrow Marcus vitel you
0:45:59 seem to appear at a lot of the same
0:46:01 places that I do
0:46:02 that is the nature of the Camarilla
0:46:04 Eucharist outside of even the court
0:46:07 well
0:46:09 you are the prince
0:46:11 I would imagine you would appear in all
0:46:14 of the
0:46:15 best and brightest social Gatherings
0:46:17 within their domain and I've made a
0:46:20 point of doing so myself
0:46:22 I will see you around Mr vital of course
0:46:24 he turns to summons actually on second
0:46:27 thought why don't you have that
0:46:29 delivered to his Grace's office when
0:46:30 you're finished
0:46:32 he seems to have a unique appreciation
0:46:35 for it
0:46:36 a gift my cousin thank you and he turns
0:46:39 and walks off I feel like this
0:46:41 interaction is done and staying is numb
0:46:44 so I'm going to I'm going to do Circle
0:46:46 for a bit talk basically I'm gonna start
0:46:50 ameliorating some of whatever that's on
0:46:52 by just interacting with people and also
0:46:54 just keeping my general presence known I
0:46:56 like to think that I'm decently likable
0:46:58 so oh you're Grace you're like this
0:47:01 little voice I turned to see who's
0:47:04 talking to me this like kind of
0:47:06 well-dressed fashionable man with
0:47:09 completely disheveled messy hair
0:47:11 approaches you it's like greasy
0:47:13 um capabilization's been gone for a
0:47:15 while your grace and I'm a little
0:47:17 worried about him all right I will look
0:47:19 into the location of dashwood thank you
0:47:22 uh I had another question I wanted to
0:47:24 ask
0:47:26 um all right there's a lot of Assamites
0:47:29 in the city now we're not going to start
0:47:31 allowing diablary right there will be no
0:47:33 rampant diablary in the city which is
0:47:38 why are you asking me well there's just
0:47:40 a lot of Assamites your grace and
0:47:43 normally from what I know by Assamites is
0:47:46 they take payment for work in the form
0:47:48 of eating people like Kindred I just
0:47:51 want to make sure that we are not going
0:47:53 to be allowing any Kindred to be
0:47:55 diablerized most of the rumors about the
0:47:57 acid mites are created as enemies we are
0:48:00 not allowing rampant Diablerie to happen in
0:48:02 the city and I do not believe the
0:48:04 astomites are interested in it and we're
0:48:07 not going to allow unrampant Diablerie
0:48:08 either increase
0:48:12 correct
0:48:14 slippery slope Your Grace that's all
0:48:16 thank you for informing me thank you you
0:48:19 Grace thank you you can go now yes sir
0:48:23 what the [ __ ] was that
0:48:27 after saying you know a couple more
0:48:30 words so my presence isn't just like hey
0:48:32 dashwood is missing and I just take off
0:48:34 like an emergency I you know finish out
0:48:36 a round of the court and then I head
0:48:37 towards the center Shell's office
0:48:39 foreign
0:48:42 [Music]
0:48:45 's office look so when you open the door
0:48:48 to enter Central's office a thick cloud
0:48:51 of morally smoke comes out it's a little
0:48:54 bit hazy in here hanging on the back of
0:48:57 the door is a black sports coat it looks
0:49:00 like it hasn't actually been worn at all
0:49:02 and in the center of a little tornado of
0:49:07 of chaos folders placed here and there
0:49:10 sits Johnny rubbing his temple with the
0:49:13 phone up through his ear and a cigarette
0:49:15 hanging out of his lip he's sitting
0:49:17 behind a computer and he looks like he
0:49:19 has this kind of expression like I'm a
0:49:22 few moments away from frenzying on his
0:49:25 face
0:49:25 he's wearing his typical jeans and work
0:49:28 boots but he's got a black collared
0:49:32 shirt with a tie half undone the shirt's
0:49:36 a little kind of rumpled looking he's
0:49:38 definitely in a state and as you enter
0:49:41 in he got his eyes kind of flash towards
0:49:43 you and he motions for you to come
0:49:45 around to where he's sitting and he
0:49:47 looks like he's just finishing up on the
0:49:49 phone
0:49:50 look it's been three days I want it done
0:49:53 or it's your ass in the line now and
0:49:56 then he slams the phone down he hangs
0:49:58 his head and as you come around you
0:50:00 realize that the computer's not on it's
0:50:03 just got sticky notes all over the
0:50:04 monitor
0:50:06 he pulls one of the sticky notes off
0:50:07 crumples it up and throws it in the
0:50:09 trash and looks up to you I am not cut
0:50:12 out for this you can get an assistant
0:50:15 all right but how do I know who to trust
0:50:17 for this kind of [ __ ] I don't know who
0:50:19 do you trust
0:50:22 maybe Jane seems like a solid idea I
0:50:25 don't know where she is but neither do I
0:50:27 she's been awfully squirrely as of late
0:50:29 probably uh she's probably dealing with
0:50:31 the Rave [ __ ] this would be an
0:50:33 excellent time to find out how is Court
0:50:35 going see it's mixed what the [ __ ] does
0:50:38 that mean
0:50:42 you know just
0:50:43 good things and bad things Johnny uh uh
0:50:47 snubs out the uh Morley that was
0:50:49 hanging on his lip into a ashtray that is
0:50:51 chock full of cigarettes it is like
0:50:54 overflowing and like little butts are
0:50:56 like starting to like fall out onto the
0:50:58 desk it is intense isn't this this from
0:51:01 tonight
0:51:03 some of it we have cleaning people it
0:51:06 has to be from tonight yeah he pulls
0:51:08 another Morley out of out of the pack
0:51:10 crumples the pack because it apparently
0:51:12 was the last one and throws that in the
0:51:14 trash as well how many packs are in the
0:51:15 trash prob probably maybe one or two
0:51:18 right let's make the third if there was
0:51:21 just more alcohol here it gives me a
0:51:23 very 70s advertising agency
0:51:25 I guess anyways uh I need you to contact
0:51:29 uh your uh people that you saw last when
0:51:35 you were with dashwood like people
0:51:37 doing with the hunters I I make a
0:51:41 gesture of right right right don't use
0:51:43 the H word got it yes okay what do we
0:51:46 what do we need him for he's been
0:51:48 missing dashwood yes
0:51:50 [ __ ] all right he uh grabs the sticky
0:51:53 pad writes down a note and slaps it on
0:51:56 the computer screen I'll get to that
0:51:57 right I'll get to that first before
0:51:59 everything else yes that's probably good
0:52:01 we should probably have our keeper of
0:52:02 Elysium back miles's phone rings
0:52:05 excuse me all right turn away not even
0:52:08 not much in one of the miles here always
0:52:11 a pleasure miles
0:52:12 there is work to be done you recognize
0:52:15 the voice of your sire never a boring
0:52:17 night things are delayed and I've had to
0:52:19 hold on to them longer than anticipated
0:52:21 however some allies of yours members of
0:52:25 the domain of New Haven they are on a
0:52:27 plane now that is headed back to you
0:52:29 they're going to need some pickup that
0:52:31 can be arranged good I trust everything
0:52:33 is going well as well as it can be this
0:52:35 is not
0:52:36 the optimal way I would have liked this
0:52:38 domain to get started but you triumph
0:52:41 nonetheless yes
0:52:43 I strive every day the
0:52:46 influx of princess has been a challenge
0:52:48 well
0:52:51 um by the way actually wait no there's
0:52:53 something I need to warn you about
0:52:54 there's one less of them what do you
0:52:55 mean there's one less he declared Praxis
0:52:59 a method needs to be found to keep the
0:53:00 peace so far other than that been going
0:53:03 okay
0:53:04 New Haven needs to hold up as long as it
0:53:06 can I've received word
0:53:09 that an alliance of princes in the
0:53:11 northern half of Connecticut up through
0:53:13 Maine is going to attempt to move
0:53:16 Kindred from the domain of New Haven out
0:53:18 to them
0:53:19 is this Pendragon it is what do you know
0:53:22 about him it's complicated I know that
0:53:25 they faced um mild set back out in Rhode
0:53:28 Island recently but not much else it was
0:53:30 my hope that the army that He commands
0:53:33 could be leveraged as aid for our
0:53:36 ultimate goal however it seems that he
0:53:39 has his own designs and is attempting to
0:53:43 pull princes to the domain of Boston
0:53:46 offering sanctuary in another Prince's
0:53:49 domain he runs that domain from the
0:53:52 Shadows
0:53:54 there is a chance that he may be
0:53:57 attempting to use this entire conflict
0:53:59 to position himself for Justicar I am
0:54:01 working
0:54:04 we are working
0:54:05 to figure out something between us him
0:54:08 and Rowlands was not an agreeable
0:54:10 contract
0:54:11 but I think we can come to some sort of
0:54:13 understanding
0:54:15 Marcus vitel is working to I feel like
0:54:18 Marcus vitel is working to cross
0:54:20 purposes Marcus vitel cannot be
0:54:22 trusted you mentioned as soon as uh some
0:54:26 more of my coterie returns that will be
0:54:28 on their task list we've been monitoring
0:54:30 messages being sent from Marcus Vitel to
0:54:32 some outside source we don't have the
0:54:36 details on who he has been in
0:54:37 communication with but you cannot trust
0:54:40 him leave him in the dark on everything
0:54:41 that you can if you have an opportunity
0:54:43 to feed him to the wrath of Roman
0:54:46 Pendragon or someone else do so
0:54:48 I understand
0:54:50 I also may have put in for another pin
0:54:53 you might need to sign that off I
0:54:55 already have fantastic
0:54:57 farewell good night
0:55:00 I hang up the phone I turn around
0:55:04 um looks like we need to go pick up a
0:55:05 couple you want me to put a uh Marcus
0:55:08 vitel sticky note on the computer it's
0:55:10 probably not a good idea to leave
0:55:12 written documentation of our plans it's
0:55:15 just out in the open in this not very
0:55:18 locked office nothing super sensitive
0:55:20 here you were just about to write Marcus
0:55:22 Vitel I was thinking out it's his name
0:55:25 okay I know what that means
0:55:29 let's just leave that up Goose he writes
0:55:31 it on Stick you know Marcus vitel pulls
0:55:33 it off and sticks it on your chest thank
0:55:36 you
0:55:37 much appreciated I would have forgotten
0:55:39 otherwise see these things are useful I
0:55:42 take the sticky note put it in my coat
0:55:43 pocket anyways we need to go to tweed
0:55:46 airport what the hell do we need to go to tweed airport
0:55:47 for a couple of our friends are arriving

0:55:53 he didn't specify oh great so another
0:55:57 Jan Pieterzoon pick up my friend's
0:55:59 missions this could either be some kind
0:56:00 of Femme Fatale assassin it could be a
0:56:03 squad of Setites moving guns it could
0:56:07 be more Assamites who the [ __ ] knows what
0:56:09 your goddamn sire wants
0:56:12 I'm sorry I'm just maybe a drive will be
0:56:15 good for us you know what it would
0:56:17 Johnny stands up and he goes to grab his
0:56:20 leather jacket from the back of his
0:56:22 chair and finds that it is not there
0:56:24 miles indicates to the sports jacket
0:56:26 behind him Johnny grimace's grabs the uh
0:56:29 sports jacket off the back of the uh of
0:56:31 the office door but does not put it on
0:56:33 just carries it in his hand it's it's

0:56:47 vans in the garage
0:56:49 oh you wanna do you want to take one of
0:56:52 your we could we could take something
0:56:54 nicer than a sprinter van all right fine
0:56:57 uh the Escalade excellent that's better
0:56:59 it's not a sprinter van do you have a
0:57:01 preference on the color preferably not
0:57:03 black but you know I will live with it

0:57:08 black I'll take that one sounds great

0:57:38 looking guy no neck ah nope uh woman a
0:57:43 lot of neck
0:57:45 Johnny's expression changes from annoyed
0:57:49 to interested and amused and he he
0:57:51 shoots a uh a wry smile at uh at Miles
0:57:55 uh looks like it's your date let's go
0:57:57 see what this is about turtleneck what's
0:57:59 your name again uh Peter
0:58:01 Peter you know it looks like your
0:58:03 turtleneck now slaps him on the shoulder
0:58:06 and walks past uh would you peek out the
0:58:07 door you can actually see khalis and
0:58:10 this uh very revealing white and gold
0:58:15 dress and she's got tons of like pieces
0:58:18 of like gold and braids through her long
0:58:21 hair big gold hoop earrings necklaces
0:58:25 plural that are draped around her neck
0:58:28 and over her you know her very curvy
0:58:31 chest and she simply Waits I look at
0:58:35 Johnny I will go meet her you better go
0:58:37 meet her or you will I can't afford a
0:58:39 woman like that
0:58:41 you can increase your salary Johnny
0:58:43 kinda nods might not be a bad idea
0:58:46 she gives this wave and you can see
0:58:48 even her nails are done all black with
0:58:51 these flecks of gold they come to these
0:58:53 like claw like points sounds dangerous
0:58:56 I start moving towards her she
0:58:58 approaches you and bows
0:59:00 Your Grace please I have been sent
0:59:04 regarding my behavior last I visited and
0:59:07 I have been asked to apologize to you
0:59:11 and I am sorry if I have caused you any
0:59:13 offense very good
0:59:16 I also bring with me a gift
0:59:19 and she takes out this like little box
0:59:22 and then she has set aside on like one
0:59:26 of the seats by where she was standing
0:59:28 and waiting for you and she opens it
0:59:30 and within is this very
0:59:35 um
0:59:36 it's a little over the top but it is
0:59:38 this golden amulet chain with this huge
0:59:44 topaz on it this is enough to make Toreador
0:59:48 in the nearby start it is losing their
0:59:51 mind
0:59:52 it is imbued with the magic of spirits
0:59:55 any who wields it is made into an
0:59:59 unparalleled Swordsman
1:00:01 and she offers it to you I will accept
1:00:05 the Box closing the lid for now
1:00:07 I find this apology appropriate and I
1:00:10 will be willing to discuss the
1:00:13 relationship with the Setites in the
1:00:14 future whenever you feel is best I will
1:00:18 warn you that we have recently been
1:00:21 approached by the Sabbath
1:00:22 they are asking that we stand aside
1:00:26 they have offered much
1:00:28 she bows until next time until next time
1:00:31 Khalis she excuses herself and walks as
1:00:34 though she knows that you're watching
1:00:36 seems appropriate she's doing it on
1:00:39 purpose so
1:00:41 Tim this amulet is an entrap ephemera
1:00:45 item within it when activated her grants
1:00:48 an additional five dice on melee rolls I'm
1:00:51 gonna have wait till I have somebody
1:00:53 with magic to check it out first you
1:00:55 recognize it is the the same term that a
1:00:58 certain Ventrue used when imbuing your
1:01:00 sword but instead they put it on an
1:01:02 amulet when you finish up you do happen
1:01:05 to notice that Johnny is waiting by the
1:01:09 painting all right I will continue to
1:01:12 carry this box with me and move over
1:01:14 towards where he's at the painting the
1:01:17 [ __ ] is this thing has the artist left
1:01:19 yes it's uh a painting by uh Miss
1:01:23 Summers called Miss Summers yes Vicki
1:01:26 Summers came from the Baltimore area
1:01:29 Baltimore area who's in charge of
1:01:31 Baltimore or who was in charge of
1:01:33 Baltimore can I make a roll for that
1:01:35 intelligence politics difficulty like
1:01:38 Johnny has just been brushing up in his
1:01:40 politics I guess I'm going to do this
1:01:42 too
1:01:43 no successes four successes Your Grace you
1:01:47 aware of the flux that the domain of
1:01:49 Baltimore have experienced originally
1:01:51 the prince was a Gangrel by the name
1:01:53 of Prince Ash however when the Gangrel
1:01:56 left ash left with them and it had been a
1:01:59 primogen council that had been
1:02:01 maintaining things since waiting for one
1:02:04 of them essentially to attain enough
1:02:06 power to claim the right of domain looks
1:02:10 like it's been a Primogen council since
1:02:12 uh Prince ash left the area during the
1:02:14 Great Gangrel departing huh so is this
1:02:18 supposed to be you
1:02:19 it was left to be
1:02:21 unclear so that's a yes it's supposed to
1:02:24 be delivered to me delivered to you
1:02:26 yes Marcus Vitel has purchased it and give
1:02:29 it to me as a gift tribute I'm not sure
1:02:32 does it have a name uh King Slayer
1:02:37 and you're okay with all this
1:02:40 seems like a pretty pointed attack at
1:02:42 you I mean be worse things to be called
1:02:45 what are you planning on doing with it I
1:02:47 don't know it's pretty well done so that
1:02:48 doesn't feel finished you know it's hard
1:02:51 to tell with art I don't [ __ ] know
1:02:53 any suggestions well if you get rid of
1:02:56 it it's like you're trying to wash the
1:02:59 uh the Barb away but that's people are
1:03:02 gonna talk right I say [ __ ] lean into
1:03:04 it put this thing behind your throne
1:03:07 remind everybody what happens when to
1:03:10 people who [ __ ] with you
1:03:13 it's not a bad mention at this time
1:03:15 since we are in the middle of a war yeah
1:03:17 people want to take shots at you they're
1:03:19 gonna have to be a little bit more
1:03:20 explicit because these little nuanced
1:03:22 things like this just play it off like
1:03:25 you think it's funny where it's like a
1:03:27 pin maybe yeah like a pin he kind of
1:03:30 points at your chest where you actually
1:03:31 have your uh your dignitas on your lapel
1:03:34 very good I'll keep that in mind that
1:03:36 way if they want to try and be a little
1:03:38 bit more straightforward about it we
1:03:41 they give us reason to [ __ ] take their
1:03:42 block off not a bad idea Johnny kind of
1:03:46 sweeps around looking at the court is
1:03:48 there anything else kind of out of place
1:03:49 in here you're taking a look around
1:03:51 honestly everyone's kind of socializing
1:03:53 and having a good time there are less
1:03:56 people here than there probably usually
1:03:58 are but that's to be expected with
1:04:01 rumors of the Sabbat the Assamites are
1:04:04 actually present no one talks to them
1:04:06 and what interactions there are are very
1:04:09 terse and unwelcoming but they're
1:04:12 actually here
1:04:13 sort of just enduring whatever disdain
1:04:18 the domain has for them as best they can
1:04:19 while trying to normalize their presence
1:04:22 how things been going with the uh the
1:04:24 Assamites over there I mean everyone else
1:04:26 dislikes them I don't really they seem
1:04:28 very nice so far very helpful they want
1:04:31 to do more do they hmm Ishmael there
1:04:34 spokesperson reached out today to see
1:04:37 what else he could be they could be
1:04:38 doing for us and sort of effect yeah
1:04:40 Johnny uh looks over to where uh Ishmael
1:04:43 is standing and goes striding over
1:04:45 Ishmael and all of the Assamites stand
1:04:48 to greet the approaching Seneschal the
1:04:51 prince tells me your name is Ishmael I
1:04:52 am Seneschal he bows and the your clan
1:04:56 is looking to do more for the domain he
1:04:58 speaks truth Seneschal well this is
1:05:00 maybe a a small task but do you have
1:05:02 someone in your uh
1:05:04 coterie that uh might be talented at

1:05:13 traveled with me are viziers they are
1:05:16 masters of the Arts architecture
1:05:19 Sciences mathematics while I'm in need
1:05:22 of somebody to help me with the
