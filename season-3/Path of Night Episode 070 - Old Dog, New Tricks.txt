0:00:26 discretion is advice now let's walk the
0:00:29 path of night
0:00:32 [Music]
0:00:39 last time on path of night
0:00:42 one was called a sheriff to handle the
0:00:44 aftermath of another brutal attack by
0:00:46 The Killing Spree
0:00:48 there Johnny and Nguyen conflicted over
0:00:51 methods
0:00:53 Johnny met with his daughter Jessica and
0:00:55 the rest of the hunters supplying them
0:00:57 with weapons and gear
0:00:59 Jessica told Johnny that she believed
0:01:01 she could discover more about The Shard
0:01:03 of the eldest denial house and how to
0:01:05 defeat it
0:01:07 Johnny made his offer to help
0:01:09 the quotery returns to Elysium and were
0:01:12 confronted by the finished painting
0:01:13 depicting miles Diablo
0:01:15 [Music]
0:01:32 so what are we talking about uh wind
0:01:34 kind of kicks the door shut with who
0:01:37 knows it she might be wearing just like
0:01:38 kids at this point because she hasn't
0:01:40 really found anything else that she
0:01:43 really identifies with but she kicks the
0:01:44 door shut and as she does she gives Neil
0:01:47 and Britta a very strong look and puts
0:01:50 her fingers in her ears Beretta is
0:01:53 unsure but she covers her ears Neil also
0:01:56 does earmuffs on himself she pulls out a
0:01:59 can and blasts an air horn backwards at
0:02:02 the door for about a second but it's
0:02:05 still kind of Yelps sorry that wasn't
0:02:08 deodorant and she sets you down like
0:02:11 okay we don't have a speaker now but yes
0:02:13 when maybe that'll help just as it just
0:02:15 as a heads up if somebody was listening
0:02:17 through like that may have deafened them
0:02:20 but also of somebody and they shouldn't
0:02:22 have been listening
0:02:23 yes but what I'm saying from from like
0:02:26 an eavesdropper perspective is if I
0:02:29 wasn't listening now I am flocking to
0:02:32 this office to listen
0:02:34 because a big air horn just went off
0:02:36 drawing a lot of attention to the spot I
0:02:38 can spray I can spray it again please
0:02:40 don't yeah
0:02:43 there's there's sort of like no way to
0:02:45 predict whether or not somebody is there
0:02:47 or that like instead I could just
0:02:49 counter listen or something if you
0:02:51 wanted but now you also know who was
0:02:53 eavesdropping by the bloody ears no it's
0:02:56 more you know it's miles can you um you
0:02:59 must have like a radio or something in
0:03:01 here I'm sure we do but everything I've
0:03:03 heard they could just ignore that
0:03:05 anyways no it depends I mean there's no
0:03:08 there's no perfect there's no perfect
0:03:09 solution but it's if you want to take a
0:03:12 look around I've done what I can to
0:03:14 sound pretty off that's a normal let's
0:03:15 just not talk about sensitive [ __ ] right
0:03:17 now where else are we supposed to talk
0:03:19 about it there's a speaker at the Royale
0:03:21 that was a pain
0:03:22 Johnny uh grabs one of the little metal
0:03:25 standing ash trays that Miles has in his
0:03:28 office specifically for Johnny pulls it
0:03:30 over towards the leather armchair and
0:03:32 lights up a cigarette anyway I you know
0:03:36 we have people that generally keep
0:03:37 people farther away that's what we've
0:03:40 got going for us this place is sound
0:03:42 proofed out of curiosity anyone seem
0:03:44 faster lately no I was actually going to
0:03:46 ask about that and not since I um that
0:03:49 says the thing Britta stands and kind of
0:03:52 starts looking through the office
0:03:53 looking for a radio a record player
0:03:57 anything like that just to do as she
0:03:59 said but she looks over and says I mean
0:04:02 I don't think I've seen him since the
0:04:04 gala and the hotel and everything no it
0:04:07 was
0:04:08 like I said the other night I
0:04:11 my sire got in my head and so I threw a
0:04:13 Molotov cocktail at him then he ran into
0:04:15 the sun do you think he
0:04:17 died or really hope not but if no one's
0:04:21 seen him why are you bringing it up
0:04:22 Johnny well there's that uh someone
0:04:24 asking me about him who Neil looks like
0:04:26 instantly suspicious specifically he
0:04:28 doesn't look suspicious of Johnny he
0:04:30 looks like who the [ __ ] asking about
0:04:32 faster like that's concerning people
0:04:34 were asking questions I'm the son of
0:04:37 shawl people ask me things someone you
0:04:39 trust to have faster spit like best
0:04:42 interest at her or somebody who's yeah
0:04:44 actually heavily tried like calling him
0:04:46 uh no I I could I I have I've been
0:04:49 reticent to I don't know if he I mean I
0:04:51 let him on fire I don't know if he wants
0:04:53 to wait you haven't called him
0:04:55 I let him on fire I I assume he doesn't
0:04:57 want to talk to me did you do it on
0:04:58 purpose what's what's his number I don't
0:05:01 know who will he pick Johnny pulls out
0:05:03 is his new cell phone and waits for his
0:05:05 number God I give him Fester's number
0:05:07 Johnny punches it in slowly and
0:05:10 awkwardly searching for each number on
0:05:13 the on the dial pad like one finger one
0:05:15 finger like just painful to watch you
0:05:18 get a notice that he's unavailable well
0:05:21 it doesn't go straight to voicemail or
0:05:23 anything like that it's it's as though
0:05:24 the battery is dead
0:05:26 I am
0:05:28 um I guess the number is currently
0:05:29 unavailable
0:05:31 I've thought about looking for him you
0:05:34 know my way but I I don't have an
0:05:36 accurate picture of him he didn't like
0:05:38 having his picture taken for you know
0:05:40 obvious reasons and uh I it was rude to
0:05:43 ask him what his real face looks like so
0:05:45 I I it's tough to do does he I mean does
0:05:49 he normally let his cell phone run out
0:05:51 of battery no he's pretty fastidious
0:05:53 yeah um you know uh a gossip
0:05:58 with a dead cell phone is not
0:06:01 living off it was nature I guess
0:06:03 where would you look to find him
0:06:06 ordinarily I would look in the sky uh
0:06:09 but also tough for the Nosferatu I could
0:06:12 go down to his Haven I guess but we'd
0:06:14 have to go Trek into the sewers is there
0:06:15 a chance he's in the city I don't know I
0:06:19 assume he would come home like he was
0:06:22 doing some work for the domain before it
0:06:24 might be best to reach out to him not
0:06:25 only for us but maybe for yourself since
0:06:28 you
0:06:29 think you lit him on fire yeah I'm
0:06:31 really worried I killed him Neil maybe I
0:06:34 have a way of traffic tracking people
0:06:37 I we maybe we can go out and look for
0:06:39 him together what does it require
0:06:40 because my ways are tough the Nosferatu
0:06:44 strangely make it hard
0:06:46 it's a track in my way I don't know him
0:06:49 well so it might be harder
0:06:51 but there are Predators can track other
0:06:54 Predators I'd be willing to go and look
0:06:57 around in the sewers and go to his Haven
0:06:58 but I also it you know I'm
0:07:00 pretty welcomed out there but also I um
0:07:04 we need to ask I'd rather talk to the
0:07:07 NOS ferratsu primigen about sort of
0:07:09 being allowed to go down they don't like
0:07:11 people in their warrants I was gonna be
0:07:12 my next exercise why don't we ask the
0:07:14 Nosferatu if they've seen him you can
0:07:17 ask Renwick
0:07:19 um if you want I can ask runwick just in
0:07:21 case he's
0:07:22 faster has been in contact yeah yeah
0:07:25 maybe maybe we I mean you're the sheriff
0:07:28 so yeah one of the two of you to see if
0:07:30 you can find out where Fester is or if
0:07:32 he's still around I'm really I'm really
0:07:34 worried about him
0:07:35 sin kind of takes out her pack of sticky
0:07:38 notes and writes down look for fester
0:07:42 um
0:07:43 and I guess if we find out I'll let you
0:07:45 know Johnny so you can tell you're
0:07:47 appreciate that we should have a
0:07:49 conversation with him in general
0:07:51 it might be worth him if you can working
0:07:53 with him to figure out what's going on
0:07:55 he was good at information gathering
0:07:57 yeah I would absolutely have gone to him
0:07:58 for some information but I I
0:08:00 the domain would be willing to hire him
0:08:03 well he's the Fester wasn't always
0:08:06 um the most
0:08:08 popular with his clan
0:08:11 um I mean they
0:08:13 left him to die for God's sake so you
0:08:16 know it's showing him a little bit of
0:08:18 appreciation would be
0:08:20 go a long way I think fantastic
0:08:24 so
0:08:25 what else folks we were talking about
0:08:28 well
0:08:29 we started talking about
0:08:32 us having
0:08:34 well Neil was talking about his specific
0:08:37 hesitations about plans moving forward
0:08:40 but then started talking about a vision
0:08:44 when he started laughing when we were
0:08:46 together
0:08:47 yeah again I I don't really remember
0:08:49 laughing but I do remember some of the
0:08:51 things that I saw
0:08:52 uh it was the future we were down in New
0:08:55 York is this a conversation we have here
0:08:57 and now uh there's there's no safe place
0:09:00 if this is this is one of the safest
0:09:02 places in the city honestly so there's
0:09:04 no if we can't have it here we can't
0:09:06 really have it okay that's that's sort
0:09:08 of he like looks around again like you
0:09:11 know by this time Britta should have
0:09:13 been able to get music set up if there
0:09:15 was music in here I'm sure there is what
0:09:18 what does Brita find to automatically
0:09:20 put on Miles Backstreet Boys oh my God
0:09:24 in this office there is probably hidden
0:09:27 like CD stuff like that but out in the
0:09:29 open there's probably a record player
0:09:31 you play Purple Rain
0:09:34 hell yeah Reddit sets it you know
0:09:37 relatively quietly so that everyone can
0:09:39 hear each other but just as an extra
0:09:41 precaution and kind of slinks back to
0:09:44 the chair that points her away from the
0:09:46 painting Neil do you want to give us a
0:09:48 once over to make sure we have no other
0:09:49 visitors uh yeah sure yeah sure Neil
0:09:52 looks around to the best of his ability
0:09:55 so you make sure nobody's here in astral
0:09:57 or listening in or you are all good he
0:10:00 takes a minute sort of opens up his eyes
0:10:02 really like gets unnaturally
0:10:05 vampirically like stock still and then
0:10:07 sort of shakes himself out of it and
0:10:09 looks at Miles uh no no nobody's uh
0:10:13 looks over when no nobody's here
0:10:14 nobody's listening nobody's we're we're
0:10:16 good we're as good as we can be sounds
0:10:18 good if we're not safe now then then
0:10:20 then no one's ever safe sell your vision
0:10:22 there uh yeah we were in New York uh we
0:10:26 were down uh fighting you know back to
0:10:28 back with like Roman Pendragon and I I
0:10:30 think Ian Peterson I can't actually
0:10:32 remember exactly exactly but alongside
0:10:35 yes oh yeah well we were fighting down
0:10:38 there against the spot we were we were
0:10:41 fighting the spot
0:10:42 um I I think we were fighting against I
0:10:46 think maybe delgado's I I can't honestly
0:10:48 remember who specifically it's usabad
0:10:50 but we were fighting this about
0:10:51 alongside and pendragon's army was down
0:10:53 there and it was like a you know all of
0:10:55 us coming together I I saw Johnny there
0:10:57 and uh and and uh I saw all this I I I'm
0:11:02 not really sure which where my
0:11:04 perspective was it wasn't my perspective
0:11:06 but it was but I was seeing it watching
0:11:09 it happen and then uh the streets
0:11:11 erupted
0:11:13 um underneath everyone and the dragon
0:11:16 rose
0:11:17 like like a dragon like we fought in the
0:11:20 Chantry oh like a big scaled one because
0:11:22 you know actually the two of them would
0:11:24 prefer the fire breathing scaled one no
0:11:26 more of um
0:11:28 I don't know how to put it any better
0:11:29 than just the dragon rose you know like
0:11:32 all capital letters how much of this is
0:11:36 symbolism and how much of this do you
0:11:38 think is very specific
0:11:40 I don't it felt specific but that isn't
0:11:45 helpful to determining sometimes
0:11:48 like like if like if I was gonna say
0:11:51 like the rivers ran red with blood right
0:11:53 like uh or like the streets you know
0:11:57 were you know engulfed in rivers of
0:11:59 blood like that might be metaphorical
0:12:01 like there's going to be Carnage or it
0:12:03 might be there is so much blood that
0:12:06 people are drowning in the streets
0:12:07 anyways I don't know what do you think
0:12:10 this is talking about
0:12:14 um it's to me it said we all go down
0:12:17 there to fight against the Sabbat but
0:12:19 what the thing that's underneath the
0:12:21 city uh because when I was projecting
0:12:23 around down there I felt it I felt its
0:12:25 presence way deep under the city pulling
0:12:28 and calling
0:12:30 um it wakes up what what thing the thing
0:12:33 under New York the eldest yeah the the
0:12:36 thing of which the the when you say
0:12:39 dragon
0:12:40 you mean the eldest don't you
0:12:43 I I don't know Johnny but it feels that
0:12:47 way if I was gonna try and connect some
0:12:49 puzzle pieces well tell me about what
0:12:51 you know tell me what you feel what I
0:12:52 feel what I feel is that the eldest is
0:12:55 down there and that if we all go or
0:12:58 rather when we all go it might not
0:12:59 really depend on when we go or if we go
0:13:01 we go down there the camarilla goes down
0:13:04 there on this Crusade that John Peterson
0:13:06 is setting up to you know Counter-Strike
0:13:08 the spot and we go down there to fight
0:13:11 alongside him with the bruja and
0:13:14 pendragon's Army and
0:13:16 Pendragon himself maybe and and and then
0:13:19 the eldest wakes up and
0:13:23 everyone's got much bigger problems
0:13:26 I'm not saying that I saw any of us die
0:13:29 but I'm also not not saying that great
0:13:34 we should take this seriously in other
0:13:37 words if we go down there or if we don't
0:13:40 I'm just saying I saw us down there and
0:13:44 the Dragon
0:13:45 Rises I don't think I really don't
0:13:49 think I want to go with
0:13:53 I don't think we should go with John
0:13:55 Peterson's plan
0:13:58 we stay here
0:13:59 feels like
0:14:01 like why would we even do it why would
0:14:04 we
0:14:06 put ourselves on The Chopping Block like
0:14:08 that so that he can move Camry and
0:14:11 pieces around because this is our home
0:14:13 and it will get slaughtered but it will
0:14:17 still be ours I have thoughts I've been
0:14:20 thinking
0:14:21 about a few ideas while it might be
0:14:25 messiah's plan ultimately it is ours to
0:14:28 enact
0:14:29 it is ultimately our domain that we are
0:14:31 defending and it doesn't necessarily
0:14:33 have to be a Slaughter
0:14:35 but that involves us gathering
0:14:38 information and being able to give out
0:14:41 very specific information I don't have
0:14:44 an exact idea yet but if we can get them
0:14:46 to come through and hit a place they
0:14:49 think is weak that we somehow Miss they
0:14:53 will try to hammer it and if we can
0:14:55 utilize that we can utilize it like a
0:14:57 trap I'm like luring them all into one
0:15:00 location I'm curious if that's actually
0:15:02 true to the Sabbat Johnny you know this
0:15:04 a lot more than any of us but when they
0:15:06 struck the gala they were specifically
0:15:08 striking a place of strength where all
0:15:10 of Longbow was
0:15:11 I think
0:15:13 generally speaking
0:15:15 packs are going to move independently
0:15:18 and from what it sounds like this
0:15:20 Crusade
0:15:21 is hard to pin down
0:15:24 until the moment they strike at a vital
0:15:27 spot at which point they all converge
0:15:29 and hit at the same time with
0:15:31 overwhelming Force
0:15:33 because they didn't kick the front door
0:15:34 down did they
0:15:36 they came in by sea and then right but
0:15:39 they didn't announce themselves with
0:15:40 fireworks and a huge parlay of ships or
0:15:43 did they they killed the center they
0:15:45 killed the sentries first but then they
0:15:47 they specifically ran in and were all
0:15:49 chanting kill the elders it's more than
0:15:52 that they specifically made sure to get
0:15:57 rid of exits and entrances so they're
0:16:00 getting rid of The Cars first they were
0:16:02 cutting off any kind of boat travel
0:16:05 first and they were encircling and they
0:16:08 were sneaking in to encircle and box
0:16:11 everyone in into a killing box which
0:16:14 basically is the plan for a New Haven
0:16:16 the plan for New Haven sounds like
0:16:18 putting us all as the distraction so
0:16:21 that Jan Peterson can go over to New
0:16:24 York City and claim it while we all die
0:16:26 this is a huge city boxing Us in is way
0:16:30 harder than you would think impossible
0:16:32 they don't they don't have the numbers
0:16:33 to box the city in they have the numbers
0:16:35 to try and put a cordon on a city Neil
0:16:38 but they they can box in a facility they
0:16:41 could box in an Elysium if they can
0:16:43 catch the entirety of New Haven and
0:16:45 Elysium that's something they could do
0:16:47 they nearly boxed the Sunnah Elysium
0:16:49 when they dropped off that werewolf
0:16:52 there exactly but they can't do that to
0:16:54 the entirety of New Haven they could
0:16:57 cordon off New Haven but they don't have
0:17:00 the numbers to box it in like they did
0:17:02 at the Elysium Neil what numbers do they
0:17:04 have
0:17:05 I mean because you've seen I don't know
0:17:07 the specific numbers of each member of
0:17:09 the pack but there were about a dozen
0:17:10 packs so I I don't know Johnny what's
0:17:13 the average pack size five
0:17:15 ten five to ten so I would say closer to
0:17:18 Ten Ten okay so that's that's like 120.
0:17:21 that's gonna be 150 Kindred my rough
0:17:25 ideas probably 200 to 250 vampires uh
0:17:28 it's less now thankfully because of uh
0:17:31 the they will make more abandonment of
0:17:34 the we're looking probably at 200 250
0:17:37 vampires that's that's a wild
0:17:39 overstatement I would imagine sure let's
0:17:40 put but I'm going to plan for that a lot
0:17:44 who do we have that we can call on
0:17:47 we have about 20 ready to fight
0:17:50 minus anybody else we might be able to
0:17:52 start garnering from if we can convince
0:17:55 Amaya and some of her people whatever
0:17:58 wherever weather is sitting nowadays
0:18:00 Also let's consider the fact that if we
0:18:03 have 200 Sabbat coming up from New York
0:18:06 each one of those packs can easily bring
0:18:08 another
0:18:10 five to ten
0:18:12 shovel heads or shlokta or any other
0:18:15 kind of horrible chef
0:18:18 soldiers that they can bring to bear so
0:18:20 if it's 50 packs could easily imagine
0:18:22 there being another 500 that they could
0:18:25 just throw into the meat grinder not to
0:18:28 give hand Dragon any credit but uh the
0:18:31 the times that we've been effective
0:18:33 against The Killing Spree
0:18:35 um
0:18:36 it's when we've sort of done some hit
0:18:38 and run stuff of the 20 or so miles
0:18:42 how many are like a like a strong cotery
0:18:45 like us like a like a group working
0:18:47 together to who we could you know
0:18:49 identify give missions to yeah okay go
0:18:53 take on take this pack out there are no
0:18:56 other coteries in the city yeah you guys
0:18:58 are actually probably the baddest dudes
0:19:01 in town but no question that is what
0:19:04 we're hoping to fix
0:19:06 to some degree we have weapons we have
0:19:09 some time we can start training some of
0:19:11 these people me and Brett have started
0:19:13 working with The Toreador of of those
0:19:16 20. if
0:19:18 if someone was to come along and be like
0:19:20 hey come up to Boston it's safer how
0:19:21 many would bail immediately I don't know
0:19:23 because Boston is known not to be safer
0:19:25 but if it's behind where we are on a
0:19:28 front on just what I'm I just yeah but
0:19:30 they don't have to stop at Boston it's
0:19:33 hard to travel but a Madman running a
0:19:35 city that will kill people willy-nilly
0:19:37 is still not terribly safer I mean if
0:19:38 they go too far north also they're gonna
0:19:41 hit all of the dark Selena stuff do they
0:19:44 know that
0:19:45 no I don't think anyone knows that
0:19:47 currently we need to build their
0:19:50 confidence morale and that means having
0:19:52 wins against them I'm not cloning myself
0:19:55 so here hundreds of wins full of claws
0:19:59 you don't want that here's here's what
0:20:01 I'm willing to live with it wind gives
0:20:03 him like okay okay
0:20:07 a couple of points I think we should
0:20:08 keep in mind
0:20:10 I think if we just try if we sit on our
0:20:12 heels and allow them to invade the city
0:20:16 we're going to lose
0:20:19 the what they're gonna hopefully try to
0:20:22 do is find us gathered together and hit
0:20:26 that with overwhelming Force I don't
0:20:28 think they even if they bring twice what
0:20:31 I imagined in shovelheads and goons they
0:20:34 can't possibly have enough numbers to
0:20:37 completely pin down the city and escape
0:20:38 and stop people from escaping my unders
0:20:41 but standing I think that many vampires
0:20:45 it'll only take them a couple of nights
0:20:48 to hunt down and kill those in the city
0:20:51 who are holding out it'll be a lot of
0:20:53 small little skirmishes and battles and
0:20:55 by the by the end of less than a week
0:20:57 New Haven will be theirs my
0:21:00 understanding is that they let all of
0:21:02 those shovelheads and lesser packs run
0:21:05 rampant to force the vampires to run to
0:21:11 gather together to go towards their
0:21:12 elders and that's when their specialty
0:21:15 packs their special forces or whatever
0:21:19 they're called do I know anyone remember
0:21:21 that yeah you know what they're called
0:21:22 yeah the the black hand will go after
0:21:25 the hard targets harder targets yeah the
0:21:29 black hand will be set in to go after
0:21:31 their the hardest Targets in the city
0:21:33 Johnny kind of gives you a look up and
0:21:36 down yeah they will be coming after me
0:21:38 and us us
0:21:40 me that that leaves us sort of two
0:21:43 options in my head
0:21:45 um if we're not going to leave the city
0:21:47 which he looks over Roberta and then
0:21:50 kind of looks back
0:21:51 if we're not going to leave
0:21:53 which
0:21:54 you know there are people that live in
0:21:56 this city right
0:21:59 um and I've seen what they do in a
0:22:00 Sabbat City uh but so two options uh if
0:22:04 we know they're gonna be coming for you
0:22:05 miles
0:22:06 either
0:22:07 we hide you somewhere they're gonna I
0:22:11 mean they're gonna find you if I can
0:22:12 find you that anybody can find you right
0:22:13 there's no but continue but we we move
0:22:16 you around constantly and keep doing
0:22:18 little hit and runs or we have a lot of
0:22:20 time to set up and fortify The Haven and
0:22:24 then we just stand in a place of
0:22:26 strength eventually I mean I I still
0:22:28 think we should do hit and runs but we
0:22:31 know we escalate I think we're
0:22:32 overlooking something we have that I'm
0:22:35 pretty sure this Sabbat does not and
0:22:38 that is influence over mortal Society
0:22:40 we can make it harder for them to get to
0:22:43 us don't ask me how human people work in
0:22:46 their influences and their wind nailed
0:22:48 it on the head actually
0:22:49 I think there is another option we can
0:22:52 we should consider because we can
0:22:55 potentially influence mortal Society we
0:22:58 can make it very difficult for them to
0:23:01 come up the Metro north 95 Corridor
0:23:05 because truthfully I doubt they're
0:23:07 taking ferries from uh from Long Island
0:23:10 into Connecticut I think most of those
0:23:13 packs are going to be Crossing on foot
0:23:16 up 95. there are limited ways that you
0:23:20 can actually travel that that path
0:23:22 between New York and New Haven we have
0:23:24 met a little bit of the bottleneck and
0:23:26 how many ports are there for them to
0:23:28 come into along the Connecticut Coast
0:23:30 limited that's a great question like
0:23:33 part of the reason Johnny that we we
0:23:35 always have you travel is you know the
0:23:37 byways so that you don't accidentally
0:23:39 step in the wrong place and get ripped
0:23:40 apart by lupines or something how do
0:23:43 they how do they support numbers get
0:23:45 around that it is one of the problems of
0:23:47 the Sabbat is they have they do have to
0:23:49 stick to Major routes and they do
0:23:52 usually have small groups of retainers
0:23:55 that can help travel them around in box
0:23:58 trucks things like that now my point is
0:24:01 like win was saying if we can get Mortal
0:24:05 authorities to help us tighten those
0:24:08 travel routes make it difficult
0:24:11 difficult for them to come up what we
0:24:13 can do is actually leave New Haven and
0:24:16 start spearheading down towards where
0:24:19 they're coming from it will
0:24:20 simultaneously keep you on the Move
0:24:22 meaning that the prince is not in one
0:24:24 location that they can go after and we
0:24:26 just start taking out packs one at a
0:24:28 time King of the hell style because one
0:24:30 camarine uh group versus one Sabbat pack
0:24:33 that's a fight we can win the second we
0:24:36 put ourselves on our heels and we start
0:24:39 trying to defend uh hard targets and
0:24:41 locations they're going to overwhelm us
0:24:44 I think we also need to start looking
0:24:45 into specific Sabbat tactics like at the
0:24:49 donkeys Johnny like there was not a
0:24:51 whole lot I could do about those Shadow
0:24:53 plays unfortunately there's not a lot we
0:24:55 can do about those Shadow plays okay so
0:24:57 maybe we need to test so we need to
0:24:58 figure out how to preempt them well the
0:25:01 big thing seems to be distance yeah they
0:25:03 didn't seem to move too much
0:25:05 um I don't really understand exactly
0:25:07 what the range is but if we can put an
0:25:10 emphasis on guns and range and well I
0:25:13 mean I was trying to learn
0:25:15 um miles I was actually hoping you could
0:25:17 pick me up a bow I mean easy enough
0:25:20 silent way so that we could sneak like
0:25:23 they can there's probably a way to
0:25:25 replicate this in a more meaningful and
0:25:28 modern way but there was such a thing as
0:25:31 a repeating crossbow in the Medieval
0:25:33 ages I was thinking maybe a composite
0:25:36 bow that'll fly further but you'll have
0:25:38 more shots with a composite so if we get
0:25:40 a few so she's so fast that she is so
0:25:43 fast not everyone is as fast as her true
0:25:46 but I'm not picking up a bow you know
0:25:49 you should have one just in case man
0:25:51 staking is difficult but guns are easy
0:25:54 to do yeah but holding someone to the
0:25:56 floor is yeah there's there's active
0:25:58 there's thoughts there I mean hunting
0:26:01 them is effective if they do not come in
0:26:05 with all the confidence they have
0:26:07 normally they will not be as effective
0:26:10 so if they fear this city to some degree
0:26:13 Here's my thought
0:26:15 if we can assemble five groups
0:26:18 just five
0:26:20 those can be five strike teams that can
0:26:23 be trying to rapidly hit these smaller
0:26:26 groups of Sabbat on their way to New
0:26:28 Haven
0:26:29 if we can leave it so it's just down to
0:26:33 the black hand packs that's a protracted
0:26:35 fight that we might be able to survive
0:26:38 for some time while Pendragon and Peter
0:26:42 Zune do what they need to do in New York
0:26:44 because the only reason the black hand
0:26:46 will be able to locate anybody in New
0:26:48 Haven is because we won't have the means
0:26:50 to transport around with those smaller
0:26:53 packs running rampant we also have the
0:26:56 children of Hakeem who have said they
0:26:58 are good at intelligence and I don't
0:27:00 crafter and maybe they can give us some
0:27:03 more edges against these folks partisan
0:27:06 researchers but they could at least look
0:27:08 there's a there's a place for that here
0:27:10 I really don't think that you're going
0:27:13 to get Pendragon up to New York City
0:27:15 well we have to try we don't actually
0:27:19 no
0:27:20 I mean if
0:27:22 if we were to ask him to bring his army
0:27:24 anywhere why wouldn't we try to get him
0:27:27 to bring his army here
0:27:30 because this is not the big fight that
0:27:33 matters it is to us we don't matter
0:27:36 there is a victory condition for us the
0:27:39 victory condition is breaking the
0:27:41 leadership of this Crusade because the
0:27:43 Sabbat will fall apart without that
0:27:45 leadership
0:27:46 and if the thing under New York Rises it
0:27:49 doesn't matter if we keep our home it
0:27:51 will be destroyed in the coming nights
0:27:52 after that anyway
0:27:54 well
0:27:56 I I see I see what Brit is saying but
0:28:00 but I get it but that that to to
0:28:03 Johnny's point I don't think we can
0:28:06 if I'm understanding the consensus at
0:28:08 the table here uh we can't survive a
0:28:10 protracted Crusade for indefinitely
0:28:14 the Sabbat in the past were always just
0:28:17 a few scattered weirdo packs and they
0:28:18 were a problem
0:28:20 but they could be Stamped Out it's the
0:28:22 Crusade that is threatening everyone
0:28:24 and to stop the Crusade it's the vicos
0:28:26 right and it's it's it's the Cardinal
0:28:29 Polonia yeah
0:28:30 so that that would be who
0:28:32 who Pendragon and his army went after
0:28:36 they would be serving as the chaff for
0:28:39 Yom Peterson to make the strike the
0:28:42 black hand intends on on New Haven
0:28:43 Polonius the same tactic we'd just be
0:28:45 using it against them to be in Polonius
0:28:48 Polonia is going to be in New York that
0:28:51 much we basically know he was waiting he
0:28:53 was conducting everything from there
0:28:54 that's where so in order to get Polonia
0:28:58 that's in New York otherwise I mean if
0:29:01 they just keep Mass embracing New York
0:29:02 is huge and at some point even if the
0:29:05 eldest Rises or the dragon Rises or
0:29:07 doesn't they're just going to keep
0:29:08 sending guys after us is that does that
0:29:10 that does that make sense I I don't know
0:29:12 they can only
0:29:14 they will still need to deal with
0:29:15 Mortals at a certain point too there's a
0:29:17 point where they they'll start using
0:29:20 much larger bombs if it becomes that
0:29:22 much of an issue so they can only go so
0:29:25 far sure but New York is so much bigger
0:29:27 than New Haven I understand but taking
0:29:29 out their leadership would probably
0:29:31 styming them do you know how many packs
0:29:33 of black hand are on the way up here I
0:29:35 don't I know you're sire is here right
0:29:39 or coming here or whatever you know he's
0:29:41 likely here delgado's already in town
0:29:44 yeah he was that that actually was going
0:29:46 to bring me back to um so we need a
0:29:48 moral win right and we need to deal with
0:29:51 the people
0:29:52 if we're going to be sending people out
0:29:54 to try and stop the Sabbat packs from
0:29:55 getting here already
0:29:57 there is still a Saba pack that's here
0:30:01 right like some of the members of The
0:30:02 Killing Spree went down to New York
0:30:04 Carmen and Delgado but if Delgado is
0:30:06 back here that means Carmen is probably
0:30:08 back here too that means all the Killing
0:30:09 Spree is here
0:30:11 they
0:30:12 need to go
0:30:14 before any of this happens right I think
0:30:17 it would also hurt them it seems like
0:30:18 Delgado is in charge I think you're
0:30:20 right that would be a moral victory for
0:30:23 us not being said but we also owe them
0:30:26 it would be a moral victory for them if
0:30:28 they took us out
0:30:29 boy if they took us out then they they
0:30:31 already won right that's it so it's more
0:30:35 than a moral Victory that's a practical
0:30:36 victory yeah so so I do have a message
0:30:41 out hoping to hear back
0:30:43 on it we could be getting some
0:30:45 reinforcements be nice but about
0:30:48 speaking which
0:30:49 um bruh right or is that what isn't
0:30:52 there Rave coming isn't that what the
0:30:54 Rave was about the Rave should be
0:30:55 happening tomorrow night
0:30:57 um is gonna we need Johnny you're
0:31:01 bringing miles is that I have no idea
0:31:03 who I was bringing miles you want to be
0:31:05 my date
0:31:06 not when you put it like that but I
0:31:09 would go with you yes well Shooks looks
0:31:12 like I'm already taken still looks a
0:31:14 little crestfall I'm like [ __ ] there
0:31:15 goes the easy answer
0:31:16 Greta goes conspicuously quiet and just
0:31:20 is kind of fiddling with her nail polish
0:31:24 um this I I had another idea I guess for
0:31:29 Johnny is it okay to ask a bruja to
0:31:32 bring you or do they have to come seek
0:31:33 you out and because I don't know what
0:31:35 the etiquette is do you feel brave
0:31:37 enough to ask a bruja to take you there
0:31:39 well we're all going right so I guess
0:31:41 I'm gonna have to I don't well then I
0:31:44 guess you had your answer I don't really
0:31:45 I as I wanted to skip this one too bad
0:31:49 you're coming no I I don't think it's a
0:31:51 good idea I think it's I think it's a
0:31:53 good idea but the cotery is working
0:31:55 together what is it you are worried
0:31:57 about can you guys stop talking in
0:31:59 unison yeah sure
0:32:01 sorry
0:32:03 I don't think it's a good idea for me to
0:32:05 go and I don't think I'd be helpful
0:32:07 there so I just want to say with Eden
0:32:10 and make sure that everything's locked
0:32:12 down at home Brita
0:32:15 I'm gonna try and be as gentle as I can
0:32:17 when I say this
0:32:18 which I realize is probably not gonna be
0:32:20 gentle at all wind kind of rolls up her
0:32:22 sleeve in anticipation of his gentleness
0:32:24 you got the piss and the spine knocked
0:32:26 out of you when we fought that dragon
0:32:28 and you need to find that rapidly again
0:32:31 because you are not useless you're very
0:32:35 [ __ ] useful you are an integral
0:32:37 member of this cotery and we need you at
0:32:40 our side when we're conducting this Rave
0:32:42 so I need you to reach deep down inside
0:32:44 you find the spine that I know you
0:32:46 [ __ ] have and start acting like the
0:32:49 Brita that I remember
0:32:50 I think I would make it worse I've
0:32:52 already made things worse why do you
0:32:54 think you would make it work with a
0:32:56 phone call what phone call don't worry
0:32:58 about it well no it seems relevant to
0:33:00 the conversation right now this is not
0:33:02 an officer of Elysium office talk what
0:33:06 we're not talking about this in Elysium
0:33:08 I'm not interesting about Elysium stuff
0:33:10 I'm just saying it's
0:33:12 personal we're going to talk about it at
0:33:14 home if Brita wants to talk about it but
0:33:16 nobody's listening right now and
0:33:18 apparently Eden's at home double check
0:33:19 Neil looks around you don't see anything
0:33:22 it's just us
0:33:25 and that she says pointing to the
0:33:27 painting well the painting's not
0:33:29 listening this isn't Ghostbusters 2.
0:33:31 okay it's not just just that I really
0:33:34 didn't get that apology outright it's
0:33:39 it's I don't think
0:33:41 thankful as an influence there but it's
0:33:43 also that every single time that we
0:33:46 interact with the bruja as a whole and I
0:33:48 mean as a whole because of course
0:33:49 there's Johnny and there's a Maya and
0:33:50 there's weathers and there's Jane
0:33:52 there's plenty of good brouha that we've
0:33:54 met but a lot of the bruja that we've
0:33:55 met have been
0:33:57 Shaw's guys or guys under Longbow and
0:34:00 the same guys that Shaw wanted to
0:34:03 make me a friend for
0:34:06 and the same guys who are running away
0:34:08 when there's a werewolf or just
0:34:12 Britta you're not a liability
0:34:14 what's the weapons policy at a rave oh
0:34:17 plenty of them okay
0:34:18 um it would it be socially acceptable
0:34:20 for Brenda to bring a handgun and shoot
0:34:22 somebody who gets fresh oh absolutely in
0:34:24 fact I hope you shoot somebody to get
0:34:26 fresh with you I don't know last time
0:34:27 someone got fresh with me I tossed him
0:34:29 off the roof I said that almost as a
0:34:30 joke but the more I'm thinking about it
0:34:31 the more I'm like actually I think I
0:34:33 might actually you threw somebody off a
0:34:34 roof oh yeah you got Lippy with me so
0:34:36 that's just like bruja stuff so like if
0:34:38 somebody guesses like throw a punch yeah
0:34:41 throw a punch you will injure yourself
0:34:42 don't you dare throw or better or better
0:34:46 yeah you look you're going in a Baby
0:34:47 Bjorn better yet you look at their brain
0:34:49 and you make it tingle and Fry and let
0:34:52 them run out of the uh out of the place
0:34:53 never to be seen again so this is like
0:34:55 not Elysium rules at all oh no Rave this
0:34:57 is the [ __ ] Wild West is that make
0:34:59 you feel better brother no no it doesn't
0:35:01 make me feel better what part of that
0:35:03 was gonna make her feel bad oh she gets
0:35:05 to shoot somebody I mean I feel fresh is
0:35:07 that just because you get to bring your
0:35:08 sword yes
0:35:10 oh
0:35:12 look you rattled off a whole bunch of
0:35:14 bruja names of people that are good and
0:35:16 it sounds like Pendragon might have a
0:35:18 little crush on you whether you just
0:35:19 whether you want to acknowledge it or
0:35:21 not I and plenty of those shipback bruja
0:35:23 what you said is just that they're
0:35:25 willing to switch allegiances at the
0:35:26 drop of a hat so what you need to do is
0:35:28 turn on your charm and get them to
0:35:30 [ __ ] switch allegiances to you
0:35:31 understood
0:35:33 I don't know who would even take me okay
0:35:37 I mean smile Adam other than Pendragon
0:35:40 it sounds like
0:35:41 honestly don't ask Pendragon Brito we
0:35:44 can talk about it later if you want you
0:35:47 will be safe if you go I'm safe as we
0:35:49 can make you I'm feeling left out by
0:35:51 girl talk here like I hate not knowing
0:35:53 the context that's kind of the point
0:35:54 that it's up to her to talk to to talk
0:35:57 about logical problems I'm not airing
0:36:00 anyone's laundry except my own that's
0:36:02 fair
0:36:04 miles dude
0:36:05 [Laughter]
0:36:09 I am not currently airing anyone's dirty
0:36:11 laundry but my own
0:36:14 no I don't think that they're gonna
0:36:16 wanna go with me because I was just at a
0:36:19 Gala really publicly with pendragons so
0:36:21 they might be they might not want to
0:36:23 press that button and then I don't
0:36:25 why don't you ask Pendragon to take you
0:36:27 to this no I why don't I Pendragon to
0:36:31 take me to the
0:36:36 [Music]
0:36:37 I think that's gonna work out really
0:36:39 well well you don't know until
0:36:42 I don't know Johnny I don't want a
0:36:44 stereotype here your clan but like I
0:36:47 feel like any bruja worth his salt would
0:36:49 see that like some guy like Pendragon
0:36:51 like put his little [ __ ] stamp on you
0:36:53 and then was like that's a challenge I'm
0:36:55 gonna ask her to go pretty it gives Neil
0:36:58 a look
0:37:01 I mean to be perfectly honest I'm
0:37:03 surprised it hasn't happened already
0:37:04 yeah right so that isn't that what
0:37:06 what'd I say he's like looking back
0:37:08 miles is also looking at you after a
0:37:10 little stamp
0:37:11 what what did I say it's the way you
0:37:13 said it again pulls a joint out of her
0:37:16 pocket I said what just guys can we let
0:37:19 Brita choose how she comes to this with
0:37:22 the understanding well no because she
0:37:24 said she's choosing not to come so I
0:37:26 said we let her choose the terms under
0:37:28 which she comes okay Britta how do you
0:37:31 want to come I like mouth stuff
0:37:37 looking at when anneal in the way that a
0:37:40 little sister looks at like
0:37:43 parents or uncles or aunts when they're
0:37:46 talking about sex at Thanksgiving but
0:37:48 she tries to pull herself back together
0:37:50 and honestly it's not that hard because
0:37:51 she is hyper focusing on the issue at
0:37:54 hand like the distraction that the two
0:37:55 of them pose is not bigger than the
0:37:58 stress of what is happening
0:38:00 she tries to pull a sentence together
0:38:02 what comes out first says
0:38:05 when I think you should probably go with
0:38:08 weathers I mean he's usually really nice
0:38:11 to you
0:38:12 Brita
0:38:13 we're gonna need weathers to get people
0:38:16 on our side and you're good at the
0:38:18 weathers we'll be there because he's
0:38:19 bruja he will take
0:38:22 someone he feels like he wants to take
0:38:24 to be fair when you you could ask him to
0:38:27 take you because you need a date to this
0:38:29 thing as much as anybody need is a
0:38:31 strong word but we have to go I know I
0:38:33 need a plus one but all right
0:38:36 here's the thing Brita we need you there
0:38:39 because
0:38:41 and this Bears repeating we need you and
0:38:44 we want you with us
0:38:46 whatever happened to you during that
0:38:50 dragon fight
0:38:51 you're still you
0:38:53 and you still have it in you to be
0:38:56 tough I'm sorry I know I'm scared of
0:38:59 everything and I know I keep on Brita
0:39:02 I've been feeling this way a long time
0:39:03 before the dragon stuff even happened
0:39:05 and it just made it worse Alberta you
0:39:08 are also Brave
0:39:10 bravery is being afraid and doing what
0:39:12 needs to be done anyway
0:39:15 um and I am not going to force you to
0:39:17 ask Pendragon to take you anywhere
0:39:20 he'll likely be there because it's a
0:39:23 bruja [ __ ] thing
0:39:24 but
0:39:25 I will
0:39:27 whatever it takes to get you there
0:39:30 I will do I have an idea I want you all
0:39:32 to hear me out
0:39:34 miles
0:39:35 I think you should ask Amaya to take you
0:39:38 there I think it would go a long way
0:39:40 going to the baron and asking her
0:39:43 permission to take you along
0:39:45 I think that would do a good job of
0:39:48 ingratiating some of the anarchs to your
0:39:51 domain
0:39:52 when I think you should ask weathers to
0:39:55 take you because you are the new sheriff
0:39:57 and having the old Sheriff bring you
0:39:59 along would also look good uh for you
0:40:01 coming along
0:40:03 Neil I think you should ask Jane to take
0:40:05 you
0:40:07 she actually thinks you're not that bad
0:40:08 of a guy so
0:40:10 okay sure yeah I'm pretty sure that's
0:40:14 that's fine Britta I'll have you be my
0:40:17 plus one would you please come to the
0:40:19 Rave with me
0:40:20 Broda kind of like blanks away the tears
0:40:22 that were threatening to come in and
0:40:24 tries to straighten up and looks at
0:40:26 Johnny and manages a couple knots I'm
0:40:29 probably gonna need you to do my makeup
0:40:31 yeah I
0:40:33 um Johnny I'll I'll come with you and
0:40:36 when when I can I can do that
0:40:39 how do people dress for this Johnny well
0:40:42 it's actually going to be at the golf
0:40:44 club haven oh I think you and I met
0:40:47 there once upon a time
0:40:48 yeah
0:40:49 so
0:40:51 dress appropriate maybe a little bit
0:40:52 less dirt than the last time we were
0:40:54 there he kind of gives you a half smile
0:40:56 hoping his joke lands brother tries to
0:40:59 smile for the dad joke she's halfway
0:41:02 successful
0:41:04 how dare you try to intrude on my vibe
0:41:06 Johnny
0:41:07 what vibe is that dirt
0:41:09 [Laughter]
0:41:12 aesthetic as the kids call it I
0:41:15 apologize I will step away from your
0:41:16 your domain that's all I ask man
0:41:19 um I'm not gonna be able to get it done
0:41:21 before tomorrow night but I think having
0:41:24 had a couple of talks with the children
0:41:27 of Hakeem and I I think I have a an
0:41:29 Avenue towards the side effects miles
0:41:33 and and Brita for
0:41:35 uh the the
0:41:37 Dragon that'd be wonderful I I can't it
0:41:40 it's gonna take some a little time and
0:41:41 we need another Bowl
0:41:43 but I I think I can we'll try it I just
0:41:47 I'm sorry I can't do it before tomorrow
0:41:48 we'll make do it would be nice to feel
0:41:52 better again we'll try it's not my show
0:41:56 so I'm not terribly worried about it
0:41:57 also uh Johnny thank you for um saying
0:42:01 Jane I I don't know why but in my heart
0:42:04 I really thought you were just gonna say
0:42:06 Neil good luck
0:42:08 um I I don't know I just but that's a
0:42:11 nice endorsement man thank you I I
0:42:12 didn't think yeah I'll talk to I don't
0:42:15 have James number could you give me
0:42:16 James number and then I got you buddy
0:42:19 thank you man yeah yeah we want you too
0:42:22 no no it wasn't about me being there I
0:42:24 just I don't know you were deliberately
0:42:26 talking smack about yourself don't be
0:42:27 mean to my friends the dates are not
0:42:30 really my thing even if it's like a
0:42:32 formal I know nothing about what that
0:42:34 might be like I heard you got invited to
0:42:36 a ball recently this one last thing that
0:42:39 I that everyone needs to keep in mind
0:42:42 I know the rate the Rave is a scary
0:42:43 proposition and after the Rave we have
0:42:46 to deal with the Sabbat we're getting
0:42:48 back to the dragon Rising there's still
0:42:51 a piece
0:42:52 of that thing in the city
0:42:55 Hell House
0:42:57 we need to purge that from this city
0:43:00 and when we do
0:43:02 I want to let my daughter take a nice
0:43:04 hard look at it what Johnny that feels
0:43:07 insane no
0:43:09 I trust her
0:43:12 and she's told me that she's been
0:43:14 selected to see Visions for Humanity
0:43:19 that jives with some things Ramirez said
0:43:22 Neil's face just falls into despair for
0:43:26 this girl
0:43:27 and I think
0:43:28 that she can see its weakness does she
0:43:32 have to be fair when it's alive the
0:43:36 house is alive
0:43:38 I don't know
0:43:39 but if we but I imagine if she sees it
0:43:42 she can see its weakness because I'm not
0:43:44 sure we can actually kill it could we I
0:43:48 don't particularly disagree with this
0:43:50 but hell house is jumping into the deep
0:43:52 end with no swimmies on she's pretty
0:43:54 much been in the deep end already but we
0:43:56 don't have to throw to kick her in there
0:43:58 what if what if we instead of starting
0:44:01 at Hell House what if we send her
0:44:04 to my old Haven where the mushrooms are
0:44:06 taking over what if we can get a glimpse
0:44:09 of what maybe a defense would be when
0:44:11 they go to Hell House when what if we
0:44:14 bring her to the other places like that
0:44:16 so she can kind of see like a pattern
0:44:18 like we show her when's Old Haven and
0:44:20 maybe we even bring her to where the
0:44:22 Chantry was and then we bring her I like
0:44:25 this idea but
0:44:27 but her her and the rest of her group
0:44:29 are gonna go wherever they go in full
0:44:32 transparency they're the ones that we're
0:44:34 asking after Fester I guess Ramirez is
0:44:37 pretty good friends with him oh always
0:44:39 Ramirez yeah okay that actually does
0:44:42 make me feel a little bit yeah look
0:44:43 around again Neil looks around again
0:44:45 you're all alone for now it's getting
0:44:48 ominous he shrugs it when
0:44:50 we are getting into some heavy stuff
0:44:52 and with some of the folks that are here
0:44:55 in the city
0:44:56 I'm not leaving anything to doubt
0:44:58 anymore
0:44:59 so it sounds like we
0:45:02 have to prepare to keep her safe and to
0:45:05 face her house again do they want us to
0:45:08 keep them safe or do they just want us I
0:45:10 don't care what they want I'm gonna keep
0:45:11 them safe unfortunately understand that
0:45:13 does Suarez sell sorry you said
0:45:16 unfortunately I said unfortunately I we
0:45:18 are now the best crew to deal with this
0:45:20 kind of thing does Suarez still hate
0:45:23 miles I don't know about miles but it
0:45:25 barely tolerates me I'm used to being
0:45:27 hated it's fine
0:45:29 I um
0:45:31 miles just to be very clear I don't hate
0:45:34 you
0:45:35 well that's good to know okay just I
0:45:37 don't hate anyone here
0:45:39 all right
0:45:40 I think
0:45:42 I think at this rave
0:45:44 we need to be focused on Gathering all
0:45:47 potential allies close to us
0:45:49 it's not going to be easy because it's
0:45:50 gonna be a bruja Rave Johnny a rave is
0:45:53 like the party dancing in music in a
0:45:56 party yeah if sometimes things get Rowdy
0:45:59 though yes I am gonna go with you and
0:46:02 try to help
0:46:03 I'm kind of thinking the most helpful
0:46:05 thing I could do is
0:46:07 party I agree just try to dance with as
0:46:12 many people and
0:46:15 do the Elsa London thing of
0:46:17 making the space vibrant and making
0:46:20 people want to be around us connected to
0:46:23 us liked by us Johnny has a big wide
0:46:27 smile on his face now you're getting a
0:46:30 kid I think she'd be really proud to
0:46:32 have you carrying her torch Britta
0:46:34 Bretta tries again to smile it's not as
0:46:36 successful as Johnny sad jokes but I can
0:46:39 sure as hell tell you that there's no
0:46:40 chance in hell that I'm gonna be able to
0:46:42 do that well you're you're gonna have to
0:46:44 dance with me if you're making me go to
0:46:46 this well I can do that okay I'm just
0:46:50 saying I'm gonna bring the whole mood
0:46:51 down dancing's not mandatory is it it is
0:46:53 in fact Johnny told me earlier
0:46:56 though it's barely dancing again if I
0:46:59 have to do this you guys are dancing
0:47:01 with me that that's that's not really a
0:47:03 hard
0:47:04 then you're grabbing bats and beat with
0:47:06 a song
0:47:07 Neil is very clearly doing like math in
0:47:10 his head now
0:47:11 [Laughter]
0:47:12 but my point being is that after this
0:47:17 Rave we're gonna have to try and deal
0:47:18 with hell house and we're gonna have to
0:47:20 try and if you're all on board with it
0:47:22 we're trying to figure out how to make a
0:47:23 counter-offensive play against the spot
0:47:25 coming towards New Haven the only way
0:47:27 we're gonna do that is we gain some more
0:47:29 allies I was actually just thinking that
0:47:31 same thing Johnny we are the only
0:47:33 effective codery in the city but if we
0:47:36 convince some of the bruja we could
0:47:38 probably pull together at least one more
0:47:40 from from the bruja if we maybe play
0:47:43 nice with vital and some of the other
0:47:45 princes they came up from down South we
0:47:47 might be able to pull out one or two
0:47:48 more coteries from there oh I don't
0:47:50 think we play nice with them I think we
0:47:52 say that you're gonna stand and fight or
0:47:53 you're gonna we're gonna kill you
0:47:54 ourselves hey however you want to play
0:47:56 it I'm just saying I feel like that'll
0:47:58 make them run aren't these where are
0:48:00 they going to go to Prince is really
0:48:01 powerful we shut down all the byways in
0:48:04 and out let's hold off on but trying to
0:48:08 pin the arms behind the princess for now
0:48:10 we need them to be on a knife's edge of
0:48:12 between mean thinking they can take over
0:48:13 and not having another place to go I'm
0:48:15 just counting some numbers here right
0:48:17 potentially we can make the the anarchs
0:48:19 Amaya might be able to pull together a
0:48:21 codery capable of doing something the
0:48:23 set tights if you uh decide to actually
0:48:26 do what you've promised with uh with the
0:48:30 snake girl there we might be able to get
0:48:32 it squeaky uh a passable cotery out of
0:48:34 them to do some strikes if you're gonna
0:48:36 do that let's do that after we fix you
0:48:39 that's potentially five code areas in
0:48:41 addition to us right there I
0:48:43 sent
0:48:45 message to Xavier
0:48:47 I'm hoping that that since he knows
0:48:49 there are people who know it's in New
0:48:50 York and that's the reason he left
0:48:52 because the code the camarilla was
0:48:55 refusing to acknowledge or deal with it
0:48:57 if those five code reads have support
0:48:59 from both the asomites in in the city
0:49:01 and Perhaps Perhaps the premiere and
0:49:04 let's say each one of those coders is
0:49:05 able to put down one of the Lesser packs
0:49:07 every night wow that's I'm also not
0:49:11 betting a whole lot of wager on it but
0:49:14 the Giovanni are in the city
0:49:17 um outside the the Giovanni specifically
0:49:20 when you're a medium and you deal with
0:49:22 the dead I know they're hiding from the
0:49:24 storm but I helped unorthodox do we want
0:49:27 to get here asking for help I want them
0:49:30 to look both ways to check for traffic
0:49:32 and get hit by a submarine that's how
0:49:34 unorthodox I want them to be I don't
0:49:37 think we actually have
0:49:39 any Premiere that can help none we have
0:49:43 one I don't know I mean I know that a
0:49:47 lot didn't survive and um
0:49:50 I I don't really know of any of the
0:49:53 premiere that did survive it's not like
0:49:55 I would recognize them anyway but Rhys
0:49:58 and then I guess we have
0:50:01 you know not that that's really a help
0:50:04 when we can't stake him but question for
0:50:08 Lex the Jamir have been a lot less
0:50:10 around here since the Chantry you have
0:50:13 not seen the trimmer since Rebecca I
0:50:15 figured they have there's a very good
0:50:17 chance to tell mahera annihilated them
0:50:19 here that's not including Reese though
0:50:21 right that is not including Greece who
0:50:23 you also have not seen he's got a new
0:50:25 lordship somewhere Lord of New Hampshire
0:50:27 yeah he got a promotion all right well
0:50:30 don't go to haircut and breakfast
0:50:31 excluding the premiere let's assumed we
0:50:35 can pull together five strike teams
0:50:37 excluding ourselves so that's six teams
0:50:39 if those six if if we can narrow The
0:50:42 Cordon coming from New York to New Haven
0:50:44 and we can hit them as they're on their
0:50:46 way up here and we do that for three
0:50:49 nights in a row and we we all managed to
0:50:52 take out a single pack each night that's
0:50:55 18 packs it's more than this coming
0:50:57 that's a possibility that's uh it was it
0:51:00 was about a dozen but I think it was
0:51:02 like I think it was 13 but it was around
0:51:04 a dozen a dozen packs yeah
0:51:06 all right so that doesn't include the
0:51:08 black hand that's just well hell let's
0:51:11 even pull it back if we're able to do
0:51:12 that a single night take out six uh six
0:51:16 packs that's a half of them I imagine
0:51:18 that a strike like that would probably
0:51:21 even break the morale of the rest of
0:51:22 them maybe we could even get a couple of
0:51:24 them to just say [ __ ] it and abandon the
0:51:27 siege of New Haven leaving us with let's
0:51:30 say five packs that's almost even odds
0:51:33 excluding the black hand but that's only
0:51:35 if they lose
0:51:38 we've been successful in surviving the
0:51:41 support but I mean not to be
0:51:42 narcissistic but I don't know if that's
0:51:45 that's fair to help or expect that
0:51:48 others would I guarantee you this plan
0:51:50 is going to fall apart the first night
0:51:52 I'm just saying there is a way in which
0:51:56 we can stem the tide by being on the
0:51:59 offensive I agree with that I don't
0:52:01 necessarily know if that plan will work
0:52:03 because operation Security will be
0:52:05 difficult with that many people but we
0:52:07 can especially between when and Johnny
0:52:09 start training these people up put them
0:52:11 in situations where they start getting
0:52:13 sharp like we did we've kept getting in
0:52:15 fights if we can figure out
0:52:17 what each assuming we can make these
0:52:20 code erasers assuming you're going to
0:52:21 help them to get this together if we can
0:52:23 figure out what the strengths and
0:52:24 weaknesses of the strike teams are
0:52:26 Johnny I I don't know if you would
0:52:27 recognize Pack names they seem to come
0:52:29 and go so much but I have the list if
0:52:32 you want to like try and match Target to
0:52:33 Target I can take a look but that's
0:52:35 that's going to be some logistic work
0:52:37 that we're gonna have to do in these
0:52:38 coming nights okay
0:52:40 I'm just saying we we need to get more
0:52:42 fighting people that is the first step
0:52:44 if we can just get five groups together
0:52:47 from all the Allies in the city hell
0:52:49 let's let's get four plus us that's that
0:52:51 makes five five strike teams on the
0:52:54 offensive we can at least blunt the nose
0:52:56 of this Sabbat Invasion before they get
0:52:58 here if we can do that I think we have a
0:53:01 Fighting Chance of surviving in New
0:53:02 Haven okay britta's turn whoa oh thank
0:53:05 you I I was just wondering if Neil could
0:53:07 figure out how to do the blood jar thing
0:53:10 what blood like there were in the
0:53:12 Chantry like like the said I'd said the
0:53:15 tramir had a method my my people had a
0:53:18 method too there must be some
0:53:20 Universal way or magic or something I
0:53:24 was if I was going to learn something
0:53:25 like that it would it would come from
0:53:26 the children of Hakeem I've been doing
0:53:29 my best to learn stuff on my own but
0:53:31 that that but that's a question that
0:53:32 could be posed to maybe some of the
0:53:34 viziers that have arrived that would be
0:53:36 a huge source of support if they're
0:53:38 willing to start doing that for us
0:53:39 brother well specifically if we if we
0:53:42 want to have strike teams right and we
0:53:44 need these strike teams to be full up
0:53:46 every time they're fighting without
0:53:48 tearing into civilians yes and they need
0:53:51 to be able to do it quickly and they
0:53:52 need to be able to do it readily I can
0:53:54 do it for myself but it's my blood so I
0:53:57 wouldn't give that to anyone else
0:53:58 question
0:54:00 do we have like do we have like a census
0:54:03 of how many ghouls are in the city no we
0:54:07 have a general idea but they're not
0:54:08 required to be because that would be a
0:54:11 huge resource if they can act during the
0:54:13 day that'd be part of putting the Cordon
0:54:15 on the on the root coming up from New
0:54:17 York to New Haven for sure we have some
0:54:19 there is some security forces that we
0:54:23 can hire to some degree but if if we can
0:54:26 only fight these guys at night we need
0:54:28 to figure out a way to fight them during
0:54:29 the daytime too finding that might be
0:54:31 also a problem they are aware of their
0:54:32 biggest weakness when you've mentioned
0:54:34 that you could like sleep in the ground
0:54:36 yep can we maybe map out like big parks
0:54:41 or I don't really know like like big I
0:54:45 don't know how gang girl would travel
0:54:46 like that but if there's like big places
0:54:48 where they could all do that on the way
0:54:51 here we can try and find suitable places
0:54:54 that would be a good spot for them if we
0:54:57 know they're coming also I know a lot of
0:54:59 times the Sabbat have lost that uh Power
0:55:04 of blood I traded it in favor of things
0:55:07 more brutal they are invisible chainsaws
0:55:10 they are more glass cannons than
0:55:14 makes sense I have one last point that I
0:55:19 do want to warn you all about
0:55:21 a bruja Rave
0:55:23 um
0:55:24 technically
0:55:26 an event that goes beyond sect
0:55:30 oh yeah because the anarchs are going to
0:55:32 be there right I don't know if he's got
0:55:35 the cojones to show up but there is a
0:55:37 chance Delgado might come and I'm
0:55:39 assuming it's a it's a no-go on a like
0:55:43 if he's there he's under the rules of
0:55:45 the Rave or I don't what's the well it's
0:55:46 not Elysium so
0:55:49 the generally speaking he's allowed to
0:55:52 be there shouldn't that mean we should
0:55:55 expect that they're gonna try to get us
0:55:56 at some point well no I'm just I'm
0:55:59 pointing out that he might show up I
0:56:02 don't think that he would necessarily
0:56:03 break bruja accustomed to jump it with
0:56:07 the rest of his pack and to be perfectly
0:56:09 honest I think if they did they would
0:56:10 probably not be leaving but he might
0:56:14 show up but he might show up regardless
0:56:15 and with a plus one with a plus one
0:56:19 and I just want to warn you that that
0:56:21 might be something that happens I don't
0:56:23 know how that would play out for anyone
0:56:26 how does that work I mean the camarilla
0:56:30 basically doesn't even tolerate
0:56:32 mentioning the spot would we be supposed
0:56:35 to talk to them Rave stays at a rave
0:56:39 okay
0:56:41 this is a gray area that I'm not
0:56:43 entirely sure of how to navigate I would
0:56:48 talk to weathers about that that sounds
0:56:50 like a good idea if he shows up I don't
0:56:52 think he'd be jumping to violence
0:56:53 immediately so I'd recommend that none
0:56:55 of you jump to violence either yeah he's
0:56:58 probably going to be there too not a
0:56:59 problem recruit he might be looking for
0:57:02 people to actually jump ship it's very
0:57:04 true
0:57:05 so then it's just a contest of Wills
0:57:07 social Gathering speeches of yeah that's
0:57:10 what I said the race will be a good time
0:57:12 to take a temperature on what everyone's
0:57:15 gonna do in these coming nights so
0:57:17 that's tomorrow then huh yeah I guess we
0:57:20 have some phone calls to make except for
0:57:22 Johnny and Britta hey miles can you get
0:57:24 me a pair of these
0:57:25 he pulls out like a thing
0:57:28 page it's just a picture of like brown
0:57:31 boots with they go a little further
0:57:33 upper leg than the bond than the Doc
0:57:35 Martens did but they also have like
0:57:37 spiked gold caps on the tips of the toes
0:57:40 when do you want this to be the time I
0:57:43 dress you or do you that's up to you
0:57:46 speaking of which I actually have to go
0:57:49 off and get myself a new jacket because
0:57:50 mine's no longer in commission oh yeah
0:57:53 me too he says holding his Blazer still
0:57:56 where's your jacket you talking about
0:57:57 the one that Johnny gave you I mean it's
0:57:59 it's fine clearly not fine
0:58:03 you have to tell me about how much stuff
0:58:06 can mean
0:58:07 where'd it go where is it
0:58:09 um any of the gear that I had when we
0:58:12 took out the Abbott is pretty much gone
0:58:13 so
0:58:14 what happened to it was it destroyed
0:58:16 some of it and then others of it it's

0:58:32 world would you want it back

0:58:38 honestly it just reminded me of
0:58:42 you guys
0:58:43 accepting me so yes so the answer is yes
0:58:46 Neil noted if you creep up to new hit to
0:58:49 Hartford I'm not and you get that jacket
0:58:52 and you leave us again I'm not going
0:58:55 anywhere please don't go I it's not

0:59:01 to I'm not breaking someone's domain
0:59:03 that would be crazy uh yes clearly
0:59:06 outside of the boundaries of what you're
0:59:07 willing to do yeah exactly I'm just I
0:59:11 was just asking questions about a jacket
0:59:12 that's all uh I am not kidding about the
0:59:14 Baby Bjorn I got
0:59:18 my legs would just drag on the floor I
0:59:21 would hold them I would swing them at
0:59:23 people I would hit a dude with another
0:59:25 dude
0:59:30 [Music]
0:59:32 surrounding the goth club Haven is a sea
0:59:36 of poorly parked cars
0:59:38 everywhere
0:59:39 outside Audible for blocks as the thrum
0:59:43 of music
0:59:45 at the entrances are clouds of smoke as
0:59:48 bruja gathers smoked cigarettes and
0:59:50 [ __ ] about things that they hate
0:59:54 miles you and Amaya arrive first out of
0:59:57 the quartering
0:59:59 what are you wearing I am wearing a long
1:00:02 dark blue trench coat over a a black
1:00:06 button-up shirt with black pants and
1:00:09 knee-high black boots carrying my Katana
1:00:12 and I have spiked my hair for this
1:00:14 occasion
1:00:15 the trench coat leather or some other
1:00:17 leather Amaya joins you wearing baggy
1:00:20 jeans huge boots
1:00:23 and a hot pink thong that rides up on
1:00:26 the side of her hips a mid-drift shirt
1:00:29 and a jacket with like a fur collar that
1:00:32 comes up around her shoulders and cut
1:00:34 sleeves so you can kind of see the
1:00:36 definition of her arms
1:00:37 she walks with you and a super [ __ ]
1:00:41 tall bruja dude that's like six foot
1:00:44 eight bald with a neck wider than his
1:00:47 head raises his hand and she chops up
1:00:51 and easily gives the dude a high five
1:00:53 one is not offered to you that's fair
1:00:57 the boys call her Amaya and they're all
1:01:01 thrilled to see her and she waves to
1:01:03 them like she's the Superstar who runs
1:01:05 this town noticing that they don't greet
1:01:07 you the same way she puts an arm around
1:01:09 your waist and pulls you inside along
1:01:11 with her
1:01:13 I'll play along with this that sounds
1:01:15 fun
1:01:16 oh how terrible oh no
1:01:20 I'm the boy toy
1:01:23 that's correct people
1:01:27 inside you could see a DJ who's wearing
1:01:31 a helmet that has
1:01:33 flashlights so bright they're like
1:01:36 [ __ ] high beams and he Bobs his head
1:01:39 up and down mixing crazy [ __ ] tracks
1:01:42 how do you feel about that music
1:01:45 producer
1:01:46 that's not great is he doing it well
1:01:49 amazingly it's still that great miles is
1:01:52 on record in one of these episodes about
1:01:54 his feelings about DJs it's not great
1:01:57 but I'm pretty sure I could eat him dude
1:01:59 grabs the mic drop the prince
1:02:02 and The Crowd Goes Wild the vast
1:02:05 majority of this isn't just
1:02:08 like a good chunk at least
1:02:11 but once you're in and you're
1:02:13 socializing someone walks by they offer
1:02:17 a blunt to his grace
1:02:19 do you accept yeah I guess they like
1:02:22 that [ __ ] for you Zippo gets awfully
1:02:25 close courage check
1:02:29 sweating willpower your difficulty or
1:02:32 Grace is for I'm still spending a
1:02:34 willpower
1:02:36 one success two successes you don't
1:02:39 Flinch they seem impressed by this
1:02:42 I'm just living it up I'm kind of just
1:02:44 going with the flow on this this is not
1:02:46 my Soiree so
1:02:53 oh I love miles I'm just kind of uh just
1:02:58 mingling mostly waiting to see how this
1:03:01 starts playing out and once the everyone
1:03:03 arrives oh my is quick unlike a fish in
1:03:07 water she finds drinks passes you a
1:03:10 glass of wine not so that you can drink
1:03:12 it so you can swirl it around as you Bob
1:03:14 your head to the music of course
1:03:16 why would I do anything else
1:03:19 this is definitely different so and you
1:03:21 begin to mingle
1:03:23 some of the questions challenge your
1:03:25 Authority many of the questions are
1:03:28 ignorant and it's irritatingly dumb
1:03:31 but every now and again you find
1:03:32 yourself actually swept up and engaged
1:03:36 in some really interesting conversation
1:03:39 ranging from music to war to politics to
1:03:42 history
1:03:48 Neil you arrive with Jane she drove she
1:03:51 dressed you and told you that as long as
1:03:54 you follow her lead no one's gonna beat
1:03:55 you up if you don't follow your lead her
1:03:58 lead she's gonna let you get your ass
1:04:00 beat
1:04:02 the choice is yours she said this joking
1:04:06 but there was like this light punch at
1:04:08 your shoulder that still hurts
1:04:11 so you're not sure how to take it she
1:04:14 looks to be in relatively good spirits
1:04:16 she offhandedly mentions to you that she
1:04:20 was obligated to show up but agrees that
1:04:23 maybe it's time to reintegrate she
1:04:26 herself is wearing [ __ ] kicking boots
1:04:29 tight jeans that are ripped at the knees
1:04:32 and hang dangerously low on her waist
1:04:36 she's wearing a button-down shirt with
1:04:39 short sleeves like white with a tie that
1:04:41 hangs Loosely around her neck from it
1:04:44 she's got a [ __ ] ton of these Bengals
1:04:47 and spikes and all these little like
1:04:49 distracting pieces of her outfit and
1:04:53 Underneath It All are fishnets
1:04:55 what do you show up to meet her dressed
1:04:58 like
1:05:01 nice polo shirt
1:05:04 Neil is trying his best to follow her
1:05:08 lead like as best as he thinks he can
1:05:12 and knowing that this is like he's done
1:05:15 so much mental math like okay Jane is
1:05:17 really into music just kind of like
1:05:18 miles is a band or whatever and just
1:05:21 goes and goes and goes so he ends up
1:05:22 showing up in those over ripped black
1:05:26 pants that have you know like way too
1:05:28 many zippers and pockets and [ __ ] trips
1:05:31 not the big ones the the like not the
1:05:33 [ __ ] like Janko sized huge ones the
1:05:35 like regular pant size you know what I'm
1:05:37 talking about
1:05:38 black combat boots that look like maybe
1:05:41 one size too big for him like he
1:05:43 couldn't find exactly the right size a
1:05:46 long sleeve red t-shirt but then over
1:05:50 that a black Bauhaus shirt that's been
1:05:53 like cut and then over all of that
1:05:56 because he couldn't quite help himself
1:05:57 he doesn't really know what to do has
1:05:59 one of those sort of like diaphanous
1:06:01 goth mantle cloaks on Neil specifically
1:06:05 it kind of gives sorcerer revives she
1:06:09 approaches you messes the hair a bit
1:06:11 wipes her hand off
1:06:14 and says are you nervous uh
1:06:18 I feel like the socially appropriate
1:06:21 response right now is not if I follow
1:06:23 your lead
1:06:24 ership yes the real answer is absolutely
1:06:26 I'm absolutely wildly nervous that this
1:06:29 kind of thing and especially since we're
1:06:31 gonna do a thing okay and she takes out
1:06:33 a spiked collar put this on uh where
1:06:37 does this go around your neck okay I
1:06:40 need like kind of fiddles with it when
1:06:41 he puts it around his neck okay let's go
1:06:43 is that that's it just just a call okay
1:06:46 and he just follows after her you're
1:06:48 with me can do
1:06:51 and she will drive you to the club
1:06:53 and she Parks alongside a sea of poorly
1:06:57 parked cars and she walks with you
1:07:00 and there's this huge [ __ ] bruh this
1:07:02 dude's like six foot eight bald with a
1:07:06 neck wider than his head and he raises
1:07:09 his hand and she hops up and gives him a
1:07:11 high five and then she says to him he's
1:07:14 with me too
1:07:15 and he's like the diablarist and she's
1:07:19 like yeah
1:07:20 and he's like okay Neil goes to defend
1:07:23 himself and as soon as she says yeah
1:07:25 he's like [ __ ] I'm supposed to follow
1:07:26 her lead she slips her index finger on
1:07:30 the metal loop on your collar and just
1:07:31 kind of pulls you along inside as soon
1:07:33 as we're outside of your shot but like
1:07:36 now we're in a [ __ ] hugely loud club
1:07:37 you'll see me like you know I'm not a
1:07:39 diablarist like like that's not who
1:07:41 gives a [ __ ] he knows okay
1:07:45 it wasn't a real question it doesn't
1:07:47 deserve a real answer
1:07:48 fair enough fair enough fair enough look
1:07:51 there's your Prince Let's Go and she
1:07:53 takes you along with her and starts
1:07:55 heading to meet with Miles and Amaya win
1:08:03 and Escalade arrives to meet you it is
1:08:08 gorgeous black with these gold flecks
1:08:11 and I don't mean gold paint
1:08:12 there's music playing that you can hear
1:08:14 tinted windows a man comes out it's a
1:08:18 weathers he looks very handsome or this
1:08:22 beard perfectly trimmed his hair with
1:08:25 perfect waves he's got his chain on he's
1:08:29 got his jacket on even as he approaches
1:08:32 you you notice he smells amazing
1:08:36 you ready to go when meets him at the
1:08:39 door she's done her hair sort of in a
1:08:43 viking style faux hawk win is wearing a
1:08:47 basically a black crop top that shows
1:08:50 off her sick abs she has some black what
1:08:53 looked like like trousers but she seems
1:08:56 to have punked him up a little bit by
1:08:59 ripping the side seams around the waist
1:09:01 and putting safety pins on either side
1:09:03 and then putting shoelaces through them
1:09:06 so it looks almost like corseted at the
1:09:07 waist and did Miles get her the boots
1:09:10 yet and anything you wanted you got okay
1:09:12 and then the gold spiked tips of her
1:09:15 boots kick out from under the baggy
1:09:17 black pants so then the makeup that
1:09:20 Brita did for a win win's eyes are
1:09:23 rimmed with black black eyeliner and
1:09:27 it's flicked out almost not quite in a
1:09:30 cat eye but it's got this wild sense to
1:09:34 it because it's so dark it's so intense
1:09:37 and it smokes out and your seagull green
1:09:41 eyes look absolutely piercing beneath it
1:09:45 and the way that the black wings well
1:09:48 there's a slight dusting of a gold
1:09:51 matching in tone to your shoes that kind
1:09:54 of like lands on your cheekbones and
1:09:57 shows off how high they are generally a
1:09:59 lot of your makeup apart from that is
1:10:01 complementary to your features kind of
1:10:04 neutral but amped up it's your eyes that
1:10:07 are the biggest biggest Focus
1:10:09 when weather steps out of the car she
1:10:11 gives him kind of an appreciative
1:10:13 whistle uh yeah if you're you're still
1:10:16 on board with taking me why wouldn't I
1:10:19 be he holds a handout she takes it let's
1:10:22 just say I've been shown up for more
1:10:23 than one party
1:10:27 I think you are too
1:10:29 [Music]
1:10:31 and take win
1:10:32 again when you arrive there is a sea of
1:10:36 poorly parked cars waiting for you
1:10:40 he gets out he opens the door for you
1:10:42 tosses his keys to one of the bruja they
1:10:46 used to give him [ __ ] one of Shaw's boys
1:10:49 and he says Park this [ __ ] and the guy
1:10:52 obeys
1:10:54 and he walks with you arm around you
1:10:56 like you are in fact his date and leads
1:11:00 you to the rave
1:11:01 win is very comfortable letting this
1:11:03 happen she kind of weaves her arm around
1:11:05 his waist behind him just yeah we're
1:11:08 here to have a good time when you get to
1:11:10 the club itself there's this big
1:11:11 freaking guy
1:11:13 and he offers whether it's a hug and
1:11:17 weathers gives the man a hug past the
1:11:20 dude on the bank
1:11:21 points to you and says this is when
1:11:23 she's with me and the guy's like you got
1:11:25 it no one gives any fuss whatsoever and
1:11:28 the two of you make your way in
1:11:29 weather's of course holds the door open
1:11:32 for you when gives the guy at the door a
1:11:35 quick chest bump and then walks in with
1:11:37 Weathers
1:11:40 feels like chest bumping a brick wall
1:11:42 there's no give nothing
1:11:47 she gives a lot of respect
1:11:50 you happen to be Stout enough to chest
1:11:53 bump a brick wall if you want to so it
1:11:55 works out just fine
1:12:01 Johnny
1:12:02 Bretta how do you do this
1:12:05 Johnny and berta's arrival is heralded
1:12:08 by the roaring sound of a motorcycle
1:12:12 engine
1:12:13 as they pull up Johnny Parks the old
1:12:17 vintage Indian motorbike that's been
1:12:19 converted out to be a little rat rod
1:12:22 looks like it's like a hell bike out of
1:12:24 a Mad Max movie it's got like different
1:12:27 parts salvaged from different kits all
1:12:30 welded together in this amalgamation
1:12:31 that looks like a bike that could
1:12:34 survive the apocalypse
1:12:36 Johnny is head to toe in black denim and
1:12:40 Leathers his brand new jacket has
1:12:44 different sections studded and spiked
1:12:47 out a lapel here a forearm on the left
1:12:51 lapel there is a small silver pin of the
1:12:54 inverted V for clam bruja and the left
1:12:57 sleeve has a small little half Cape
1:13:01 almost made out of chain mail a palette
1:13:04 yeah hanging from his shoulder
1:13:06 underneath he wears a black snap button
1:13:11 cowboy shirt that he has unbuttoned very
1:13:14 low exposing his chest and a silver
1:13:18 conch bolo tie that just hangs on his
1:13:22 bare chest undone almost completely
1:13:24 because you did bring up that the shirt
1:13:27 is mostly unbuttoned
1:13:30 I think the audience needs to know how
1:13:32 hairy is Johnny's chest
1:13:34 it is a uh definitely hairy enough that
1:13:37 somebody could grab a handful and hang
1:13:38 on
1:13:40 I'm sure that's exactly what they were
1:13:42 looking for he wears a pair of black
1:13:44 ripped Levi jeans and two black pointed
1:13:48 boots with silver tips and heels
1:13:52 with it the design of a wolf
1:13:55 incorporated into it on his fingers he
1:13:58 wears these big gnarly silver and
1:14:01 turquoise rings
1:14:03 and of course he's got a pair of
1:14:05 Wayfarers on and a morally cigarette
1:14:07 hanging out of his lip once he finds a
1:14:10 spot for his bike near the front of the
1:14:11 club he kicks the uh kickstand down
1:14:14 pulls the bike down hops off and helps
1:14:18 Brita down off the bike Brita gratefully
1:14:21 accepts the hand and somehow Dismounts
1:14:24 this Spike completely gracefully despite
1:14:27 she's got this
1:14:29 Sky High stilettos on her vinyl boots
1:14:31 but the hand helps and her own Grace
1:14:34 helps and she's mostly got this outfit
1:14:38 that's a deep shade of plum purple for
1:14:41 her top she's wearing basically a
1:14:44 lingerie inspired bodysuit that's got
1:14:47 that same plum purple lace emphasizing
1:14:50 each and every curve spaghetti straps
1:14:52 keep that in place her skirt is silk and
1:14:55 Skin Tight she's got a slit on one side
1:14:57 so that there will be no constriction on
1:15:00 her dancing she has a full range of
1:15:02 movement and when she moves just right
1:15:05 that means you can Glimpse strapped high
1:15:08 on each thigh there's a small compact
1:15:10 handgun just an inch or so above those
1:15:13 heeled boots you can see about just the
1:15:16 top of some fishnets and her makeup is
1:15:19 synchronous with her outfit hers is both
1:15:22 Smoky and sharp it's the same colors all
1:15:25 through and she sweeps her hair back
1:15:27 into place
1:15:28 like the motorcycle only made it better
1:15:31 and takes your arm to go in Johnny radar
1:15:35 when you arrive it is to a sea of parked
1:15:39 cars it is a mess everywhere cars cannot
1:15:42 get around this block right now good
1:15:44 thing I got a bike
1:15:47 you take it slow rumbling loudly a
1:15:51 number of the bruhar checking out this
1:15:53 bike sometimes with Envy sometimes just
1:15:57 admiring the Senate shawl's work
1:16:02 and as the two of you pull up right by
1:16:04 the entrance this Beast of a bruja
1:16:08 nearly seven feet tall greets the two of
1:16:11 you he puts his chin up greeting Johnny
1:16:14 Johnny looks up gives him a uh a nod
1:16:18 respectful nod in return he holds out
1:16:21 his fist Johnny holds out his the dude's
1:16:25 fist is like a small cinder block and
1:16:29 bumping your fist against it it actually
1:16:31 feels like a small cinder block and he
1:16:35 gives you a nod and he's like welcome
1:16:36 Johnny you're the man of the hour do
1:16:39 your thing Johnny kind of gives this guy
1:16:41 a half smile
1:16:42 thanks Tony you got it and heads on into
1:16:45 the club this Brady goes by he kind of
1:16:48 like
1:16:48 definitely gives like an appraising look
1:16:51 to her but it's mostly like approval
1:16:54 like acknowledging that she looks really
1:16:55 nice she smiles at the greeting between
1:16:57 the two bruja
1:16:59 after connecting us with this guy who
1:17:02 seems to be occupying the role of
1:17:04 bouncer something clicks or maybe she'd
1:17:07 been thinking about it in the back of
1:17:08 her mind but it becomes more real in the
1:17:12 moment she looks back and spots familiar
1:17:16 Alleyway and her eyes land on the ground
1:17:20 and she didn't
1:17:23 she watches that spot for a few moments
1:17:27 her expression not quite changing she's
1:17:31 too
1:17:33 readied
1:17:34 she's wearing the armor of
1:17:37 preparation the armor of looking hot as
1:17:40 hell and being ready for fights
1:17:43 but
1:17:44 she can't help the way that memory Rings
1:17:47 back
1:17:48 she steals herself and turns back to you
