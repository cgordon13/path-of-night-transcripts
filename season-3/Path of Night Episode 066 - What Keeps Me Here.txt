0:00:29 [Music]
0:00:37 last time on path of night
0:00:40 when in Britta hope to find Fetters to
0:00:43 try and protect Joey and Romeo
0:00:45 Wynn reached out to Ramirez and
0:00:47 recovered the whistle
0:00:49 riddle attempted an apology to Pendragon
0:00:52 and said more than she meant to reveal
0:00:55 bread and Nguyen ended up having the
0:00:57 talk
0:00:59 meanwhile
0:01:01 Mao's Johnny worked to contain the
0:01:03 situation in court rumors have begun
0:01:06 spreading them with new Prince
0:01:08 group received a directive to go pick up
0:01:10 Allies at the airport
0:01:13 [Music]
0:01:33 win and Brita
0:01:36 Arrangements have been made
0:01:38 the piano is being moved
0:01:41 to The Haven that you all now share
0:01:44 the goal movers are very good at what
0:01:47 they do
0:01:48 and because of the strength that they
0:01:51 are imbued with thanks to miles's blood
0:01:55 they actually get it in nice and easy
0:01:58 would you mind um I think there's
0:02:00 actually space in my room
0:02:02 absolutely
0:02:04 thank you I kind of hustle and there's a
0:02:07 little bit of like arguing back and
0:02:09 forth between them as far as tetrising
0:02:11 hey through the doorway but they make it
0:02:13 bread is kind of anxiously hovering I
0:02:16 mean she's not getting in the way but
0:02:17 aren't stares a factor yeah yeah and
0:02:21 this extremely heavy object has
0:02:24 delicately sat down in your room thank
0:02:26 you guys of course no problem they head
0:02:28 downstairs actually go ahead and get the
0:02:30 bench for you and they set it up so that
0:02:33 the piano is ready to go when what if
0:02:36 it's not right do you think we should
0:02:38 get the record player too or
0:02:40 honestly it may not be right but it may
0:02:43 also be worth asking him what would be
0:02:46 right
0:02:47 in my senses and I look around when just
0:02:50 kind of
0:02:52 looks around
0:02:54 um what's the weather in the shadow
0:02:55 lands like right now
0:02:57 there is
0:02:58 a storm that grows and grows
0:03:01 days ago who's like a hurricane now
0:03:04 there really isn't anything you've ever
0:03:07 seen or heard of that can be compared to
0:03:09 it
0:03:10 she has been holding
0:03:12 the nicely wrapped Tupperware that
0:03:15 contains Joey's whistle but as the piano
0:03:17 gets placed she begins
0:03:19 unwrapping it
0:03:21 does she see anyone in the shadowlands
0:03:25 as the two of you
0:03:28 nervously fiddle with these objects of
0:03:30 power
0:03:32 there are two figures that join you on
0:03:35 the bench sitting side by side
0:03:38 one of them
0:03:39 is this irate little boy
0:03:43 who Broods with this hurt angry
0:03:47 expression
0:03:49 parts of his flesh flayed away in eyes
0:03:51 that glimmer deep kind of mustardy
0:03:54 yellow
0:03:55 and with an arm wrapped around him
0:03:57 offering what quiet Comfort he can
0:04:00 as a young handsome black man
0:04:03 you recognize to be Romeo
0:04:05 am I able to spot them with my aspects
0:04:08 with or perception you can see the shine
0:04:12 of their auras
0:04:14 uh it's as though rather than having all
0:04:16 around them that is these colors the
0:04:19 color makes up their shape it's like a
0:04:21 it's like a rainbow silhouette good boy
0:04:25 it's deep black and twisted and angry if
0:04:29 a young man there's much more hope
0:04:32 sorrow
0:04:34 deeper more complex emotions than the
0:04:37 the rage
0:04:38 that the little boy is feeling Bretta
0:04:41 sort of cheats and follows wins I line
0:04:43 over to where she needs to be looking
0:04:45 and along with heightening her senses
0:04:48 she uses her Aura perception and
0:04:52 upon the confirmation of the presence
0:04:54 looks unsure more nervous a little
0:04:58 uncomfortable but then even a bit more
0:05:01 confused and she looks back to win and
0:05:04 back to the smaller shape
0:05:07 when kind of looks to Romeo when she
0:05:11 sees
0:05:12 Joey's state
0:05:14 you definitely get the impression that
0:05:16 his shadow is in control the shadow
0:05:17 isn't it okay
0:05:18 so when she sees that Joey's Shadow has
0:05:21 taken hold of him maybe for the first
0:05:23 time
0:05:24 maybe not she kind of looks to Romeo
0:05:28 with an expression on her face begging
0:05:30 for context if he knows what has caused
0:05:33 this
0:05:34 Romeo speaks up
0:05:36 hi kid you can tell him
0:05:38 speak
0:05:39 Joey what's the matter
0:05:41 boy matters
0:05:43 my mom is [ __ ] stupid
0:05:45 that is stupid [ __ ] death and she's
0:05:47 not here
0:05:49 she didn't come and join me on the other
0:05:50 side she left me
0:05:52 she left me to die again and again and
0:05:54 again
0:05:55 when kind of
0:05:58 I [ __ ] hate her
0:05:59 I'm not able to hear them I just see the
0:06:02 emotions
0:06:03 Britta sees the roiling and is unsure
0:06:08 what to say looking to win as the leader
0:06:11 of the situation
0:06:12 when kind of she crouches on instincts
0:06:15 to be eye level with Joey but she does
0:06:17 take a minute her head lowered a little
0:06:20 to try and figure out what to say
0:06:21 because it's not fair there's nothing
0:06:25 she's gonna be able to say that makes
0:06:27 this fair or okay especially to a little
0:06:30 boy who's already lost so much my mom
0:06:32 went to heaven
0:06:33 and she left me to rot in hell Wynn kind
0:06:36 of holds out her hands not insisting he
0:06:38 take them but as an offer should he want
0:06:40 them he lashes out to scratch at you she
0:06:43 leaves her hands there it doesn't do
0:06:45 anything yeah she lets him get the anger
0:06:48 out
0:06:49 Joey
0:06:50 that [ __ ] sucks
0:06:53 there's nothing good about that
0:06:56 I'm so sorry
0:06:58 but I don't think all of you hates her I
0:07:01 think all of me hates her I know all of
0:07:03 you hates her right now always I'm never
0:07:06 gonna forgive her no I think you're
0:07:09 gonna forgive her honey
0:07:10 because it hurts to be mad like this
0:07:14 no it doesn't and it wasn't mom's choice
0:07:18 I hate her
0:07:19 and I don't want her
0:07:22 she can have heaven
0:07:24 I have the storm
0:07:26 she's not in heaven
0:07:27 [ __ ] alarmed that
0:07:30 she win sticks by her guns moms
0:07:34 not in heaven hunting
0:07:36 she's in a paradisical afterlife but
0:07:40 heaven for her was being with you
0:07:43 mom has been in hell ever since you were
0:07:45 taken
0:07:46 and I know what Mom was feeling
0:07:50 God took her away
0:07:53 he saved her and he took her to heaven
0:07:56 and he didn't save me so what should I
0:07:58 think of that you should be mad you
0:08:00 should have questions I should be mad
0:08:03 but you shouldn't be mad forever man I
0:08:05 can be more mad no we're not going to
0:08:08 get more mad I can feel it I've barely
0:08:10 dug down the well Joey no look at me no
0:08:14 you like shoves Romeo and I'm gonna put
0:08:17 Sans up like clearly looks like I want
0:08:19 to slap the [ __ ] out of the kid but like
0:08:21 when kind of gives up the controls
0:08:23 himself for the moment when kind of
0:08:24 gives a look of
0:08:25 gratitude to Romeo when
0:08:29 he's really
0:08:31 really
0:08:32 hurting
0:08:34 I know
0:08:35 this happens to race sometimes
0:08:38 they have a form of Beast too
0:08:41 and it takes over and it makes the bad
0:08:43 feelings feel good and like there's
0:08:44 nothing else
0:08:46 and it's satisfying to feel the hurt and
0:08:49 be mad about the hurt rather than
0:08:52 rather than work through it because it's
0:08:55 easy
0:08:57 I'm already dead
0:08:59 there's no brighter thing to go to
0:09:03 he tries to like
0:09:05 get philosophical but it's too
0:09:07 frustrated and young and yeah and eight
0:09:10 Joey you didn't live a long enough life
0:09:13 on this side to have the answers or the
0:09:16 presents to know how to answer these
0:09:18 questions for yourself and I'm sorry for
0:09:19 that
0:09:20 I'm not a baby
0:09:22 no babies don't become wraiths honey
0:09:26 and if they did
0:09:28 put him out of their misery
0:09:30 for a sec I wish someone would do for me
0:09:33 and then who gets who inherits that
0:09:35 misery Joey I don't care
0:09:37 you don't care right now
0:09:38 no I don't care ever
0:09:40 Joey
0:09:42 what
0:09:44 you asked me once
0:09:46 what would happen if you were bad
0:09:49 you've asked me that a couple times now
0:09:52 so what happens
0:09:54 I'll tell you what won't happen
0:09:56 you're not gonna make me stop loving you
0:09:58 or caring for you or trying to find a
0:10:00 better issue for you you're a monster
0:10:03 too
0:10:04 I know you kill people and have fun
0:10:06 what if I want to have fun
0:10:08 do you want to be like Mr Perfect
0:10:11 I'm already like them no you're not it
0:10:13 disappears uh when we'll call him back
0:10:16 guys Roy
0:10:20 so she is holding two of his Fetters
0:10:22 basically knowing his birthday and
0:10:24 having his whistle yep um so what does
0:10:26 that do for the difficulty minus two all
0:10:28 right I'm going to spend an auto or a
0:10:30 willpower for a grade of success
0:10:33 spending it already that's what I like
0:10:35 to see
0:10:39 so the difficulty was eight or six
0:10:42 you're at diff four okay yeah even
0:10:44 better
0:10:45 six successes he reappears arms crossed
0:10:49 I'm not talking to you
0:10:51 I'll wait
0:10:53 fine what if we got like stops himself
0:10:55 what have we got other than time buddy
0:10:59 I don't know
0:11:00 well we have each other for one thing
0:11:03 Joey I am I want you to go with your mom
0:11:07 and I am trying to find a way
0:11:09 and there might be a way
0:11:12 so I need you to hold on to the hope
0:11:15 that this isn't over
0:11:18 Romeo said he's going to mash me into a
0:11:20 coin who is Romeo Romeo
0:11:23 I was like no I didn't
0:11:27 it's like yes you did and Ronnie was
0:11:29 like no I didn't
0:11:30 he's like yes you did
0:11:32 when are they fighting or no I didn't
0:11:36 apparently Romeo said he was gonna Mash
0:11:38 Joey into a coin and there's some
0:11:40 dispute on that matter I didn't say that
0:11:42 yes you did
0:11:44 empathy who's
0:11:48 I mean I'm looking at their feelings is
0:11:50 there any feeling of guilt
0:11:53 on Romeo's side
0:11:54 no I mean I don't think he did or he
0:12:00 doesn't feel bad about it or
0:12:03 [Laughter]
0:12:07 he said he's gonna Mash me into a coin
0:12:11 first off what
0:12:15 what does that even mean
0:12:17 he said he was gonna do it
0:12:20 um is there a way I can try and get his
0:12:23 get him out of his shadow there is a
0:12:26 ritual called call upon the Shadows
0:12:28 Grace okay which I don't have well what
0:12:31 level is it three can I have it
0:12:34 you can go learn it yeah okay but not
0:12:37 right now right okay
0:12:40 Joey if Romeo tries to smash you into a
0:12:43 coin I'm gonna smash him
0:12:45 what [ __ ] she's just kind of gives him a
0:12:48 look like can you be chill for one
0:12:49 minute here one I think I've been pretty
0:12:51 [ __ ] chill
0:12:54 he looks down
0:12:56 she stands up she kind of motions Romeo
0:12:59 to come over here
0:13:00 I'm obviously not gonna smash you dude
0:13:03 but this kid is scared and he needs to
0:13:05 believe that someone is going to protect
0:13:06 him don't negotiate with terrorists
0:13:10 he just disappears into the piano it's
0:13:13 like I'm out when does that mean that
0:13:16 that's gonna work or
0:13:19 does he seem to be nestled in it who
0:13:22 Romeo yes he goes to it as though it is
0:13:24 his fetter yeah he's safe there brother
0:13:26 that's a good sign that means that's it
0:13:28 worked this is an anchor for him Bretta
0:13:31 heaves a big sigh eyes going wide and
0:13:36 she sits down on the bed looking both
0:13:38 scared confused but mostly relieved her
0:13:41 eyes kind of flicking to the piano and
0:13:44 back to the situation at hand
0:13:46 all right she kind of holds out the
0:13:48 whistle
0:13:50 Joey I don't make promises I can't keep
0:13:52 but I promise you I'm gonna find a way
0:13:54 I'm gonna try
0:13:56 and find a way to get you to Mom
0:13:59 and in the meantime I'm gonna try and
0:14:02 keep you safe just like I have been
0:14:05 fine
0:14:07 when does this go away like like a
0:14:10 frenzy yeah
0:14:12 does it take time or yes
0:14:15 if you're looking at auras there might
0:14:18 be a little
0:14:19 ish lie
0:14:21 Joey
0:14:23 remember when you got to say bye to Mom
0:14:25 no
0:14:27 remember when you got to say bye to Mom
0:14:29 and I make and I make him remember
0:14:33 when holding out the whistle like go to
0:14:35 your room
0:14:37 five successes he hisses like a cat what
0:14:41 about it I don't care it doesn't matter
0:14:44 it was all [ __ ] is that making him
0:14:46 feel anything apart from the black rage
0:14:50 is that giving her any traction that I
0:14:52 can see
0:14:53 it's actually like hard to tell because
0:14:56 there is so much of this angst that is
0:15:01 permeating his form that you can't
0:15:04 readily see what other emotions might be
0:15:07 down there it's like someone took like a
0:15:10 Sharpie and scribbled over a colorful
0:15:14 picture so you can't really like make
0:15:16 out the colors that are underneath you
0:15:18 know they're there but yeah it's hard to
0:15:20 make out
0:15:22 do you remember what mom told you
0:15:25 with tears in her eyes because she was
0:15:27 so glad to be able to see you
0:15:29 she was just crying no she wasn't
0:15:33 she got a chance to say goodbye to her
0:15:35 little boy
0:15:37 because you were brave enough to go back
0:15:41 get a little empathy to try it yeah okay
0:15:44 which
0:15:46 which attribute
0:15:48 manipulation oh sweet
0:15:51 [Music]
0:15:53 uh what's the difficulty for this six
0:15:55 okay
0:15:56 three successes I'll think about it
0:15:59 what's his Aura doing
0:16:02 um so it looks like basically right now
0:16:04 his Shadows riding through but it burns
0:16:07 out and tires out eventually
0:16:09 so at this point he just needs to let it
0:16:12 Coast but basically the loss of his mom
0:16:15 especially if she was a Fetter is very
0:16:18 very bad for him
0:16:19 when can we
0:16:22 make them safe when he's like this
0:16:25 he has to want to
0:16:27 and I think some part of him might but
0:16:29 I'm not going to speak for him
0:16:31 he can make his own choices
0:16:33 and if he's choosing to think about it
0:16:36 then I'm happy about it
0:16:39 she holds out the whistle to Joey
0:16:41 you can go in here and be safe from the
0:16:43 storm
0:16:45 I told you I could find a way to keep
0:16:47 you safe from the storm he looks sad
0:16:48 brother and British clothes start to
0:16:52 stink like urine
0:16:55 bad bad
0:16:59 and then he hops into the
0:17:01 whistle Britta heightened her I don't
0:17:04 remember in the system does everything
0:17:05 heighten at once I need a willpower or
0:17:09 you will lose yourself for around
0:17:10 wretching from the horrible stench
0:17:12 coming from you I mean this has never
0:17:16 happened I don't think I know everyone
0:17:18 says that but
0:17:21 is this a willpower spend or role spend
0:17:24 okay
0:17:26 I will spend a willpower just about one
0:17:29 sec
0:17:30 Brita is confused and revolted as the
0:17:33 smell hits her and as she realizes what
0:17:37 that smell is she
0:17:40 stands like honestly horrified feeling
0:17:44 pretty violated she's not been in close
0:17:46 contact with that smile that she can
0:17:48 remember
0:17:49 and she
0:17:52 embarrass runs to the bathroom
0:17:54 to try to get the clothes off
0:17:56 wind kind of holds up the whistle to her
0:17:59 eyes you're going to apologize for that
0:18:01 later and sticks it in her pocket okay
0:18:05 um she kind of like big long suffering
0:18:08 sigh and
0:18:10 face in hands just this whole parenting
0:18:13 [ __ ] of the dead children very
0:18:16 shortly you hear the shower running
0:18:19 and she does not intrude
0:18:25 uh when your phone starts to ring wind
0:18:28 just kind of rolls her eyes like this
0:18:30 better not be Sheriff's Office [ __ ]
0:18:32 and just kind of pulls her phone out and
0:18:34 sees and smiles uh it's probably Prince
0:18:36 level [ __ ] answers when here
0:18:40 excellent
0:18:42 you're learning
0:18:44 I'm learning something proper etiquette
0:18:47 love it yeah we'll call it that anyway
0:18:49 what's up
0:18:50 uh we are heading to the airport
0:18:54 and while I do not think there will be
0:18:57 trouble there might be so we're coming
0:18:59 by to get you where are you uh back at
0:19:01 the Haven um we had to resolve some
0:19:05 shadowlands nonsense and so Brit is in
0:19:08 the shower but she should be ready by
0:19:09 the time you get here where are you
0:19:10 coming from
0:19:11 we're coming from the Elysium okay yeah
0:19:14 she should be done but I'll let her know
0:19:16 that you're coming fantastic
0:19:18 all right uh who's we just you and
0:19:21 Johnny or are you bringing other guests
0:19:23 just Johnny okay we'll be there soon all
0:19:26 right
0:19:27 he just hangs up and wind kind of goes
0:19:30 over and knocks on the bathroom door
0:19:33 yeah
0:19:35 when kind of like cracks the door a
0:19:37 little bit just so she doesn't have to
0:19:38 yell
0:19:39 okay first thing I'm really sorry about
0:19:41 that he is going to apologize he was
0:19:44 having a moment I'll explain it later
0:19:47 um but miles and Johnny are going to be
0:19:49 here in a few minutes to pick us up for
0:19:50 a ride to the airport okay I I can get
0:19:53 ready fast okay I figured you probably
0:19:55 could all right but
0:19:58 I am really sorry about that take your
0:20:00 time if you need to
0:20:02 um is this all that we need to do to get
0:20:05 them safe to get their feather feathers
0:20:08 there is this is probably the most we
0:20:11 can do right now but they should be safe
0:20:14 all right can you um
0:20:16 can you actually get me my rope yeah do
0:20:19 you want me to grab an outfit or
0:20:20 something
0:20:21 oh can I can I pick an outfit for you I
0:20:23 never get to do this
0:20:25 there's like a confused pause and the
0:20:28 shower turns off so that she can have
0:20:31 the conversation you feel as the
0:20:33 impression
0:20:34 I didn't
0:20:36 you're really excited about that I don't
0:20:40 get a lot of opportunities to be
0:20:44 traditionally feminine I guess
0:20:47 okay
0:20:48 um
0:20:48 do you want to pick out an outfit for me
0:20:50 and then we can I'll pick out an outfit
0:20:53 for you another time
0:20:54 win seems to consider this like she
0:20:56 doesn't want to be excited about it but
0:20:58 she's super excited about this uh yeah
0:21:01 let's let's make that deal one thing
0:21:03 yeah I get to do your makeup
0:21:06 it's only fair I got to do your hair
0:21:09 and she kind of shuts the door and goes
0:21:11 over to britta's closet an extreme range
0:21:14 of options gifted by Miles
0:21:18 she picks out a nice pair of dark jeans
0:21:23 um tapered at the bottom
0:21:25 and
0:21:27 like a nice slouchy sweater
0:21:30 kind of lightweight because it is
0:21:31 springtime
0:21:33 if she has a nice pair of cute boots
0:21:36 she's going to pick those out for her
0:21:37 too
0:21:38 and then like a like a racerback tank
0:21:41 top so that the straps kind of stick out
0:21:42 the top of the sweater then she'll grab
0:21:44 socks and underwear and everything like
0:21:46 that because she's nothing if not
0:21:47 practical and gross and then she'll kind
0:21:50 of slide them in and she'll like open
0:21:53 the door a little and set them on the
0:21:54 the sink all right they're there
0:21:57 whenever you're ready
0:21:58 thank you yep as
0:22:01 you turn to walk away you are spooked by
0:22:05 the sudden presence of a person right
0:22:07 next to you
0:22:09 oh hey sorry it's Eden oh hi honey you
0:22:13 okay yeah were you talking to ghosts
0:22:17 yeah why she looks real spooked suddenly
0:22:21 and she just kind of gives a quiet nod
0:22:23 no no don't don't stop there so I know
0:22:25 that's okay no no no I didn't know you
0:22:29 didn't you didn't know ghosts were a
0:22:30 thing she nods okay so quick rundown
0:22:33 ghosts Spirits two different things both
0:22:36 real
0:22:37 nod's a little faster if you want help
0:22:41 learning about them that's okay too
0:22:43 shakes her head all right how are you
0:22:45 doing do you need anything I'm okay
0:22:47 you seem like you're very much not okay
0:22:49 I'm okay her eyes dark towards brita's
0:22:52 room and then back to you
0:22:55 what's up
0:22:56 nothing they're gone goneish now
0:23:01 okay
0:23:02 she sighs a little bit of relief in her
0:23:04 tone
0:23:05 if you ever get a shiver up your back
0:23:09 or the air gets a little cold one is
0:23:11 around other than that they're probably
0:23:13 not gonna pay a whole lot of mine okay
0:23:15 she starts walking away real quick Brita
0:23:19 exits dress in the clothing that Wynn
0:23:21 picked out looking way more casual you
0:23:24 don't really remember the last time you
0:23:26 saw breto wearing jeans and she this is
0:23:30 a it's not really off brita's style
0:23:34 miles has excellent taste and it would
0:23:36 have picked out items that bread I've
0:23:38 really liked but it is a combination
0:23:40 that you haven't seen her in and she
0:23:42 kind of looks a bit confused as she sees
0:23:45 Eden running off and says hey we're
0:23:48 gonna have to run off for a bit are you
0:23:50 gonna
0:23:51 what do you think we shouldn't take her
0:23:53 with us
0:23:54 Eden do you want to come with or stay
0:23:56 here
0:23:57 no what if there's other Kindred there I
0:24:00 don't think she should come but
0:24:02 yeah but I don't know if the tramir are
0:24:03 gonna come looking for Ira
0:24:05 I don't know what kind of
0:24:07 Big Brother level
0:24:10 body snatcher meat tracking systems
0:24:13 they've got but blood is a it's a
0:24:17 conduit to people
0:24:18 and the tramira are really good at
0:24:20 finding things yeah
0:24:23 what if she stayed with in the ghoul
0:24:25 house
0:24:28 I guess that makes sense it's not like
0:24:30 they don't already know about her yeah
0:24:32 we may get a joke on pool house
0:24:35 or is that like the ghoul house next
0:24:38 door the house where the ghouls live
0:24:40 okay all right throw them next on HGTV
0:24:43 Schoolhouse schoolhouse
0:24:46 Brita calls out in the direction that
0:24:48 Eden's rapidly disappearing and says
0:24:52 um actually would it be
0:24:54 are you willing to stay with the ghouls
0:24:55 for a bit I'm sorry if we just scared
0:24:58 you she's yeah I like them
0:25:01 that sounds good so they're they're
0:25:03 around during the day
0:25:07 one of the girls sees this and they're
0:25:08 just like oh [ __ ] when like takes a
0:25:11 joint out of her back pocket and slides
0:25:13 it to the guy not while you're watching
0:25:15 her we'll see he takes the joy I get it
0:25:18 I do
0:25:20 and Bretta picks up some makeup to go to

0:25:34 I don't know I I feel like I look like
0:25:36 you a little bit
0:25:38 I have certain tastes they probably are
0:25:40 reflected in my choices for others
0:25:43 it's nice to match yeah I should
0:25:45 probably get shoes at some point as you
0:25:47 Ponder whether or not you wear shoes
0:25:49 the van pulls up and Escalade pulls up
0:25:52 oh the erskully an Escalade pulls up to
0:25:56 the untrained eye it looks black what

0:26:14 and get going yep Bretta before she
0:26:17 leaves her room to head down with when
0:26:19 looks to the piano and says quietly
0:26:23 I hope we can talk later
0:26:27 finally
0:26:28 the other voice says
0:26:30 she can hear that voice
0:26:34 preda gives the piano a little hesitant
0:26:37 nod
0:26:38 and heads down as she planned to
0:26:45 but it loads some weapons some armor
0:26:48 into the back and steps around to join
0:26:50 the guys in the car yeah when
0:26:53 get some stuff together she finds like a
0:26:55 pair of Birkenstocks or something like
0:26:56 that and throws them on hey
0:26:59 hello you guys ready to go
0:27:01 who are we getting I'm not entirely sure
0:27:04 oh another mystery trip yeah uh my sire
0:27:07 sent people he said
0:27:10 they sounded friendly so but I'm not
0:27:12 entirely sure some bots in the city so
0:27:15 we might as well might as well go
0:27:16 prepare how many people are we picking
0:27:18 up unclear
0:27:20 well Eden's gonna stay with the goals
0:27:22 while we're gone all right
0:27:23 sure I mean we've only got space for
0:27:25 three more in this thing so
0:27:27 hopefully that'll be enough yeah
0:27:29 hopefully otherwise we're gonna be
0:27:31 people will be sitting on each other's
0:27:32 laps I can just sit in the trunk Do not
0:27:35 sit in the trunk because that's like
0:27:36 there's not really a trunk well it's the
0:27:38 trunk space
0:27:40 right behind the seat anyways I can get
0:27:43 in someone's lap oh my god let's just go
0:27:47 and then you go
0:27:49 bickering the whole way
0:27:55 once everyone's gathered up
0:27:58 Johnny will uh put the Escalade in
0:28:00 reverse back out onto the road and head
0:28:02 towards
0:28:04 Tweed airport I don't know if it
0:28:06 necessarily existed then I know it's
0:28:08 been around and it got rebuilt we're
0:28:10 going to pretend that it is in in the
0:28:11 world of Darkness yeah that existed in
0:28:13 the 1999 yeah you guys get to the
0:28:15 airport it's very small
0:28:17 a little out of the way not quite
0:28:19 obvious to the rest of the city
0:28:23 and there
0:28:25 is a private jet waiting one of the very
0:28:27 little ones
0:28:28 the side of it is opened
0:28:32 giving the makeshift stairs that the jet
0:28:34 makes you know down and ready to go
0:28:38 beside the stairs there are two men in
0:28:41 suits who have on single point slings
0:28:45 SMGs
0:28:47 just little mp5s that they're holding on
0:28:50 to while they run security
0:28:53 some recognizable faces get off the jet
0:28:57 the first is Amaya
0:29:00 she's dressed in a leather jacket and
0:29:02 jeans there's a little hoodie underneath
0:29:05 she's very uh casual compared to how she
0:29:10 normally is normally while she still
0:29:12 wears urban fashions it's much brighter
0:29:14 colors she's much more vibrant but she
0:29:18 looks dressed to blend in
0:29:20 and go unnoticed not her uh her usual
0:29:25 behind her and towering over her
0:29:29 is Earl Weathers
0:29:32 and Weathers
0:29:33 is dressed how he's always dressed it's
0:29:37 got a nice shirt it's got a chain that
0:29:39 hangs around his neck he looks like some
0:29:43 sort of cross between an action star
0:29:47 and a member of like one of the early
0:29:50 90s late 80s
0:29:53 boy brand groups like Boys to Men that
0:29:56 kind of like style baggy pants nice
0:29:59 shoes it looks good
0:30:01 behind him
0:30:03 is this tired ratty but somehow still
0:30:07 handsome Kabir
0:30:09 who walks down a little dazed a little
0:30:13 confused and he of course is making his
0:30:16 way immediately towards when
0:30:18 when doesn't pretend she wasn't gonna go
0:30:21 to him and
0:30:23 once close enough
0:30:25 with
0:30:27 no
0:30:29 etiquette or even awareness of an
0:30:31 audience he pounces wind and starts to
0:30:34 kiss her
0:30:35 she probably winds up scooping him up
0:30:37 when picks him up into her arms
0:30:41 and just she lets this happen
0:30:43 she just kind of holds on to him it's
0:30:46 gross
0:30:47 finally
0:30:49 stepping out of the Shadows of the jet
0:30:51 is Neil
0:30:53 Brita spotting Neil starts jogging and
0:30:56 then running to go hug him well there's
0:30:58 weight weathers turns back Neil is
0:31:01 holding an extremely paranoid hand up
0:31:03 and his eyes glance really sort of
0:31:06 sporadically between like nervously
0:31:09 between Johnny and Britta specifically
0:31:14 Lex uh
0:31:16 I have recently been surrounded by
0:31:18 people who are not who they seem coming
0:31:21 out of nowhere Johnny's wearing Jack
0:31:24 sport coat right now he is not wearing a
0:31:26 sport coat he's not wearing a sport no
0:31:28 no not wearing a leather jacket he's not
0:31:29 wearing leather jacket no the sport coat
0:31:31 he never actually put it on and he just
0:31:33 carries it with him he's carrying a
0:31:35 sport coat it does not have a leather
0:31:36 jacket on and britta's wearing a pair of
0:31:38 jeans
0:31:39 and
0:31:41 kneel as much as he's like vibrating to
0:31:44 go see people is terrified that this is
0:31:47 not really them because he's been away
0:31:49 for a while uh and so before does
0:31:52 anything tells weathers to wait holds a
0:31:54 hand up to like keep people away from
0:31:57 him and is just looking paranoid
0:32:00 uh to like like he's assuring himself
0:32:03 that it's really them
0:32:04 Brita falter so if she spots that
0:32:07 expression on his face
0:32:09 Johnny just comes walking up
0:32:12 I just I need to make sure it's it's
0:32:15 actually you damn and Neil I just woke
0:32:18 he patch Johnny in the back kind of
0:32:21 embracing his clan mate Johnny uh like
0:32:24 grabbed like grabs him by the arm and
0:32:27 pulls him in for like a tight hug how
0:32:30 you doing old man
0:32:32 I heard you're old now too it seems like
0:32:35 that thanks for picking up the phone
0:32:37 Weathers after a second Neil size
0:32:41 um and sags a little bit
0:32:43 like a hit dog who finally realizes you
0:32:45 do actually have a treat Johnny uh Jenny
0:32:48 once once he lets go of uh Weathers
0:32:51 will like
0:32:52 full-on like Palm the top of uh Neil's
0:32:56 head
0:32:57 which is funny because I think Neil's a
0:32:58 little bit taller than Johnny yeah but
0:33:00 he'll Palm the top of his head and kind
0:33:02 of like shake his head around and then
0:33:05 like pull him close and be like where
0:33:07 the [ __ ] did you get off to
0:33:10 oh thank God I really miss you guys I
0:33:14 and like his whole posture changes and
0:33:17 becomes way more like relieved
0:33:21 immediately
0:33:23 where's your you
0:33:25 um he looks over at uh I don't even know
0:33:28 where to start with that yeah he looks

0:34:09 towards British you can actually like
0:34:11 say hi everyone's safe everyone's safe
0:34:13 and now instead of like looking around
0:34:15 paranoid at everyone Neil's doing like a
0:34:18 wellness check on everybody britta's
0:34:20 giggling at Johnny uh
0:34:23 enforcing affection with the nervous
0:34:25 malkavian and she slides in to get a hug
0:34:28 from Neil and if he accepts that hug
0:34:31 it's warm it's tight and she's clearly
0:34:35 relieved and happy to see him he does he
0:34:37 he wraps his arms back around her and
0:34:39 that's more is it cold I mean her hands
0:34:42 are freezing
0:34:43 [Laughter]
0:34:45 and yeah Neil like leans down into the
0:34:49 hug

0:34:52 you're okay you made it out you're
0:34:54 everything's okay everyone's okay now
0:34:56 right everybody's okay when kind of once
0:35:00 she starts hearing Neil she will find a
0:35:03 natural
0:35:04 pausing moment for the makeout session
0:35:07 and she'll just kind of make sure Kabir
0:35:09 is steady on his feet before she goes
0:35:11 over to Neil and
0:35:12 just like kind of grabs his face just
0:35:15 like you are such a [ __ ] and I missed
