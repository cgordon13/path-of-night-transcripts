0:00:37 last time on path of
0:00:39 night Marcus vitel confronted the Cod
0:00:42 when they failed to make it through his
0:00:44 Ward the lra ran and the Cod gave Chase
0:00:48 accidentally proving Marcus vitel to be
0:00:50 a powerful
0:00:52 methusa Vel took BR and miles out of the
0:00:55 fight swiftly touring
0:00:57 them Renwick joined the fight alongside
0:01:00 Neil Wynn and
0:01:01 Johnny vital struck Renwick down giving
0:01:04 the nosrat to final
0:01:07 death the rest of the Coterie escaped as
0:01:10 vitel burned the neighborhood to the
0:01:13 [Music]
0:01:24 ground the group of you had a
0:01:27 plan not everything
0:01:30 worked as
0:01:32 intended but you knew where to fall back
0:01:34 to in case things
0:01:36 didn't one by
0:01:38 one those who
0:01:41 have weathered the storm and remain
0:01:44 standing find themselves the York garage
0:01:48 on the second
0:01:49 floor the parking garage is dead
0:01:54 quiet the lights really only
0:01:58 intermittently light the the garage
0:02:00 itself so there's Deep
0:02:02 Shadows and you can't help but wonder
0:02:06 what might be hidden there as you go
0:02:09 from light to light until
0:02:12 when
0:02:14 Johnny and Neil are together with their
0:02:18 torped
0:02:19 allies Neil arrives carrying brda in his
0:02:23 arms looking around frantically having
0:02:26 sort of lost track he saw Johnny run off
0:02:30 disappeared to get Brea out before he
0:02:32 saw that Wynn was completely safe and he's
0:02:35 just looking around frantically at the
0:02:37 Rally Point hoping somebody else is
0:02:40 there with him looking almost shell
0:02:42 shocked and panicked but like his mind's
0:02:45 going a million miles an hour trying to
0:02:49 figure out how to salvage this complete
0:02:51 mess of a
0:02:53 situation Johnny when are you are you
0:02:56 guys please tell me your
0:02:58 hair
0:03:00 Johnny arrived into the parking garage
0:03:04 in the SUV that we had taken um after
0:03:07 leaping out of the situation he managed
0:03:09 to get back to that sto miles's body and
0:03:12 drive to the garage but upon getting out
0:03:16 of the driver's seat you can see that he
0:03:19 is in a bad
0:03:21 way he gives you hungry animal
0:03:26 eyes how much blood do you have there's
0:03:30 a look of at first just utter relief
0:03:33 seeing Johnny here and then sort of
0:03:35 panic and and a
0:03:37 little
0:03:39 uh uh I have he grabs you by the
0:03:41 shoulder and and and puts you against
0:03:43 this SUV in a way that you can tell that
0:03:47 he is restraining himself but it is it
0:03:50 feels uncomfortable to be
0:03:52 pinned by Johnny with that look in his
0:03:55 eyes I I have how much
0:03:57 blood some are you
0:04:01 enough enough he grabs your wrist and
0:04:06 bites into your wrist and slakes his
0:04:09 thirst he will take three points of
0:04:11 Blood Neil you do not suffer from the
0:04:14 kiss are you resisting in anyway Neil
0:04:17 will try and pull away just because he
0:04:19 doesn't want to bond Johnny like it's
0:04:22 less that he's concerned that Johnny
0:04:24 might not stop in this Mo like he's too
0:04:26 overwhelmed with fear to be afraid that
0:04:28 Johnny's going to just fully eat him
0:04:30 like situational fear but he's so
0:04:33 focused on not wanting to B Johnny that
0:04:36 he does try and like pull his arm Johnny
0:04:38 wait there's got to be but I mean in a
0:04:41 grapple with Johnny there's there's no
0:04:42 resisting that probably about the time
0:04:44 that Neil is able to push Johnny away
0:04:47 there's kind of like a little bit of a
0:04:49 clanging noise as when comes up the
0:04:51 stairwell but it looks more like she's
0:04:53 not using the stairs she's standing on
0:04:56 the little concrete ledge next to the
0:04:57 stairs grabbing the bar uh the next
0:05:00 floor up and pulling herself up until
0:05:02 she gets there and she'll kind of Vault
0:05:05 over the stairwell ledge and make her
0:05:09 way over and do a little bit of a
0:05:11 startle to see Neil pressed against the
0:05:14 car by Johnny and
0:05:16 Johnny evidently drinking from Neil I'm
0:05:20 going to make a self-control check to
0:05:23 stop
0:05:24 drinking I think considering the
0:05:26 circumstances and where Johnny's
0:05:28 humanity is at and how hungry he was I
0:05:30 think it's a legitimate issue that seems
0:05:33 fair to me are there any modifiers to
0:05:35 this Lex yes your maximum dice pool is
0:05:37 your blood pool whichever is the lower
0:05:39 between your selfcontrol and blood you
0:05:42 still got uh three actually that's a
0:05:45 good sort of mechanical question before
0:05:47 you roll it's still that night but we
0:05:50 have gotten away from vital so do we
0:05:53 still have the extra willpower any
0:05:55 calling down the Hunter's Moon that has
0:05:57 been used with regards to that plan is
0:05:59 done so no more gotcha I went through so
0:06:03 much willpower that fight oh
0:06:08 yeah three successes you can feel Johnny
0:06:12 grip your wrist and his bite relaxes but
0:06:16 he is still hovering over and he looks
0:06:19 you in the eyes with kind of an
0:06:21 apologetic look thank you Neil
0:06:25 I thank you for stopping Johnny I'm so
0:06:28 Sor I didn't I should have said no more
0:06:30 I should no no no no we we do not have
0:06:34 time for apologies on either part we are
0:06:36 doing we are in crisis mode now guys
0:06:39 right apologies come later this is bad
0:06:42 this is really really bad Johnny nod
0:06:44 John Johnny nods along with win and lets
0:06:48 Neil go and cleans his mouth off Wynn kind
0:06:51 of she doesn't close distance because
0:06:55 she is also hungry and she is not going
0:06:58 to get close enough to tempt herself
0:07:00 into this to that point when Johnny
0:07:02 pulls away from Neil Neil also looks
0:07:05 hungry now oh [ __ ]
0:07:09 guys just quick check in how much blood
0:07:11 does everyone have one after Johnny
0:07:14 pulls away Neil has three okay so we're
0:07:16 we're evens we're Evies now yeah we
0:07:18 basically split my blood between the two
0:07:20 of us when has W yeahh so win is not
0:07:24 getting close and if someone upsets you
0:07:27 you're rolling one died to resist freny
0:07:29 M all right you guys I'm real hungry so
0:07:33 we need to we I I this is not the bunch
0:07:37 to be saying this to but we have got to
0:07:39 be calm and rational about how talking
0:07:41 about how we're going forward agreed
0:07:44 yeah um so what
0:07:47 is what is the first thing we need to do
0:07:51 to get control of this we need to get
0:07:54 you something to eat that's the second
0:07:57 thing we need to do we need to get balls
0:07:59 rolling how how when this is balls
0:08:02 rolling because we we are a a series of
0:08:05 of dominoes on a on a seesaw right now
0:08:08 and
0:08:10 Neil please don't think about me right
0:08:12 now that's I can't do that I think about
0:08:15 miles then think about Bri I'm I'm
0:08:19 looking at the bigger picture you need
0:08:20 to eat or things are going to get worse
0:08:22 Neil do not push
0:08:25 me
0:08:27 okay we need to get
0:08:29 somewhere
0:08:31 where we can make sure that they're safe
0:08:34 and that there's a source of food
0:08:36 so the Haven miles's Haven can we get
0:08:39 back there can you make it back there I
0:08:41 shouldn't be in the car with you guys
0:08:43 but yeah I can get
0:08:45 there um back there miles has his herd
0:08:48 his ghouls the people who could at least
0:08:52 help us and it's somewhere safe safer
0:08:57 for miles and BR until we could figure
0:08:58 out how to get the up getting them up um
0:09:02 there's options there's people to talk
0:09:03 to but are there options at the
0:09:06 Haven as much as there are standing
0:09:08 right here okay when the problem is some
0:09:12 of the options we have to talk about who
0:09:14 we're going to talk to because the
0:09:16 Prince of the City is down right now I I
0:09:19 have
0:09:21 ideas on how to fix that okay we don't
0:09:26 need to talk about them here and now I
0:09:27 do think getting back to The Haven is a
0:09:30 good choice
0:09:32 because you guys look absolutely
0:09:35 delicious and I don't even want to look
0:09:37 at John at Miles and BR right now
0:09:40 worried about that yeah um when is
0:09:43 like like she's she's it looks like
0:09:46 she's got the DTs she is just like
0:09:48 bouncing and shivering and holding
0:09:52 together only from the sheer amount of
0:09:55 will that she has to put against this
0:09:58 there are
0:10:00 100 things we need to do but I think the
0:10:02 first step is getting the two of them
0:10:03 back to The Haven and you need to eat
0:10:05 something before you're near them yep if
0:10:07 you guys can get there ahead of me and
0:10:09 arrange for something to be there for me
0:10:12 before I come inside that was my thought
0:10:15 exactly okay then get them safe I will
0:10:20 run I don't have enough left to turn
0:10:23 into something faster don't worry about
0:10:26 getting there fast worry about getting
0:10:28 there safe well we have a rampaging
0:10:32 thge setting fire to everything so
0:10:35 there's going to be some haste involved
0:10:37 as long as it's safe that's the plan
0:10:40 I'll I'll get these guys safe back to
0:10:41 The Haven too and we'll see you there
0:10:43 soon yeah he gives you a look he doesn't
0:10:47 reach out but you can tell that he like
0:10:48 wants to like touch you he like wants to
0:10:51 hug but you can tell that he is in
0:10:53 crisis mode and just goes straight for
0:10:55 the driver's seat yeah Wynn will put an
0:10:57 arm up and thump a fist against
0:10:59 her heart like love you guys I would hug
0:11:02 you but now is not that time Neil puts
0:11:04 up both of his hands like in the little
0:11:06 shape of a heart towards Wynn like also
0:11:08 clearly wanting to just be like giving
0:11:10 comfort and receiving comfort in this
0:11:12 moment knowing it's not possible right
0:11:14 now and without looking at either of
0:11:16 them too long she scurries back down she
0:11:20 seems to have some problems with the
0:11:22 idea of being confined to a stairwell so
0:11:24 she just climbs over the edge and
0:11:27 drops and lands on the next landing and
0:11:31 drops again and goes Johnny will start
0:11:34 the vehicle and bang on the side of the
0:11:38 door let's go Neil Neil sort of hoists
0:11:42 brda the strength that Johnny gave them
0:11:45 earlier starting to fade and sort of
0:11:47 struggles puts her into the back seat
0:11:49 buckles her in and then gets in the
0:11:51 front seat next to Johnny as you go to
0:11:53 get into the front seat lights all
0:11:56 around you become overwhelmingly bright
0:12:00 you feel
0:12:03 confused and then your
0:12:06 senses Fade Away
0:12:09 entirely as you are
0:12:13 confronted with a
0:12:19 vision you
0:12:21 see the
0:12:23 Bron some of the worst neighborhoods you
0:12:26 are aware of and there at a basketball
0:12:31 court that has its fence kind of rusted
0:12:35 out mostly gone there are no backboards
0:12:39 anymore the ground is cracked and
0:12:42 ruined everything around you is
0:12:45 dilapidated and this time unlike so many
0:12:48 other Visions where it is a series of
0:12:51 flashes or Sensations you find yourself
0:12:55 in a
0:12:56 crowd weak
0:12:59 hungry confused and unsure of why you
0:13:03 feel this terrible hunger stirring in
0:13:07 you and all around you are dozens of
0:13:10 people that are confused and
0:13:13 scared all of them victims of
0:13:17 kidnappings
0:13:18 assaults dragged their and mass buried
0:13:24 with people and having to have killed
0:13:27 and lost them elves to this madness in
0:13:30 order to survive and dig themselves out
0:13:33 each of you
0:13:35 survivors of these terrifying
0:13:39 ordeals and in the center of the
0:13:42 Court speaking to the group with this
0:13:47 Aura of command and
0:13:51 hope is a woman with a thick Spanish
0:13:56 accent saber on her hip a leather jacket
0:13:59 and beside her her loyal packmates and
0:14:03 she tells all of you that you have been
0:14:08 cursed you have been taken by the
0:14:11 minations of a master
0:14:14 vampire and that he is responsible for
0:14:17 your curse and you will not be free of
0:14:20 this vampirism until you kill the man
0:14:25 responsible and end the curse
0:14:30 and she tells you about miles
0:14:34 Davenport the one responsible for your
0:14:38 suffering and in you there's this
0:14:40 glimmer of hope you don't really believe
0:14:44 you're a parent savior
0:14:47 but she's literally the only way out and
0:14:51 if you have to kill some stranger to
0:14:53 save yourself and get back to your
0:14:56 family you're not proud
0:14:59 but you'll do
0:15:00 it and as you begin to feel
0:15:04 inspired the man who is standing beside
0:15:06 her you
0:15:08 recognize [ __ ] dado
0:15:10 anywhere he lets out a beastial roar
0:15:14 that scares and invigorates you and you
0:15:19 can feel his potence surging through
0:15:22 your veins and empowering you for a
0:15:25 battle that is to come and you shut the
0:15:28 passenger door and her sitting next to
0:15:30 [Music]
0:15:37 Johnny oh God oh my God Johnny I we got
0:15:42 to go we got to go now you got a moment
0:15:45 it's starting it's starting now vitel I
0:15:49 I I don't know if he called or what but
0:15:52 Carmen all of them there's an army of
0:15:54 shovel heads your sire he's r ring them
0:15:58 the way you rallied us to go after vital
0:16:00 and they're coming now they're on their
0:16:03 way if not tonight then tomorrow or the
0:16:05 next it's started Johnny blinks at that
0:16:09 fumbles for his pack of Morley's looks
0:16:12 down to see that there's one left puts
0:16:15 it in his mouth all right let's go and
0:16:19 lights up they will take the SUV and
0:16:22 head towards the
0:16:27 Haven
0:16:29 wind hops out of the parking garage the
0:16:31 air is
0:16:33 cool cold even and the city is very much
0:16:38 alive you can hear the cars passing by
0:16:42 you can see an old man with a shopping
0:16:44 carart kind of hustling by with coat and
0:16:47 extra gloves on if you choose to hunt
0:16:51 there is prey Wynn is actively avoiding
0:16:56 looking at the the homeless
0:16:59 population a lot of them are veterans
0:17:01 her dad was a veteran she does not have
0:17:05 the emotional space to deal with doing
0:17:08 that she'll kind of tuck her H her arms
0:17:11 tightly against herself as she walks
0:17:13 nominally to make it look like she's at
0:17:15 least cold but she is looking for drunks
0:17:20 she is looking for people stumbling out
0:17:23 of bars or fumbling with their car keys
0:17:25 trying to drive home drunk I think
0:17:28 subconsciously Wynn really needs a drink
0:17:30 right now but she
0:17:32 is she is keeping eyes peeled for
0:17:35 convenience that won't that won't cost
0:17:38 her later rule me a perception plus
0:17:41 alertness as you stalk the streets of
0:17:43 New Haven I'm still pretty good on
0:17:46 Willpower so I'm going to spend one of
0:17:49 those four successes with four successes
0:17:54 you walk the streets headed towards the
0:17:56 New Haven green it is a an unusual
0:18:00 pattern of sidewalks that cross it
0:18:03 forming what can only be some sort of a
0:18:06 cult
0:18:07 symbol but tonight it is mostly
0:18:10 populated by people attempting to warn
0:18:12 their hands by trash fires or in one
0:18:17 particular case a young horny couple
0:18:23 desperately in search of a place that's
0:18:25 out of sight so that they could better
0:18:27 enjoy one another
0:18:29 company there's two of them which always
0:18:32 represents some manner of risk but
0:18:35 they're actively trying to get be
0:18:37 alone so because Wynn is who she is
0:18:40 without apology or regret and with one
0:18:42 dot of
0:18:43 StreetWise does she know of a good
0:18:45 [ __ ] spot in New
0:18:48 Haven
0:18:50 unfortunately
0:18:52 because wind doesn't necessarily worry
0:18:56 about such things
0:18:58 I'm not going to allow you to Simply no
0:19:02 okay that's fair do you want me to
0:19:06 roll yeah why don't you start scouting
0:19:09 out presential spots that are out of
0:19:11 sight so StreetWise and I'm going to say
0:19:14 perception okay two successes so it
0:19:18 looks like there's a handful of bars
0:19:22 some of them have little driveways that
0:19:27 lead to spaces behind the actual bar
0:19:29 itself their Apartments overhead it's
0:19:31 all kind of a tight tight space they
0:19:34 could probably make their way down one
0:19:36 of those alleys and get carried away it
0:19:42 probably
0:19:43 smell but they're young they're drunk
0:19:46 they're dumb they don't care so wi
0:19:49 without an ounce of Shame will walk up
0:19:51 to the couple and kind of like put her
0:19:53 head down next to theirs I can show you
0:19:56 a better spot for this if you'd like
0:19:59 I need to know your Humanity
0:20:02 [Music]
0:20:04 ra oh
0:20:09 boy
0:20:11 right are you [ __ ] guys sorry he kids
0:20:15 want to see a dead
0:20:18 body so
0:20:22 basically I have forgotten until this
0:20:24 moment that when is Humanity 5 but
0:20:27 that's not the part of forgot the part I
0:20:29 forgot is that she has Eerie [ __ ]
0:20:30 presence yep and she is how does that
0:20:34 manest and and describe your Beast
0:20:37 features she just has a very predatory
0:20:41 way about her in the way that she moves
0:20:44 she is watching things a little too long
0:20:46 a little too
0:20:48 intensely and like she always moves like
0:20:51 she's moving with intent so she's also
0:20:54 got them uh Viper fangs she's got the
0:20:58 snake patterns on the sides of her
0:21:01 head uh and the the eyes that are just
0:21:03 an unnatural almost Eagle like color her
0:21:07 nails are just probably really long and
0:21:09 nasty and like uncomfortably thick they
0:21:13 were just inside Marcus Vitel for a
0:21:15 minute there too there's got to be dirt
0:21:16 and blood oh there's definitely on the
0:21:18 one hand there's definitely like Ash and
0:21:21 probably like burnt
0:21:23 calluses all down her
0:21:26 fingertips and Humanity
0:21:29 five
0:21:31 well these things coupled with the fact
0:21:33 that you smell like a burnt
0:21:35 house causes them to be very visibly
0:21:39 startled you have a moment to say one
0:21:41 thing and attempt to calm them what is
0:21:44 that thing that you say it's a really
0:21:47 good
0:21:48 question so win realizes pretty quick
0:21:50 that this is not going to go very well
0:21:53 she has forgotten exactly how bad she is
0:21:55 with the Mortal populace
0:21:58 so she quick in her head tries to walk
0:22:01 it back with no I just mean because your
0:22:03 nipples are going to get really hard
0:22:04 [ __ ] and she just quells both of them
0:22:07 you can choose to quell one which one do
0:22:09 you wish to quell let's quell the dude
0:22:13 what does quell look like and which
0:22:15 ability is that um it's animalism it's
0:22:18 the same thing that I can do to give
0:22:19 people a way out of frenzy but it
0:22:21 basically makes people compliant I guess
0:22:25 dosel dosel yeah it subdues their fight
0:22:27 or
0:22:28 and it's conveyed through a touch or eye
0:22:30 contact yep so she just they turn a look
0:22:33 at her she looks at them boom qu Wynn roll
0:22:37 manipulation plus intimidation um will I
0:22:40 get my manipulation spec of threats yes
0:22:43 okay what's the difficulty six normally
0:22:47 but you have Eerie presence and
0:22:49 therefore had a plus two difficulty this
0:22:52 I am being decadent and spending a
0:22:53 willpower
0:22:54 on five successes with five successes
0:22:58 his eyes go wide like a dough in the
0:23:01 headlights and he freezes it's like
0:23:04 those tragedies with prey animals when
0:23:07 confronted by a predator that no longer
0:23:09 needs to chase them moments before
0:23:12 they're consumed and the that bit of
0:23:15 Hope of survival goes out of the prey
0:23:17 animal's eyes it leaves his in the same
0:23:20 way and then the girl that is with him
0:23:23 shoves him towards you as a means of
0:23:28 slowing you down should you be intent on
0:23:31 chasing her and she goes running spooked
0:23:36 by the creepy woman in the hood that's
0:23:39 good for her so wind just kind of lets
0:23:41 that happen and just Embraces being the
0:23:44 creepy Park stalker breaking up Lovers
0:23:47 Lane interludes and just kind of leans
0:23:50 into the guy's neck and sinks her teeth
0:23:54 in and she will I can take two without
0:23:58 causing him harm right if you take three
0:24:00 he's knocked out and if you take more
0:24:02 than that he needs medical attention all
0:24:04 right when will try to keep herself to
0:24:07 three roll me self-control remember that
0:24:11 your self-control is capped at your
0:24:14 blood pool one success he does not die
0:24:17 tonight and despite like being at the
0:24:21 buffet and her stomach still rumbling
0:24:25 metaphorically when puts the plate down
0:24:27 and
0:24:28 takes her fangs out of him giving him a
0:24:30 lick and kind of slinks off when you
0:24:35 lick the wound it closes and he slowly
0:24:38 slumps towards the
0:24:40 ground curls up into this fetal position
0:24:44 in the alley and stays there and when
0:24:48 will wipe her mouth adjust the
0:24:52 hoodie check herself to make sure she's
0:24:54 not overtly having committed an assault
0:24:58 and she starts walking for the Haven and
0:25:01 you
0:25:06 leave when the group of you arrive to
0:25:08 The Haven the front door is unlocked
0:25:11 it's open you slip right in a waiting
0:25:15 for you are miles's ghouls who are
0:25:18 gathered up around
0:25:21 Eden they have weapons drawn and Miles
0:25:26 because he splurged for exceptional gear
0:25:28 for his team they're strapped with
0:25:31 AK-47s body armor the
0:25:35 works all that Eden has is this Glock
0:25:39 this pistol that she's holding in her
0:25:41 hand with a Stern expression on her face
0:25:46 the ghouls have Stern Expressions on
0:25:50 their
0:25:51 faces and as you enter their eyes seem
0:25:55 to stare daggers
0:25:58 at
0:25:59 Miles and when it becomes clear that the
0:26:02 group of you brought him here for safety
0:26:05 to help this
0:26:07 person those daggers are pointed at each
0:26:10 of you
0:26:12 Eden is sitting on a
0:26:16 person that is lying on their side
0:26:18 propped against the wall there is a
0:26:21 steak in his
0:26:22 chest and you recognize him to be the
0:26:25 trir that the group of you have held
0:26:26 captive for some time now there's a
0:26:30 clicking noise as Eden lights a
0:26:35 cigarette you should not be smoking
0:26:37 young lady Neil who's that in
0:26:41 her
0:26:43 uh what so what what's going on
0:26:47 everybody eting shrugs I was actually
0:26:50 thinking I might ask the group of you
0:26:52 that who's Yan
0:26:55 Peterson can we put the weapon down for
0:26:58 a minute nope we've got Stakes
0:27:03 too why are you asking who Yan Peter zun
0:27:06 is answer the question he's an archon of
0:27:09 the
0:27:10 camaria is it true that he's after me
0:27:13 there's a lot of people after you babe
0:27:15 don't call me babe she's got like these
0:27:18 tears welling up in her eyes and she's
0:27:21 clearly
0:27:22 enraged all of them seem enraged with
0:27:26 miles where are the ghoul's weapons
0:27:29 pointed right now they're just kind of
0:27:31 holding them close to chest and haven't
0:27:33 aimed them at anyone so are they in a
0:27:35 defensive ring around Eden
0:27:38 yeah who's this
0:27:40 guy uh there is a trir by the name of
0:27:45 Ira I thought you said the TR after me
0:27:48 that's why he
0:27:49 staked that doesn't make any sense is he
0:27:52 after me the trir are after you he is
0:27:56 trir he asked us to stake him so he
0:27:58 couldn't hurt you Why didn't Miles just
0:28:01 kill him we don't tend to jump to that
0:28:04 solution if we don't have to [ __ ]
0:28:07 name someone we've killed that we didn't
0:28:09 have to I can see how close you are to
0:28:11 the Beast you're not nice vampires
0:28:15 especially not him she points at Miles
0:28:19 Eden what's going on when did you all
0:28:20 start feeling this way is Miles a
0:28:23 diabl can we go question for question
0:28:26 here when did you we can't he is is
0:28:30 Miles a nice
0:28:32 vampire I don't think any vampires are
0:28:34 nice the only nice one when saying Brit
0:28:38 is the only nice one visibly makes Neil
0:28:40 look sad but he does not seem to
0:28:42 disagree but miles does have a good
0:28:47 heart and he is my
0:28:50 friend and he's put a whole lot in the
0:28:53 line to protect your
0:28:55 neck well he doesn't have to anymore
0:28:57 more why is that we're leaving where are
0:29:00 you going none of your business well if
0:29:02 you want to get past me it's going to be
0:29:04 oh that's where it's at now no okay hold
0:29:06 you're going to keep me captured stop
0:29:08 did I say that stop something changed
0:29:12 something changed in the atmosphere here
0:29:13 what is it when did you start feeling
0:29:15 this way I looked through miles's
0:29:19 things I learned about his
0:29:22 War I learned that none of these people
0:29:26 have any interest in me actually being
0:29:29 alive and that goes holds true for his
0:29:30 allies and I know I know that he will do
0:29:34 whatever it takes to keep himself safe I
0:29:37 am not safe here I'm leaving Eden we
0:29:41 haven't been safe for a long time pretty
0:29:43 much since you came into our lives we've
0:29:45 had to make a lot of choices to keep you
0:29:47 alive there are so many things pointed
0:29:50 at us right now and they would be so
0:29:52 much easier if we gave you up and we
0:29:54 didn't we made the choice that we would
0:29:57 rather have the world against us than
0:29:59 give you to them I'm not safe until
0:30:01 miles is dead why do you think it has to
0:30:04 be Miles because it has to be miles he's
0:30:08 the one with all the connections he's
0:30:09 the one he's the one behind everything
0:30:11 she start laughing you think miles is
0:30:15 the one behind everything good grief are
0:30:19 you
0:30:20 hungry cuz you're saying some dumbass
0:30:22 [ __ ] if you want to leave you know what
0:30:25 you're old enough to do so but
0:30:28 before you do that can I at least make
0:30:29 you some pancakes or something no she
0:30:32 frustrated wipes tears from her eyes
0:30:35 [ __ ] let these ghouls sit and and put
0:30:38 their weapons down if you want to leave
0:30:40 I'm not going to stop you but at least
0:30:42 come talk reasonable with us in the
0:30:44 kitchen one of the ghouls speaks up
0:30:47 can't let that happen Johnny sorry what
0:30:49 you can't let me go to the kitchen miles
0:30:51 kept us his sleeves we're going free
0:30:54 what's how long have you been ghouls Big
0:30:56 Red flag having a understanding the it
0:30:59 is how the blood Bond works yeah why
0:31:01 don't you give me an intelligence plus a
0:31:03 cult rle yeah that's I suppose my spec
0:31:05 and sorcery would apply sure
0:31:09 oh What's the diff seven one success
0:31:13 with one success I'll give you two
0:31:16 things one their relationship and Trust
0:31:20 in miles has been completely subverted
0:31:22 and corrupted the second thing about it
0:31:25 is that any blood bonds they have are
0:31:29 inverted so rather than being willing to
0:31:33 go through anything to protect miles
0:31:36 these ghouls feel the opposite they will
0:31:39 go through you to kill him two quick
0:31:43 questions and I don't know if I have the
0:31:44 answers to this one to my knowledge Eden
0:31:47 is not bloodbound to miles that is your
0:31:49 knowledge correct that is my knowledge
0:31:51 yep and not to shoot myself in the foot
0:31:53 is this all blood bounds to miles or is
0:31:56 this just currently AFF his ghouls it
0:31:57 seems like this is currently affecting
0:31:59 his ghouls okay I only ask because I am
0:32:01 bloodbound to Miles yep okay
0:32:05 um can
0:32:07 we
0:32:10 maybe
0:32:12 I uh Neil sort of gets a little lost in
0:32:15 thought wait wait wait wait wait
0:32:18 wait
0:32:20 uh don't don't mind me everybody and
0:32:23 Neil just kind of turns and starts
0:32:25 rumaging through miles's pockets and
0:32:27 just seems to like check out for a
0:32:28 second okay when you reach for miles's
0:32:31 Pockets gun are trained on
0:32:34 you I'm not getting a it's we're just
0:32:38 ignore me Johnny step uh interposes
0:32:42 himself between Neil and uh miles and
0:32:46 the crowd as does win nobody do anything
0:32:49 stupid she looks at do these ghouls have
0:32:52 names I assume they have names they were
0:32:56 never really like introducing themselves
0:32:59 to you guys or anything like that these
0:33:01 are miles's
0:33:02 employees they come in they do not
0:33:04 fraternize with miles's guests and
0:33:06 friends they they were they were Rolland
0:33:09 schools before that right yes were they
0:33:12 ever around did they ever they never
0:33:14 interacted as people unfortunately that
0:33:18 these guys have been ghouled a long time
0:33:22 faceless goons their whole lives and if
0:33:25 they were not engaging in really odd
0:33:27 behavior right now you guys probably
0:33:28 wouldn't even have noticed them is
0:33:30 that's just yeah that's fair life among
0:33:33 vampires is there any one of them that
0:33:35 seems to look like he's taking point in
0:33:37 doing the talking they're they seem to
0:33:39 be following
0:33:40 Eden guys how long have you been working
0:33:44 for Roland and then for
0:33:46 Miles 60 so they start throwing off but
0:33:49 it's usually multiple decades what would
0:33:51 have happened if miles hadn't stepped in
0:33:54 to keep you guys sustained when Rowlands
0:33:56 was killed that's kind of a [ __ ]
0:33:59 question what would have happened if
0:34:01 miles didn't kill rolands what would
0:34:03 have happened if Roland kept going
0:34:05 completely bug nuts crazy and decided
0:34:07 you were against him he would never do
0:34:09 that well agree to disagree on that
0:34:12 point then agree to disagree when their
0:34:15 perceptions are being altered you can't
0:34:19 it's more clear than ever I know I know
0:34:21 uh what I'm looking for by the way in
0:34:23 miles's pockets is off hand miles is
0:34:25 like hey the serpent people gave me a
0:34:28 [ __ ] amulet is it bad and while Neil
0:34:31 does not have let's say a tra's
0:34:34 perception perception of things I
0:34:37 believe my response was yes obviously so
0:34:40 I'm looking for any sort of [ __ ]
0:34:42 amulet or something in miles's Pockets
0:34:44 well I think he showed it to you he did
0:34:45 I'm looking for it I just have so many
0:34:47 pockets miles do you have it on you I do
0:34:50 you find it Neil comes out of miles's
0:34:54 like searching miles uh holds up an
0:34:57 amulet puts on a floor and like hey
0:34:59 Johnny can you break did you break this
0:35:00 for me Johnny kind of looks down at the
0:35:03 amulet with like just kind of like
0:35:04 distain of like you really want to break
0:35:07 him in the middle of me and just kind of
0:35:08 casually move away from it they kind of
0:35:11 they all right we roll initiative
0:35:14 NOP uh there's six of them they are
0:35:16 going full auto goons are going on 12
0:35:18 what you got 24 I'm going on a seven I'm
0:35:22 going on a
0:35:23 [Music]
0:35:25 nine
0:35:28 so Johnny is going to um with an
0:35:31 indignant snarl on his face step forward
0:35:35 amidst these Ghouls and is just going to
0:35:39 like take a whirlwind step forward
0:35:42 swinging his arms and bashing these guys
0:35:45 amongst their heads and he is going to
0:35:47 split his action into five separate
0:35:50 strikes um leaving just a single one of
0:35:52 them standing Johnny unleashes a
0:35:54 hurricane and go ahead and give me five
0:35:57 rules um because his attack is 15 dice
0:36:00 that means I'll have three dice for each
0:36:03 guy uh four successes on the first one
0:36:06 oh my
0:36:08 God I got it uh one success on the next
0:36:14 one four successes on the next
0:36:20 one one success on the next
0:36:24 one four more success oh my God he
0:36:28 rolled three dice for each of those uh
0:36:31 I'll spend a single point of uh Neil's
0:36:33 blood for uh
0:36:36 potent unfortunately I'm not I'm no
0:36:39 longer potent eight okay so you have a
0:36:40 mere five automatic successes I'm all of
0:36:47 this and two more successes on the three
0:36:50 dice so eights and tens eights and
0:36:54 tens okay they so two two of them will
0:36:58 take six bashing damage three of them
0:37:01 will take eight bashing damage which
0:37:03 knocks them unconscious and wraps one
0:37:05 into lethal so Johnny leaps forward with
0:37:11 a Flurry of Blows that drops five out of
0:37:16 the six two of them are still conscious
0:37:18 but on the ground the rest of them are
0:37:20 laid out
0:37:21 cold one is
0:37:24 standing they will drop their weapon
0:37:28 good
0:37:29 move spend WP on this
0:37:32 Neil shoot you in the [ __ ] head is
0:37:36 this Eden yes it is she has one success
0:37:40 to hit you I don't get the body armor in
0:37:42 this right shot me in the head I rolled
0:37:44 two t but I do not have any sort of spec
0:37:47 so I will soak two damage you will
0:37:49 merely take three lethal to the head as
0:37:51 a bullet is fired straight into your eye
0:37:54 socket and your head snaps back that's
0:37:56 my first injury then I I assume I got to
0:37:58 make a frenzy that's correct your
0:38:00 self-control is cap that your blood
0:38:02 poool I'm going to spend a wart on this
0:38:05 I do not want a frenzy on Eden right
0:38:08 now with 11 one 17 and The Willpower I
0:38:12 have one success you do not
0:38:16 frenzy ow [ __ ] Eden looks [ __ ]
0:38:21 shocked that she did that but when it's
0:38:24 on
0:38:25 you
0:38:27 if there's a question whether you need a
0:38:28 frenzy chop you need a frenzy chop right
0:38:31 indeed someone just shot my emotional
0:38:33 support milk roll it I also do not want
0:38:37 to kill the little girl kill the
0:38:41 baby one
0:38:44 success willpower well
0:38:47 spent wind looks super [ __ ] close to
0:38:53 just shoving people out of the way and
0:38:55 tearing Eden to shred
0:38:57 RS but something in her holds back her
0:39:02 basest
0:39:04 instincts and she instead drags Neil can
0:39:09 she grab the amulet too yeah the amulets
0:39:12 being held pretty out in the open for
0:39:14 you guys she will drag Neil out of the
0:39:17 line of
0:39:19 fire grab the amulet along the way
0:39:23 and hands shaking for maybe the first
0:39:26 time in a very long time she just kind
0:39:29 of holds she pulls her shirt off and
0:39:31 holds pressure on Neil's wound she's
0:39:35 wearing multiple shirts it's New England
0:39:37 and she's a Gangrel it's also actually
0:39:38 really sweet because like Neil's vampire
0:39:41 is not bleeding actively but that like
0:39:42 in the immediate Instinct yeah I have I
0:39:45 have to keep him safe and I am panicking
0:39:47 because he's been hurt when take steps
0:39:49 to protect Neil Neil what do you
0:39:53 do it's it's not it's it's not their
0:39:56 fault to somebody probably probably the
0:39:59 seti but somebody somebody got inside
0:40:01 them I know I mean not physically inside
0:40:03 them but like is is Neil Neil I'm not
0:40:06 even making a joke about what you just
0:40:08 said corrupting the bonds I I get it
0:40:10 okay I get it but so you're the guy who
0:40:13 sees stuff and you just got shot in the
0:40:15 [ __ ] head in the eye I I know I I
0:40:18 it's not her fault can you also looks
0:40:21 like pissed he he look he's not okay
0:40:23 yeah with what happened um also had to
0:40:26 like keep the Beast down but is seems to
0:40:29 be like dealing with it by just throwing
0:40:31 his brain directly into puzzle mode and
0:40:33 being like what do I do what do I do
0:40:35 what do I do can you figure out a way to
0:40:36 destroy this thing I mean if we just
0:40:39 snap it I I don't know anything else
0:40:40 than that like I told miles before I
0:40:42 don't know how to Once magic is in play
0:40:44 it's probably in play but I I don't know
0:40:47 it's it's at least not good to have do
0:40:49 you know some way to like a null magic
0:40:51 are we out of rounds no that's not a
0:40:53 thing I know how to do um no we're not I
0:40:56 don't think it is still Neil's go yeah
0:40:58 but I can at least buy us time to think
0:41:01 about it and how far did you pull like
0:41:04 can we still see Johnny through the door
0:41:05 yeah okay um yeah she she didn't take
0:41:08 him far like if they were in the doorway
0:41:10 she basically just took him and pulled
0:41:12 him to the side of the door like
0:41:14 realistically they could probably shoot
0:41:16 through the wall all right so I I just I
0:41:18 need to bi us time to think and I'm
0:41:20 going to vanish from The Mind's Eye the
0:41:23 five of us go for it cuz I also don't
0:41:25 want to leave like miles body when they
0:41:27 [ __ ] hate him just standing right
0:41:31 there I have six successes on Advantage
0:41:34 from The Mind's Eye to hit all of us
0:41:37 plus them which actually uh it depends
0:41:40 what is their um what is their wits plus
0:41:43 alertness six okay so yes I have that
0:41:46 many I have what did I say six successes
0:41:49 M with more than three we Disappear
0:41:51 Completely and if we score more than the
0:41:54 observer's willpower rating uh they
0:41:57 forget that we were here in the first
0:41:58 place you have okay so everybody in the
0:42:02 room forgets that we were ever here as
0:42:04 all of us disappear hold on nobody move
0:42:07 we just need to think and we'll
0:42:10 disappear all of us so miles's body br's
0:42:12 body when Johnny and Neil all vanish so
0:42:16 thoroughly they forget we existed if I
0:42:19 act as I going to break it for the rest
0:42:20 of you no it'll just break it for you
0:42:23 okay um but right now like would
0:42:26 probably see okay correct me if I'm
0:42:28 wrong Alex but you would probably see
0:42:30 that like you are mid fist fight with
0:42:32 someone and then a look in their face
0:42:34 like they forgot they were even there
0:42:36 fighting you yep like they just blank
0:42:38 out as if like they're not even aware
0:42:40 they're in a fight round two Johnny
0:42:44 Johnny seeing that they are unawares of
0:42:46 him will take a step further in and he
0:42:50 is going to perform two grapples he is
0:42:53 going to snatch the last goon who
0:42:55 dropped his gun by the lapels and he is
0:42:59 going to grab Eden by the hand holding
0:43:02 the gun and he is intending to just lift
0:43:04 her up off her feet with the gun pointed
0:43:08 straight up with his hand just over top
0:43:11 of her hand go for it remember you do
0:43:14 get the dice bonus for surprising them
0:43:16 which is how many dice uh you roll steth
0:43:20 stealth it is not contested because you
0:43:23 are invisible so you just roll your Dex
0:43:24 plus stealth and then every success will
0:43:26 give you an extra
0:43:28 die two successes Lex am I close enough
0:43:31 to be actually able to just take a free
0:43:33 step to be behind them yeah all right so
0:43:36 uh to grab the
0:43:38 ghoul four successes to gra uh to
0:43:41 Grapple the ghoul
0:43:42 grappled three successes to Grapple Eden
0:43:46 grappled uh with Johnny's Last Action uh
0:43:49 he will feed from the ghoul how much you
0:43:52 taking you can take up to three with an
0:43:53 action I am taking three Okay so Johnny
0:43:56 is standing there feeding from the ghoul
0:43:59 and hoisting Eden up by the hand holding
0:44:03 the gun letting her dangle uh the ghoul
0:44:07 has like no hope of breaking her grapple
0:44:11 so I'm just going to kind of not worry
0:44:13 about that all right we cut to win is
0:44:17 there like a pendant on this amulet it
0:44:19 is a blue glazed Earth and wear amulet
0:44:22 desperate for ideas at this point when
0:44:25 just kind of takes what if there's a
0:44:26 center pendant on it or a piece that
0:44:28 looks like it's supposed to be the focal
0:44:30 point yep she just snaps it okay when
0:44:33 that
0:44:34 happens the ghouls and Eden seem
0:44:37 overwhelmed with emotional exhaustion
0:44:40 and just
0:44:41 collapse when kind of pauses for a
0:44:43 minute just kind of holding the two
0:44:45 halves and listening and then she kind
0:44:49 of shoves the halves in different
0:44:51 pockets and helps kneel toward the car
0:44:55 NE shakes his head where are you going
0:44:58 where are we going we're not going to
0:44:59 stay here why not there's no better to
0:45:03 be right now who knows who they called
0:45:05 before we got here man and we can find
0:45:07 out we'll find out but we don't have
0:45:09 time to go anywhere and what we're still
0:45:12 in a crisis mode we we have to pick a
0:45:14 place and I feel like that place has to
0:45:16 be here okay and she will instead help
0:45:19 him she will peek in the doorway to see
0:45:23 what the situation is you see
0:45:26 Johnny surrounded by a bunch of tired
0:45:28 people Johnny are they under control
0:45:30 enough to bring them in Johnny takes
0:45:32 another three points of blood understood
0:45:34 from the same guy oh yeah oh boy I need
0:45:37 a conscience
0:45:40 check one success you don't feel great
0:45:43 about that this guy's probably not going
0:45:45 to make it even a ghoul yeah yeah you uh
0:45:49 took six pints of blood out of his body
0:45:51 doesn't he have
0:45:52 eight well he's dying yeah
0:45:56 yeah are we out of rounds Le you are out
0:45:59 of
0:46:04 rounds as when a Neil steep back inside
0:46:07 seeing Johnny feed at all on on it's
0:46:10 okay I mean well it's not okay but this
0:46:12 is not their fault the Stites got to
0:46:14 them Johnny drops them um I don't know
0:46:17 what to do about it hopefully that works
0:46:20 with the with the pendant when you broke
0:46:21 it it's broken I I broke it it was Clay
0:46:25 okay now we got to get back to [ __ ]
0:46:26 figure it out Eden how are you feeling
0:46:29 are you are you you are you
0:46:32 alive I don't feel good I I bet I I bet
0:46:37 you don't yeah hey quick question and I
0:46:42 know you don't feel well how do you feel
0:46:43 about miles right now what or any of us
0:46:46 I don't understand that fine okay Neil
0:46:50 takes like a huge audible breath of
0:46:53 relief okay I think it fixed it
0:46:56 um okay so now we got to figure out what
0:46:59 do we do with them we got to get them
0:47:01 back on their feet we got to put out
0:47:04 your cigarette and go to bed well hold
0:47:05 on she shouldn't be alone right now
0:47:07 either just you curl up on the couch
0:47:09 maybe or that's fine I mostly put the
0:47:11 cigarette out she looks pretty surprised
0:47:13 that she has a cigarette don't put it
0:47:16 out give it to Johnny she just Johnny's
0:47:19 still holding her in the air by the way
0:47:21 yeah but with in the other hand she's
0:47:22 like he uh have her having dropped the
0:47:25 the ghoul he takes takes the cigarette
0:47:27 from her and starts smoking it she's
0:47:29 like a totally incompetent smoker like
0:47:31 the the cigarette butts like slick and
0:47:34 she clearly held in her mouth the wrong
0:47:36 way and like with the filter on the
0:47:39 outside no I think gared understands
0:47:41 what I
0:47:42 mean yeah I do I
0:47:45 do the just just in case the audience
0:47:47 can't see my look of utter disgust
0:47:49 pretty
0:47:51 intense
0:47:53 um okay okay let's then let's get get
0:47:55 them in NE go sit on the couch with Eden
0:47:57 get okay he he sets Eden down on her
0:48:01 feet and kind of gives a an upset look
0:48:04 at the ghoul I probably took way too
0:48:06 much blood from him um does m have are
0:48:10 there a merchant does miles have
0:48:12 emergency supplies like medkits blood
0:48:15 transfusion kits uh Johnny looks at one
0:48:17 of the ghouls who's not unconscious but
0:48:20 just like incapped on the ground where's
0:48:23 where are the blood stores the supplies
0:48:25 in the house across the street but not
0:48:29 blood I I got
0:48:31 it and windl is deeply upset how much is
0:48:35 going to keep him from
0:48:36 dying I I don't know I'm not I don't
0:48:38 have any medical
0:48:40 training we probably if he's got a
0:48:42 chance to we probably need like an
0:48:44 actual doctor in here um but it would be
0:48:47 really [ __ ] up to keep a doctor in
0:48:49 here and I don't know miles's roll aex
0:48:50 for that kind of thing Johnny do you for
0:48:53 a doctor yes not really um okay all
0:48:59 right get them in let's lock the door
0:49:02 problem two getting miles and and BR
0:49:05 back on their
0:49:06 feet now because the city is without a
0:49:09 prince and that is really really bad
0:49:12 right now specifically right now
0:49:13 specifically because Neil Neil we're not
0:49:15 going to start discussing what to do
0:49:17 until we've done the first things on the
0:49:19 list let's get everybody inside you want
0:49:22 me sitting on the couch I'll I'll make
0:49:23 the list but

0:49:27 Johnny while you were out I saw it like
0:49:31 capital S saw it the sabat coming now
0:49:35 this is a bad time for the city to be

0:50:51 Kindred I'm remembering what all of them
0:50:53 are at this point so you'll have to
0:50:55 describe your Eerie presence your Co
0:50:58 your Cobra eyes your sorry cobra face
0:51:01 seagull eyes your you scales in the
0:51:04 sides yep I think she's got a hood on so
0:51:07 it's can't see the scales so less
0:51:11 scary less
0:51:13 weird I just love the fact that Kabir is
0:51:17 the one crazy [ __ ] who sees this
0:51:20 and it's like
0:51:22 yeah I'm [ __ ] rock hard right now
0:51:24 let's go it's so funny cuz we've seen
0:51:27 kind of like a series of a few guys be
0:51:29 like yeah win and now seeing Wynn interact
0:51:31 with regular ass Mortals now I'm just
0:51:34 imagining being a college kid like
0:51:35 drunkenly making out with some hot
0:51:37 chicken New Haven and looking up to see
0:51:40 this [ __ ] like evil looking vagrant
0:51:42 being like you want to know somewhere
0:51:44 good to go being like what girl we got
0:51:47 to get out of
0:51:51 here the mood it's
0:51:54 dead but seriously if you could describe
0:51:57 your eie presence we haven't got that in
0:51:59 a while so I don't know that Wynn has
0:52:02 described her Eerie presence since maybe
0:52:04 like episode two or
0:52:06 three
0:52:11 um I know all the good [ __ ]
0:52:14 spots for
0:52:18 real this a first
0:52:21 date [ __ ] wind you want Bailey's out
0:52:25 of a
0:52:35 boot Lex is this pretty much how you
0:52:37 thought it was going to go if I going to
0:52:40 be totally honest yes has it exceeded
0:52:43 your
0:52:44 expectations it has you're doing great
0:52:48 thanks thanks this is Wynn in the city as
0:52:51 opposed to hunting in the woods it's
0:52:53 pretty much this is why Wynn has people
0:52:55 like miles and BR I'm old
0:52:58 [Music]
0:53:02 way guys for real is there anything to
0:53:05 say at this point
