0:00:25 now let's walk the path of
0:00:27 [Music]
0:00:29 path of now
0:00:36 last time on path of night
0:00:40 the Quarry met in the VIP lounge to talk
0:00:42 objectives
0:00:45 the black hand arrived to the Rave and
0:00:48 joined in their conversation
0:00:50 but have figured out that dark Celine
0:00:52 was hiding herself within their ranks an
0:00:55 informed Pendragon
0:00:57 Neil took issue with this leading to a
0:01:00 disagreement between him and wing
0:01:02 when and weathers danced spoke of
0:01:05 feelings responsibilities and politics
0:01:09 the Rave continued
0:01:12 [Music]
0:01:27 brother
0:01:28 you make your escape to the dance floor
0:01:31 Britta knows a shield from Neil and she
0:01:36 also said an objective earlier and that
0:01:38 objective is to dance with the codery
0:01:41 each member of the codery
0:01:43 she did promise or rather requests first
0:01:46 Sans from Johnny so effectively she's
0:01:49 making a beeline for Johnny and miles to
0:01:52 see if either one of them is going to
0:01:54 take her up on their end of the deal but
0:01:57 regardless just by her body language
0:01:59 it's relatively apparent that her
0:02:02 intention is
0:02:03 to go on the dance floor and start the
0:02:06 process up you Mingle others dancing a
0:02:11 lot of flirting in one instance there is
0:02:15 a man who recognizes you from the
0:02:18 mansion

0:02:22 and he says to you
0:02:24 as not a lot of us that made it out

0:02:43 remember that that

0:02:51 very short distance and they go Ruby oh

0:03:15 back is a katana on his chest there is a
0:03:18 tattoo in bold letters and not quite

0:06:19 and just starts dancing with Britta away
0:06:22 from the three of them he goes who the
0:06:23 [ __ ] is this and as she tries to storm
0:06:25 at you a dog and Sea Dog actually get

0:06:43 the dead villains imma get you Johnny on
0:06:45 all of them Rufio don't take no [ __ ]
0:06:48 Johnny's going to turn back over the
0:06:51 shoulder and go try it but then give him
0:06:54 a dread gaze and Flash fangs go for it
0:06:58 uh your difficulty five
0:07:00 his courage is five uh no no no no okay
0:07:04 his courage is four
0:07:06 three successes I think that's where
0:07:09 they run Rufio turns and flees and a dog
0:07:13 looks at you Johnny's like you're the
0:07:16 host man I don't I don't want to like
0:07:17 make you worry but this guy's kind of
0:07:19 dangerous he's probably getting his gun
0:07:21 right now and they're kind of like they
0:07:23 kind of look look worrisome over in the
0:07:25 direction uh Sea Dog speaks up and he's
0:07:28 like look we're gonna go talk to our
0:07:30 side and make sure that he doesn't want
0:07:31 to like go after you or nothing Johnny
0:07:33 kind of dances for a second with Alberta
0:07:35 then turns back
0:07:37 you two seem cool enough all right you
0:07:40 got my permission to stay here but if
0:07:42 you go chasing after that the weeb
0:07:44 Chinese kind of shakes his head and
0:07:45 keeps on dancing all right they're gonna
0:07:47 throw it against the event killums
0:07:48 [Laughter]
0:07:56 a dog gives you a panic look and runs to
0:07:59 chase after his sire
0:08:01 Sea Dog gives another panic look first
0:08:06 too because of a sire and then because
0:08:08 of his best friend and rude me and he
0:08:10 looks at you and he's like I'm gonna
0:08:13 chill here I'm gonna let a dog see to it
0:08:14 they got like a promise thing going on
0:08:15 they gotta look after each other no
0:08:17 matter what uh but I'm gonna try to keep
0:08:20 it cool so it kind of nods at him I can
0:08:23 respect that he looks to Britta the dress
0:08:26 is fat
0:08:28 and then he saunters away
0:08:30 so as Johnny returns and is willing and
0:08:33 actually like maybe out of spite but
0:08:35 Britta knows she's got him here for the
0:08:37 dance that she requested so what she's
0:08:40 gonna do is I want to use my dancing
0:08:43 skill to make Johnny look as cool as
0:08:46 possible I want to make him the guy that
0:08:50 anyone who wants to dance with anyone
0:08:51 wants to dance with I want to make him
0:08:53 look great give me a dexterity plus
0:08:56 performance role remember toriador his
0:08:59 Celerity adds to all Dex rolls does
0:09:02 graceful apply it sure does are you uh
0:09:05 spending woolfire cut so few
0:09:09 but it's also dancing so I figured I'd
0:09:10 check
0:09:12 I was thinking about it in case that
0:09:15 didn't come through
0:09:16 no
0:09:18 [Music]
0:09:20 it's like exalted levels of dice
0:09:22 difficulty
0:09:24 six surprisingly that's only four
0:09:26 successes but it is four successes okay
0:09:29 so you casually roll super well
0:09:33 describe the dance
0:09:37 so britta's own style of dancing tends
0:09:41 to be more feminine and sensual but
0:09:44 that's not really the focus for this
0:09:46 moment there's very few moments where
0:09:48 she is focusing on how she is coming
0:09:51 across because the entire purpose in
0:09:54 this moment is making Johnny the guy
0:09:58 so hopefully if he's kind of willing to
0:10:02 go along with us and she's trying to
0:10:04 make it fun for him and trying to like
0:10:07 kind of demonstrate her intention but in
0:10:10 that kind of quiet way that friends can
0:10:13 share communication almost in that way
0:10:16 of making her affection for him and how
0:10:19 cool she knows him to be come through in
0:10:22 the ways that she can try to get him to
0:10:25 move kind of teach him and lead him or
0:10:28 just move him herself and to make him
0:10:31 look like he's the one taking the lead
0:10:33 at certain points that he's the one who
0:10:36 can kind of have that Swagger to him or
0:10:38 the one who has like I want to take the
0:10:41 things that I know about Johnny and kind
0:10:45 of like the energy that he's brought
0:10:47 with his Persona and his uh outfit and
0:10:50 everything I want to amp it up so in
0:10:54 essence you are going to draw attention
0:10:56 to his chest and biceps I mean again
0:10:58 yeah she just works out the baby
0:11:00 emotions
0:11:01 Johnny catches on to what she's doing
0:11:04 and kind of realizes that he's really
0:11:07 too stiff
0:11:09 on the Dance Floor to really do anything
0:11:11 impressive
0:11:12 um in terms of like footwork or anything
0:11:16 so instead he tries to to keep up with
0:11:19 the beat and how she's moving and kind
0:11:23 of just will
0:11:25 switch between different kind of like
0:11:27 strong poses and like will like give her
0:11:32 support to do fancy moves so she's she's
0:11:35 doing all of the fancy dancing and he is
0:11:38 just being kind of a commanding pose
0:11:41 next to her
0:11:42 trying to look like he's the one
0:11:44 directing this incredible dancing around
0:11:47 him as this like really strong dance
0:11:49 partner Bradley will do the technical
0:11:51 work the flirtation the energy with the
0:11:53 crowd and any of that and make Johnny
0:11:56 the cool guy that he is well you
0:11:59 successfully make him the cool guy
0:12:01 Johnny for the rest of the Rave you will
0:12:04 receive a number of bonus dice on your
0:12:05 socials equal to half of British
0:12:07 successes so you will enjoy plus two die
0:12:10 bonus to your social roles for the rest
0:12:12 of the Rave by the way to my status
0:12:14 affect the social roles as well if they
0:12:18 are a camera yes okay yes they do
0:12:22 when the dance is Sun Greta will thank
0:12:25 Johnny for the dance and
0:12:27 look to pick out more targets he gives
0:12:30 you like kind of a half smile and it's
0:12:32 like thank me for the dance thank you
0:12:35 kid
0:12:36 how the hell you managed to make me look
0:12:38 all right out here
0:12:39 some Mysteries will never be known I
0:12:42 didn't point out anything that wasn't
0:12:44 true yeah yeah he passed you on the back
0:12:46 if those goons give any more trouble
0:12:48 though yeah they're that they're
0:12:50 probably going to oh
0:12:53 if you see him back in the club you let
0:12:55 me know will do
0:13:01 Neil
0:13:02 you've been skulking around this Rave
0:13:05 for a little while where are you what
0:13:07 are you doing Neil is one of the least
0:13:10 comfortable times that he's ever been in
0:13:12 his life but instead of just doing the
0:13:14 full Wallflower he's doing a thing where
0:13:17 you're anonymous in the middle of a
0:13:18 crowd like things are so crowded that
0:13:20 nobody's really looking at you and he's
0:13:22 just sort of weaving his way between all
0:13:24 the people deep inside his own thoughts
0:13:28 kind of looking out for Jane because he
0:13:31 was like I he doesn't really know what
0:13:32 to do right now and was like okay I'm
0:13:34 supposed to follow her lead kind of
0:13:36 looking out for Sabbat and the people
0:13:39 that they're all supposed to stay away
0:13:40 from kind of looking for the rest of his
0:13:44 codery looking for the patterns in the
0:13:46 room and some small part of him in the
0:13:49 back of his head is also kind of looking
0:13:51 for
0:13:52 this is a bruja Rave and
0:13:55 there's a there's sort of a
0:13:56 self-preserving part of him that is also
0:13:58 kind of on the lookout for the woman
0:14:00 that his sire left torped in a shower
0:14:03 last time but he's not actively looking
0:14:05 for her there's just like a small part
0:14:06 of his brand that's like on the alert
0:14:08 for danger and that's what he's doing
0:14:10 he's just kind of wending his way
0:14:12 through the crowd looking out for people
0:14:13 and trying to get a sense of there's a
0:14:16 moment in any big crowd where it turns
0:14:19 from a party into a riot and he's like
0:14:21 hyper sensitive hyper Vigilant to like
0:14:24 that feeling right now trying to relax
0:14:27 but not doing a very good job of it
0:14:29 as you're creeping through the crowd
0:14:31 minding your own business you feel an
0:14:35 urge I need for fresh air
0:14:39 when you turn
0:14:41 a new skulk your way to the entrance and
0:14:46 you step outside or there is a crowd of
0:14:49 bruja gathered and sitting on top of a
0:14:52 taxi with her feet kind of dangling over
0:14:56 the edge
0:14:57 singing sea shanties with some of her
0:15:01 fellow clan mates
0:15:02 you find Jane and you find yourself
0:15:05 needing to present yourself to her
0:15:07 Neil walks up to like the peripheral
0:15:11 like right at the edge of the crowd
0:15:12 around this taxi and
0:15:15 sort of straightens himself up to his
0:15:17 full height and puts a hand in the air
0:15:19 and just kind of gives a lame Little
0:15:21 Wave yes uh
0:15:24 I don't interim song but hi Jin I'm
0:15:27 sorry I'm here she stops singing and the
0:15:32 the it kind of dies down a bit and as
0:15:36 emotions for you to come on over hi Neil
0:15:40 hi that's um
0:15:43 hi sorry I was talking to Johnny and
0:15:46 everyone and then I was looking around
0:15:48 and but here you are hi I was wondering
0:15:51 okay
0:15:53 as she brings us up a number of the bra
0:15:56 kind of like give you slightly derisive
0:16:01 looks
0:16:02 it's it's not that they don't want you
0:16:05 there but it's more like
0:16:08 these guys are all gathered around Jane
0:16:11 because they all want Jane's attention
0:16:14 so if I were to drop what she's doing
0:16:16 look at you they're not overly thrilled
0:16:19 and she gestures to you and looks at the
0:16:22 other bruja and she says this is Neil
0:16:27 he's a friend and he knows about Khalif
0:16:30 and one of the couple were like [ __ ]
0:16:32 what and they look at you and they're
0:16:34 like what is is Khalif real is it a
0:16:37 thing what is it and they start like
0:16:38 badgering you about Khalif
0:16:42 [ __ ] great uh
0:16:44 uh he like presses himself sort of with
0:16:48 his back up against the taxi near Jane
0:16:51 like as close as he can get not
0:16:53 comfortable being sort of pressed in by
0:16:55 a crowd of brew having us yeah um it's
0:16:57 uh yeah of course it's it's real yeah
0:17:00 I'm um I had a lot uh the premiere took
0:17:03 a bunch away but uh Johnny actually [ __ ]

0:17:21 while I still have some left
0:17:23 um uh I I managed to save a bunch I I
0:17:26 haven't really gotten a chance to get my
0:17:27 feet back under me yet but I was gonna
0:17:29 start
0:17:30 you know
0:17:31 um
0:17:32 growing and cultivating a lot more I
0:17:34 used to do it myself fed it with my own
0:17:36 blood so I kind of looked between each
0:17:39 other do you sell
0:17:41 I usually use it for like ritual but I
0:17:45 mean if I had enough I guess so I mean I
0:17:47 sort of sell right so like there's um
0:17:49 who you sell one asks not directly but
0:17:52 usually through intermediar areas to the
0:17:54 Mortal populace but I mean I have some
0:17:58 he like fumbles around in his pockets I
0:18:01 don't have a lot right now but I've got
0:18:03 some how much you got one of the masks
0:18:05 uh minor boon
0:18:08 oh
0:18:09 um that was like go two two minus two
0:18:10 miners Neil sort of passed around his
0:18:12 pockets
0:18:13 um I I mean I don't have a ton left like
0:18:16 some is still cultivating I only have
0:18:18 this and he pulls out one of those like
0:18:20 gallon Ziploc bags out of one of the
0:18:23 huge stupid pockets in his pants that is
0:18:25 like three quarters full like stuffed
0:18:28 the other one calls out two miners a

0:18:49 and she's like Neil everybody knows
0:18:51 about Khalif they literally just asked
0:18:54 me if it's real it was a thing maybe
0:18:57 some think some feel it used to be a
0:18:59 pretty big part of bruja culture oh we
0:19:03 have a pretty big history with the
0:19:05 Assamites in Carthage okay yeah um
0:19:09 well [ __ ] I um
0:19:11 I guess Jane I never did like thank you
0:19:14 for bringing me so and he's just kind of
0:19:16 like pushes the bag towards Jane if this
0:19:19 is like a like a a special thing like a
0:19:22 ritualistic thing for the bruja I mean
0:19:23 that's you know one time thanks for
0:19:25 having me at your party guys and he just
0:19:27 hands the bag over to Jane the bruh all
0:19:30 kind of at least those who are in the
0:19:32 know is the curious
0:19:34 at this point you kind of have the
0:19:36 attention of the crowd and their eyes
0:19:37 all follow the bag a chain gracefully
0:19:41 accepts and she reaches up and grabs you
0:19:44 by the collar and pulls you down so
0:19:46 you're not so tall for a moment and she
0:19:48 kisses you on the cheek
0:19:50 Neil doesn't vanish from The Mind's Eye
0:19:53 mostly because he you're grappled so two
0:19:56 grappled and stunned yeah
0:19:58 um it's really not that uh it's not a
0:20:01 big deal I I like I said I'm growing
0:20:03 more now
0:20:04 um trying to cultivate a lot more it
0:20:05 just it takes time now they just want to
0:20:08 get high oh well then yeah we could get
0:20:11 high that's just do it yeah
0:20:14 all right
0:20:16 um
0:20:16 I don't have to worry about the side
0:20:18 effects because none of you are mortal
0:20:20 so chain points inside let's get inside
0:20:23 find a spot let's get a room
0:20:25 one of the bra puts an arm around you
0:20:27 and say Hey you think we could uh
0:20:31 get into the VIP room
0:20:33 smoke it up oh uh I'd have to
0:20:37 Neil almost says I'd have to check with
0:20:40 Johnny but I assume at this point this
0:20:42 is probably around the time that he and
0:20:43 Britta are dancing oh you're not sure I
0:20:45 don't know I don't know where he is yeah
0:20:47 I'd have to check with and then he
0:20:50 doesn't want to not look cool for like
0:20:51 the first time in his life I just goes
0:20:54 yeah probably
0:20:56 yeah it's probably okay
0:20:58 um yeah I mean it's I'm sure it's I'm
0:21:01 sure Johnny wouldn't mind I'm sure it's
0:21:03 fine at this point
0:21:05 you are Dragged In by this throng of
0:21:09 excitable bruja and they like patio in
0:21:12 the back and they like give you like
0:21:13 joking shoves and they're just kind of
0:21:16 having fun joking around but it is a
0:21:18 frightening and jostling experience
0:21:20 despite the fact that getting high and
0:21:23 being weird is his wheelhouse this is
0:21:25 still deeply uncomfortable for Neil yeah
0:21:28 it's it's very much like being
0:21:29 surrounded by a dozen very big very
0:21:32 strong excitable pit bulls who all want
0:21:36 you to take them for a walk
0:21:38 um
0:21:39 okay
0:21:41 you get to the VIP and they go in there
0:21:43 loud people are throwing their boots up
0:21:45 on couches and they start reading a
0:21:50 table they get a bowl they start closing
0:21:52 off the space
0:21:54 one of them kind of starts fiddling with
0:21:57 the fire alarm in the room
0:21:59 that's probably a good idea
0:22:01 um
0:22:02 so
0:22:04 so are we just um getting
0:22:07 we're just doing this like normal do you
0:22:09 guys have like a historical thing that
0:22:10 you want to do here because I know that
0:22:12 it really crosses like the whole Jane
0:22:14 speaks up what's like normal how do you
0:22:15 do this what show us oh she's like come
0:22:18 here come on come sit here um like
0:22:21 brings you to the middle of the room
0:22:22 Neil comes in the middle well it depends
0:22:25 sometimes I get Mortals really high and
0:22:26 I feed off of them but with enough you
0:22:29 can do it on your own
0:22:30 um
0:22:31 police kind of special that way
0:22:34 and not knowing what else to do because
0:22:36 he doesn't get Khalif casual high he
0:22:38 literally only uses it for like magic
0:22:40 purposes sure buddy that's what he does
0:22:43 because this shits are hard to come by
0:22:45 Magic is Loosely defined here yeah Neil
0:22:49 basically starts setting up the room as
0:22:52 if he was going to ascend the ladder of
0:22:54 Heaven just there's like no bull there's
0:22:55 no whatever so just like getting
0:22:58 everyone as into like the smoke as
0:23:02 possible
0:23:03 feeding and like drinking blood he like
0:23:06 loosens his shirt a little bit like
0:23:08 pulls a collar just kind of gets relaxed
0:23:10 tries to relax and just goes okay so as
0:23:13 you as you take it all in
0:23:15 just
0:23:17 let your mind
0:23:19 go
0:23:21 so the the body itself is an impediment
0:23:24 to
0:23:26 um the Transcendence of the Mind
0:23:29 so
0:23:31 a lot of people work on the discipline
0:23:33 of their bodies and and sort of neglect
0:23:34 how fragile their minds can be so what
0:23:37 you need to do is just relax don't think
0:23:40 about the things that scare you
0:23:43 don't think about the things that are
0:23:45 dangerous think about the things that
0:23:47 are
0:23:49 Pleasant calming pleasurable think about
0:23:53 the things that you want
0:23:54 and then just live there
0:23:57 don't try and transcend past the point
0:24:01 where you are living with the ideas of
0:24:05 the things that you want
0:24:06 and sort of unconsciously Neil has this
0:24:09 idea in his head ever since he found out
0:24:11 miles and Britta have been sort of broken
0:24:13 by whatever happened in that Chantry
0:24:16 that if he could help them not really
0:24:19 Ascend the latter because they're not a
0:24:22 shipu but like if he can sort of Sherpa
0:24:24 them off to self-actualization he may be
0:24:28 able to do something about the fractured
0:24:30 parts of their minds
0:24:32 and I think because Neil's humanity is
0:24:35 not super high up there right now and
0:24:37 because he's not comfortable I think he
0:24:39 accidentally sort of unconsciously
0:24:41 starts going into a mode where he's sort
0:24:44 of practicing like leading this group of
0:24:46 bruja to some point along the ladder
0:24:50 this is not really a thing that he can
0:24:52 do but sort of leading him on like a
0:24:55 like a meditative Journey with the
0:24:58 intention of not actually reaching
0:25:00 actualization but just stopping at
0:25:01 pleasure
0:25:02 so a lot of there's a couple of bra that
0:25:06 can't help the [ __ ] around they don't
0:25:07 really have an off switch
0:25:08 bought a lot of them once you start
0:25:11 getting like talking about spirituality
0:25:13 and all of these Concepts uh they get
0:25:16 pretty into it and
0:25:18 Jane even kind of swoons a little bit
0:25:21 and
0:25:23 they start kind of taking turns talking
0:25:27 about the things that make them happy
0:25:29 and for Jane she says bringing truth to
0:25:34 power that is what makes me happy and
0:25:37 some of the Brewers are like [ __ ] yeah
0:25:38 and they're like weather and one of
0:25:41 them's like I like dogs and they're like
0:25:44 yeah now they're like all very
0:25:45 encouraging as they kind of go over a
0:25:48 very wide range of things that make them
0:25:52 happy and you start kind of getting this
0:25:56 feel that the the people you're
0:25:59 interacting with are a lot more like
0:26:02 diverse than one would assume When
0:26:05 approaching a group of bruja
0:26:08 but eventually while like you know the
0:26:11 the Khalif is cooking and is he and it's
0:26:15 starting the smoke is starting to kind
0:26:16 of fill the room it becomes your turn to
0:26:19 answer
0:26:21 Neil is quiet for an uncomfortably long
0:26:26 amount of time and clearly needs
0:26:29 it's partly that he needs encouragement
0:26:31 to talk
0:26:32 even in this scenario where he's Central
0:26:35 and it's partly that he doesn't seem to
0:26:37 grasp
0:26:38 the idea
0:26:41 and he starts to just look as one of the
0:26:45 one of the last times I I I tried to do
0:26:48 this
0:26:49 um not the last time but one of the
0:26:51 anyway I um
0:26:54 I got here and it was just an empty an
0:26:59 empty room I I didn't know I didn't know
0:27:01 what I wanted
0:27:02 uh now
0:27:04 a good thing that makes me happy is
0:27:06 having a
0:27:07 having a purpose having an outlet having
0:27:10 a family having
0:27:12 people around that helped to ground me
0:27:16 and Define me
0:27:18 knowing my place in the world even
0:27:21 as the world ends
0:27:23 knowing where I'm supposed to be in it
0:27:26 certainty that's
0:27:28 that's the ideal those few moments of
0:27:31 certainty
0:27:32 and knowing knowing that you're cared
0:27:35 about and that you're loved and that
0:27:37 you're not
0:27:38 only worthy because of the things you
0:27:40 can do
0:27:42 but because you are who you are
0:27:45 he doesn't know what he's he's
0:27:47 absolutely crying a little bit when he
0:27:49 says that he just is not aware that he's
0:27:51 crying you got a lot of like yeah man
0:27:53 yeah a couple Pat you on the back
0:27:57 uh
0:28:00 yeah so anyway that's uh that that's it
0:28:04 um who's who's next is it somebody else
0:28:06 somebody else goes after or we just is
0:28:08 this where we're at now
0:28:10 I lost count Jane laughs
0:28:12 she's like there's no structure to this
0:28:15 oh that is it's actually really deep
0:28:20 she's like yeah yeah hi so I mean that's
0:28:24 the thing right like
0:28:26 tramir trying
0:28:29 they see magic and things like
0:28:31 like trying to order the world and and
0:28:33 make it all [ __ ] the premiere
0:28:36 the whole room kind of agrees somewhere
0:28:39 in the distance when yells [ __ ] the
0:28:40 premiere I feel like Neil is probably
0:28:43 like close to being pretty Stone sober
0:28:46 at this point I feel like everybody else
0:28:48 in the room is probably so your
0:28:50 tolerances are way out yeah yeah Neil
0:28:53 does not have a good stamina because he
0:28:54 does this [ __ ]
0:28:56 they are [ __ ] up I mean like how long
0:29:00 have you been like cultivating Khalif 30
0:29:02 years so you are a 30-year veteran where
0:29:07 you're like probably like yeah whatever
0:29:09 man it's like yes I had I've had a few
0:29:11 joints I'm getting I'm feeling it a
0:29:13 little whereas these guys hit it once
0:29:14 and they're like
0:29:16 it's [ __ ] coins looking at the
0:29:18 ceiling like oh my God having your Snoop
0:29:21 Dogg moment right here
0:29:23 yeah the premiere um
0:29:25 they try and order everything to how
0:29:27 they see order and and I always looked
0:29:29 at it different that there wasn't really
0:29:31 a structure it was your relationship
0:29:32 with the world around you and the
0:29:34 spirits of the world around you right
0:29:36 that's what I was taught
0:29:38 it's different you guys okay
0:29:40 one of them looks at you
0:29:42 and begins to speak Latin
0:29:45 and he says I am well finally I am me
0:29:51 uh
0:29:53 I I'm sorry I don't do I understand it
0:29:56 even though I don't know when you think
0:29:58 so this is he didn't exactly go yeah off
0:30:01 into like a tangent or anything it's the
0:30:03 Latin for those particular words is not
0:30:05 terrible not that hard from if you know
0:30:07 any language then you're okay
0:30:09 um
0:30:11 good for
0:30:13 good for you
0:30:15 to like a mulcavian right yeah
0:30:19 what's that like
0:30:21 you see how this room that we're
0:30:22 standing in right now is
0:30:25 filled with people maybe too many people
0:30:26 it's a little hot in here
0:30:28 uh it's a little smoky a little hard to
0:30:31 hard to focus yeah so imagine every
0:30:33 single one of us in in this room
0:30:36 was a thought
0:30:38 and this room was the inside of your own
0:30:41 mind
0:30:43 it's kind of like that so everyone's
0:30:45 High
0:30:47 some some people see it that way yeah I
0:30:50 don't know it's just looking at the
0:30:51 world a little bit different you ever
0:30:52 seen a Magic Eye picture at the mall I
0:30:54 love magic guy yeah uh it's that you
0:30:57 know how some people can't see Magic Eye
0:30:59 but you can and because you can see it
0:31:02 it's so frustrating trying to describe
0:31:05 to somebody who can't see it how to see
0:31:07 it yeah yeah yeah it's like that it's
0:31:10 it's kind of like you can see it but you
0:31:13 can't describe to other people you can
0:31:15 describe what you see but other people
0:31:18 they can't it's hard to describe to
0:31:21 people who can't see the Magic Eye how
0:31:23 to see the Magic Eye so you can tell
0:31:24 them what the picture is but if they
0:31:25 just go no it isn't they're living in
0:31:28 too many dimensions Kinda Yeah you are
0:31:32 straight up starting a cold one man this
0:31:35 is the beginning of a secret sect called
0:31:37 the fosterings and it's a bad [ __ ]
0:31:40 time from here on out
0:31:42 the neolites I believe the time is like
0:31:45 a flat circle
0:31:47 yeah yeah it's like a it's like a wheel
0:31:50 everything that goes around comes back
0:31:53 around and we're all just at different
0:31:56 stages on different spokes of the same
0:31:59 wheel I mean if we're all on parts of a
0:32:03 wheel that means that everyone gets
0:32:05 their turn to get ground into the road
0:32:07 you know
0:32:08 I am Neil by the way what's here who are
0:32:11 you pee pee what's up what's up yeah
0:32:14 that's what I think I think
0:32:17 I think the end is coming but I think
0:32:20 that it's the end because we're on this
0:32:24 side of the wheel
0:32:25 and the only reason we don't see it as
0:32:28 the beginning is because we're not on
0:32:30 the other side of it
0:32:31 and there's really no point in getting
0:32:34 mad about it
0:32:36 because
0:32:37 what we stand to lose a whole world
0:32:41 stands to gain man I mean I uh I've been
0:32:44 doing a lot of reading
0:32:46 a lot of star watching recently you like
0:32:48 to Star watch Pete I love star watching
0:32:51 yeah I I've uh I've always been
0:32:53 interested in the Stars I've always been
0:32:54 interested in celestial bodies and
0:32:56 things like that that's what makes me
0:32:58 think of it man you saw the star oh yeah
0:33:01 the new Star I did yeah yeah yeah
0:33:03 someone's like what the [ __ ] is that so
0:33:05 they're like they look nervous like what
0:33:07 do I not do I not know something
0:33:10 it's kind of what I was talking about
0:33:11 when you see all the signs of something
0:33:13 and you can name it
0:33:15 but you can't get people to look unless
0:33:18 they can already know how to see the
0:33:19 Magic Eye
0:33:20 and I I don't think there's anything
0:33:23 that I hear you saying Pete that I
0:33:25 disagree with Jane who has been curled
0:33:28 up like a house cat on the floor
0:33:29 listening to you guys talk gets up and
0:33:32 she puts a hand on your hand and she
0:33:34 says
0:33:36 do I go on the roof
0:33:38 yeah yeah that's fine the room kind of
0:33:41 lights up oh let's go in the roof let's
0:33:44 go yeah let's do it let's go on the
0:33:48 let's go look at the stars
0:33:49 you
0:33:51 and the small army of bruja who are very
0:33:54 high make your way to the Rooftop
0:33:59 to
0:34:00 stargaze and discuss the universe the
0:34:05 meaning of life and unlife while a rager
0:34:08 goes on beneath you and it is as you
0:34:12 kind of make it onto the roof you hear
0:34:15 the sounds of something
0:34:17 crash inside
0:34:20 very loudly over the music and there's
0:34:24 this quick pause
0:34:28 followed a second or two
0:34:31 but yeah
0:34:33 and for a moment it seems like
0:34:34 everything's all right
0:34:40 miles
0:34:43 and you are listening to music
0:34:45 that
0:34:46 you hate more than most things
0:34:50 and stomping upstairs you see a train of
0:34:55 bruja
0:34:57 that are following Neil to the roof I
0:35:00 have said that I'm going to be cool
0:35:02 about everything today and I made a
0:35:05 promise to myself
0:35:06 and that's where we're at I'm here to
0:35:10 support this Rave and all the ridiculous
0:35:13 shenanigans that might be happening
0:35:14 around me they're at the bar relaxing
0:35:19 do you get the attention of immortal
0:35:21 here and there but for a bit it actually
0:35:23 seems like a lot of the bruja are
0:35:25 avoiding talking to you
0:35:27 some might wanna pick at you a little
0:35:30 bit but might be a little too nervous
0:35:32 because of your status
0:35:34 some might want to talk to you but are a
0:35:36 little too nervous that you're kind of
0:35:38 the man quote unquote
0:35:40 but eventually
0:35:42 Amaya sits next to you give her an odd a
0:35:45 bit different from your board meetings
0:35:47 exceptionally so
0:35:49 nationally so yes well it's not a lot of
0:35:52 uh
0:35:53 Rules of Order here that I can tell
0:35:56 no no no Robert's Rules of Order here
0:36:00 it's probably for the best I would agree
0:36:04 I got you something
0:36:06 oh well I understand it is the tradition
0:36:10 of your clan to wear merit badges to
0:36:12 represent accomplishments yes we wear
0:36:15 pins
0:36:16 she reaches into a pocket and she pulls
0:36:18 out a simple pin
0:36:21 she holds in her hand a moment she's
0:36:23 like I want you to know that with this
0:36:24 comes great power
0:36:26 and I need you to be responsible with it
0:36:30 I am very responsible with most things
0:36:33 she stands up and says
0:36:35 Your Grace please stand I stand and she
0:36:38 puts the pin on your shirt and it says
0:36:42 I'm with Amaya
0:36:44 now the bruh will like you they will
0:36:46 respect you and they will want to spend
0:36:48 their time with you it seems like it'll
0:36:50 go a long way how many of these pins do
0:36:52 you have I got this one made just for
0:36:54 you I because you earned it
0:36:57 I going to sound sarcastic but I
0:37:00 actually enjoy this you were going to
0:37:02 sound sarcastic [ __ ] laughs I can't help
0:37:05 it it's part of the whole thing while
0:37:07 you were talking to Amaya there is a
0:37:10 circle of bruja and there's one who
0:37:14 stands in the middle he's wearing a
0:37:17 blind fold and in their hand is a like a
0:37:23 thumbtack of sorts like a big like
0:37:25 Thumbtack okay that has like a paper
0:37:29 like tail is it attached to pin the tail
0:37:33 and he's like I'm ready and the other
0:37:37 ones start they start spinning him
0:37:39 around
0:37:40 and after he's been spun around enough
0:37:42 he blindly starts making his way into
0:37:47 your general direction Maya says don't
0:37:50 worry it's a game
0:37:52 and the tail on the prince very old
0:37:54 anarch tradition should I make this hard
0:37:57 or not wait I hear him nuances
0:38:01 she shrugs that's up to you
0:38:03 usually we play this on Elysium I think
0:38:05 you are
0:38:07 options are a bit wider here well I
0:38:11 don't think I'm going to let any random
0:38:13 person do it so you're gonna let do it
0:38:15 miles
0:38:16 no those that are worth it okay as she
0:38:20 gets close to you she kind of heads over
0:38:22 and gives him another Spin and he starts
0:38:24 like [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] starts trying to
0:38:26 reset her himself and she turns back to
0:38:28 you okay
0:38:30 let's play a game
0:38:32 all right okay
0:38:39 everybody quiet down quiet down I heard
0:38:42 him Maya says
0:38:45 your grace
0:38:46 who gets to pin you he gives her a big
0:38:49 smile
0:38:50 well definitely not the man holding the
0:38:52 pin right now
0:38:54 he freezes yes I can see you he switches
0:38:57 again this time starts creeping towards
0:39:00 you horse Saturday
0:39:03 I am going to turn on for now uh uh
0:39:08 personal armor
0:39:11 okay
0:39:12 it's not worthy he says looking directly
0:39:14 at Amaya which kind of like raises her
0:39:17 hands well
0:39:18 I already pinned you so that's fair we
0:39:21 have that answer so who else I don't
0:39:23 know find me someone
0:39:25 at someone you feel a thumb
0:39:28 firmly pressed at the side of your ass
0:39:31 and he goes boom and as you stand
0:39:34 straight pulls the blindfold off the
0:39:37 Thumbtack falls to the ground crushed
0:39:41 I don't think you do sir what the [ __ ]
0:39:43 better luck next time some of the brujas
0:39:46 start laughing Teflon Prince
0:39:49 literal Buns of Steel I I will uh raise
0:39:53 my arms up to Teflon Prince
0:39:57 I was like I approve of that one
0:39:59 there's a rumor going around that you're
0:40:01 trying to raise an army trying to defend
0:40:03 my home
0:40:04 she looks at you
0:40:05 and she's like I have a question
0:40:09 a real one all right
0:40:11 Pat [ __ ] off and she shoves the bruja
0:40:14 the
0:40:14 blindfold on away as he tries to restart
0:40:17 the game she's like no you're done you
0:40:19 had your chance
0:40:21 um
0:40:23 I heard
0:40:25 what's coming
0:40:27 and we don't have the numbers to beat
0:40:30 that
0:40:31 so why are we doing this
0:40:34 because numbers on everything and it is
0:40:37 my home and I will keep it
0:40:39 I'm going to say something and it's not
0:40:41 uh and attempt undermining you or any of
0:40:43 that but you're out of bruja Rave and
0:40:46 real talk is just kind of a thing we do
0:40:48 here appreciate it I come from a clan
0:40:51 that's lost a lot of things we loved
0:40:53 because of pride
0:40:55 if
0:40:57 you're asking our clan to lose more
0:41:00 Pride can't be the reason I'm not saying
0:41:04 you need to have an answer right this
0:41:05 second
0:41:06 tonight
0:41:07 there's going to be a talk
0:41:09 and we're going to want to know why we
0:41:11 should die fighting the Sabbat
0:41:14 and because it's my home
0:41:17 isn't going to cut it
0:41:19 so why are we doing this well it doesn't
0:41:22 help with the Sabbat are here but there
0:41:26 is a plan you know they do that every
0:41:28 time but every time the Shabbat plans on
0:41:31 taking down the city one of the first
0:41:33 things they do is show up introduce
0:41:35 themselves to the anarchs and promise
0:41:38 revenge and all kinds of power to be
0:41:41 free how they were meant to be free it
0:41:43 always starts with an open hand
0:41:47 I'm gonna be honest with you miles
0:41:50 they do it because it gets results
0:41:53 the camarillo's approach is typically
0:41:55 not great
0:41:57 what about you I'm willing to work with
0:41:59 people
0:42:00 tell me what that looks like I don't see
0:42:02 a reason we can't co-exist
0:42:05 there are people who are going to
0:42:06 believe in your ideals
0:42:08 much stronger than the Camarillo and all
0:42:10 they'll do is make trouble for us
0:42:12 they don't want to live in the structure
0:42:15 that we have
0:42:17 sits back a couple of the other bruja at
0:42:20 the bar one of which is literally
0:42:23 bartending lean against the bar and look
0:42:27 at you
0:42:28 all right
0:42:30 when this is done what's ours
0:42:32 where do we co-exist
0:42:35 where do they exist now mostly East
0:42:37 Haven yeah they kind of float around
0:42:38 they don't really have an official space
0:42:41 there's never something up in Rowlands
0:42:43 was really interested in talking about
0:42:45 right
0:42:49 I've got two thoughts for you
0:42:51 you guys can either take East Haven or
0:42:53 whatever interest you past the river
0:42:56 or I can do what I can with the help you
0:42:59 and you can have Middletown
0:43:01 purees is an eyebrow that intrigued and
0:43:05 not having quite expected that kind of
0:43:08 an offer
0:43:09 that actually sounds pretty good okay
0:43:13 I'm gonna level with you there are some
0:43:15 things that I know that I think you
0:43:17 should know all right
0:43:19 Carmen
0:43:21 ala Sombra and darkness of The Killing
0:43:24 Spree I'm aware she approached me
0:43:27 and she said that
0:43:30 New York and their control of New York
0:43:34 and Bridgeport means that they don't
0:43:36 actually feel that they really need to
0:43:37 hold New Haven
0:43:39 so as a means of
0:43:42 convincing us
0:43:45 they offer to leave it empty
0:43:48 and give it to us provided We Stand
0:43:51 aside well that's kind of odd since we
0:43:55 spied on one of our meetings and she was
0:43:57 promising an Archbishop of New Haven an
0:43:59 Archbishop yeah who was she who was she
0:44:02 promising unfortunately somebody riding
0:44:04 a ghoul suit
0:44:06 so
0:44:07 I don't trust this one obviously and I'd
0:44:10 rather work with you but I need to make
0:44:12 sure that what few animals are left
0:44:14 aren't going to betray me for what they
0:44:16 think is a better offer
0:44:18 so I think Middletown is good now
0:44:21 there's another part that you need to
0:44:24 know all right there's a follower of set
0:44:26 by the name of noffrey familiar
0:44:30 they offered this to the followers of
0:44:32 set
0:44:33 and what they want from the followers of
0:44:36 sin is to eliminate anarchs that choose
0:44:40 to side with the camera Allah and their
0:44:42 offering East Haven
0:44:44 as far as I know
0:44:46 the followers of set have taken the deal
0:44:49 they want to meet with me also I don't
0:44:51 know if this is the humiliate me or what
0:44:53 not but I do have to meet with them I
0:44:56 don't think you should do it I owe them
0:44:59 that unfortunately if you send someone
0:45:02 else instead
0:45:04 it was a personal debt and I don't think
0:45:06 they'll take anyone me and not for it
0:45:09 have a history
0:45:10 she looks a little concerned at that
0:45:12 we've not liked each other for a long
0:45:14 time said it's corrupt if they get into
0:45:17 your head
0:45:19 it can be bad miles I've had some
0:45:21 experience with that
0:45:22 we're going to take some precautions
0:45:25 but I can't go back in my word it's one
0:45:27 of the few things that I won't
0:45:30 okay
0:45:32 but I do appreciate the concern one more
0:45:34 question shoot
0:45:36 that painting yeah
0:45:39 is it real
0:45:43 it might be but I guess the question is
0:45:46 why do you want to know
0:45:49 I don't back the set types because
0:45:50 they're evil [ __ ]
0:45:53 I need to know that you are not morally
0:45:55 compromised
0:45:57 a single slip is the first step to a big
0:45:59 fall
0:46:01 true
0:46:02 but people slip all the time it doesn't
0:46:04 mean they fall
0:46:05 I disagree
0:46:07 you think no one in that level
0:46:10 I have 13
0:46:12 12 Elder princes
0:46:15 now existing in my domain that I knew
0:46:17 were coming
0:46:18 from all along the east coast
0:46:21 I had an erratic
0:46:23 crazy
0:46:25 Prince the oppressed us two miles I
0:46:29 understand
0:46:30 part of the reason that
0:46:33 he needed to be removed is that he was
0:46:36 working with the side diets against
0:46:38 everyone but also against oh oh okay no
0:46:42 no no miles
0:46:44 you don't need to justify that that
0:46:46 [ __ ] needed to go yeah
0:46:48 we heard about what he did to Britta and
0:46:51 how he treated people his own people
0:46:53 [ __ ] him he needed to die
0:46:56 I'm asking if you had crossed the line
0:46:59 into true evil
0:47:01 I had to become a shield
0:47:06 yes or no
0:47:08 I thought that was the answer
0:47:11 it's not
0:47:13 miles looks
0:47:15 away
0:47:17 considers the glass he's holding the
0:47:19 back of the bar
0:47:21 not really doing anything with it mostly
0:47:24 appearances
0:47:25 but
0:47:26 then he looks back at her
0:47:30 yes
0:47:32 her eyes become downcast for a moment
0:47:37 I appreciate your honesty
0:47:41 no seriously she kind of like grabs your
0:47:44 arm
0:47:46 I appreciate it I'm just afraid of what
0:47:49 it will cost
0:47:51 but it has to it is what it is well I'll
0:47:54 tell you this
0:47:56 for that
0:47:59 the cost is always too much
0:48:01 I know
0:48:04 she gives you a hug like you're this
0:48:05 like sad broken thing
0:48:08 we'll keep in touch
0:48:10 I'll be talking to my people talk to you
0:48:13 soon
0:48:13 and you can keep the PIN
0:48:15 fantastic she slips off Britta
0:48:22 [Music]
0:48:24 you finally find
0:48:26 what can't be quite described as a quiet
0:48:29 moment but one to yourself
0:48:32 and you've made your way into a throng
0:48:36 of dancing
0:48:38 inebriated Mortals
0:48:41 the senses that you've developed over
0:48:43 the past year
0:48:45 remind you
0:48:47 it's a sweet sense you pick up
0:48:51 are more
0:48:53 that of meals
0:48:55 then peers
0:48:58 or really even people anymore
0:49:01 and in this time what do you do what's
0:49:04 on your mind
0:49:05 after finishing her dance with Johnny
0:49:08 Bretta has kept in mind why she came
0:49:12 here
0:49:13 but also in defiance of everything at
0:49:16 the end of the world the feelings that
0:49:19 this place evokes in her the reminder
0:49:21 that this club means to her she's also
0:49:24 here managing to have fun and let loose
0:49:29 because that is essential to the
0:49:30 strategy
0:49:31 first move is to dance alone and dance
0:49:34 sexy to establish confidence sexuality
0:49:37 sensuality desire
0:49:40 she's phenomenally beautiful and she
0:49:42 moves gracefully but I'm not imagining
0:49:44 that dancing alone will last long not in
0:49:47 this kind of circumstance
0:49:49 after that she'll start making sure that
0:49:52 the party's roaring people are having
0:49:54 fun that people want to be around her
0:49:57 around the codery around allies of the
0:49:59 codery Allies she hopes to lure them
0:50:02 onto the floor even enemies maybe not
0:50:06 quite enemies that's a bit dramatic but
0:50:08 offering a sense of unspoken forgiveness
0:50:12 those that were kind of Shaw's peons
0:50:15 if they approach her respectfully for a
0:50:17 dance they can get put on the
0:50:19 metaphorical card
0:50:21 her movements are smooth and seductive
0:50:24 but she's establishing a boundary about
0:50:28 still like how people can dance with her
0:50:31 what kind of touch she'll allow
0:50:33 basically to keep it a lowering but Out
0:50:36 Of Reach to connect with individuals and
0:50:39 boost reputations of the codery inclined
0:50:42 people positively towards their
0:50:43 intentions and take a temperature on
0:50:45 what's going on
0:50:47 as you dance and enjoy your surroundings
0:50:51 you feel
0:50:53 a poke at your hip from a small delicate
0:50:57 finger and when you turn wearing some of
0:51:01 your clothing
0:51:03 and dancing with you is a young team
0:51:06 with bright eyes and raven-like black
0:51:10 hair
0:51:11 and immediately you recognize her as
0:51:15 someone who's not supposed to be out
0:51:17 tonight
0:51:18 and in the distance over at the bar with
0:51:21 an immensely nervous expression is one
0:51:25 of the ghouls who serve miles
0:51:27 she gives a little wave
0:51:29 what is her expression
0:51:32 uh she looks like a 14 year old girl who
0:51:35 snuck into a crazy nightclub like does
0:51:38 she look like excited guilty like
0:51:40 mischievous yes
0:51:42 I mean bretta's first reaction is stress
0:51:45 she turns recognizes her has almost a
0:51:49 little bit of a double take and then
0:51:51 pulls her in for a hug almost as if
0:51:53 she's trying to pull her closer to pull
0:51:56 her away from the crowd Eden hugs you
0:51:58 back I did it I made him listen to me
0:52:01 making sure to whisper into Eden's ear
0:52:04 Britta says
0:52:06 you know that this is a really bad place
0:52:08 for you but you're here of you it's fine
0:52:11 she like holds her hand up and like
0:52:14 Twirls under your hand like you're
0:52:17 spinning her brutal lets her
0:52:21 TZ guy her back towards the goal if
0:52:24 anyone asks
0:52:26 you're my ghoul okay
0:52:29 but I don't want you to talk to anyone
0:52:31 not to anyone like me
0:52:33 the code right that's fine but Johnny
0:52:35 Comes stepping over looks like he's kind
0:52:38 of intrigued at why one of Miles ghouls
0:52:41 happens to be at the Rave and as he goes
0:52:44 to the point and ask him a question
0:52:45 notices the two of you
0:52:49 hey there
0:52:51 you look like you're a little bit too
0:52:52 young to be in the club here
0:52:54 when you got the goal to listen to you
0:52:57 did you make eye contact and tell him
0:53:00 what you wanted she nods
0:53:02 okay I've tried it before but it
0:53:04 wouldn't work but this time I got him
0:53:06 how exactly did you get in
0:53:10 I told him to let me in he told the big
0:53:13 guy at the front Johnny kind of motions
0:53:16 and points of whatever tiny is oh no no
0:53:18 no I hid from him she admits
0:53:23 points at like way off one of the like
0:53:26 people serving drinks
0:53:28 uh them they were smoking outside
0:53:32 all right
0:53:35 and what's your plan now that you're
0:53:37 here
0:53:38 she kind of like grabs Buddha's hand
0:53:41 intertwining her little fingers with
0:53:43 hers and I was like I
0:53:48 am going to enjoy being a vampire
0:53:52 I've been cooped up I've been really
0:53:54 good
0:53:55 I feel healthy and she like jumps up and
0:53:58 down a moment I just I need to get out
0:54:04 from going any further if anyone asks
0:54:07 you
0:54:08 who you are what are you gonna tell him
0:54:10 I'm pretty cool
0:54:12 Johnny kind of like frowns at that a
0:54:14 little bit so you want to come out here
0:54:16 to be a vampire
0:54:18 told me to do yeah it's it's my fault
0:54:20 yes better yet if anyone asks who you
0:54:23 are you say your close personal friends
0:54:25 with Johnny sacks and the Seneschal
0:54:27 and the [ __ ] off
0:54:29 is that understood yes brother closes
0:54:32 her eyes and none so she's kind of
0:54:34 trying to press at her temples without
0:54:38 disturbing her makeup but Johnny gives
0:54:41 her the hardest like death stare he can
0:54:44 if you're gonna be a little Rebel and
0:54:46 sneak into clubs then you better not
0:54:49 [ __ ] it up understood she looks
0:54:52 mortified at Johnny and despite the
0:54:58 pulsing bass you can hear her gulp
0:55:03 yes sir his uh expression cracks into a
0:55:07 big wolfish grin any kind of nods at her
0:55:09 all right then I expect everything's
0:55:11 gonna be cool can we at least he flashes
0:55:14 a very worried glance at Britta Bretta is
0:55:18 not ready to Summer down and she
0:55:21 continues to say can we at least have
0:55:23 the goal watching her or oh yeah yeah he
0:55:26 looks over at the ghoul oh yeah you're
0:55:28 uh you're you're making sure that she
0:55:30 didn't get in any trouble the kind of
0:55:32 his lips thin and he gives this a solemn
0:55:37 nod knowing that he [ __ ] up but maybe
0:55:42 doesn't totally understand what how he
0:55:45 got here
0:55:46 Eden please I'm pretty sure miles takes
0:55:49 arms [ __ ] like this Eden please let
0:55:52 him watch you okay please don't mess
0:55:54 with him anymore like that I I get it
0:55:56 and I I don't want to be upset with you
0:55:58 I'm just
0:56:00 please let us help even if I I know you
0:56:03 want to be here the ghoul looks like a
0:56:07 ghost when it is mentioned to him that
0:56:10 miles takes arms
0:56:12 Eden
0:56:14 this is a little more Carefree when
0:56:17 concern of consequences is brought up
0:56:20 and she hugs Britta
0:56:22 don't worry
0:56:24 I'll be subtle
0:56:26 Beretta looks down at Eden and in a
0:56:30 protective motion she makes sure that
0:56:33 almost like like an older sister making
0:56:36 sure the clothes are sitting right
0:56:37 that's stolen out the closet kind of
0:56:39 smoothing it down and like setting it
0:56:42 straight I'll put it back I promise no
0:56:44 that's that's it doesn't matter I just
0:56:48 this
0:56:51 okay remember what Johnny said Okay
0:56:54 um and if anything happens come back to
0:56:58 this VIP area anything at all okay if
0:57:01 anyone tries to
0:57:03 have an extended conversation or just
0:57:08 I feel like you get it
0:57:12 just slips off five five
0:57:15 all right
0:57:17 aside from the troubling development
0:57:19 that we now have that little one running
0:57:21 around this place should we just get
0:57:23 someone to take her back or I don't feel
0:57:26 like we should because then that's she's
0:57:28 not allowed to go places but to be
0:57:30 perfectly honest I think I'm more
0:57:32 comfortable having an eye on her and
0:57:35 she's gonna have to learn some
0:57:37 survival technique sooner or later so as
0:57:40 much as I I hate to admit it I think
0:57:42 this is probably a good thing
0:57:45 put some trust in her
0:57:47 and we'll make sure nothing happens
0:57:49 it's not really her I don't trust it's
0:57:51 more of the people around her that's
0:57:53 [ __ ] world
0:57:55 are things going at least well on your
0:57:58 end no no this place is a [ __ ] [ __ ]
0:58:00 show I'm pretty sure that we've already
0:58:03 had several fights just barely avoid
0:58:07 turning into riots has anyone torpart or
0:58:09 anything not yet are you sure
0:58:13 not that I've seen okay
0:58:16 how do you how are you thinking what's
0:58:18 the temperature like here what was it
0:58:20 like when I was on the dance floor in a
0:58:23 word volatile
0:58:25 things would be very fun exciting people
0:58:29 are shouting hilarious things sometimes
0:58:32 weird inside jokes and then someone
0:58:35 bumps into someone the wrong way
0:58:36 everything gets super heated for a
0:58:39 moment and then there they're taken away
0:58:40 walk away on their own what have you and
0:58:42 everything dies down and the cycle
0:58:44 begins anew and this cycle was like
0:58:47 every 10 minutes or so Johnny everyone
0:58:51 is looking for a fight it didn't take
0:58:54 any provocation I felt like
0:58:56 when I was dancing I found myself
0:58:58 counting the seconds of how long I was
0:59:00 making eye contact with one person and
0:59:02 another because I thought that might
0:59:03 cause an issue
0:59:05 okay
0:59:06 and it's just
0:59:08 so far people are walking away
0:59:11 but the Energy's really really high
0:59:14 famous
0:59:15 it's kind of good news but it's it's it
0:59:19 feels like it could get worse
0:59:21 yep that's a read for you always feels
0:59:24 like it can get worse and he usually
0:59:26 does so since it hasn't yet I'll take
0:59:28 that as a sign
0:59:30 let's try and round up the rest of the
0:59:31 codery I want to have a little pow-wow
0:59:33 before we start getting things underway
0:59:36 on the rooftop
0:59:37 I'll go find miles
0:59:40 you see Neil anywhere I've
0:59:43 don't really want to talk to him right
0:59:45 now he kind of gives you a quizzical
0:59:47 look you don't want to talk to Neil
0:59:49 right now I mean I can talk to him it's
0:59:51 not like like a big
0:59:52 like Grudge or that kind of thing it
0:59:54 just feels like he's yelling at me a lot
0:59:56 well he's been through some [ __ ] don't
0:59:59 forget that
1:00:00 I know
1:00:01 but that isn't really fair because I've
1:00:06 been through a lot too
1:00:08 yeah but I think his Beast is starting
1:00:10 to win that fight if you catch my drift
1:00:12 what does that even mean okay because
1:00:16 honestly
1:00:18 he wasn't there when we were fighting
1:00:20 the dragon and he showed up at the end
1:00:23 of the things I was going through and I
1:00:25 know he's been through his own things
1:00:26 I'm not trying to devalue that but why
1:00:28 do I have to treat him gently like that
1:00:30 then
1:00:31 you know you don't have to treat him
1:00:33 gently
1:00:35 it just sounds like I should be keeping
1:00:38 in mind that he's not okay and I'm not
1:00:39 okay either
1:00:40 [ __ ] call him out for it
1:00:43 don't be gentle don't ignore it just go
1:00:46 ahead and go in on it
1:00:47 not talking to him never solved anything
1:00:50 Britta kind of casts her eyes down and
1:00:52 gives a couple nods
1:00:55 if you got issue with him
1:00:57 getting his face and talk to him about
1:00:58 it
1:01:00 I know we're out of proja Rave but I
1:01:03 already feel out of place enough without
1:01:05 trying that
1:01:08 I'll pick the site later right now I
1:01:13 feel like we should try to be as United
1:01:14 as we can
1:01:16 it's probably a better Point than the
1:01:17 one I was making
1:01:19 I don't know about that but I
1:01:22 maybe you find Neil for now and I'll
1:01:23 round up the others
1:01:25 by the way does it smell like weed in
1:01:27 here
1:01:28 I mean yeah it's pretty much the main
1:01:31 smell at this point yeah I think I have
1:01:34 an idea where I could find them you see
1:01:36 if you can get the others
1:01:38 um let's do a quick powwow like I was
