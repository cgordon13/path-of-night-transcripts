0:00:20 we know what to expect we're all excited
0:00:22 to be here and we want you to feel the
0:00:25 same so listener discretion is advised
0:00:28 now let's walk the path of night
0:00:32 [Music]
0:00:37 foreign
0:00:43 as the agent Canary she escaped from
0:00:46 Pendragon to join the mother mission to
0:00:48 kill veto zantosa though Reddit to
0:00:50 control the throne mind back from her
0:00:52 new captors they remained otherwise in
0:00:54 control and prepared for the raid
0:00:57 miles and Ira woke wind from the effects
0:00:59 of Shimmer Street
0:01:01 Johnny clashed against a werewolf though
0:01:03 the hunter Crystal was lost chiney
0:01:06 managed to save the injured Suarez along
0:01:09 with the other Hunters
0:01:11 Sheila's help and a bit of blood the bra
0:01:14 remained in control enough to head back
0:01:16 to the Quarry
0:01:19 [Music]
0:01:27 to
0:01:28 usually
0:01:30 ever since you've become Kindred the
0:01:33 rest you experienced during the day
0:01:35 offers little Comfort nothing like a
0:01:39 good night's sleep used to do as a human
0:01:41 but this time it was worse than usual
0:01:44 you arise this evening feeling depleted
0:01:48 after this series of trials that you
0:01:51 have undergone
0:01:53 when you rise you are surprised to see
0:01:57 that you are not the first to do so
0:02:00 naturally Romeo is haunting this place
0:02:04 giving everyone their privacy but he
0:02:06 doesn't really feel the weight of the
0:02:09 day like the rest of you
0:02:11 but Peru Peru doesn't seem to have
0:02:14 needed to sleep at all
0:02:16 and he has spent his time
0:02:19 organizing Maps making final
0:02:21 preparations finishing up the work Eagle
0:02:25 did to prepare everyone's gear for the
0:02:28 mission at hand
0:02:30 and as each of you file into the meeting
0:02:33 space of your Haven
0:02:35 he is ready to go
0:02:38 it's been a long time since spreta has
0:02:40 slept in her own sleeping bag but
0:02:43 re-contextualizing it with it's intended
0:02:47 purpose
0:02:49 sleeping behind the bar and watching
0:02:52 people kind of come out from where they
0:02:55 would go
0:02:56 and there's a sense of practice in it
0:02:58 they've done this before and they
0:03:00 remember it right yep
0:03:02 so that is
0:03:05 it makes it feel even less like hers
0:03:09 but Britta Rises and goes over to start
0:03:14 investigating the maps and see if she
0:03:17 can memorize some of these details
0:03:20 see what they refer to as you get close
0:03:23 they're marked up maps detailing
0:03:26 information regarding Sterling Memorial
0:03:28 Library it is a library that is on Yale
0:03:31 campus and that seems to be where the
0:03:34 group of you are headed are there other
0:03:36 things there Beyond Maps you do see some
0:03:41 notes uh it looks like it's notes
0:03:43 largely from the Nosferatu detailing
0:03:46 some of the activities of the tremeer
0:03:48 there and not that there's no tour
0:03:51 prepared for the benefit of the tomahira
0:03:54 more like this is intercepted
0:03:56 information and they have pieced
0:03:59 together some of the identities of the
0:04:02 what are called acolytes and apprentices
0:04:04 that reside there you're quickly getting
0:04:07 the impression that you're about to
0:04:09 perform a hit on New Haven's Premier
0:04:11 Chantry
0:04:12 and then you see the profile on the
0:04:17 xantosa family Britta picks it up and
0:04:19 starts reading as you look through it
0:04:21 there seems to be some sort of
0:04:22 discussion on it about events that took
0:04:24 place during the integral that a group
0:04:28 who would later become known as the
0:04:31 Blackhand not the same black hand was
0:04:35 involved in orchestrating a strike to
0:04:38 support the zamizi in betraying their
0:04:40 Clan founder the notes specify that this
0:04:45 black hand I'm imagining berta's
0:04:48 confusion and I'm trying to think how
0:04:51 she takes in that separation you find
0:04:54 yourself thinking a bit about Johnny
0:04:56 sire like ah yes okay and in it there's
0:05:00 an assassination that is performed on
0:05:03 the zamisi and to deluvian but in these
0:05:06 notes you find that there is a great
0:05:09 deal of uncertainty a name lambach is
0:05:12 mentioned into more than once
0:05:14 and in these notes you come to find out
0:05:16 that the xantosa family was extremely
0:05:19 loyal to this the client founder and had
0:05:23 gone by the name Santa which in these
0:05:26 notes there's mention of them changing
0:05:28 names and fleeing to the new world
0:05:31 smuggling some object of in grave
0:05:35 importance
0:05:37 and that object is taken to Connecticut
0:05:39 and then New York you get the impression
0:05:43 that a certain xentosa is a remaining
0:05:47 member of the group that smuggled this
0:05:51 thing is there any indication of this
0:05:53 object's Dimensions or qualities there
0:05:57 is not okay as uh you read through Peru
0:06:01 actually sits next to you Britta looks
0:06:04 over a bit of curiosity automatic at the
0:06:06 fact that he didn't seem to have to
0:06:09 sleep she's not familiar with how that
0:06:11 could even be true for Kindred but she
0:06:14 doesn't really clarify that she's very
0:06:17 focused on these notes trying to figure
0:06:19 out it's just sort of flipping between
0:06:22 options as she was intake information
0:06:25 about the santosa family and their
0:06:27 history with samitsi she would like then
0:06:30 look over to the tramir Chantry and try
0:06:33 to do the mental math in her head that's
0:06:35 probably when she looks up and catches
0:06:37 him
0:06:38 it was
0:06:39 believed that with the destruction of
0:06:42 the ancient
0:06:43 not through the
0:06:45 well-placed strike
0:06:48 we would be free of the disease
0:06:51 but it found a way to live on
0:06:54 there are those who think that this is
0:06:56 some sort of
0:06:57 uh gift
0:07:00 that it is something that can be
0:07:02 leveraged for power
0:07:04 but they are wrong
0:07:06 it is damnation manifest when you say a
0:07:10 damnation what do you mean by that
0:07:13 the Sabbath believes that this institute
0:07:15 is a
0:07:17 discipline a simple power spread among
0:07:21 pacts among
0:07:23 the Diocese of the Sabah a power like
0:07:27 any other
0:07:28 but they are wrong it seems sometimes to
0:07:31 behave like an infection it is an
0:07:34 infection
0:07:36 it is
0:07:38 an entity
0:07:40 an invasion
0:07:42 and as the Sabbat spreads
0:07:45 so too does it
0:07:47 and there will come a night
0:07:49 or it is all and all are it
0:07:53 unless we find a way to kill it
0:07:57 Purge its existence
0:07:59 but killing the xantosa would we even be
0:08:02 able to find that Remnant we know where
0:08:05 it is
0:08:06 you've come so terribly close
0:08:09 I can see that in you
0:08:10 you went to the house did you not we're
0:08:13 done
0:08:14 and even though you wisely did not
0:08:17 venture to What Lies Beneath it you know
0:08:20 it is there and you know that it is not
0:08:23 content to remain there
0:08:26 there was a feeling in that place
0:08:29 I mean
0:08:30 like that but to have a way to kill it
0:08:34 I do not know
0:08:36 that life and death mean to it what it
0:08:40 does to us
0:08:42 but I know
0:08:43 that it is dependent
0:08:46 the most powerful aspects of it or the
0:08:49 limitations by which it can be beaten
0:08:52 it is an infection of the flesh deny the
0:08:55 flesh and you deny it of its ambition of
0:08:59 its path to Victory making sure it has
0:09:03 no caretaker and that it won't be fed
0:09:05 further we can isolate it the caretaker
0:09:08 knows what it requires that it requires
0:09:11 anything means that it is not without
0:09:14 limit and even if it isn't
0:09:18 even if we can't place it within the
0:09:21 usual bounds of life and death then
0:09:23 maybe finding a way to freeze it like a
0:09:27 virus in ice
0:09:28 you are familiar with Romeo yeah
0:09:32 you are familiar with the realm that
0:09:35 Romeo occupies
0:09:37 of
0:09:38 emotion dreams and death
0:09:42 but a place without flesh
0:09:46 goes a bit cage here at the mention of
0:09:49 the shadowlands because the mention the
0:09:51 shadow lands reminds her even as she's
0:09:54 starting to go into planning mode and
0:09:57 very much understanding that the Sabbat
0:10:00 are drawing nearer and nearer and that
0:10:03 she doesn't want them to have access to
0:10:07 this power but the Mansion of the
0:10:09 shadowlands brings back the bits and
0:10:11 pieces that she can remember walking in
0:10:13 and how great it was and the training so
0:10:18 cageiness the second the muscles in your
0:10:22 body tense the second there is even the
0:10:25 most subtle display of potential action
0:10:29 Eagle the avenue-skinned Assamite who is
0:10:34 a member of this column can be seen
0:10:36 right beside parun resting a hand on his
0:10:40 shoulder indicating that the two are are
0:10:43 very close and he simply watches you an
0:10:46 unspoken warning that your unaffirmed
0:10:52 loyalty is noticed and that he is very
0:10:55 protective of perin Britta doesn't hide
0:10:58 the mixture of feelings with that
0:11:00 because one of the few things she can
0:11:02 remember about Eagle is him protecting
0:11:05 her during training at least from
0:11:08 greater harms she doesn't really can't
0:11:10 pin down details or that kind of thing
0:11:12 but that was one of the sensations that
0:11:14 she felt looking around the room and
0:11:16 hearing everyone's name so she looks up
0:11:19 at Eagle not really hiding the
0:11:22 experience of conflict that she's having
0:11:23 but she's not moving either to cause
0:11:26 harm she's just in her feelings about it
0:11:30 so you really think that would affects
0:11:32 it bringing it to the shadowlands
0:11:35 I do not know for sure but I know that
0:11:38 if nothing has tried
0:11:40 if we do nothing
0:11:42 it'll just get worse
0:11:44 there's a quiet moment and shrike enters
0:11:46 the group gives wave evening folks I
0:11:50 think we're ready to go right Eagle
0:11:51 gives a nod you have the Chantry this is
0:11:56 the location you think for it shrike
0:11:58 speaks up we're heading under the
0:12:00 Chantry they are very well defended and
0:12:04 I imagine I couldn't get Veto out of the
0:12:08 Chantry but summoning him worked before
0:12:12 Britta is back to trying to pull an
0:12:17 emotion back in something about shrike
0:12:19 is making her she emotionally does not
0:12:22 know what to do with him it doesn't make
0:12:23 sense to her that like he's so flippant
0:12:25 uh in some ways in most ways as far as
0:12:28 she's seen so far virtual Avery and like
0:12:31 as an itchiness of that reminding her of
0:12:33 Miles making her like frustrated and how
0:12:36 much she misses her Coterie but as well
0:12:39 it's it's just so
0:12:42 anti-resonant the flippancy between like
0:12:46 her not being able to place what their
0:12:50 Rapport or anything or she does not know
0:12:53 their connection and so this reaction
0:12:56 makes her want to close back up where
0:12:59 she was willing to show Eagle like her
0:13:02 internal state that willingness does not
0:13:04 seem to extend destroy but in this
0:13:07 moment she is hoping to angle the tramir
0:13:11 away from harm that's what she's looking
0:13:13 towards Shrek smiles and it is a very
0:13:17 disarming smile that almost confirms
0:13:20 your concern about the sort of threat
0:13:22 the man is and he says to you
0:13:24 the tramir made the same mistake that
0:13:27 many many others do and that is they
0:13:29 fill their homes with so many security
0:13:31 measures that they start getting in the
0:13:32 way of each other and the truth is the
0:13:34 place is sealed like a vault it's got
0:13:36 every trick that they can manage and
0:13:38 that's great that works for us it helps
0:13:41 you see the tremeer are I don't know if
0:13:45 lazy is the right word but they're so
0:13:47 engrossed with their studies that they
0:13:49 prefer to have others do their medial
0:13:52 tasks that their homes required done and
0:13:55 that means that they have acolytes
0:13:56 mortal schools who run their errands
0:14:00 perform some security details all these
0:14:03 little odds and ends that keep the
0:14:05 business running
0:14:07 so
0:14:08 the trick about getting into a century
0:14:11 is learning about all the little places
0:14:13 that the people in the changer need to
0:14:16 get to to get their occult paraphernalia
0:14:20 their ritual components their blood
0:14:23 things got complicated and we never
0:14:27 really got the opportunity to insert you
0:14:29 guys the way we would have preferred by
0:14:32 I know some of their acolytes and so
0:14:35 long as the acolytes in the Chantry we
0:14:38 don't need to worry about getting
0:14:39 through Premier Blue Ribbon magic tricks
0:14:43 or whether or not our Target can't
0:14:45 escape the room or whatever he's trapped
0:14:48 in all we need is one of their acolytes
0:14:52 that we know inside on the other side of
0:14:54 their defenses and that's where the
0:14:56 summon trick comes in Britta glances at
0:14:59 Romeo if he's visible At The Mention Of
0:15:02 well it wasn't how I wanted she can't
0:15:04 tell if Romeo might know what he means
0:15:06 by that not that a glance would give her
0:15:08 much information but Romeo gives a look
0:15:10 like he understands what he's referring
0:15:12 to
0:15:13 so we get into position I summon the
0:15:16 acolyte the acolyte opens the door no I
0:15:20 don't know which we're going to need the
0:15:21 acolyte once it's opened the door but up
0:15:23 until that point he's quite useful
0:15:24 there's no need to kill him
0:15:27 it gives you a look Britta knows when
0:15:29 she says it that there's arguments and
0:15:32 she's not saying it with confidence all
0:15:34 right agent lay it on me what advantage
0:15:37 do we get by the acolyte wandering off
0:15:40 to get help or maybe we can take the
0:15:42 acolyte in with us as a hostage and
0:15:45 render one of our own teammates uh
0:15:47 useless while we try to get the job done
0:15:50 Britta doesn't actually have an argument
0:15:53 she she knew when she said it that it
0:15:55 was yeah she's hoping to come up with an
0:15:57 answer but she doesn't have one I so she
0:16:00 looks down but her jealous type so here
0:16:03 is my suggestion
0:16:05 right
0:16:06 drink them dry
0:16:08 he goes out probably the happiest he's
0:16:11 ever been
0:16:12 and
0:16:13 he doesn't have to be a Trimmier someday
0:16:15 a double win
0:16:17 up makes a couple calculations
0:16:19 internally but gives a tight nod
0:16:23 all the highlights of the guy's life are
0:16:25 behind him he's the last good thing the
0:16:28 nod is not for strike sense of humor
0:16:32 well he seems convinced
0:16:36 and he just kind of you know enjoys the
0:16:38 uh company of the column as he puts on
0:16:41 body armor he has this like navy blue
0:16:44 kind of top coat and
0:16:47 he shoots up into something sharp breto
0:16:50 saying that it's go time she replaces
0:16:52 the finishing details getting the knives
0:16:54 strapped on making sure that what can be
0:16:57 concealed is concealed shrike turns and
0:17:00 offers you a trench coat brother
0:17:04 it's okay we vampires do this thing
0:17:06 wearing these all the time
0:17:09 well similarities really freaking out
0:17:13 [Laughter]
0:17:16 somewhere across New Haven miles is
0:17:18 incensed I think there's
0:17:23 does
0:17:24 a bit of a
0:17:26 just take the trench coat the group of
0:17:29 you hedge the armored truck and you go
0:17:36 hammer truck is loud it's not a
0:17:39 comfortable you know trip it's not
0:17:41 exactly like the sports cars that you've
0:17:44 become used to
0:17:46 um but it gets you there and when you
0:17:47 get there the group piles out and starts
0:17:50 heading to the library and as you walk
0:17:52 you begin to notice that the people who
0:17:56 walk the sidewalks who hang around the
0:17:59 entrances to the various buildings on
0:18:01 campus ignore you it's like the group of
0:18:04 you aren't there and you're outlandish
0:18:06 ridiculous outfits don't catch their eye
0:18:09 at all you are in a massive crowd of
0:18:12 huge throng of people and are totally
0:18:15 alone Britta sticks closer to Romeo if
0:18:19 she can't if he seems there and gone in
0:18:22 the way that wraiths sometimes are
0:18:24 she'll I guess move a bit closer to
0:18:27 peroon but it weirdly in this moment of
0:18:30 transition she's getting very caught up
0:18:32 in the fact that she can observe people
0:18:34 like this it seems so human to just walk
0:18:37 around these people who can't even see
0:18:40 her and uh makes the contrasts worse but
0:18:43 she's keeping a wide eye out as you get
0:18:46 to the door the library is actually
0:18:48 closed up due to the time it is and
0:18:51 Romeo gives a subtle nod to the group
0:18:54 those who can see him and this
0:18:57 Phantasm of a one story door seems to
0:19:01 interact with the building and the door
0:19:04 comes unlocked and opens itself for you
0:19:07 at the click of the door Britta Reddy's
0:19:10 the pistol she's not raising it she's
0:19:13 just keeping it in her hand
0:19:15 strike an eagle actually follow your
0:19:19 lead on that writing their weapons and
0:19:21 the group of you hadn't Tanaka speaks up
0:19:24 this was the most fortuitous moment but
0:19:26 up here is going to grow dangerous and
0:19:30 she rests a hand on the door
0:19:32 and seals it in time so that it may not
0:19:35 be interacted with what does that look
0:19:38 like a pulse Alberta watches the
0:19:41 Curiosity again flickering she can't
0:19:44 help but to wonder about it shrike leans
0:19:47 in you want to hear a weird story is the
0:19:49 group of you are heading downstairs
0:19:51 Britta like a little absorbed by the
0:19:54 strangeness of this pulse and that like
0:19:55 maybe sense of time emanating from it is
0:19:58 not expecting shrike to get like up
0:20:00 close and personal so she just a bit of
0:20:04 it's not really like a jolt like it's
0:20:06 not that that far but it is like the
0:20:08 surprise a startle yeah
0:20:12 and she looks back at him again just so
0:20:16 confused by how to relate to him but
0:20:19 after an expression that probably reads
0:20:22 us what is this does kind of Nod she
0:20:26 reaffirms the nod after she realizes
0:20:28 that she's given the world's Vegas
0:20:31 answer check this out Heron wasn't going
0:20:34 to allow the mission to happen without
0:20:35 you you see eagle has these divination
0:20:39 rituals
0:20:40 where he basically smokes a bunch of
0:20:43 Khalif and finds out what's going to
0:20:45 happen
0:20:46 right you know Khalifa's yeah you know
0:20:49 yeah okay so he uses that and he knows
0:20:53 two things about what's about to go down
0:20:55 one is that the entire city is not going
0:20:58 to give a crap about what happens to
0:21:00 this building for the next night
0:21:03 because there is a no [ __ ] Lupine attack
0:21:06 that is right about to go down Breda
0:21:09 looks extremely concerned at the idea of
0:21:11 a Lupine she knows how bad that goes and
0:21:13 her brain's going to the killing spree
0:21:15 as they have a history of doing that oh
0:21:17 yeah Lupine here in a city
0:21:20 it's going to be insane uh empathy what
0:21:23 is he doing that he seems very excited
0:21:26 about this werewolf Bing place he seems
0:21:28 like he might have had a hand in that
0:21:30 well empathy
0:21:32 empathy what a perception
0:21:35 foreign
0:21:43 even if he's pretty good he's pretty
0:21:46 good but you know his type at this point
0:21:48 he is not responsible for it however
0:21:53 just as you are drawn to beautiful art
0:21:57 as you are drawn to
0:22:01 stunningly crafted jewelry
0:22:04 he is drawn to Carnage
0:22:07 and pain
0:22:09 and suffering
0:22:11 and he has an idea of just how bad it
0:22:14 can be when a Lupine shows up and he's
0:22:17 just kind of looking forward to seeing
0:22:19 the aftermath he doesn't care at all who
0:22:21 gets hurt he's just happy someone is
0:22:24 Brett attracts that and tries to conceal
0:22:26 her own reaction
0:22:28 oh yeah the other one apparently we
0:22:30 don't stand a chance unless you're on
0:22:31 the team
0:22:32 so I was wondering if maybe you had a
0:22:33 story for me because you're good but
0:22:36 you're not that good
0:22:38 no offense
0:22:40 it's not like I remembered a crack Tale
0:22:43 it's a story
0:22:45 what is his body language as his body
0:22:48 language is somewhere between that of a
0:22:50 cat burglar and these Soldier sweeping
0:22:52 an area for hostels
0:22:54 bread is not sure even if she wants to
0:22:58 give a story back but she can recognize
0:23:01 that this is useful information that he
0:23:04 seems to be dangling in front of her so
0:23:06 she's willing to play the game and the
0:23:09 first story that comes to mind is
0:23:12 when we ended up going to Hell House
0:23:16 it was
0:23:17 even from the outside you could feel it
0:23:20 there were pretty details some
0:23:24 stained glass mural but
0:23:27 even before the door opened and you
0:23:30 could see the way that the bodies were
0:23:32 set up and altered and the things moving
0:23:36 around in that place
0:23:38 it felt so
0:23:41 oppressive that when we finally got hold
0:23:45 of the santosa and
0:23:47 we're ready to leave with him
0:23:50 I don't
0:23:51 that was the first time that I really
0:23:54 started to get a picture that this was
0:23:56 even a part of me
0:23:59 I'm the reason that Vito's kindred
0:24:04 well
0:24:06 this time
0:24:07 cut his [ __ ] head off
0:24:09 right
0:24:10 he steps on and it isn't long before
0:24:12 perun telepathically addresses the group
0:24:15 at once and says we're here
0:24:22 as you advance downstairs to one of the
0:24:25 sellers of this massive Library you come
0:24:28 to what looks like a zone that is sealed
0:24:31 off with two steel doors this do not
0:24:33 enter sign right on it and when you see
0:24:35 the sign I need you to make a will bar
0:24:36 check
0:24:38 two successes with two successes you
0:24:41 resist the very subtle urge to not go
0:24:43 anywhere near the door and ignore it
0:24:45 completely as you guys draw in you
0:24:47 notice that there are cameras that watch
0:24:50 the door and with a flick of the wrist
0:24:52 harun envelops their lens with Darkness
0:24:55 we don't have a lot of time before they
0:24:58 notice that acolyte's on the way Britta
0:25:00 has a good amount of academics and this
0:25:04 being a library what is this meant to
0:25:08 look like a book Fault uh will me an
0:25:10 intelligence academics
0:25:14 one success with one success you know
0:25:16 Sterling Memorial Library recalling
0:25:19 they've researched this place before has
0:25:22 underground tunnels that connected to
0:25:23 other locations on campus and supposedly
0:25:27 the purpose of these tunnels is actually
0:25:29 to move Steam and should be filled with
0:25:33 pipes and completely useless in terms of
0:25:36 travel and those doors probably just
0:25:39 grant access to the useless space that
0:25:41 definitely has nothing to do with the
0:25:45 Kindred well those dots do feel pretty
0:25:47 connected Britta will start to
0:25:50 investigate the door she's not going to
0:25:52 touch it but she can feel that there's
0:25:55 that sense of repulsion and there's this
0:25:58 stupid sliver of hope that if she could
0:26:00 figure out the puzzle that maybe they
0:26:02 can get in before the acolyte but she
0:26:05 knows that this is a last Stitch effort
0:26:07 as you approach the door the rest of
0:26:09 them Stack Up off to the side letting
0:26:11 you be point on this and you examine the
0:26:13 door and it just looks like locked
0:26:15 double door entrance to some sort of
0:26:17 massive tunnel system I have gloves on
0:26:21 I'll try tracing a finger to it you
0:26:24 examine no harm comes to you but it is
0:26:26 locked a little bit of larceny and try
0:26:28 and Fiddle with it you have enough time
0:26:30 for one roll as you go to fiddle with it
0:26:32 you do notice that the lock is
0:26:33 incredibly intricate Dex larceny
0:26:35 difficulty nine
0:26:37 spend a well power okay
0:26:40 four successes okay with expert skill we
0:26:44 picked a lock Eagle raises a hint and
0:26:46 helps you to open the door and now the
0:26:48 door makes no sound Retta is inclined to
0:26:51 try to move and she's hoping that maybe
0:26:54 if they go fast enough that means the
0:26:55 acolyte's not necessary this is her hope
0:26:58 as the group of you make your way in and
0:27:00 upon reaching the other side of the door
0:27:02 you find yourself concealed under a
0:27:05 cloak of Shadows that renders the group
0:27:08 invisible just as the Accolade arrives
0:27:12 for thinking failing but the acolyte
0:27:15 looks confused for a moment and shrike
0:27:18 reveals himself completing the summons
0:27:22 shrike looks towards you
0:27:24 kind of tilts his head
0:27:26 hey guy he's not directing the guy to
0:27:28 like open any second lock or anything
0:27:30 nope he's greeting the guy and buying
0:27:32 you a moment to jump him
0:27:34 Britta does
0:27:36 hesitate she is trying to think of a way
0:27:39 not to but
0:27:42 all she can think about is that
0:27:44 bloodlust she heard in shrike earlier
0:27:47 she's terrified that if she the the
0:27:50 thought crosses her mind to try and
0:27:52 Dread gaze him the acolyte
0:27:55 but she's afraid if she makes him run
0:27:58 that it'll be worse so
0:28:01 ashamed she goes to pull him in for the
0:28:06 kiss
0:28:07 okay Dex plus uh brawl you have surprise
0:28:11 stealth
0:28:15 that's better
0:28:18 uh does the spec Grace Full Count it
0:28:22 does
0:28:25 six successes
0:28:28 two is four two successes will carry
0:28:31 over into your attack roll and you have
0:28:32 two dice from trying to grab him from
0:28:35 behind so You're Gonna Roll Just your
0:28:37 decks plus similarity plus four dice
0:28:39 Jess but then you're gonna have it
0:28:42 because you want to Grapple like is she
0:28:44 splitting her dipole basically
0:28:51 that's two ones and no successes
0:28:55 he accidentally bite his Jawbone
0:29:01 go to grab him and your fingers slip
0:29:04 right off of his tweed jacket
0:29:07 shrike gives you a look
0:29:11 and we roll initiative
0:29:13 Shrek will be going under 23.
0:29:16 13. okay
0:29:20 shrike very casually snatches the man
0:29:22 with a hand gripping him by the chin and
0:29:25 he turns this poor young college
0:29:28 student's face instead of just looking
0:29:31 at shrike and shrike's eyes blink and
0:29:34 are suddenly that of a cobra and this
0:29:38 young man meant to look like a student
0:29:40 probably an intentional guys false
0:29:44 helpless to his gaze the guilt just
0:29:47 steals spread as balance
0:29:49 but shrike grabs him establishes eye
0:29:52 contact and seems to paralyze him with
0:29:55 this Serpentine power
0:29:57 and
0:29:58 Britta does as she is going to do to
0:30:00 lean in to give the kiss
0:30:04 she doesn't even know if any of that
0:30:07 pleasure any of whatever small amount of
0:30:10 comfort she might be able to give in
0:30:12 this action could get through whatever's
0:30:14 happening with the ice but she's trying
0:30:17 are you gonna get a plus two die bonus
0:30:19 for attempting to grab him from behind
0:30:21 and because he is woefully distracted
0:30:24 you'll get an extra uh you got a minus
0:30:26 one difficulty to your grapple attempt
0:30:28 so Dex plus brawl diff five I'll spend a
0:30:32 willpower
0:30:35 for successes you snatch them right up
0:30:38 your Celerity action drink once you
0:30:41 enact the kiss combat ends how much are
0:30:44 you taking
0:30:48 Britta has fall blood she's doing this
0:30:52 so that she can she can't think of a way
0:30:55 out for him
0:30:57 Britta is already very aware of the heat
0:31:00 that's been brought onto her code Ray
0:31:02 from her involvement in the TMR and that
0:31:05 fear leads her to do as she's told
0:31:07 you feel him Die In Your Arms lost to
0:31:12 artificial throws of ecstasy
0:31:15 and as his flesh turns pale
0:31:19 and he is insanguinated I need from you
0:31:23 a conscience role that difficulty a bit
0:31:25 of blood Falls in a tear as she does
0:31:29 what she's doing who knows if that
0:31:31 regret will linger or not you feel an
0:31:33 ice cold hand against your back whose
0:31:36 hand is that and you look it appears to
0:31:39 be Romeo attempting to comfort you
0:31:43 foreign
0:31:47 you wish you had thought a little
0:31:49 quicker did something faster sweet
0:31:52 talked shrike saved him somehow and he
0:31:56 eats at you this young man had to die
0:32:00 the man whose teeth are like that of a
0:32:02 shark crouches down or the pin prick to
0:32:06 his finger from his razor sharp
0:32:09 thumbnail he presses just the smallest
0:32:12 drop of blood to the Flesh of your
0:32:14 victim
0:32:15 and the young man crumbles to Ash
0:32:19 Britta had already been a bit pulling
0:32:22 away from Romeo his comfort in this
0:32:25 circumstance
0:32:26 doesn't know what to do with it because
0:32:28 she can't place where his how much he's
0:32:31 with them how much he's with her
0:32:34 she is doing something horrible and she
0:32:37 knows she's doing something horrible and
0:32:38 she knows she's doing it for selfish
0:32:40 reasons and his comfort doesn't feel
0:32:43 good but at the same time as she's
0:32:46 starting to pull in words that the body
0:32:49 turns to Ash and that's horrifying but
0:32:52 it takes a couple steps back there
0:32:56 on with the Eerie smile says
0:33:00 all gone like he never was
0:33:03 nothing to feel bad about it anymore
0:33:07 shall we
0:33:08 read a turns and she wipes the tear off
0:33:11 her face
0:33:12 just hating herself and everything for
0:33:16 what she's done
0:33:17 She'll follow along but she'll she won't
0:33:20 be leading the group right now
0:33:22 Eagle sort of tucks you behind him and
0:33:24 he takes point for the fire team and the
0:33:28 column starts to make its way the items
0:33:32 that were carried by the ghoul are
0:33:34 quickly collected by shrike and he seems
0:33:37 to go through the little occult objects
0:33:39 that this man had carried and uses them
0:33:42 as a means of bypassing a handful of
0:33:44 mystical defenses a strange Ward here a
0:33:47 watching gargoyle there not not the kind
0:33:50 of gargle you ran into last time this
0:33:52 time just an inanimate statue it's so
0:33:54 provokes nervousness Britta absolutely
0:33:57 heightens her sense of vision to check
0:34:00 over for any sense of movement but
0:34:02 eventually as you travel down this
0:34:04 tunnel you come to a point where you
0:34:07 start to recognize the fungus that was
0:34:10 outside of Wynn's home
0:34:16 is it growing organically or has it been
0:34:19 planted places it has not been planted
0:34:22 places it looks like there are just
0:34:24 veins of this orangey spongy fleshy
0:34:29 fungus does it look like the premiere
0:34:32 have tried to get rid of it it doesn't
0:34:33 appear that they've noticed anything
0:34:35 about it it's very subtle and it's right
0:34:37 in senses that reveal it to you that
0:34:40 processes that she can see that based on
0:34:43 that choice is Eagle moving in the same
0:34:46 direction as the fungus yes Britta is
0:34:50 going to keep a specific Lookout where
0:34:52 the fungus leads we seem to be following
0:34:55 in the same direction for now but I want
0:34:58 to keep an eye out for firstly how
0:35:01 anything here is affected by the fungus
0:35:03 I've seen what it does in nature and
0:35:05 being able to see how it affects the
0:35:07 Chantry may be magical items within the
0:35:10 Chantry and if it might have insight
0:35:15 into what's going going on at Hill house
0:35:17 because Brett Associates that fungus
0:35:19 with well what had happened with a
0:35:22 weeping bear she has not seen it
0:35:26 generally around Vito himself so she is
0:35:31 doing the math on is this something that
0:35:33 she hasn't noticed when Vito has had a
0:35:35 presence somewhere or has he been able
0:35:39 to bring some element or some additional
0:35:41 creature that sort of mindset
0:35:44 see it parents says to you yes I've seen
0:35:48 it before but not around veto
0:35:51 ego raises a fist signaling for the
0:35:54 group to hold bread it does
0:35:57 appearing you can listen to the acolytes
0:36:01 monitoring the situation heightened my
0:36:04 hearing for that they seem to be
0:36:06 discussing the section of the Shane tree
0:36:10 that is currently sealed off and seem to
0:36:13 indicate that they are attempting to
0:36:15 gather what information they can from it
0:36:18 but the Chantry is to be closed within
0:36:20 the next few weeks by context of their
0:36:24 discussion and sort of the way that they
0:36:26 might glance around the space does that
0:36:28 appear to be the same section of the
0:36:30 Chantry that the fungus is leading
0:36:33 towards likely yes okay
0:36:36 how many voices are there three
0:36:39 are we so obfuscated
0:36:41 no what is the purpose of this room what
0:36:44 kind of items are here so right now you
0:36:47 are kind of around the corner from the
0:36:49 entrance to a main space this area it
0:36:52 looks like they can monitor it it looks
0:36:55 like it kind of takes an L shape and
0:36:56 leads into this room that you can't
0:36:59 quite see very well into but it looks
0:37:02 like uh from what you can make out like
0:37:05 a foyer like a main entrance to some
0:37:07 sort of like uh honestly what would be
0:37:09 like some sort of like very like nice
0:37:12 almost mansion-esque location but it
0:37:15 looks like it's kind of this that they
0:37:17 use it as almost like a waiting room at
0:37:18 a doctor's office before anyone kind of
0:37:20 gets let into the main areas where work
0:37:22 is done does our conversation seem
0:37:24 nearer conclusion it does the
0:37:27 conversation starts to take a turn
0:37:29 towards looking for someone named Scott
0:37:31 who uh sort of abruptly left in the
0:37:34 middle of the conversation
0:37:37 the feelings that she can't suppress
0:37:40 she's hoping that that search will lead
0:37:42 them away
0:37:44 she's of the mind to wait the
0:37:46 conversation out and see if they will
0:37:48 just go you see one of them collects an
0:37:51 SMG from a locker and with an SMG kind
0:37:55 of hanging on a sling and a wand in
0:37:57 their hand they start making their way
0:37:59 to the hall where you guys are as
0:38:01 British scene Premiere once before May
0:38:04 well be the first time you ever see
0:38:06 someone literally pull a wand well
0:38:08 there's just a flicker of confusion this
0:38:11 isn't someone I recognize I mean none of
0:38:13 the Chimera really are showing up much
0:38:16 at court uh the trimmer don't usually
0:38:18 make a very strong Presence at court so
0:38:20 absolutely not someone who I would know
0:38:22 their name or anything of that nature
0:38:24 is Eagle the one who has been obvious
0:38:26 getting us yes does he look like he'll
0:38:29 do it again he looks like he's willing
0:38:30 to but he's so very skilled at stealth
0:38:34 that he's not going to exert it until
0:38:37 unless someone feels they particularly
0:38:38 need it I am curious for us to how the
0:38:41 first level of obvious skate works if
0:38:43 you stay still you're invisible then I
0:38:45 am inclined to stay still and be
0:38:46 invisible okay the first acolyte well
0:38:49 second jogs pass with a wand and SMG the
0:38:52 other two remain in there as that person
0:38:54 takes off members of the team start
0:38:56 slipping in at this point as they enter
0:38:59 that main foyer area that is when the
0:39:01 obvious case starts going into effect
0:39:03 and this time uh it seems to be eagle
0:39:06 and shrike who dropped the next two
0:39:09 Britta using what Neil had given her and
0:39:13 the small amount of knowledge that an
0:39:15 access to obfuscation that she has I had
0:39:18 in her guilt genuinely had the naive
0:39:21 hope that they would be using that
0:39:22 obvious skate to slip us and not do what
0:39:26 they just said and she just feels that
0:39:29 guilt just feels worse as she realizes
0:39:33 how unlikely that thought had been when
0:39:37 the two of them make the kill it's quick
0:39:39 they drain them dry shrike does not seem
0:39:42 phased by the ACT
0:39:44 however Eagle seems to untone some
0:39:47 unspoken like prayer like his mouthing
0:39:49 words and it's almost as though he is
0:39:52 apologizing for some sin but the body
0:39:55 language and the way he in tones it is
0:39:58 like like a prayer for prey more like
0:40:01 saying thanks for what has been given
0:40:03 then saying sorry for what has been
0:40:06 taken like an apology that we met in
0:40:09 such a way but thank you for like
0:40:12 fueling the work that I must do yeah
0:40:15 that's that stifles the urge towards
0:40:18 sympathy she has for Eagle at first at
0:40:21 ever a split second she almost starts
0:40:24 stepping forward to she doesn't even
0:40:27 know what the idea of trying to give
0:40:30 some amount of comfort to someone that
0:40:33 she is being dragged into the
0:40:34 circumstance with is a bit ridiculous as
0:40:37 the step falters but hearing it you can
0:40:39 definitely tell he has he is certainly
0:40:42 aware that what he is doing is wrong
0:40:44 but he seems to feel that that what you
0:40:48 are attempting to do here makes those
0:40:51 sins acceptable
0:40:53 and that inclined spread at a speed back
0:40:55 up and go more towards the section that
0:40:59 they were speaking about not to rush but
0:41:02 again that pale hope that maybe the
0:41:06 quicker that they're in and out the
0:41:07 fewer lives will have to go for this
0:41:09 Phantom again is very careful to reduce
0:41:13 the bodies that are left to Ash once
0:41:15 they have confirmation that they're
0:41:18 through the magical defenses that have
0:41:20 been placed that is when the team starts
0:41:23 to split up Peru gestures for eagle and
0:41:26 shrike desire locating the tremir and
0:41:28 begin removing them tanak in him look to
0:41:31 you
0:41:32 well the two of them were off
0:41:34 searching for Tremaine removing
0:41:36 obstacles
0:41:38 we need to find veto quickly
0:41:41 the channel system here
0:41:42 covers a great deal of the campus our
0:41:45 time will be limited because once the
0:41:46 clan is alerted at one of their
0:41:48 chantries has been
0:41:50 sacked they will move to defend it then
0:41:54 let's keep following the trail
0:41:56 he gives a nod as he does Phantom
0:42:00 starts to peruse through the remains or
0:42:05 Ash that was left behind and what they
0:42:08 were looking at in this room before the
0:42:11 group of you crashed and then this is
0:42:12 for your space strangely has a very
0:42:16 small stockpile of original components
0:42:19 weapons things they've been collected
0:42:21 for collecting from other areas of the
0:42:23 Chantry you're kind of getting the
0:42:25 impression that the tremeer do not
0:42:28 expect to be able to hold this location
0:42:30 for long
0:42:32 is there any repeating theme and what
0:42:34 Phantom is looking at like maybe
0:42:35 something was particularly protective
0:42:38 Phantom will actually kind of pointed
0:42:39 out that there is an entire wing of this
0:42:43 Subterranean Chantry that has been
0:42:45 completely sealed off I expect you will
0:42:48 find him there Britta is tight in her
0:42:51 posture but she just nods and looks to
0:42:53 the other two to follow Phantom and
0:42:55 Romeo seem to stay put and seem more
0:42:58 interested in securing this location and
0:43:01 Romeo I exercising whatever strange
0:43:04 wraithfully abilities he possesses seems
0:43:07 to haunt this space seizing control of
0:43:11 it Baron gestures to you and the three
0:43:14 start heading down the wing
0:43:20 Alfredo will not be dropping the
0:43:22 auspicious enhancements to her eyesight
0:43:25 and to her hearing she'll keep them up
0:43:28 and partly to be following the trail of
0:43:31 mushrooms and partly just as a
0:43:33 precaution as you head down the wing
0:43:36 that's closed off a lot of the lighting
0:43:39 the lights that they keep to kind of
0:43:41 illuminate these tunnel pathways are
0:43:43 blown out and Starker what few remain
0:43:47 functional kind of blink on and off what
0:43:51 seems to blown them out if there's any
0:43:52 if there's any indication fungal growths
0:43:55 yep that trucks eventually you get to
0:43:59 this very like heavy heavy heavy looking
0:44:02 security door and the security door is
0:44:06 slick and Ruddy and has this kind of
0:44:10 orangey tinge does it smell like blood
0:44:14 orange smells like meat meat is the
0:44:17 orange matching the fungus yes this
0:44:19 store or looks heavy but does it look
0:44:21 locked it does appear to be quite locked
0:44:24 down Britta is going to stealthily
0:44:27 approach the door keeping her hearing
0:44:30 very focused on the other side in case
0:44:33 there's some sign of movement that she
0:44:34 could translate as a hint as you
0:44:37 can do the other side you hear groans of
0:44:39 pain do they sound like they belong to
0:44:42 veto anyone else
0:44:44 you don't recognize that as Vito's voice
0:44:47 okay
0:44:49 brother is going to give unlocking the
0:44:51 door a go it is a DEX plus larceny at a
0:44:55 difficulty of nine as you approach the
0:44:58 door I need a willpower check to not
0:45:01 become impossibly lost ah speaking of
0:45:04 willpower checks when would you like
0:45:06 that why don't you go ahead and give me
0:45:08 the that one now and then we'll follow
0:45:13 it up with the resistance to the Chantry
0:45:16 defenses can I spend willpower on either
0:45:19 on the second
0:45:21 okay so the first one being the strike
0:45:25 of midnight your purple score yep yep
0:45:30 three for the week of nightmares for all
0:45:32 that just happened okay and now I need a
0:45:36 willpower roll to resist the uh
0:45:39 enchantment year difficulty six and you
0:45:41 can spend willpower I will do so I do
0:45:43 not want to be lost here forever
0:45:46 tens being one success right yes two
0:45:50 successes okay you do not find yourself
0:45:53 suddenly lost while attempting to walk a
0:45:55 straight line and you make it to the
0:45:57 door now for the door it looks like
0:46:00 there is a electronic lock on it you
0:46:03 have the tools with which you can pick
0:46:05 at it and attempt to trigger unlocking
0:46:08 but it is very difficult so you're going
0:46:11 to be rolling at a difficulty of nine
0:46:13 we do have access to that whole prep
0:46:16 room if I go around and take a look how
0:46:19 far back was that the prep room a short
0:46:22 walk but a bit of a distance to travel
0:46:25 I'll give it a go I'll spend another
0:46:27 willpower
0:46:31 no successes you work at it and you hear
0:46:33 like a buzzing noise
0:46:35 a slight red light and it does not allow
0:46:38 you to pass it Britta turns and shakes
0:46:40 her head I haven't got this it's beyond
0:46:42 me he looks to Tanakh we are going to
0:46:46 have to force the door
0:46:48 and he looks a little concerned when he
0:46:51 says that
0:46:52 she approaches the door
0:46:55 and gently shoves it off its [ __ ] hinge
0:46:59 and the big steel door
0:47:01 collapses to the ground in front of you
0:47:04 and then the other side of that door
0:47:07 there are no working lights
0:47:09 but it stinks
0:47:11 it smells like infected flesh
0:47:15 the walls are runny with mucus and pus
0:47:18 against the wall across from the door
0:47:21 you see the source of those groans a
0:47:25 Premiere one of the ones who is even
0:47:27 present when The Killing Spree first
0:47:30 arrived to New Haven
0:47:32 and they are caked against the wall
0:47:36 it is conscious blood pumps through it
0:47:40 but is connected to this complex Network
0:47:44 that runs the walls the ceilings the
0:47:46 floor of fungus that is spread through
0:47:51 the area like veins like the nerves of a
0:47:55 thing this being a Chantry there's
0:47:57 probably at least candles Within Reach
0:48:00 for illumination or is that a wrong
0:48:02 assumption but it looks when you look in
0:48:04 the area you see a lot of wet sloppy
0:48:08 boxes and within were ritual components
0:48:12 old reports books what have you it looks
0:48:15 like this area they were trying to pack
0:48:18 it up and pull out but it was overrun
0:48:21 before they could finish among those
0:48:23 things you do find the candle anyway to
0:48:26 light it okay Britta will hold on to that
0:48:30 for now she's not gonna light it at this
0:48:32 moment but she's hoping to stick to self
0:48:36 even through this at least if there's
0:48:38 any chance of it we did just kick down a
0:48:40 door obviously so I know that we made
0:48:41 quite the announcement but I'm unsure of
0:48:44 how capable this person is of seeing us
0:48:52 a vertice tries to communicate
0:48:55 approaches
0:49:00 Britta would like to make a medicine
0:49:02 throw to see what's going on if he might
0:49:05 be missing a tongue or give me an
0:49:08 intelligence medicine your difficulty is
0:49:10 five
0:49:11 two successes with two successes you're
0:49:14 leaning close
0:49:15 and determine that this tremeer or
0:49:18 remains of them as caked against the
0:49:21 wall covered in this mushroom and flesh
0:49:24 and spongy tissue and one of the eyes
0:49:27 moves while the other is paralyzed and
0:49:30 he looks right at you
0:49:32 certain that he has his tongue because
0:49:34 what he says is
0:49:40 all right well
0:49:43 that sounds so tired
0:49:49 initiative I don't
0:49:55 does it sound like Vita's voice no oh
0:49:58 it's not initiative but the Cadence is
0:50:00 right those are not his vocal cords but
0:50:03 he's using them
0:50:04 looking him over if I speak to him and
0:50:08 say
0:50:09 are you yourself
0:50:12 trying to test how much of this person
0:50:15 is left
0:50:19 kitten
0:50:21 Britta is reviled by what's happened to
0:50:24 this person and certainly uh disquieted
0:50:27 by this but is going to light her candle
0:50:33 now I'm getting ready to go deeper in
0:50:35 you light the candle you have a look
0:50:38 around and realize that there is a Dory
0:50:41 to each side the fungal presence is
0:50:44 worse both ways but more importantly
0:50:47 you realize that you're alone
0:50:54 on that realization she looks back
0:50:56 towards where the seal door was kicked
0:50:59 in trying to figure out what has
0:51:00 happened to the other two may seem
0:51:02 missing I won't attempt to call out for
0:51:05 them you wait for a response and all you
0:51:09 hear behind you
0:51:12 kitchen
0:51:14 but nothing from them
0:51:16 for the pure sake of trying to figure
0:51:19 out this new horror Britta is going to
0:51:22 walk towards the seal door the one that
0:51:24 she came from just see if it works she's
0:51:27 been trapped in too many time Loops
0:51:29 lately to not give that a go you make it
0:51:31 to the doorway and the only thing that
0:51:32 is unusual is that this fungus seems to
0:51:35 grow so rapidly that while you are
0:51:37 working on other things veins of it have
0:51:41 already expanded through the now open
0:51:43 doorway I'll try calling out the names
0:51:45 again and see what happens just in case
0:51:49 they left
0:51:50 you call out and the only thing this
0:51:52 time you hear
0:51:54 is your voice echoing in the tunnel
0:51:56 Britta tightens her grip on the pistol
0:51:59 in her hand and keeping the candle
0:52:03 upright still make sure to place the
0:52:06 knife in that same hand as the candle
0:52:08 and heads on in and then there's a
0:52:10 choice between the two paths kind of a
0:52:12 left or right situation yes there is is
0:52:14 there any identifying information about
0:52:17 left or right to the left there is the
0:52:20 light of kind of one of those blinking
0:52:23 fluorescent lights from down here the
0:52:26 other way is just pitch black and it's
0:52:28 equally fungusified oh yes all right
0:52:31 let's go into the dark Britta very much
0:52:35 in battle mode tense and ready decides
0:52:38 upon the path that doesn't already have
0:52:40 a light set in it I mean she keeps her
0:52:42 eyes on the poor warped Premiere as long
0:52:45 as she can but as soon as that path like
0:52:48 the darkness of it overtakes her focus
0:52:50 is entirely there
0:52:52 you venture into the dark and as you go
0:52:55 forward you come to a hall with a
0:52:58 handful of open doorways at each flank
0:53:01 so each side there are these rows of
0:53:03 open doorways when you peer into the
0:53:05 first one you see what looks like an
0:53:08 open space cement floor an old chalk
0:53:12 sigils drawn onto the floor and you
0:53:15 start to kind of piece together that
0:53:17 this is some ritual space where young
0:53:20 tremeer would probably go when preparing
0:53:22 for the night they'd have access to all
0:53:24 of the components that are available
0:53:25 right here for them to do their evening
0:53:27 rituals and then they could be on their
0:53:29 way when you look to the left you see a
0:53:33 small 10 foot by 10 foot room and all
0:53:36 there is is a now emptied bookshelf
0:53:39 soaked and ruined clothing lying around
0:53:43 a handful of components and a cop soaked
0:53:47 in what the same fluid it looks like
0:53:49 mucus whatever is it's like thick and
0:53:52 reflects the light of the candle does
0:53:55 the clothing match Vito's size
0:53:57 theoretically it does not one of the
0:54:00 main articles of clothing that stand out
0:54:01 to you is a robe and keeping veto in
0:54:05 mind are there events drains that kind
0:54:08 of thing oh yes and the vents what pipes
0:54:12 you find they are covered in this stuff
0:54:15 when Britta's eyes float around the room
0:54:17 those start to become some of the first
0:54:19 places rise land but she'll go on to a
0:54:22 couple of the other doors as you head up
0:54:24 back onto the hallway to continue your
0:54:27 investigation back where that
0:54:29 unfortunate soul was pressed against the
0:54:31 wall you hear a squelching noise I will
0:54:35 go back and investigate and as you take
0:54:38 just a step in that direction you hear
0:54:41 the clicking of many legs moving down to
0:54:45 the floor
0:54:46 and you recognize the sound and it
0:54:49 reminds you of your past visit to Hell
0:54:51 House at that sound Britta puts the
0:54:54 knife away and switches guns this isn't
0:54:56 pistol time anymore the assault rifle is
0:54:59 in both hands she sets the candle down
0:55:01 at her feet gets ready
0:55:07 sure enough
0:55:08 a kind of Milky wet head comes crawling
0:55:15 into the room on these legs that seem
0:55:18 made from ribs and intestines Britta is
0:55:21 spending enough time to absorb this
0:55:23 visually before shooting that's all you
0:55:26 mean a tackle
0:55:28 stuff
0:55:29 successes
0:55:31 four dice will roll over into damage
0:55:35 it's a lot of ones
0:55:37 three damage with three successes you
0:55:40 actually kill it Brenda did not expect
0:55:41 that Britta was really prepared for the
0:55:45 horse and she remained so as there to
0:55:48 come it makes a coconut cracking noise
0:55:51 and inside you just see chunks of this
0:55:55 fungus that seems to have overrun and
0:55:57 rotted the brain out is that the
0:55:59 premiere the one that had been caked
0:56:01 against the wall oh yes there's a moment
0:56:04 of that visceral horror of seeing how
0:56:07 far gone as you take that moment you
0:56:10 notice that the fungus and the veins and
0:56:12 the Flesh and and this viscous whatever
0:56:16 it is is growing very rapidly I can see
0:56:21 it now and you can now see that it has
0:56:24 grown along in the direction of the
0:56:26 trail you have walked and the way that a
0:56:29 plant grows toward the sun it's
0:56:31 following my steps yes like like this
0:56:34 fungus it can't move it can't grab you
0:56:37 you know for certain that it hungers for
0:56:41 your blood Fred is not convinced by the
0:56:43 narration that I can't grab her so she's
0:56:45 gonna go ahead and keep moving once
0:56:49 she's taken this thing out I'll try
0:56:51 going back to that hallway with the
0:56:53 other doors if if there are doors that I
0:56:55 haven't looked into there are and as you
0:56:57 look in through some of the doors you
0:56:59 can see apprentices tremire
0:57:02 round to the bed have grown haven't
0:57:05 grown into the wall the floor it's like
0:57:09 over the course of a day this fungus
0:57:12 grew rampant through this place and as
0:57:14 they slept it took them
0:57:17 Britta can feel that sort of shaking
0:57:19 coldness that in a human usually
0:57:22 accompanies a heart thumping and that
0:57:25 kind of Terror but in this body it's
0:57:28 just this strange sensation of where it
0:57:31 should be
0:57:32 how many tramir am I looking at in this
0:57:35 area yes I killed three and all
0:57:37 including that first one they had to
0:57:39 shoot in the head and they look
0:57:40 similarly degraded yes
0:57:43 I'm sharing them okay effectively when
0:57:46 Britta intends to shoot she'll set the
0:57:48 candle down so as not to be trying to
0:57:50 shoot this with one hand one of them
0:57:53 kind of twitches and screams when you
0:57:56 kill it Britta bites back the horror at
0:57:59 like shooting something that looks so
0:58:02 humanoid but the twitching is a terrible
0:58:04 Vindication can I get a perception
0:58:06 investigation yep her instances is still
0:58:08 up it's normally defeat but you've got
0:58:10 the candle reducing the darkness penalty
0:58:12 so if seven and then another uh
0:58:15 reduction equal to your awesome X rating
0:58:17 so that's a difficulty of four
0:58:20 one success with one success you reached
0:58:22 the end of the hall and find that there
0:58:24 is a stairwell that goes deeper and
0:58:27 further down into this complex right at
0:58:29 the top of the stairs backing away and
0:58:32 fleeing when it really gets a good look
0:58:34 at you is a hand a severed human hand
0:58:39 that is covered in pustules and teeth
0:58:43 and it flees you
0:58:45 did it appear to have eyes no and if it
0:58:48 did gone now I realized with all the
0:58:50 pustules that this might be a complete
0:58:53 non-question but would the skin tone
0:58:55 match for you now the skin tone does not
0:58:57 match Vito all right that hint it's
0:58:59 Premiere made oh extra gross well
0:59:05 I'm gonna try to follow that hand I
0:59:07 shoot it down I suppose you follow the
0:59:09 hand down by the time you're down that
0:59:11 floor my hand is gone well I've ended up
0:59:13 here anyway so left of the candle what
0:59:16 you see before you is a vault that is
0:59:19 sealed but it doesn't seem hermetically
0:59:21 sealed anymore as area around it has
0:59:24 kind of overgrown with this fungus there
0:59:27 are windowed lab spaces and within one
0:59:32 you see this thing that looks like an
0:59:35 imp it is very very small maybe a foot
0:59:38 tall and this very kind of sick withered
0:59:42 homunculus
0:59:44 kind of looks and seems confused that
0:59:48 there's anyone even here and it seems to
0:59:50 already be showing signs of infection
0:59:52 but is hiding in one of the lab rooms I
0:59:55 don't have very much in the way of these
0:59:57 veins and tendrils of Flesh does it look
1:00:00 like the gargoyle it definitely looks
1:00:02 like a creature that was created through
1:00:06 the use of hermetic thromo surgery it
1:00:08 looks like a little magical thing but
1:00:10 the little magical thing does not seem
1:00:13 overly resistant to wet whatever it is
1:00:16 that's spreading through here
1:00:18 her eyes scanning over what's happened
1:00:20 to it and the way that it's hiding tries
1:00:23 to say hey just to see if it can respond
1:00:27 it makes a confusing sound and turns
1:00:30 behind and behind uh some of these boxes
1:00:33 that had been arranged again to pack up
1:00:36 and move out of the space you see a
1:00:38 familiar face
1:00:40 as Reiss
1:00:41 reveals himself
1:00:43 on absolute reflex but as next reflexes
1:00:47 to say hey again just out of pure shock
1:00:51 but does he look infected he does not
1:00:54 what the hell are you doing here
1:00:57 he seems irritated that you have
1:00:59 involved yourself in this Britta doubles
1:01:02 over his appearance deeply confused and
1:01:06 surprised that he seems okay he seems
1:01:08 Haggard and like he's having a a rough
1:01:11 go at it but seems to have locked this
1:01:14 little room that he's in down you can
1:01:17 hear him largely because of heightened
1:01:19 senses that the glass between your
1:01:21 muffles is a great deal Mysteries
1:01:24 um you're not safe here
1:01:28 and why might that be it's a
1:01:30 sarcastically gesturing to the
1:01:31 apocalypse that the two of you are
1:01:33 standing in no I mean
1:01:35 all of this it's
1:01:37 getting cleared out
1:01:40 is your Corey here
1:01:42 is Miles deemed necessary to insult the
1:01:45 charmir further
1:01:47 he talks to you but like he's very
1:01:49 quickly packing up some information and
1:01:51 is like filling this like leather kind
1:01:54 of messenger bag up Britta looks around
1:01:57 again are there signs of more dead in
1:02:01 here the number he is in no but there
1:02:05 are definitely bodies that are overgrown
1:02:09 Monsters made in service to the tramir
1:02:12 that are infected and transformed one of
1:02:15 the labs has something big kind of just
1:02:18 brooding and pacing and it it doesn't
1:02:20 seem to have the the sensory organs
1:02:23 necessary to detect you
1:02:25 but
1:02:27 it is big and moves
1:02:30 the Cerise how many people have died
1:02:32 here
1:02:33 he looks like
1:02:36 he looks like he has no intentions of
1:02:37 answering that question
1:02:39 but regrets the truth of it
1:02:42 enough then if not handled correctly
1:02:46 all of this can
1:02:48 end up having been wasteful meaningless
1:02:50 in the end
1:02:52 but you have not explained why you are
1:02:53 here
1:02:55 and how you got in here
1:02:58 it's not my Coterie
1:03:00 I'm sorry but I have to kill veto you
1:03:03 cannot kill Vito he's too important puts
1:03:07 his hands up please
1:03:09 I could exert my will over you
1:03:11 I could
1:03:13 but I'm not going to
1:03:15 I'm going to hope
1:03:17 do you recognize that what I am telling
1:03:19 you is the truth
1:03:22 is connected to an ancient vampire of
1:03:25 incredible power
1:03:27 so ancient
1:03:28 so powerful
1:03:30 that they themselves are a sympathetic
1:03:32 link to what could be vampire kind
1:03:35 or as you see here happen everywhere
1:03:38 Kindred are cruel and monstrous I am no
1:03:43 exception but surely you've learned at
1:03:45 this point that I'm speaking the truth
1:03:47 Vito zantosa represents
1:03:51 freedom
1:03:53 from the Kindred condition
1:03:55 we couldn't make the world better
1:03:59 and to do that I am willing to sacrifice
1:04:01 many lives
1:04:03 because for thousands of years
1:04:06 for thousands of years into our future
1:04:11 I will have saved many more
1:04:14 veto must live
1:04:17 what do you mean when you say freedom
1:04:20 from the Kindred condition you know
1:04:22 exactly what I mean
1:04:23 Britta looks his eyes that is a solid
1:04:29 hook for her scanning back and forth
1:04:31 looking for the truth there is a
1:04:34 disaster coming something truly terrible
1:04:38 and the only way the only way to survive
1:04:42 it is to not be kindred at all
1:04:46 help me
1:04:48 let's get out of this place
1:04:51 and I will reward you
1:04:54 Britta can't conceal that she's
1:04:56 considering it but the way she got here
1:04:59 with the tamahirah is Weighing on her
1:05:03 as you consider
1:05:06 a hand slaps against the glass beside
1:05:08 you
1:05:09 when you look
1:05:11 parent is there but a startles she turns
1:05:15 the gun immediately but lowers it
1:05:17 slightly you must not allow distraction
1:05:20 he says kinda confused and way Haggard
1:05:26 compared to when you saw him just a
1:05:28 little while ago does he look orange at
1:05:30 all no but he does look to have suffered
1:05:33 wounds and is visibly like incoherent I
1:05:37 have found Vito
1:05:40 come I'll show you
1:05:43 is there any that way that we could work
1:05:46 together
1:05:47 where the looks between the two
1:05:49 by the time you look back to uh Reiss
1:05:51 he's gone Britta bites back the sound of
1:05:54 surprise feeling a bit foolish for
1:05:56 having been surprised at all but hope
1:05:59 keeps getting her
1:06:00 she swallows it down looks back to
1:06:02 Perrin and dips her head in a slight nod
1:06:07 this way he leans and walks like he's
1:06:10 got kind of like a slightly broken neck
1:06:12 that seems in control of himself
1:06:15 she's slow she looks around for a race
1:06:18 again but she does eventually follow
1:06:21 dragging her feet
1:06:23 you scan the area but don't see Reiss
1:06:26 and as you head deeper in you arrived to
1:06:29 what looks to be prison cells the space
1:06:32 is specifically made to hold well things
1:06:36 like veto and one of them uh is every
1:06:40 bit of cell as that is as much like an
1:06:42 observation room like a space that holds
1:06:45 something that you can watch from like
1:06:47 the hall
1:06:48 and that room is filled with Gore that
1:06:53 clings to the ceilings the floor the
1:06:55 walls
1:06:57 and sitting
1:06:59 Barefoot and just kind of linen pants to
1:07:03 the shirt
1:07:04 or cotton pants and a shirt is this
1:07:07 hideously malformed Vito xantosa
1:07:13 there you are
1:07:15 he sniffs the air
1:07:18 I know you are here
1:07:20 I have been thinking of you
1:07:23 he says approaching the glass
1:07:26 when you say malformed again can he see
1:07:29 me
1:07:30 by the sniffing
1:07:32 I'm not so sure
1:07:34 his eyes seem very uh Pink and kind of
1:07:40 messed up but they at least track in
1:07:44 your direction turning back to perin is
1:07:47 he there yes well he's just kind of
1:07:50 staring blankly
1:07:52 Britta looks at him
1:07:54 a bit of desperation
1:07:56 and puts her hand on his forearm and she
1:08:00 says
1:08:01 you needed me to be here for this to go
1:08:04 right
1:08:06 healing is down
1:08:08 and says to you
1:08:11 kitten
1:08:13 Perrin yes initiative
1:08:16 and that is when you hear sounds from
1:08:19 all of the other labs as glass starts to
1:08:22 shatter everywhere
1:08:24 [Music]
1:08:27 Ira miles and win three of you are
1:08:31 gathered
1:08:32 at miles's office just as he's sort of
1:08:36 determining what to replace the the bust
1:08:40 with so that he has something occupying
1:08:42 that now empty space and it's just the
1:08:45 three of you kind of recovering from
1:08:47 whatever it was that when experienced
1:08:50 wind didn't think together close before
1:08:53 she left she grabbed what was important
1:08:55 to her which was basically her books any
1:08:58 little tchotchkes she'd brought her
1:09:00 dad's gun which more of a teddy bear at
1:09:03 this point than an actual functioning
1:09:05 firearm for her but she kind of once
1:09:07 they get up in the office she kind of
1:09:08 puts her back down and looks to Miles
1:09:10 you don't happen to have like any extra
1:09:14 clothes here do you for you in your size
1:09:17 yes I do I was gonna take anything from
1:09:19 anywhere but I shouldn't be surprised
1:09:22 yeah no I have it for just about every
1:09:24 one of you about two sets worth Iowa
1:09:26 cracks like half a smile
1:09:28 shows a lot of forethought you Grace if
1:09:32 we get into a lot of fights he's a
1:09:34 learning robot yeah does that happen a
1:09:36 lot around here
1:09:38 the uh
1:09:40 professional curiosity what did happen
1:09:42 if you don't mind sharing
1:09:44 I don't mind sharing but miles were
1:09:46 close where
1:09:47 though yeah he goes over to a closet and
1:09:51 he grabs like essentially a package of
1:09:53 clothing that is still with tags and
1:09:56 whatnot it's like here you go
1:09:58 should be your exact size wind just kind
1:10:01 of takes it thank you and she just
1:10:03 actually goes into the closet and shuts
1:10:05 the door behind her and starts talking
1:10:06 as soon as she's out of sight iron [ __ ]
1:10:09 a thumb at the closet she just walked
1:10:11 into and mouths is that normal well just
1:10:14 nods his head and goes over to his desk
1:10:17 and shakes his head a little bit and
1:10:18 listens so
1:10:21 I had come back from looking for Kabir
1:10:24 everything
1:10:26 something's [ __ ] with me and my
1:10:28 ability to track him
1:10:30 um I I would follow his Trail for a
1:10:33 while and then the trail would get kind
1:10:36 of hanky and then I would end up right
1:10:38 back at the hotel room and I can't
1:10:41 decide whether that means he's there and
1:10:44 I can't see him
1:10:45 or he's [ __ ] with me and doesn't want
1:10:48 me to find him or it's not his choice
1:10:50 that I find him or not
1:10:52 so then I figured I should
1:10:54 at least be productive in other
1:10:57 ways and so I pulled I destroyed the TV
1:11:00 for one thing because I'm sick of
1:11:01 hearing about Sri Lanka because that
1:11:03 that [ __ ] messed with him too she
1:11:06 comes out of the closet and like pulls
1:11:07 her boots on
1:11:09 just proceeds to start yanking price
1:11:10 tags off you're supposed to do that
1:11:12 before you put them on but yeah
1:11:14 um I was in the dark in a closet there
1:11:16 were priorities you can't get her new
1:11:18 shoes I won't wear them yeah at this
1:11:22 point it's a it's a living habitat and I
1:11:24 would feel bad about killing it
1:11:27 um anyway so there's there is no
1:11:30 indication in her voice that what she is
1:11:32 saying is a joke but there's no
1:11:33 indication that it's not
1:11:35 let's go take you with face value
1:11:38 yeah play a good move
1:11:39 so I took the call from miles
1:11:43 I literally hang up seems like the weird
1:11:47 word I pressed the button to disconnect
1:11:50 and then I heard something scraping at
1:11:53 the window
1:11:54 and it was I looked out past the curtain
1:11:57 a little bit and it was dozens dozens of
1:12:01 starving Kindred with their
1:12:03 teeth bared and screaming for ravana and
1:12:07 hunger and ravana
1:12:09 and then they burst in through the
1:12:11 bathroom window and they started
1:12:12 clambering over to me and I tried
1:12:14 turning into mist but they got a hit in
1:12:18 on me and and I couldn't I couldn't
1:12:21 I felt it it was there
1:12:25 and there was nothing I could do about
1:12:26 it not to disagree Sheriff but evidence
1:12:31 says wasn't there bathroom window wasn't
1:12:34 broken and nothing happened to your body
1:12:37 well I'm dealing with a [ __ ] ravnos
1:12:40 here so who the [ __ ] knows it was real
1:12:42 for me kinaz has had like yeah that's a
1:12:45 fair point and I know it wasn't real
1:12:47 because
1:12:48 I wasn't devoured by 20 or 30 hungry
1:12:52 whites to some sort of mental attack of
1:12:54 some sort
1:12:56 this goes along with the other weird
1:12:58 things we've been hearing what the [ __ ]
1:12:59 is ravana I'm sorry I go to you for
1:13:01 these questions I I've oh I've heard the
1:13:04 name in like Legends and stuff but I
1:13:06 have no idea what bearing that would
1:13:09 have on this now no matter is the one I
1:13:12 would ask puts you step up over I guess
1:13:15 the rest of us I mean I can look into it
1:13:18 but I'm not 100 I would get a clear
1:13:21 answer I mean your Mutual Woods friend
1:13:24 might be an answer Raven yeah where is
1:13:27 she [ __ ] nose
1:13:30 supposed to be local to the area
1:13:32 hypothetically she is but she's also
1:13:34 Gangrel and she does what she wants
1:13:36 she went independent quite a few months
1:13:38 back and
1:13:39 she's not really beholden to anyone here
1:13:41 she we talk she answers my messages
1:13:43 apparently if I'm not in a city but
1:13:46 that puts you again a step up over some
1:13:49 of the rest of us I can try and get into
1:13:52 contact with her but I don't
1:13:55 she's dealing with
1:13:58 when kind of puts her she kind of just
1:14:01 kind of perches on the edge of the desk
1:14:02 and pulls a knee up and kind of puts her
1:14:05 hand on her head and it's just like
1:14:08 she's dealing with larger issues and
1:14:11 I'll be very honest as long as she's
1:14:12 dealing with them she's
1:14:14 she's not a threat to anyone around here
1:14:17 my understanding from Mr Giovanni is
1:14:21 those larger issues or maybe what you
1:14:23 and I need to talk to her about
1:14:26 it's
1:14:27 possible if you can put a word in
1:14:30 he leans up against the wall kind of
1:14:33 near where that ashtray was and pulls
1:14:36 out the pack of morallys is this still
1:14:38 okay with you yeah that's perfectly fine
1:14:41 it's gonna be a common occurrence around
1:14:43 here when kind of Pats the pockets for a
1:14:45 minute for getting their new pants and
1:14:47 then goes into the closet and checks her
1:14:50 pants and to see if she has a joint she
1:14:52 doesn't
1:14:54 part of the things
1:14:56 I want to do around here is
1:14:59 talk to Raven conclude this business
1:15:01 with Mr Giovanni what exactly does Mr
1:15:04 Giovanni want to talk to Raven about you
