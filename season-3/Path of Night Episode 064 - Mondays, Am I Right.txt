0:00:28 the path of night
0:00:28 [Music]
0:00:38 last time on path of night
0:00:41 Ira returned to the group
0:00:43 and requested that everyone participate
0:00:45 in a game of questions and answers
0:00:48 suddenly
0:00:50 when we entered the room convinced that
0:00:52 Ira was a threat to eating
0:00:55 the quarter recited with win and managed
0:00:57 to stake IRA
0:01:00 protected Eden when Johnny was overtaken
0:01:03 by his lack of blood and willpower
0:01:05 miles's efforts to prepare the group and
0:01:08 a fortuitous call from Neil brought back
0:01:10 some order
0:01:13 foreign
0:01:14 [Music]
0:01:32 they've been chasing you
0:01:34 through the city
0:01:36 the traffic
0:01:37 saying the car was not working out
0:01:40 and it's only a matter of time now
0:01:42 before all of these ravenous find their
0:01:44 way to you you
0:01:46 weathers a Mayan Kabir
0:01:50 have to stop somewhere soon
0:01:52 and Kabir is not overly helpful
0:01:55 he keeps coming in and out of catatonia
0:01:59 wait
0:02:00 I thought he was staked it was
0:02:04 Neil
0:02:06 hangs up the phone that weathers gave
0:02:07 him
0:02:08 hands it back to him before realizing
0:02:11 like hey wait that was my phone
0:02:13 but let's do it in order to get back to
0:02:15 letters weather seems completely
0:02:18 frustrated with the way that kabir's
0:02:21 power seems to fluctuate it isn't just
0:02:24 the chemistry that is displaying wild
0:02:28 effects but his command over beasts and
0:02:32 fortitude go between him being totally
0:02:36 vulnerable
0:02:37 to well
0:02:40 shoving a steak out of his chest Neil
0:02:43 looks really like his brow furrows
0:02:47 partly because he's in the back seat
0:02:49 with Kabir
0:02:50 and that's not a comfortable place to be
0:02:52 and then looks over his shoulder his
0:02:56 mind is racing and he looks at weathers
0:02:58 and am I in the front seat and goes
0:03:02 wait wait wait wait
0:03:04 um hold on weather's you staked come
0:03:07 here yeah but there's no stake in him
0:03:09 right now no he's like he's restraining
0:03:13 Kabir who Bears his fangs and starts
0:03:15 hissing uncontrollably and we're
0:03:18 we're being chased he looks over
0:03:20 shoulder at like look you can see them
0:03:22 coming up who's chasing us Amaya takes a
0:03:25 look at the rear view mirror
0:03:27 something happened
0:03:29 and ever since these ravnotes have been
0:03:31 going out how do you know the ravnos
0:03:35 her eyes kind of for a reverse Furrow
0:03:37 what do you what do you mean how do you
0:03:40 know that those are ravnos
0:03:42 because this is only happening to
0:03:43 ravenos right
0:03:45 what's happening and as he's Neil's a
0:03:48 paranoid mulcavian he's starting to get
0:03:51 some like really uncomfortable questions
0:03:53 as parts of this scenario start not
0:03:57 making sense
0:03:58 as he asked those questions into Maya
0:04:00 pauses he looks at weathers and goes
0:04:01 talk to me tell me about how you staked
0:04:04 him tell me when you staked him and he's
0:04:06 going to try very hard
0:04:08 to open his eyes as far as they can
0:04:11 to if this is some sort of Illusion
0:04:14 see if he can see past it and as a
0:04:16 matter of fact I will additionally and I
0:04:19 don't even know Neil doesn't know if
0:04:20 this would make any difference but in
0:04:22 his experience looking at things from
0:04:24 like a different angle a literally
0:04:26 different angle that people do not
0:04:27 expect you to look from can kind of help
0:04:30 to bypass things so he's actually going
0:04:32 to look from the sky through lightning
0:04:35 senses make a perception alertness roll
0:04:37 your difficulty is eight reduced by
0:04:40 heightened census yes uh he'll spend a
0:04:42 willpower on this
0:04:44 eight successes
0:04:46 would have been nine I got a one so what
0:04:48 you see one Kabir staked and where
0:04:53 there's a shaking him and trying to
0:04:55 restrain an already staked Kindred the
0:04:58 ravnos who are giving Chase
0:05:01 aren't really there
0:05:03 however
0:05:05 in this parking lot
0:05:08 that New York calls traffic
0:05:10 there is someone who is walking between
0:05:13 cars
0:05:14 headed towards the group of you
0:05:18 and she is a woman who is dressed and a
0:05:25 pair of jeans wearing lots of Jewelry in
0:05:30 one hand she's holding this kind of old
0:05:33 weathered looking knife
0:05:36 and you realize
0:05:37 that these Illusions are not being
0:05:40 created by Kabir
0:05:42 but the obfuscated woman
0:05:45 who is hunting for him
0:05:48 and on her way to the car
0:05:51 okay okay okay okay
0:05:53 weathers I need you to listen to me and
0:05:55 it's gonna sound crazy and I'm gonna
0:05:57 need you to do it anyways
0:05:59 Lego could be
0:06:01 Drive okay if you have to hop a curb I
0:06:04 don't care it's not him none of this is
0:06:07 happening but someone is coming someone
0:06:08 is coming right now I can see her she's
0:06:11 coming for Kabir she's coming for us
0:06:13 she's the one doing this and I'm gonna
0:06:15 try and stop it I'm gonna try and I'm
0:06:17 gonna try and and pull her off the trail
0:06:19 I need you to drive how much you care
0:06:22 about the superior guy
0:06:23 Neil hesitates
0:06:25 real hard it's not subtle at all that
0:06:29 there's a big part of him that's just
0:06:30 like [ __ ] this dude dump him in an alley
0:06:33 I don't care about him and then he
0:06:36 pauses and goes
0:06:38 wind cares about him a lot I know a
0:06:40 place we can lay low okay are you sure
0:06:43 but we're gonna have to ditch the car
0:06:44 okay
0:06:46 um how much you can't see her you can't
0:06:49 see her if she's coming I'll keep eyes
0:06:51 and I'll try and throw her off get I'll
0:06:55 try and throw her off I'm not as fast as
0:06:57 you guys are I can't run with
0:07:00 but but I can see all of them he gives
0:07:03 Amaya nod all right everyone ready
0:07:07 [Music]
0:07:08 Lex how far back is she before I open
0:07:11 the before we step outside like is she
0:07:13 real close or is she like voice distance
0:07:16 or where she is a little less than 50
0:07:21 yards away pretty close pretty close
0:07:24 okay
0:07:25 um
0:07:26 yeah let's let's go let's as soon as you
0:07:29 say let's go the light in the car goes
0:07:31 on doors open and weathers is yanking
0:07:36 kabira out of the car pulling him over
0:07:39 his shoulder and running uh he seems to
0:07:43 be trying to run slow enough that he
0:07:45 doesn't just immediately lose you
0:07:48 um but he's on the Move I'm gonna need a
0:07:50 DEX plus Athletics [ __ ] happening to me
0:07:52 to weave around cars and in this case
0:07:55 slide over the hood of one to keep up
0:07:57 with him
0:07:58 [Music]
0:08:01 hmm
0:08:02 where am I at for blood I woke up not
0:08:05 that long ago not having been in full
0:08:07 possession with my body you have three
0:08:09 blood in your system oh I'm not buffing
0:08:11 my decks all right uh I can't do that
0:08:16 what's a diff
0:08:17 six
0:08:19 well without a spec and two dice I got
0:08:21 one success I rolled a ten
0:08:25 Neil slides over the hood of the car and
0:08:28 manages to stick with Weathers in Amaya
0:08:30 who are
0:08:32 ridiculously athletic one of the things
0:08:35 that I'm going to try and watch for
0:08:36 right I'm gonna try and so I actually
0:08:38 have an eye in the sky so I can kind of
0:08:39 look at two places at once I and this
0:08:42 guy I'm gonna keep an eye on her the one
0:08:44 whoever is following us down here on the
0:08:47 ground I am wow they are faster than me
0:08:50 and I'm like struggling to keep up even
0:08:52 without the ability to get winded just I
0:08:54 can't keep up with these people
0:08:56 they probably are maybe still one of the
0:08:59 effects of chemistry so if they start
0:09:01 turning or like oop can't go that way
0:09:03 there's a wall uh when there clearly is
0:09:05 not I'm gonna try and be like no no it's
0:09:07 it's okay go go go and lead them through
0:09:09 so weather's into my Air clearly trying
0:09:12 to maneuver and keep their distance from
0:09:15 what they think is a horde of ravenous
0:09:18 chasing them
0:09:20 now Amaya looks to you and kind of gives
0:09:24 you this like a little smile like and
0:09:29 says to you if you've got some moves
0:09:31 Mark and then she Scoops you up and
0:09:34 pulls you over her shoulder
0:09:37 and says I promise I'm not going to
0:09:39 think any less of you
0:09:41 and starts I have no Pride running
0:09:45 with you over her shoulder Neil just
0:09:48 like bouncing over the back of her
0:09:50 shoulder now that I actually don't have
0:09:51 to worry about running is this woman
0:09:53 running after us or is she still doing
0:09:55 like the Casual villain saunter so it
0:09:58 goes in like this phase right it's the
0:10:00 Casual villain saunter and then as soon
0:10:01 as you guys Round the Corner she like
0:10:03 twitches and clearly like enters into a
0:10:07 frenzy and starts running so [ __ ] so
0:10:11 she's clearly in a frenzy yeah well
0:10:13 there goes that plan almost like a
0:10:15 zombie movie right yeah you can feel
0:10:18 like the power of something that should
0:10:20 not be driving her to this madness I'm
0:10:24 going to look at weathers and just be
0:10:27 like how uh
0:10:29 how how much do we give a [ __ ] about the
0:10:30 Masquerade right now a lot always okay I
0:10:33 just double trouble [ __ ] and he Ducks
0:10:35 into I'm double checking and he and he
0:10:39 Ducks into a deli limiting options here
0:10:44 all right that limit she's frenzying
0:10:46 that limits one of my options and we
0:10:48 don't wanna
0:10:50 [ __ ] up the Masquerade even in New York
0:10:51 that limits one of my other options um
0:10:54 oh [ __ ] how far away where do we go
0:10:57 she's running he starts heading to the
0:11:00 back of the deli and one of the deadly
0:11:04 employees kind of absent-mindedly opens
0:11:07 the door to the refrigerator and he
0:11:10 heads in you guys head in both you and
0:11:14 Kabir are being carried by Brujah
0:11:17 and when they shut the elevator the
0:11:19 elevator when they shut the
0:11:21 um refrigerator there's like a loud
0:11:23 noise from like a locking mechanism
0:11:26 he heads over to the other side of the
0:11:29 refrigerator
0:11:30 and bangs on it after a couple loud
0:11:33 thumps the back of the refrigerator
0:11:36 opens
0:11:37 and there are men in suits who starts
0:11:41 pulling you guys into the other side of
0:11:42 the refrigerator the door is shut behind
0:11:45 you and then in the distance like on the
0:11:47 other side of the door because of our
0:11:48 hiding sentence you can hear the locking
0:11:50 mechanism for the refrigerator Come
0:11:53 Undone
0:11:54 and then a second lock start happens
0:11:56 from the door that you guys just passed
0:11:59 through to exit the refrigerator on the
0:12:02 other side
0:12:07 inside in this space you can see there
0:12:10 are these screens monitoring activity
0:12:14 all over various parts of New York and
0:12:18 there are men in suits pacing people are
0:12:20 taking notes there is a big like board
0:12:24 that has images of prominent members of
0:12:27 the Sabbat some sketches some actual
0:12:30 photos and kind of sitting in the middle
0:12:34 of this kind of calculating their next
0:12:36 move is John Peterson
0:12:39 and he turns his head very slowly
0:12:42 towards the group of you
0:12:44 why are you here
0:12:46 any points at the four of you
0:12:50 weathers takes a step forward
0:12:53 we're out of options
0:12:55 and I think we've got some pretty
0:12:58 important Intel
0:12:59 and yawn nods
0:13:02 is the intelligence more important than
0:13:04 this location and weathers looks to you
0:13:07 um sort of a subjective question uh but
0:13:11 I I know who's
0:13:13 coming I know who's here I I know the
0:13:16 list of the packs that are going to be
0:13:18 crusading North into New Haven and I
0:13:20 know why the black hand is
0:13:22 stalled out
0:13:24 weather
0:13:25 fighting internally
0:13:27 interesting
0:13:29 he turns
0:13:31 it's out of his seat
0:13:33 you are a member of my child's
0:13:36 quartering
0:13:38 uh yes yeah
0:13:41 sir you're
0:13:43 archonship
0:13:45 you're far from home what's going on
0:13:48 oh God that's such a loaded question
0:13:52 um Neil your presence here really
0:13:54 depends on your ability to answer
0:13:56 questions regardless of how loaded or
0:13:58 complicated they are okay uh what's
0:14:00 going on is a much larger question uh
0:14:04 regarding I understand the whole parody
0:14:07 of my questions answer it okay well on a
0:14:09 global scale uh horrific things are
0:14:11 happening uh that are affecting Kindred
0:14:15 everywhere uh that are affecting
0:14:17 everyone everywhere you've obviously
0:14:19 seen the red star in the sky that
0:14:22 everyone can see now even the Mortal
0:14:24 populace can look up and just see it now
0:14:27 yes Doom's saying aside
0:14:30 tell me important information he says
0:14:33 kind of like realizing that you're just
0:14:34 everywhere
0:14:35 tell me what important information I
0:14:37 need to know regarding the activities of
0:14:39 the Black Hand
0:14:41 Corner Polonia and the Vykos
0:14:44 are here in the city meeting with
0:14:48 um a number of members
0:14:51 of the Sabbat they many of the packs
0:14:55 um however there seems to be some
0:14:57 internal problems installing
0:15:00 in the East are you aware of the Schism
0:15:03 of the Assamites the children of Hakeem
0:15:06 we were approached recently
0:15:09 by an elder brother of tejiras
0:15:12 of the Assamites and the Amar here
0:15:16 represents a kindred by the name of
0:15:18 Allah shrad yes they are approaching
0:15:22 seeking Sanctuary from some sort of
0:15:25 trouble that is taking place
0:15:27 in their Eagle's Nest what bearing does
0:15:32 this have on the black hand or what
0:15:34 um the trouble the thing that they're I
0:15:37 won't say its name but just call it the
0:15:38 Herald
0:15:39 of Hakeem because that is what it calls
0:15:42 itself has awoken and has decided that
0:15:46 all of the children of Hakeem are to be
0:15:49 beholden to the old laws the laws of
0:15:52 Hakeem and I am now to sort of
0:15:55 understand that a great deal of this
0:15:57 organization in the Sabbat the the black
0:15:59 hand
0:16:00 was made up of the Warriors of
0:16:04 the Assamites the children's of Hakeem
0:16:06 members of the web of knives and things
0:16:08 like that the the warrior cast of the
0:16:10 Assamites but since the herald has awoken
0:16:14 and is haunting all those who have
0:16:17 turned away from the roads of blood
0:16:22 um
0:16:22 the Assamites who made up probably the
0:16:25 majority of this black hand their major
0:16:27 fighting force
0:16:29 have abandoned the Sabbat and returned
0:16:31 to
0:16:33 unexpectedly the um carnal Polonia uh
0:16:38 and they the Sabbat were extremely
0:16:42 unhappy and wanted all of those who he
0:16:44 saw as traitors
0:16:46 are haunted to show a message that the
0:16:49 black hand that the Sabbat were still
0:16:52 strong which is why now they are trying
0:16:54 to Rally as many loyal pacts as they can
0:16:56 to get the engine of War moving again
0:17:00 hmm
0:17:02 they were waiting on a um someone a
0:17:05 guest some a guest that Polonia thought
0:17:07 was
0:17:08 important
0:17:09 well who is the guest
0:17:11 Neil thinks back real hard
0:17:15 Lex I ran before the names were said
0:17:19 it's still the week of nightmares can I
0:17:22 blow one of those to have gotten that
0:17:24 eyes of Chaos in the ambience that kind
0:17:26 of thing in the air yes you may I have
0:17:28 one left the name was dark Selena
0:17:33 uh I don't know the
0:17:36 I don't know the context but the name um
0:17:39 with Polonia the Vykos they were talking
0:17:41 about this individual uh dark Selena he
0:17:45 makes a bit of a face at that now to
0:17:47 explain
0:17:49 the mysterious benefactor in Maine
0:17:51 weathers kind of gives you a nod
0:17:54 I told who Neil has is worth it I have a
0:17:57 list of the packs too but that seems
0:17:59 maybe less important no it's important
0:18:01 write it down attach it to that board uh
0:18:05 there is someone who has been sending
0:18:08 messages from Portland uh rallying some
0:18:12 rather
0:18:14 unusual Kindred uh towards aiding in the
0:18:18 crusade of New England
0:18:20 and
0:18:21 the woman you speak of is sufficiently
0:18:25 influential if it is indeed her and she
0:18:28 is
0:18:29 somehow still intact and despite her
0:18:32 child's best efforts Neil clicks back to
0:18:36 a com a rooftop conversation with NYX
0:18:39 and Britta and he may be tying threads
0:18:43 that do not tie but his mind is tying
0:18:45 them this benefactor has brought two
0:18:47 groups to the region very low and in
0:18:52 number however allegedly capable of what
0:18:57 has been described as Powers long
0:18:59 forgotten
0:19:00 the first is a man by the name of Adonai
0:19:05 and what he calls his Furies another
0:19:10 is a group of canines who refer to
0:19:13 themselves as the harbingers of skulls
0:19:15 he actually sits down at one of the
0:19:18 desks and picks up a manila folder and
0:19:21 motions for you to approach neol the
0:19:24 seeming very in his element in a messy
0:19:26 conspiracy board has already attacked
0:19:28 all the names of the things up and then
0:19:30 hurries over have you ever seen Kindred
0:19:32 who look like this and he opens the
0:19:34 folder and he shows you photos that are
0:19:38 unsettling
0:19:41 the first is a cowled figure or the
0:19:46 white porcelain cherubic mask and in one
0:19:50 of the pictures that follows the mask is
0:19:53 gone and the person's face is flayed
0:19:58 revealing their skull
0:20:01 the practice some form of necromancy and
0:20:05 are quite powerful and seem to have some
0:20:08 form of Vendetta with the Giovanni I
0:20:10 know that your corduroy was in Boston
0:20:12 not too long ago and the Giovanni have
0:20:15 great sway there did the Giovanni
0:20:18 mention anything about harbingers of
0:20:21 skulls and did you see anything like
0:20:22 this individual in the Subway or in in
0:20:26 the streets or anywhere during your
0:20:29 visit to here in New York
0:20:31 no I've
0:20:33 not seen anything like that all right he
0:20:36 looks flustered perhaps they're not here
0:20:39 yet what about this he turns through
0:20:41 many pictures of dudes with Mohawks and
0:20:45 literal chainsaw hands and just nonsense
0:20:49 weird-looking monstrous vampires and
0:20:52 then he comes to one who is a man with a
0:20:56 leather jacket with spiked like
0:20:59 protruding from the shoulders and around
0:21:01 the collar and he's wearing this like
0:21:03 hoodie underneath hoods up and you can
0:21:06 see his face he's got like you know he's
0:21:09 got a bit of a full beard and on his
0:21:12 forehead
0:21:14 is a third eye
0:21:16 this is Adonai
0:21:18 have you ever heard of this ah a third
0:21:22 no no nothing like that they seem to be
0:21:25 in the area of the Vendetta against the
0:21:27 tremeer it would seem that the Camarilla
0:21:31 and the Giovanni are experiencing a
0:21:35 Resurgence of old enemies and if these
0:21:39 individuals are powerful
0:21:41 like intelligence seems to suggest the
0:21:45 advantage given to us by the sudden
0:21:49 disorder among the black hand is not
0:21:52 going to be a lasting advantage
0:21:54 so
0:21:56 he says
0:21:58 I'm going to need to determine how to
0:22:00 best use what few moments we have was
0:22:03 dark Selena there did you see her is she
0:22:05 in New York she wasn't there yet but
0:22:08 Polonia seemed to think she was on her
0:22:10 way that was the indication that he I
0:22:14 mean he even went so far as to say he
0:22:15 didn't want to be disturbed when his
0:22:17 guests arrived
0:22:19 if you
0:22:21 I don't know have a a picture of her or
0:22:24 something I can find out what she is but
0:22:28 [Music]
0:22:30 I think I know where to get one
0:22:33 the group of you when are you headed
0:22:35 back to New Haven Neil looks over at
0:22:37 weathers unabashedly hopefully we're
0:22:40 looking to get there as soon as possible
0:22:41 he says kind of looking at you
0:22:44 I'll fly you up go out of the area as
0:22:47 soon as possible
0:22:48 I need to Rendezvous with someone
0:22:50 let her know that we're going to be
0:22:52 taking a step back from New York
0:22:54 but I'm going to tell you this
0:22:57 New Haven is overloaded with Kindred
0:23:00 right now
0:23:01 that is not by accident
0:23:04 bodies
0:23:05 someone is going to be drawing the eye
0:23:08 of the Sabbat toward New Haven
0:23:10 we are going to attempt
0:23:12 to deal as much damage as we can
0:23:16 to Cardinal polonia's force and then we
0:23:18 are moving on New York and if we can
0:23:20 lock it down
0:23:22 we can end the Crusade
0:23:24 what about the thing underneath New York
0:23:28 the supernatural phenomena happens from
0:23:30 time to time in every city in New York's
0:23:31 massive
0:23:32 Neil doesn't say anything but a little
0:23:35 class is over his face of I'm not going
0:23:37 to speak out against the archon who's
0:23:39 the expert in the area but also you have
0:23:41 no idea what you're [ __ ] talking
0:23:42 about because he astraled around and
0:23:44 felt the [ __ ] down there so that look
0:23:47 flashes across his face but he doesn't
0:23:49 say anything
0:23:50 what I need
0:23:52 is for the group of you to make sure
0:23:54 that New Haven is prepared
0:23:57 I understand that New Haven is going to
0:24:00 be put under a great deal of duress
0:24:03 and one of the deadliest forces this
0:24:07 about is ever mustered is coming to it
0:24:10 but we know it's coming
0:24:12 who we can prepare for it the night can
0:24:14 be won
0:24:16 make sure my child is ready to win the
0:24:19 night
0:24:20 someone needs to go root out the spies
0:24:23 in New Haven part of preparation
0:24:26 it looks to others
0:24:28 Weathers
0:24:29 we are going to need Roman pen dragon's
0:24:31 Army to Siege New York
0:24:33 convince him
0:24:35 on weathers looks annoyed
0:24:38 at the request but slowly not Neil looks
0:24:42 at weathers and just because might have
0:24:43 am
0:24:45 potential inroad for our conversation
0:24:48 if you
0:24:49 he gives you another nut
0:24:51 get some rest well if I say we will
0:24:54 provide for you
0:24:56 and then give me an hour and we'll be
0:24:59 getting the group of you out of New York
0:25:01 thank you welcome
0:25:07 miles we pick up with you a night later
0:25:10 here in the office putting in work
0:25:13 there's been reports of masquerade
0:25:15 breaches things needing to be cleaned up
0:25:18 as the Sabbat has begun to harass the
0:25:22 domain borders again
0:25:24 and as you are filing some information
0:25:26 away utilizing Upton Rowlands as
0:25:29 resources and contacts to get the job
0:25:31 done there is a knock at the door come
0:25:34 on in Britta pokes her head in and sees
0:25:38 that you're busy
0:25:40 um is now an okay time
0:25:42 yeah I've got things mostly handled for
0:25:45 now I'm pushing things on Wynn and
0:25:47 Johnny that need to be done
0:25:50 um there's a couple things that I wanted
0:25:52 to do and I was wondering if you might
0:25:53 help me or also maybe just want to come
0:25:56 with I could definitely use a break what
0:25:59 are you thinking well the first thing is
0:26:02 that I found I don't know if you know if
0:26:05 they're any good this overnight florist
0:26:08 and underneath her arm she's got the big
0:26:11 thick phone book her pointer finger
0:26:13 tabbing a particular page and she shows
0:26:16 you the advertisement I mean anything
0:26:19 you'll find in the phone book may be
0:26:20 adequate what are you trying to do
0:26:22 I no it's not like
0:26:25 enough
0:26:27 but
0:26:29 um it doesn't feel right to me to
0:26:33 just kind of not acknowledge what
0:26:34 happened to Elsa Linden and I did I was
0:26:38 thinking about it and I just wanted to I
0:26:41 thought you might want to come with me
0:26:42 to pay respects I thought about going to
0:26:45 where the Toreador gather and maybe
0:26:48 leaving some flowers at her piano we can
0:26:51 do that he picks up a card writes a
0:26:54 number you're going to want to ask for
0:26:55 Richard it's where I got the flowers
0:26:57 from before so well
0:27:00 um there's kind of another number I
0:27:02 would need soon the one you were asking
0:27:05 about before yeah I think the sooner I
0:27:08 try to apologize to Prince pen drug in
0:27:11 the batter
0:27:14 I mean
0:27:15 I don't think there's anything you're
0:27:16 going to be able to do with a coffee pot
0:27:18 against him
0:27:21 no of course not but I
0:27:24 I
0:27:25 I've been thinking about it right the
0:27:27 advice that I gave you when you were
0:27:29 trying to make things right with Elsa
0:27:32 and I don't feels like
0:27:36 confident for this
0:27:38 so I don't think that a gift would
0:27:42 really do it
0:27:43 um
0:27:44 and I think that may be the best thing
0:27:46 to do would just be to
0:27:48 show that I'm not running away
0:27:50 because us running away at Boston was a
0:27:54 huge deal
0:27:55 I can see that
0:27:56 why don't you call Richard
0:27:58 I mean we can get that flower order in
0:28:00 there so to be ready to pick up and then
0:28:01 you can make your phone call to pen
0:28:03 Dragon after you give me a bit more
0:28:05 about some of the situation that went on
0:28:08 there okay
0:28:12 says what do you want for yours if you
0:28:15 if you wanted to do a bouquet too
0:28:18 yes give me uh a white bouquet uh
0:28:21 Lillian roses
0:28:22 all right sounds good
0:28:24 and Britta leaves the room to let you
0:28:28 have well do you have multiple phones
0:28:30 this phone's all over this place I have
0:28:32 phones there's multiple lines on the
0:28:35 phones Britta goes to the nearest phone
0:28:37 that you're not using fair enough
0:28:39 cheap calls and orders the two bookcase
0:28:43 um she gives a pretty high budget but
0:28:47 doesn't indicate what they're for and
0:28:49 asks that they be ready as soon as
0:28:52 possible they seem to indicate that it's
0:28:54 not going to take them more than an hour
0:28:56 or two to have everything ready to go
0:28:58 and once she's kind of put those orders
0:29:01 in for the bouquets making sure that you
0:29:04 know she set it up that they come in a
0:29:07 nice face each Britta comes back over to
0:29:09 Miles by the time you come back around
0:29:11 miles it's from come around the other
0:29:13 side of the desk and it's like leaning
0:29:14 on it waiting for you to come back they
0:29:16 said it should be at most an hour I
0:29:18 think that sounds about right they're
0:29:20 very good
0:29:23 so before I give you pen Dragon's number
0:29:26 I felt like a lot of things were left
0:29:28 unsaid about the whole deal and enough
0:29:30 that I'm wondering
0:29:33 is is the apology just to keep us safe
0:29:36 Britta looks down
0:29:39 you see her gay is kind of slipped to
0:29:42 the door
0:29:44 and she goes to sit closer to you
0:29:46 there's a couple chairs right in front
0:29:48 of the desk there she seems
0:29:50 self-conscious of the door maybe like
0:29:53 she's not sure if she wants to say this
0:29:56 and be overheard
0:29:58 well I don't know where everybody else
0:30:00 is but Johnny and winter both out okay
0:30:03 um
0:30:05 I don't really know where to start um I
0:30:09 thought I was suing
0:30:11 I thought I was making progress that we
0:30:14 were gonna have a better
0:30:17 relationship with him
0:30:19 and I think I really [ __ ] it up and
0:30:23 that's
0:30:26 um
0:30:28 look at those couple days were a big
0:30:31 Whirlwind and it's kind of hard to
0:30:33 settle everything out after but
0:30:36 I guess I'm kind of
0:30:38 inbretta's fiddling with her hands and
0:30:41 her lap and she's
0:30:44 speaking quietly not quite looking at
0:30:46 you peeking at you checking like that's
0:30:50 her usual nervousness and cageness is
0:30:54 Amplified in this moment and it could be
0:30:57 what's happened to her it could be the
0:30:59 scenario she's really having trouble
0:31:01 figuring out a starting point for what
0:31:03 she's saying well you know it's just me
0:31:06 here so you don't have to I don't know
0:31:08 beat around the bush too much here but
0:31:10 also once you essentially mind
0:31:12 controlled
0:31:13 I didn't choose to leave the tomahira
0:31:17 came in and
0:31:19 activated me
0:31:22 but um
0:31:23 things had kind of gotten
0:31:26 awkward before that and
0:31:29 I don't know if he was already mad at me
0:31:32 before I tried to hit him with a coffee
0:31:34 maker
0:31:37 um
0:31:37 he smiles a little bit at that still
0:31:43 the picture of him getting hit with a
0:31:45 coffee maker is using I didn't succeed I
0:31:47 mean the attempt is still I'm humorous
0:31:49 to some degree I understand the
0:31:50 situation wasn't but I'm sorry
0:31:55 I
0:31:56 I get that he's
0:31:58 he's not
0:32:00 a good person but
0:32:03 he really did stand by his word I know
0:32:08 I'm saying it carefully because I think
0:32:10 that the Coterie is gonna jump at any
0:32:12 chance for conflict and I'm worried that
0:32:15 they're gonna do that because
0:32:17 I don't think we win that fight and
0:32:20 sorry I mean part of it is it's it's the
0:32:23 kidnapping that you know wrangles us a
0:32:26 little and I get that
0:32:29 um
0:32:29 but I I'm not saying it's okay or
0:32:33 anything I'm just saying that the choice
0:32:35 was kidnap or kill or a whole range of
0:32:38 options and they everything that I go
0:32:41 through seems to indicate that that was
0:32:44 on the lighter end of what Kindred
0:32:46 choose to do you're not incorrect
0:32:51 I don't really see waste out of
0:32:55 What's Happening Here Without working
0:32:57 with him and
0:33:00 and
0:33:02 um
0:33:03 I guess I ended up kind of confused
0:33:06 about
0:33:08 about
0:33:10 Britta racks her mind for how to keep
0:33:12 going and finally looks more up at miles
0:33:18 I want to call to apologize to make sure
0:33:21 that we're safe
0:33:24 um
0:33:26 but I
0:33:29 that's that really is the motive of
0:33:32 calling
0:33:33 I'm just also
0:33:37 I guess a little confused on my
0:33:40 feelings
0:33:42 all right
0:33:43 I mean how were things while you were
0:33:45 there at his place
0:33:47 did he treat you well
0:33:50 I don't really know how to answer the
0:33:52 question when I was kind of a lot of
0:33:56 there are a lot of bad things right like
0:33:59 obviously being kidnapped is not great
0:34:01 and then no bread like loses her steel
0:34:05 to look at you
0:34:07 there were threats and there were
0:34:10 moments where it felt like he was
0:34:13 trying to teach me and I
0:34:18 he protected me but also he would put me
0:34:21 in danger I don't
0:34:23 really know which one to go with in this
0:34:25 conversation
0:34:27 and I feel like an idiot talking to you
0:34:29 about it and I'm sorry I'm not trying to
0:34:32 all right all right
0:34:35 you're not an idiot
0:34:36 this whole thing is very complex and we
0:34:39 do not need Pendragon as an enemy
0:34:41 currently
0:34:43 I am on these pages with you
0:34:46 if nothing else we need him as an ally
0:34:49 going forward as it will work against
0:34:51 the Sabbat regardless of his methodology
0:34:55 very archaic planning Style
0:34:57 anyways
0:35:00 so you want to apologize
0:35:03 yeah
0:35:04 are we looking to meet up with him again
0:35:06 I have no idea if he would even that's
0:35:09 not what I asked
0:35:12 um
0:35:13 I don't know
0:35:14 I don't
0:35:16 it's not an objective of the phone call
0:35:18 if that's what you mean I I love you
0:35:22 to be honest I kind of still want to
0:35:24 hide in that closet for a while about
0:35:26 everything so yeah we don't allow to get
0:35:29 a lot of those opportunities
0:35:31 especially now everything seems to be
0:35:34 moving much faster than it ever has
0:35:37 yeah
0:35:39 so our closet days are varying
0:35:42 short sweet to be remembered as we
0:35:46 forward your head
0:35:48 do you have closets I'm using
0:35:52 um
0:35:53 metaphor you would understand pretty
0:35:55 actually looks quietly disappointed
0:35:57 so no I I'm not um
0:36:01 I already film
0:36:03 confused enough I'm not really trying to
0:36:06 get more confused
0:36:10 what
0:36:12 I don't really know how to explain it
0:36:13 better than that I I don't
0:36:16 I'm not looking to push things forward
0:36:19 avoiding
0:36:23 um I think if
0:36:26 I acted like I wanted to meet up again
0:36:29 it would have some connotations
0:36:32 and I
0:36:34 don't even really know
0:36:37 how any of that works and
0:36:41 um it may or may not have connotations
0:36:43 but that's not what I was asking I was
0:36:45 asking what you wanted I don't I I don't
0:36:52 okay what does it mean if someone's
0:36:54 fangs come out
0:36:56 usually it's an emotional response if it
0:36:58 isn't on purpose like if you're
0:37:01 I've seen it happen when you're mad or
0:37:04 hungry yeah strong emotions can bring
0:37:07 out the fangs dependingly any strong
0:37:10 emotion
0:37:13 I don't know I haven't done extensive
0:37:15 testing
0:37:17 um I'm also not always aware of what my
0:37:19 own fangs are doing
0:37:23 laughs
0:37:28 brother's eyes kind of go a little wide
0:37:30 and she looks anywhere but miles
0:37:35 he semi-races an eyebrow at that but um
0:37:39 look when you were
0:37:42 taken
0:37:43 yeah
0:37:44 and he wanted to talk
0:37:47 I very much felt like it put a lot more
0:37:51 power
0:37:52 in your hands and
0:37:55 I don't know if you realize that yeah
0:37:57 okay um I think to some extent yes
0:38:02 sure he's a old powerful Brujah with tons
0:38:06 of potents and everything else just
0:38:08 throwing his strength around Britta
0:38:11 covers her face
0:38:14 but
0:38:16 it seems like things were going well
0:38:18 overall for you enough to the point that
0:38:20 he didn't kill Neil at the side of him
0:38:24 that seems to Rally Britta yeah
0:38:27 um
0:38:29 I kind of figured that if I
0:38:32 showed him that I wasn't going to listen
0:38:36 to Neil or pay attention
0:38:40 that he wouldn't hurt him
0:38:44 because he wouldn't seem to matter
0:38:48 but there are other ways of meeting up
0:38:50 in more public ways if you wish to
0:38:53 further cement this Alliance of sorts
0:38:56 inviting him to come down for one of our
0:38:59 court days
0:39:01 yeah I mean I if the phone call were to
0:39:04 go well I guess I could try and
0:39:09 um
0:39:10 I mean he would already be going to The
0:39:13 Wraith probably or I guess you'd want
0:39:15 him to be because otherwise that's most
0:39:18 the Brujah ever in the area right I
0:39:22 imagine he would get an invite to this
0:39:24 rave
0:39:25 part of that is from what Johnny's
0:39:27 talking about trying to solidify the
0:39:30 Brujah in
0:39:32 some way
0:39:35 [Music]
0:39:36 um
0:39:38 Johnny's trying to solidify the bra in
0:39:40 the area
0:39:42 so I imagine Hugh all will receive an
0:39:43 invite but this would be
0:39:45 slightly more personal I mean that
0:39:47 didn't seem like the kind of thing that
0:39:49 I could invite him to yes that's why I
0:39:53 said you invite him to a thing
0:39:55 okay that would put you know in this
0:39:58 territory instead of him showing up out
0:40:00 of nowhere and summoning you and
0:40:02 stealing you in a car
0:40:04 do we have a thing coming up yeah we
0:40:06 have court days I'm pretty regular
0:40:08 um
0:40:10 okay
0:40:11 um I don't think that's I think if he is
0:40:14 planning on doing that he's gonna do
0:40:16 that that's not the point
0:40:18 I okay from what we knew about Rowlands's
0:40:23 Court
0:40:24 did I don't think he ever officially had
0:40:28 Hospitality that wasn't I mean I'm sure
0:40:30 he had Hospitality but it's not like he
0:40:33 was asking for it yes I I understand
0:40:35 that this isn't about court
0:40:36 complications with role in them
0:40:39 I'm just saying I don't know what you're
0:40:40 trying to prevent I'm not trying to
0:40:42 prevent
0:40:43 I'm trying to give you an idea to meet
0:40:46 up with him in a area that isn't being
0:40:48 you know kidnapped or driven away to
0:40:51 Harker if he wants to me in real life
0:40:53 I'll suggest our core sure sounds great
0:40:57 for the world we're in
0:41:00 is
0:41:02 weird in many ways and things happen
0:41:05 beyond our understanding or
0:41:07 just
0:41:09 what we would consider normal
0:41:11 everything is
0:41:13 terrible all the time and I feel like
0:41:16 I'm losing scope on what's supposed to
0:41:18 compare to what I don't feel like
0:41:21 everything's terrible all the time but
0:41:24 there are things that are bad that are
0:41:26 happening and we are doing our best to
0:41:28 stop them I don't know miles I feel like
0:41:30 I was doing a better job holding
0:41:32 everything together but ever since ever
0:41:36 since the dragon I just I don't feel
0:41:39 like I I'm doing a good job at that
0:41:41 anymore
0:41:42 like I can't I can't make myself act
0:41:44 like this is normal what the dragon was
0:41:47 and what it did is beyond the kind of my
0:41:51 understanding but
0:41:53 we
0:41:54 need to keep moving we need to keep
0:41:57 going forward otherwise we don't ever
0:42:00 leave
0:42:02 the Dragon
0:42:04 yeah I I guess I just I still feel it
0:42:08 that'll be there
0:42:10 like many things it's presence is still
0:42:13 there and
0:42:14 doesn't go away
0:42:16 do you think it ever will or do you
0:42:19 think it'll feel like this like like
0:42:21 there's too much of me that's been taken
0:42:24 the edges will soften
0:42:26 it'll still be there there'll be times
0:42:28 when you're randomly doing things and
0:42:31 the memories will come back
0:42:33 part of the curse of us being you know
0:42:36 never really aging
0:42:39 a couple times and tries to pull herself
0:42:42 back into better posture but that's why
0:42:47 we take the things that we do enjoy and
0:42:50 enjoy them while we can
0:42:52 do you want to walk to get the flowers
0:42:54 or oh no oh no no no we'll have a ghoul
0:42:59 drive us if nothing else why well this
0:43:02 Sabbat are attacking various points in
0:43:04 the city currently I thought you liked
0:43:06 this drive I do like driving I just
0:43:08 figured I didn't know if you wanted to
0:43:09 talk but if you want to take out one of
0:43:11 the fast cars I'm all foreign
0:43:15 um I I don't know I guess sure let's do
0:43:18 it
0:43:20 you can make a phone call after we drop
0:43:22 the flowers off Britta's face kind of
0:43:24 Falls it kind of seems like she was
0:43:25 edging away from having to do that but
0:43:28 she knots and we get to the storm purple
0:43:31 Lamborghini
0:43:32 [Laughter]
0:43:35 sure it may be the death of me someday
0:43:37 but I'll enjoy it until then
0:43:40 hey you have your cell phone right yes
0:43:42 okay I don't I'm sorry I'm gonna have to
0:43:45 ask you for a new one I third closet Lex
0:43:48 when is the last time that Britta
0:43:50 remembers having a cell phone because
0:43:53 the last time that it was on screen was
0:43:56 in the limousine was it collected along
0:43:59 with the weapons then or was it
0:44:01 collected from our hotel room because
0:44:04 that certainly she has not had enough
0:44:06 Pockets consistently enough to have that
0:44:08 cell phone I don't know that the dress
0:44:10 you attended in did not have pockets and
0:44:15 it did not have a cell phone with you
0:44:19 um I think my phone's so with the rest
0:44:21 of my well it's probably with the rest
0:44:24 of my stuff let me get you a new one
0:44:26 there's a couple down the closet we just
0:44:28 have to activate it
0:44:29 I'll call up the phone company
0:44:31 okay but really I'll have somebody do
0:44:33 that and uh we'll grab a phone I'll send
0:44:37 a quick message to one of the ghouls to
0:44:39 get it activated for and we will head
0:44:41 off to Richards to pick up the flowers
0:44:44 Britta gets into the passenger see there
0:44:47 is that sort of it's not automatic
0:44:49 anymore it's that unconscious check if
0:44:52 there's a pistol underneath the seat yep
0:44:55 that seems to make her feel a little
0:44:56 safer as they go off to get their
0:44:58 flowers
0:44:59 picking up the flowers happens without
0:45:01 any issues they're there waiting for you
0:45:03 beautifully arranged and ready to go
0:45:06 Britta thanks the shopkeeper makes
0:45:09 she probably starts getting ready to pay
0:45:11 I don't think Miles alone is that right
0:45:13 yeah
0:45:15 he steps all the way and lets miles to
0:45:16 do his thing I mean there's no trends
0:45:18 for money right now that's good yeah
0:45:22 so then she probably like Pats herself
0:45:25 down for no no not 90 miles ways off
0:45:29 it's not necessary don't worry they get
0:45:30 paid she nods
0:45:32 um and kind of gives like uh you know
0:45:34 parting smile to the shopkeeper before
0:45:37 heading back towards the car to head
0:45:39 back to where the Toyota Salon is held
0:45:42 miles definitely makes introductions to
0:45:44 Mr flowers barely fit into the lambo
0:45:48 you know what Bruto and we'll have them
0:45:50 on her lap so that you know it's
0:45:52 obviously crowded right but she can keep
0:45:54 careful hold of them and she's small
0:45:56 herself so there's some more room
0:45:58 flowers are now part of the
0:45:59 consideration
0:46:00 [Laughter]
0:46:03 she's gonna be very careful with them
0:46:05 they're gonna be
0:46:06 she'll protect them but yeah he
0:46:08 definitely introduces you to those
0:46:09 people so that you are now aware of them
0:46:11 and they know each other and so and uh
0:46:14 he will take brittle to the salon
0:46:21 so when is probably sitting out she's
0:46:24 probably walked a fair bit into the
0:46:26 woods because miles place is nice it
0:46:29 feels very much like home but sometimes
0:46:31 there are there are thoughts you don't
0:46:33 want to think in the safe places and the
0:46:36 birds with the human demeanors have her
0:46:39 concerned but she also
0:46:42 has messages to send so she's still not
0:46:46 wearing shoes she's sitting out at the
0:46:49 base of a tree just kind of legs bent in
0:46:52 front of her kind of playing with the
0:46:53 dirt in the sediment on the floor of the
0:46:56 woods looking at her phone to see if any
0:46:59 anyone has gotten back to her of the
0:47:01 messages she sent either to Kabir or to
0:47:04 Ramirez
0:47:06 and if that's a blank it's a blank she
0:47:08 tries not to think about it so much
0:47:11 more and more she's starting the Monday
0:47:13 Morning Quarterback if there are things
0:47:15 she should have done differently at any
0:47:17 step
0:47:18 mostly so that she knows she could do
0:47:20 better in the future but as she's
0:47:22 sitting
0:47:23 she sticks her phone back in her pocket
0:47:26 just kind of leans on one hip to slide
0:47:28 it in her back pocket and she starts
0:47:31 looking for what Critters are in the
0:47:33 woods because there's a message she
0:47:35 needs to send she has been thinking a
0:47:38 lot about how helpful it would be if she
0:47:41 wasn't the only Gangrel in the city
0:47:43 if someone somewhere along the line had
0:47:47 listened to Xavier's warnings and maybe
0:47:51 he's the guy who can help save New Haven
0:47:53 and maybe bring some Gangrel back to the
0:47:56 area and it's a long shot because
0:47:57 they've never met but what if we got
0:48:00 left but long shots
0:48:02 so when looks around
0:48:04 she's looking for
0:48:06 a bird a bat something that can cover
0:48:08 ground and will not be uncomfortable
0:48:11 traversing the landscape of the United
0:48:14 States or elsewhere you find a mouse
0:48:18 moving about light weary
0:48:21 and without making a sound
0:48:25 something snatches it from the ground
0:48:28 perches up on a branch with a tapless
0:48:31 victim and begins to Rend the mouse with
0:48:35 its beak you see an owl
0:48:37 devouring its meal when waits for the
0:48:40 owl to finish because it's rude to
0:48:42 interrupt people's meals it finishes and
0:48:45 then turns its head way too far so that
0:48:48 it can look at you does this seem to be
0:48:51 just an owl it seems to be an owl okay
0:48:54 she turns her head to look at it with
0:48:57 her with her Eagle to like eyes could I
0:49:00 trouble you for a favor and Ted quickly
0:49:03 tilts to the side fever white fever and
0:49:06 this is still just an owl yep okay I
0:49:09 need someone found and brought to me
0:49:12 found favor what would you want in
0:49:14 exchange for bringing a message tilt its
0:49:17 head on the other side food
0:49:19 you got it food what favor there's a man
0:49:23 like me Beast inside not really human
0:49:26 anymore he'll be able to understand you
0:49:29 what say his name is Xavier let him know
0:49:32 when of his clan in New Haven believes
0:49:36 him and there are those who will stand
0:49:38 we'll say
0:49:40 thank you food yes
0:49:43 um when will kind of look around for any
0:49:46 kind of like small prey yeah give me a
0:49:48 perception survival
0:49:50 well I had two successes but I also had
0:49:53 two ones so he didn't seem to find
0:49:55 anything she starts to think for a
0:49:57 minute she holds up a finger wait wait I
0:50:00 will come back with food food very soon
0:50:02 and she runs in the house
0:50:04 and she grabs
0:50:07 she grabs a container of eggs
0:50:10 and she grabs like a thing of bacon and
0:50:13 she comes back this message is important
0:50:15 she says to the owl so generous payment
0:50:18 food it heads over and swoops down to
0:50:21 you she opens the container of eggs she
0:50:23 opens she pulls off the plastic from the
0:50:25 bacon the owl Gorge is on fat and me and
0:50:29 Neo don't make yourself too sick to
0:50:31 deliver the message I will give you more
0:50:33 if you come back you kind of have to
0:50:35 make it stop but yeah she kind of like
0:50:37 pops it on the face and pulls it back it
0:50:40 takes off savior Xavier Xavier Xavier he
0:50:44 goes by both and he's off to deliver a
0:50:47 message
0:50:48 and when goes back to sitting against
0:50:51 the tree with the meat and the eggs as
0:50:54 you walk through the woods headed to
0:50:55 somewhere to sit passing the tree you
0:50:58 catch the figure of Raven leaning
0:51:01 against the tree and watching you
0:51:04 wind startles a little bit not so much
0:51:08 that someone is there but more that it's
0:51:10 her well
0:51:12 [ __ ] I didn't anticipate seeing you here
0:51:15 how could you
0:51:17 [Music]
0:51:21 when they get there Britta asks if miles
0:51:23 can get the door yes of course
0:51:26 she does that kind of careful slink out
0:51:28 of the lambo with the flowers and when
0:51:31 she's writed herself made sure they're
0:51:33 so perfect
0:51:35 she hand Smiles his bouquet and leads
0:51:39 the way up to the door let me let you
0:51:41 take the lead since this is more your
0:51:43 territory than his in many ways within
0:51:45 moments the door opens and you are shown
0:51:48 in by some of the ghouls that serve the
0:51:51 toridor and inside you can hear the
0:51:55 sounds of a piano Softly playing soft
0:51:58 laughter it's just a very cozy
0:52:01 experience being had by the local
0:52:04 Toreador how good is that piano pretty
0:52:07 good but miles is actually probably
0:52:09 better am I okay to proceed you are it
0:52:11 then suddenly occurs to miles that no
0:52:13 one has informed the Toyota of the
0:52:15 missing Elsa Britta leading the way is
0:52:19 going to look for familiar faces to see
0:52:22 if there's anyone that she recognizes as
0:52:24 having been present at the gala as she
0:52:26 heads over towards usually Elsa would be
0:52:29 at that piano right yes when you enter
0:52:31 there is one story where you do
0:52:34 recognize who was at the color so if you
0:52:36 however most of the torreador actually
0:52:38 had stayed in New Haven to lend support
0:52:41 to the new Prince but one of them uh
0:52:44 Sophie one of the one of the tour reader
0:52:46 that would always follow Elsa around and
0:52:49 was just kind of a doting minion uh she
0:52:52 is here looking over to try to make eye
0:52:55 contact with her how's she doing uh she
0:52:57 seems uh quiet reserved everyone seems
0:52:59 to be having a very good time she's sort
0:53:02 of sitting just off to the side lounging
0:53:05 and listening to the conversations that
0:53:07 happen
0:53:08 Britta pauses and changes track from the
0:53:12 piano over to our Sofias and approaches
0:53:16 to make a hello
0:53:18 which kind of Waits just to see if she's
0:53:20 acknowledged she acknowledges you and
0:53:23 she waves and smiles so good to see you
0:53:25 it's been a while it's good to see you
0:53:29 too then someone enters Predator turns
0:53:33 look from another room Marcus Vitel and
0:53:36 a handful of toried or sort of start to
0:53:39 enter Marcus notices the two of you oh
0:53:42 hello
0:53:43 Britta sends a smile she does not
0:53:46 recognize this stranger say sincere and
0:53:49 polite smile hello Your Grace Prince
0:53:52 vital oh thank you she dips her head in
0:53:56 respect realizing the prince of
0:53:58 Washington DC
0:54:01 um a bit of a
0:54:03 complicated scenario there for now but
0:54:05 once we beat back the Sabbat uh I'm sure
0:54:11 all of the princes who are visiting will
0:54:13 disperse back to their home domains
0:54:16 strong hands will be necessary to
0:54:19 reaffirm the camarilla
0:54:21 in those areas how true my fellow King
0:54:23 what brings you here tonight to join us
0:54:25 Freda has been going Vettel smells of
0:54:30 agreement as he speaks towards the idea
0:54:33 their light Smiles nothing to come metal
0:54:36 but at that question she lets her eyes
0:54:39 flick over to Miles as if checking I had
0:54:42 become aware of the fact that Elsa may
0:54:45 have suffered her final death at the
0:54:47 attack what attack and the room fills
0:54:51 with gasps including Sophie uh or a
0:54:55 perception sure
0:55:00 does my Speck and villains apply no okay
0:55:03 High instances is up so that is minus
0:55:07 four to difficulty leading to four
0:55:09 difficulty okay
0:55:13 that is seven successes what is your
0:55:17 question I am seeking her emotional
0:55:21 state she's concerned does she seem
0:55:24 surprised yes Berta looks very intently
0:55:29 at Sophie for that long telling moment
0:55:31 and then back to Miles
0:55:34 um yes I had heard that Warwick's domain
0:55:37 in Rhode Island had been attacked by a
0:55:39 large Gathering of Sabbat I feel so
0:55:41 bored that they would attack War that's
0:55:43 Grace I suppose that is
0:55:46 trouble for us in New Haven I was there
0:55:49 along with a few other Toreador and
0:55:52 one of the spot had been attacking Elsa
0:55:56 and with those words Britta addresses out
0:55:59 to the crowd of Toreador allowing her
0:56:02 window to include Vettel but when trying
0:56:05 to raise her voice and speak with
0:56:07 Clarity to the group
0:56:08 some of us
0:56:10 tried to pull Elsa away from
0:56:14 an orb of Shadows but we weren't
0:56:17 successful workers mightel kind of makes
0:56:20 uh gives a look of concern
0:56:23 you were there I was at the gala yes
0:56:26 when the Sabbat started attacking
0:56:28 myself and my friend Neil we were
0:56:31 looking for Elsa to make sure that she
0:56:33 got out safely it was a rumor that I
0:56:36 you're actually in the hands of the
0:56:39 prince of Hartford
0:56:40 um yes I went with him there I see
0:56:44 hey Grace what is our policy regarding
0:56:46 the prince of Heartland currently we are
0:56:49 in discussions for possibly a mutual
0:56:53 Alliance it was ongoing with Rowlands
0:56:56 but
0:56:57 Rowlands wanted to pretend all of this
0:56:59 wasn't happening so
0:57:01 Britta is dedicatedly attending the
0:57:03 conversation at hand and ex pretending
0:57:06 to have not noticed the fact that that
0:57:08 is also an announcement that has been
0:57:10 made in a room full of gossiping
0:57:12 Toreador when your sire was approached
0:57:16 regarding which domain we would be going
0:57:19 to for the time being it was specified
0:57:21 to us that we should go to New Haven
0:57:24 because his grace Prince Roman Pendragon
0:57:28 could not be trusted
0:57:30 and posed a threat to any domain he
0:57:33 attended are you certain this is a man
0:57:35 that you wish to Ally yourself with from
0:57:38 my understanding Pendragon was also at
0:57:41 the attack in Rhode Island
0:57:43 hmm Mr presidents didn't deter it it
0:57:46 doesn't seem so then what is it exactly
0:57:48 that he offers he has
0:57:51 troops
0:57:52 your grace
0:57:54 some of us that made it out from that
0:57:56 attack were working together and his
0:58:00 assistants really helped some of us
0:58:03 survive the spot he just didn't choose
0:58:05 to help Elsa there were a toyed or look
0:58:08 flustered at the thought of Roman
0:58:11 Pendragon just leaving her there to die
0:58:12 he was fighting outside
0:58:16 there were fights in different pockets
0:58:19 of the mansion and the gala and
0:58:22 those that he could rally outside
0:58:25 he did
0:58:26 I had been inside to try to get others
0:58:30 safe and worn if this kind of attack
0:58:33 were to happen the future we would need
0:58:35 to work together to cover a different
0:58:36 ground
0:58:37 his lips thin and he looks to some of
0:58:41 the other story that are in the room
0:58:44 I am concerned that an allying
0:58:48 or the prince of Harford
0:58:50 we are embracing
0:58:52 barbarism cruelty
0:58:55 we would
0:58:57 protect ourselves from the Sabbat by
0:58:59 becoming them and your grace
0:59:02 it is of course
0:59:04 your decision
0:59:06 however
0:59:07 I know
0:59:08 a great many
0:59:11 of your new citizens
0:59:13 no Prince pendragon's reputation and
0:59:16 have turned to you
0:59:18 because you are not a violent brute or a
0:59:23 diablarist
0:59:24 or someone who
0:59:27 scoffs at tradition
0:59:29 what an opportunity for power arises you
0:59:33 are a noble King
0:59:35 that is why they chose you
0:59:37 and your choices
0:59:39 reaffirm the man that they know you to
0:59:42 be
0:59:43 I hear you
0:59:45 if you'll excuse me this this terrible
0:59:48 news has suddenly denied for me
0:59:51 some of the toys are actually look a
0:59:53 little silent saddened that vital is
0:59:56 leaving my condolences for your loss he
0:59:59 says it's a better very sincerely I'm
1:00:02 sorry to give you the news
1:00:04 he then excuses himself
1:00:08 miles watches them go and take stock of
1:00:11 the situation inside the salon
1:00:13 especially in combination with what his
1:00:16 own sire told him when the princess
1:00:18 arrived Britta turns and looks back to
1:00:21 Sophie once more
1:00:23 Sophie seems to have excused herself and
1:00:25 when you look back she's just not there
1:00:28 brightest stars of the spot for a couple
1:00:29 moments before looking around the room
1:00:31 at where she might have gone but I
1:00:33 imagine this is probably a place with a
1:00:35 lot of doors it is and open passages and
1:00:39 staircase going upstairs and so after
1:00:42 taking sock of that and the lack of
1:00:46 likelihood of figuring out which path
1:00:48 she took Britta takes what is likely
1:00:51 still a hush in the room she takes the
1:00:54 moment to then walk over and put her
1:00:57 bouquet on Elsa's piano
1:01:00 setting it so that it's not in the way
1:01:01 of whoever was playing but in a place of
1:01:05 respect
1:01:06 I follow suit
1:01:08 is the room so quiet or have they
1:01:12 fall into Whispers
1:01:14 there are some hushed attempts at small
1:01:18 talk
1:01:19 but with the music having stopped and
1:01:22 the bad news it seems like uh they're
1:01:26 carousing has largely concluded
1:01:30 Britta turns and she looks towards the
1:01:33 assembled to Toreador and kind of using
1:01:37 the fact of knowing their attention to
1:01:40 be on her regardless
1:01:41 she speaks
1:01:43 to the room at large and she says
1:01:46 I wish that I had brought this news
1:01:49 in a better way I'm sorry to tell you
1:01:51 and
1:01:54 I hope that we can
1:01:56 pair respects
1:01:58 one of them approaches and gives you a
1:02:01 hug
1:02:02 I'm sorry I had to see all of that
1:02:05 actually catches bred off guard and she
1:02:08 genuinely falls into the hug and hugs
1:02:10 back
1:02:11 one of them turns to miles of Grace what
1:02:14 do you need us to do
1:02:17 I need you to
1:02:19 continue to keep the Spear of the Court
1:02:21 up
1:02:22 this is the Torito I've always done
1:02:25 and
1:02:27 for to remember also as she always
1:02:30 wanted to be remembered
1:02:32 of course
1:02:34 Your Grace yes
1:02:36 further preparations that we're making
1:02:38 for this city would you include combat
1:02:42 practice
1:02:43 of course
1:02:44 when we were there
1:02:46 that's something that many of the Toyota
1:02:49 didn't have and maybe if we had been a
1:02:53 bit more prepared to fight not just with
1:02:56 our words and with our skill
1:02:59 maybe that can help make a difference
1:03:01 and protect us moving forwards
1:03:04 I will give you all the things you need
1:03:06 to make that happen
1:03:08 including my own expertise if necessary
1:03:11 thank you or maybe you should spearhead
1:03:13 It For The Toreador Britta looks to the
1:03:17 room to assess reaction
1:03:19 I seems some seem a little surprised at
1:03:23 the idea of breto being some sort of
1:03:25 combat veteran
1:03:27 others don't
1:03:29 Britta dips her head
1:03:31 it's
1:03:32 it's awkward isn't the right word but
1:03:34 she's not used to addressing miles as
1:03:37 Prince I think this is the first time in
1:03:39 a public setting so there's a bit of
1:03:41 extra emphasis on the gestures of
1:03:44 respect and formality but she dips her
1:03:47 head to Miles and says
1:03:49 I'd like to help yes
1:03:51 very good
1:03:53 all right then I think that's what we
1:03:56 came for
1:03:57 miles makes a bow to the Toyota
1:03:59 hopefully I'll be able to join you guys
1:04:01 again join you again
1:04:04 sometime soon
1:04:05 a number of the Toyota
1:04:07 men women kind of together like good
1:04:11 night your grace
1:04:13 [Laughter]
1:04:16 I will finish my bow and start heading
1:04:19 for the door but I was like this is my
1:04:21 favorite I love this clan the most put a
1:04:25 heads out after miles
1:04:30 this voice is not Ravens and wind knows
1:04:33 that immediately and I've surprised as
1:04:37 she was to see the form of Raven now her
1:04:41 hackles are up
1:04:42 this is something in the shape of Raven
1:04:44 as best she can tell
1:04:46 when takes a more defensive stance and
1:04:51 eyes narrow
1:04:53 what are you
1:04:58 there are a lot of he's in my life
1:05:01 miles
1:05:03 they didn't answer you
1:05:05 about Sofia when there's some relief in
1:05:09 knowing that this is not an unknown
1:05:12 factor
1:05:13 but not a lot and certainly not enough
1:05:15 to adjust your friend
1:05:19 [ __ ]
1:05:22 yes
1:05:26 yes even when you deserve it
1:05:29 but
1:05:31 I can still wash
1:05:34 right now
1:05:37 this is a very
1:05:39 very
1:05:40 specification
1:05:42 and as zofial speaks
1:05:45 a shiver runs up your spine
1:05:49 because in the Underworld
1:05:51 winds suddenly pick up
1:05:54 and a great Deluge arrives
1:05:59 and in all consuming
1:06:02 storm
1:06:04 begins to sweep in from the East
1:06:07 and you know in your heart
1:06:11 the males from that they were talking
1:06:13 about everything you're warned about has
1:06:18 begun
1:06:20 when
1:06:21 doesn't panic easily
1:06:24 I'm gonna need a courage check at
1:06:26 difficulty nine yep
1:06:28 I have no willpower left then you're
1:06:30 rolling without it being able to spend
1:06:32 willpower okay
1:06:34 no successes it is not for yourself that
1:06:38 the fierce Suite seeps in
1:06:41 but for Joey oh my yes and for all
1:06:45 you've been through
1:06:47 all of the struggles you've endured in
1:06:50 short order
1:06:51 something in you finally snaps
1:06:54 and the hopelessness and the Doom that
1:06:59 this storm represents
1:07:01 sends you into a raw Trek where do I
1:07:03 even begin to run to
1:07:06 [Music]
1:07:10 in the car away from the place a decent
1:07:13 distance away from the place because
1:07:14 you're gonna need to combat that I was
1:07:17 gonna actually say the same to you
1:07:19 Marcus Vitel is
1:07:21 somebody of my sire specifically warned
1:07:23 me against yeah he definitely wants you
1:07:25 to have no allies I mean sure he might
1:07:28 specifically also not like Prince
1:07:30 Pendragon but I think he wants to be my
1:07:33 Ally I think he wants to be Prince yeah
1:07:36 that's you know get close then you know
1:07:38 go from there
1:07:40 what else do you need from me is there
1:07:43 anyone else in Clan Toreador who's ready
1:07:45 to lead well see I'm confused because
1:07:47 Sophie the one that I walked up to she
1:07:50 was at the gala and she was there when
1:07:53 we were trying to pull outside of the
1:07:55 Shadows but when I was kind of staring
1:07:57 at her I was trying to see what she was
1:07:59 feeling and she seemed concerned
1:08:02 surprise
1:08:03 dig into it a little bit more see if you
1:08:05 can find anything else
1:08:06 if not
1:08:08 she might be a spy yeah she might not be
1:08:11 Sophie right or some sort of control
1:08:16 when it comes to who else is capable
1:08:17 I'll try and figure that out you do know
1:08:20 that if you don't find somebody else
1:08:22 soon enough to lead this clan I'm going
1:08:24 to suggest that you do
1:08:29 no no
1:08:31 that wasn't a suggestion
1:08:33 but they're not they're not gonna want
1:08:36 that um especially when you start
1:08:38 showing them how deadly you are I think
1:08:40 they won't object too much especially
1:08:42 being in my favor I I don't with all the
1:08:44 rumors about me already and what
1:08:47 tutorial rise above them make them your
1:08:49 own I mean sure that's one way to look
1:08:52 at it but it's not that easy I mean
1:08:55 there's rumors about me being an
1:08:57 infiltrator and there's rumors now about
1:09:00 what Prince fight well he's not really a
1:09:03 prince is he um it was there to be nice
1:09:05 but no he's not what Mr vitel said and
1:09:10 um I don't I don't think they're
1:09:12 yeah I don't I don't think they're gonna
1:09:13 agree to that Miles great somebody needs
1:09:16 to present themselves I'm gonna guess
1:09:18 that not a lot of them were going to
1:09:20 isn't that gonna look weird if most of
1:09:22 the permission council is your Coterie
1:09:26 uh if we had a lot more time and space
1:09:29 for all sorts of things it would be even
1:09:31 weirder but uh right now on war footings
1:09:35 I imagine it's pretty normal I'm barely
1:09:39 in the camarilla miles I don't I have
1:09:41 acknowledged acknowledgment by
1:09:43 but yeah how many of them are father
1:09:44 Dragon I don't think that's usually a
1:09:46 requirement for permission it's not but
1:09:48 it does it's a bonus they don't even
1:09:50 know about the dragon okay it was news
1:09:52 to them apparently about Elsa well I'm
1:09:54 getting pins made up so bread I can't
1:09:56 tell if that's a joke and is looking for
1:09:59 no miles not confirming nor denying it's
1:10:01 a joke or not
1:10:04 I'm driving really fast
1:10:06 yeah is that your subterfuge what are
1:10:09 you trying to do it here oh roll empathy
1:10:12 oh PVP yeah
1:10:14 that's eight successes okay miles what
1:10:17 did you get two miles were you joking
1:10:19 no I'm getting tomato
1:10:23 looks dramatically on Shore for a second
1:10:25 but it seems actually able to find her
1:10:29 balance in the situation from some hint
1:10:31 that you weren't sure you were giving
1:10:33 off
1:10:34 okay
1:10:35 um
1:10:36 how are we going to explain that the
1:10:40 dragon thing I don't know you don't have
1:10:41 to wear the pins okay the commemorative
1:10:44 all right I think I have to apply to get
1:10:46 mine from the vent room like a like a
1:10:48 letter
1:10:50 yeah something like that it's a a white
1:10:53 cross for the bedroom does that add on
1:10:55 to the whole Lecter stuff it's just more
1:11:00 Prestige for The Ventrue does that mean
1:11:02 we would have Ventrue Prestige that's
1:11:05 why yours is a commemorative
1:11:07 oh all right we'll get back to the place
1:11:09 and you can make your call to Pendragon
