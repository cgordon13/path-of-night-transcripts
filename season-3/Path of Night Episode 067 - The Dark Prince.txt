0:00:31 [Music]
0:00:40 last time on path of night
0:00:43 when in British secured the Fetters of
0:00:45 their wraith friends in preparation for
0:00:47 the coming storm
0:00:48 despite Joey's Dark Side taking control
0:00:53 the group picked up mysterious allies at
0:00:55 the airport Amaya weathers Kabir and
0:00:58 Neil
0:01:00 together at last the quotery started to
0:01:03 catch up
0:01:04 thank you
0:01:06 [Music]
0:01:26 we pick up with a group of you making
0:01:28 away from the airport
0:01:30 all piled up into a vehicle Johnny
0:01:33 believe you're at the wheel
0:01:35 and they're now headed to the Royale
0:01:37 at first there's a bit of a long quiet
0:01:39 at first there's a long quiet that rests
0:01:42 between the group of you
0:01:43 Neil
0:01:45 it becomes increasingly difficult to
0:01:48 carry
0:01:50 the burden of the information you carry
0:01:53 without speaking on it
0:01:56 um
0:01:57 guys are we um
0:02:00 going to the Royale how important is
0:02:04 um codery meeting code remaining it's
0:02:07 been a long time I mean I know it's only
0:02:09 been like a week or two but all
0:02:11 cut just kneel if you were kind of if
0:02:13 you're itching to talk you can feel free
0:02:15 to talk no no no no no I I think um
0:02:19 uh there I mean obviously there's things
0:02:21 to to talk about with our our friends
0:02:23 and allies here actually friends and
0:02:25 allies is kind of one of the important
0:02:27 things but it's been a long
0:02:29 week in New York I'm sure they want to
0:02:32 go and and you know rest and you know
0:02:35 check on their own Havens and Johnny
0:02:37 looks up into the rear view and catches
0:02:39 eyes of weathers
0:02:41 has he been like this the whole time he
0:02:43 was with you
0:02:44 yeah but
0:02:46 and wrong about there being a lot to
0:02:48 talk about
0:02:50 well I get that he just blazed the beat
0:02:51 around the bush for a while all right
0:02:53 I'm trying really hard not to wind pipes
0:02:56 up with Kabir probably in her lap and
0:02:58 like nuzzling into her neck
0:03:00 so say what you can
0:03:02 while we've got the time now
0:03:04 um
0:03:06 has to do with the security of of New
0:03:09 Haven and and the spot coming and people
0:03:13 who happen to know certain things about
0:03:15 members of the cotery and so so say
0:03:18 public I just did all right all right
0:03:21 well calm down I'll get to the Royale
0:03:23 and we can have a little meeting
0:03:25 I suppose uh weather is you and amayak
0:03:29 and you probably have some things you
0:03:30 want to talk about yeah we've got things
0:03:32 to talk about so don't worry about it I
0:03:34 could be here I'm sure you can find some
0:03:36 mischief to get into that won't bring
0:03:38 the house down will you Kabir gives you
0:03:41 this look like bro right now but like
0:03:45 slowly nods like of course anything for
0:03:47 you Johnny
0:03:49 perfect
0:03:51 is that uh does that come your uh your
0:03:53 nerves a little bit Neil Neil does not
0:03:56 answer verbally because he is like
0:03:59 holding his own jaw to like keep his
0:04:01 [ __ ] mouth shut take that as a yes we
0:04:04 could just fill him in a little bit of
0:04:05 what's going on around here on the way
0:04:06 the rest of the way here so
0:04:09 he's uh been missing for all the fun
0:04:11 things that we've had to deal with yeah
0:04:13 it's better
0:04:14 fun what fun
0:04:16 no fun like decidedly
0:04:19 so we can fill him in until we get to
0:04:21 the Royale about the things going on
0:04:23 with like the Chantry and
0:04:25 I don't know the Aston mites being here
0:04:27 what's the the
0:04:28 there in town what's going who's this is
0:04:31 the part where we're glazing in for the
0:04:32 part miles is tactic 100 works and Neil
0:04:36 is now more full of questions for other
0:04:38 people right and starts just really
0:04:40 grilling down and like trying to listen
0:04:43 to as they're driving
0:04:45 uh as you listen to Miles vaguely
0:04:48 explain what's happened the group of you
0:04:50 arrives to the Royale
0:04:56 as if they'd been caught in some sort of
0:04:59 like
0:05:00 trapped to Bear witness to an awkward
0:05:02 conversation
0:05:04 your guests depart from the vehicle
0:05:06 rather quickly all of them heading into
0:05:08 the club when will kind of like grab
0:05:11 kabir's hand and say I want to talk to
0:05:12 you about some stuff later he gives one
0:05:14 a kiss nods and then Slips Away off to
0:05:18 whatever no good he's going to be doing
0:05:20 at the club all right y'all scoot inside
0:05:22 I'll find a safe spot for the uh the
0:05:25 vehicle and I'll meet you in there in
0:05:26 just a couple minutes got it okay but
0:05:29 miles is there like a like a quiet spot
0:05:32 like a like a spot where guys like me
0:05:33 can't overhear us talking there are a
0:05:35 number of different areas I don't try to
0:05:37 utilize the same one all the time just
0:05:39 because it gets predictable yeah smart
0:05:41 smart there's a couple rooms in the back
0:05:43 that we can use this is why we need an
0:05:45 air horn guys Bretta heightens her
0:05:47 vision specifically at that trying to
0:05:49 see if there's anyone that the codery
0:05:51 well that she specifically would
0:05:54 recognize as someone trying to listen in
0:05:56 as they're finding their spot as you
0:05:58 look around you keep an eye out so far
0:06:00 nothing Neil will do something similar
0:06:03 but full paranoid mulcavian crazy and
0:06:07 Will Open the Eyes of chaos when he
0:06:09 walks into the club which can be a
0:06:11 little overwhelming just to see where
0:06:13 might be safe whether or not there are
0:06:16 like designs on following us just he
0:06:19 opens himself up to the chaos of the
0:06:21 universe to try and see like I really
0:06:24 need to talk about this but I really
0:06:25 need not to be overheard there's an area
0:06:27 over by one of the speakers that's got
0:06:30 like a little static it's a little kind
0:06:32 of messed up from being constantly at a
0:06:34 maximum volume and there there you feel
0:06:38 like if someone was to try to listen in
0:06:40 with heightened senses they'd be in for
0:06:42 a world of hurt and that pain as a
0:06:45 source of safety uh oh great uh here um
0:06:50 get us some chairs and uh Neil starts
0:06:53 walking directly towards the speakers by
0:06:55 the sound setup wind stays like right
0:06:57 with him because he's not disappearing
0:06:59 again he seems deeply hyper focused
0:07:02 right now like until he gets whatever he
0:07:04 has on his chest out he's not going to
0:07:07 be able to really do anything else sure
0:07:09 I get some money to some people and get
0:07:12 us some space over by the speakers the
0:07:15 worst place to talk to
0:07:18 uh
0:07:20 slightly behind right so like we still
0:07:22 talk ish it's so it's it's from people
0:07:27 who are like 10 15 feet away they're not
0:07:29 gonna be over here [ __ ] but if you guys
0:07:31 yell in each other's ears while talking
0:07:33 or like move maybe behind the speaker
0:07:35 that kind of deal you're gonna be better
0:07:37 off I assume behind the speaker would be
0:07:38 yeah all right that's that's slightly
0:07:41 better yeah the goal is not to have a
0:07:42 comfortable conversation the goal is to
0:07:44 make so you can't be spied on because
0:07:45 otherwise I'm just going to respond to
0:07:47 everything for this next scene but going
0:07:49 what
0:07:53 so once the group is gathered up and
0:07:55 Neil kind of like pushes people into
0:07:57 like the right little so we're kind of
0:08:00 like group huddle yeah we're this is not
0:08:02 a comfortable no management yeah great I
0:08:04 love it he just shouts uh apologetically
0:08:08 but shout it's like we don't have to
0:08:10 stay here the whole time I just we need
0:08:13 to not be heard for this next part and
0:08:16 this is the best spot in the house where
0:08:18 no one can hear us even me after a few
0:08:20 minutes Johnny shows up as well he comes
0:08:23 over and looks at you quizzically about
0:08:25 the [ __ ] horrible spot you've picked
0:08:27 out but it seems to just kind of accept
0:08:29 it
0:08:30 weak into I was telling them we can talk
0:08:34 he just he gives you a glare and drags
0:08:37 on us morally this is like the worst
0:08:38 Anonymous meeting miles
0:08:42 someone in the city is selling
0:08:45 information to the Sabbat about what you
0:08:48 did are we actually gonna do this for
0:08:49 the whole scene
0:08:51 when you guys get sick of it I think I
0:08:54 think Neil can do that I'm gonna be like
0:08:57 dude you need to calm the [ __ ] down I
0:08:58 can hear you
0:09:00 oh
0:09:01 okay because I was like I'm not you know
0:09:03 you don't have to do the whole time
0:09:05 I'll be at the bar when you're done
0:09:07 whatever you're doing
0:09:08 you can't go to the bar this involves
0:09:12 you
0:09:13 [Music]
0:09:15 Neil just talk normal you can hear me
0:09:17 you can hear me if I talk like this it's
0:09:19 loud but yeah okay well no one else over
0:09:21 there can hear us that's why we're here
0:09:23 miles that's that's me
0:09:26 when I was in New York I was spying on
0:09:28 the Sabbat that's good yeah it was news
0:09:30 to me uh I
0:09:33 while I was down there members of The
0:09:35 Killing Spree Carmen uh and your sire
0:09:38 Johnny they were there too they were
0:09:40 rallying a list of packs a huge list of
0:09:43 Sabbat to come assault New Haven they're
0:09:46 all coming here Johnny exchanges a look
0:09:49 with miles
0:09:51 your sire told me himself that the goal
0:09:54 of New Haven is for everyone here to be
0:09:57 a bulwark
0:09:58 for a meat grinder to stay here and die
0:10:01 against the Sabbat but we have to so
0:10:04 they can take other places
0:10:06 they're trying to get pen Dragon to like
0:10:09 get his army to go down into salt New
0:10:11 York while we are taking the brunt like
0:10:13 they're the hammer and we're the Anvil
0:10:14 so specifically he needs all the princes
0:10:17 and stuff to stay here to die
0:10:20 um and we need somebody to go and get
0:10:23 Pendragon to send his army down to New
0:10:25 York like that's your sire's plan we're
0:10:28 not holding New Haven that's the point
0:10:30 the problem is the next metaphor though
0:10:33 isn't it there's so I don't know I don't
0:10:34 know that we're not really an anvil if
0:10:36 they're striking New York no like a
0:10:38 shield and they're more of a sword okay
0:10:40 I don't know more stuff but yeah that
0:10:42 makes sense not even worse than this is
0:10:44 our hammer and Anvil less relevant the
0:10:46 problem is when I was down there I was
0:10:48 spying on Carmen and Carmen was talking
0:10:51 to someone who was in a like riding a
0:10:56 ghoul they were possessing a ghoul but
0:10:57 they were old enough where I couldn't
0:10:59 tell who it was
0:11:01 I I got a block and I don't get blocks
0:11:03 unless it's some sort of an elder uh I
0:11:06 Raja they were selling the information
0:11:09 to Carmen that they knew and had proof
0:11:11 that the new Prince of of the city you
0:11:14 were diablarist that you had diablerized
0:11:17 Upton rolands what I haven't looked yet
0:11:20 because I wanted to talk to you first
0:11:22 that's why I didn't want anyone else
0:11:24 here but if I can see it I actually will
0:11:26 look at this point
0:11:28 uh seven successes Neil are you using
0:11:31 heightened senses with this for Sight
0:11:33 yes okay spin point of willpower
0:11:35 experience immediate sensory overload
0:11:37 okay uh yeah I will spend the willpower
0:11:40 so I don't go blind okay how many
0:11:43 successes did you get seven with seven
0:11:45 successes you can ask him seven
0:11:48 questions about his emotional state or
0:11:50 creature type Etc however you
0:11:53 immediately see terrible black veins
0:11:59 that wriggle and undulate and move in
0:12:03 his Aura the things that I want to know
0:12:06 are when I say this out loud in front of
0:12:08 the cotery what is your immediate like
0:12:11 top two emotions so that'll be like two
0:12:13 questions mostly annoyed
0:12:17 other than that
0:12:19 um just resignation number three and I
0:12:22 don't know if there's a question for Tim
0:12:23 or for Lex I am looking for any residual
0:12:27 touch because as far as Neil knows last
0:12:30 time he left there was a demon in your
0:12:32 head and he does not know anything's
0:12:33 changed about that so I am looking for
0:12:36 like demonic taint in Residence you see
0:12:40 no such thing in Azora okay am I
0:12:42 correcting assuming that Neil knows a
0:12:44 little bit about Diablo Ray considering
0:12:45 who Osiris yeah yeah
0:12:49 um there's two last I have a couple
0:12:51 other questions but there's only two
0:12:52 more that I want to ask uh one is is
0:12:55 there any sense of like guilt or weight
0:12:59 to what miles did in regards to diablary
0:13:02 in his Aura I did pass so yes there is
0:13:06 some guilt to it yes and then two I was
0:13:08 in New Haven for a long time Roland's
0:13:10 had particular little patterns and I
0:13:12 want to see I don't even know if this is
0:13:14 something I can see but Neil's trying to
0:13:16 see if there's any any lingering rolands
0:13:18 impacting miles's like emotions
0:13:22 examining his Aura for any signs of
0:13:25 shards of and intact ruins you do not
0:13:28 see anything okay
0:13:30 I will add as someone who knows a bit
0:13:32 about diablary it would take some time
0:13:34 before that manifested anyway fair
0:13:36 enough
0:13:38 Neil opens his eyes hyper Focus stairs
0:13:41 at miles for a little bit and then you
0:13:44 can see him sort of wrestling with the
0:13:45 information overload in this club uh as
0:13:49 he's like way overdoing it but manages
0:13:51 to push through and then nods
0:13:54 um that sort of would be yes win what
0:13:58 yeah it's all over here
0:14:01 Spirit not miles you you didn't I did
0:14:05 how else do you think we're going to
0:14:06 handle 13 Elder princes coming by not
0:14:11 doing that what does that have to do
0:14:12 with anything how do you think most
0:14:15 princes get there get out get power
0:14:18 through political machinations sometimes
0:14:20 wind vibrates per chair when the answer
0:14:24 is yes and after a minute just stands up
0:14:27 Kicks her chair over and walks out
0:14:29 Beretta takes in a deep breath and looks
0:14:32 just dejected and follows when your your
0:14:35 event true everyone knows your lineage
0:14:37 there's no hiding what you are it's like
0:14:40 your lineage is your whole thing that's
0:14:41 where your power base comes from like
0:14:43 what is what's going to change that by
0:14:45 power comes from Power
0:14:47 and so just having the power how is the
0:14:51 power helped you become Prince
0:14:53 you didn't you became pretty like like
0:14:55 you how many of these other questions
0:14:57 you successfully got him stop
0:15:01 what do you think was going to happen
0:15:03 one of these other princes started
0:15:05 showing up the same thing they've
0:15:06 already one of them's already attempt to
0:15:08 Praxis and how did that go we killed
0:15:11 them yeah and and how did how did
0:15:13 Roland's blood help but they were weaker
0:15:15 ones okay there are stronger ones here
0:15:18 and you have us and you have like we
0:15:21 we've done I agree with Miles you do I
0:15:26 do I was there and helped him do it
0:15:29 Neil was dead silent was just completely
0:15:32 flabbergasted at this
0:15:35 I don't
0:15:36 unders but you want to survive the
0:15:40 coming nights
0:15:41 none of us are going to survive the
0:15:43 coming nights that's not really the
0:15:45 point survival is not the point to
0:15:47 protect is the point yeah that's my
0:15:49 point but protects who from what you
0:15:52 from them
0:15:54 so what you're saying to me miles is
0:15:58 that you think that we should start
0:16:00 diabolarizing no because I I gotta tell
0:16:04 you I just escaped from someone who
0:16:05 tried to get me to do that
0:16:07 like a lot I'm not advocating it for
0:16:10 everyone anyone you're advocating it for
0:16:12 you no I'm not advocating for me I'm
0:16:14 doing it because I had to yep he's
0:16:16 advocating it for the prince of New
0:16:17 Haven but that's to remain strong that's
0:16:19 what I'm saying in the face of a lot of
0:16:22 opposition but that is going to be what
0:16:25 causes the downfall of the no what's
0:16:27 cause we would cause the downfall of New
0:16:29 Haven is if we had an influx of Camry
0:16:31 and princes that all were fighting over
0:16:34 a seat that couldn't be held steady but
0:16:37 that's the point that I'm making is that
0:16:39 the Sabbat know and are using that
0:16:42 information to undermine miles and
0:16:44 continue the game of people fighting
0:16:46 over all this so that they can come in
0:16:48 and kill because there are already
0:16:49 Sabbat not just the Killing Spree in the
0:16:51 city if it wasn't one thing it'd be
0:16:53 another but why take it I don't unders
0:16:58 understand
0:16:59 that's not
0:17:01 possible we've explained it to you I
0:17:04 don't know what else you want and I
0:17:05 think you're wrong miles I do I'm sorry
0:17:08 physically pains me this it would be the
0:17:10 first time frankly I guess second
0:17:11 guessed a lot by a lot of the things
0:17:13 that I do okay not by me by everyone and
0:17:17 I I welcome it I understand that I don't
0:17:21 but these 13 princes I would be enslaved
0:17:24 by one of them if not there's ways
0:17:26 around that
0:17:27 is there where were you
0:17:29 not here and I don't know the answer to
0:17:31 that question is Magic there's all sorts
0:17:34 of things you can do is blood magic any
0:17:36 better than this yes see that's where I
0:17:39 don't know if we're all on the same page
0:17:40 either Johnny you can't see it it is
0:17:43 this man his soul I can see it I can't
0:17:46 see what what blood magic does to your
0:17:48 soul either I can nothing so I gotta
0:17:51 trust you yeah I can teach you or Britta
0:17:55 could teach you to see it if you don't
0:17:56 want to trust me regardless this man's
0:17:58 also the one who corralled a demon which
0:18:00 was also a mistake but he did it which
0:18:02 was a mistake which but what was it was
0:18:05 the fact that he was able to Corral that
0:18:06 a mistake it's not there now where is it
0:18:09 because it's not in miles right now it's
0:18:11 not New Haven what does that mean and
0:18:13 how do you know that it was taking
0:18:15 control of my body during the day
0:18:17 miles your way would have had it free
0:18:19 too the circle wasn't intact when you
0:18:21 were done but it was e so your way was a
0:18:24 mistake also
0:18:25 but the circle was reparable and this is
0:18:28 what I did correct we had time how do
0:18:31 you know how long we how do we know
0:18:33 anything because you research and you
0:18:35 learn and you look at things you know
0:18:37 sometimes you don't have time for that
0:18:39 your way would have been a mistake also
0:18:42 it's happened and it's done and if it
0:18:45 wasn't a mistake then you should have
0:18:46 been here to counsel the prince instead
0:18:48 of going off to some party in Rhode
0:18:49 Island but it was kidnapped
0:18:52 gone she was taken and we made the
0:18:54 decision to let her take care of
0:18:57 as far as I saw she came back with a
0:18:59 codery of tomahira to kick the door
0:19:03 through the Chantry and Pendragon and
0:19:06 that's not like you brought her back
0:19:08 only got out of that party because of me
0:19:10 oh yeah yeah
0:19:13 good work
0:19:14 because I found the way out after the
0:19:16 Sabbat came in huge numbers and burned
0:19:19 everything to the ground you did a great
0:19:21 job there
0:19:23 sounds like we could have used you when
0:19:25 we were Diablo Rising rolands I guess so
0:19:27 because I wouldn't have
0:19:30 miles I love you
0:19:32 because you're you and also because
0:19:34 frankly I'm bound to you so I can't not
0:19:37 but there's an arrogance to some of
0:19:39 these decisions and it is so hard for me
0:19:42 right now to hear you justify it and be
0:19:45 okay with it because justification leads
0:19:47 to more justification and then before
0:19:49 long you're my sire who is around by the
0:19:53 way and grabbed me and staked people and
0:19:55 said he would come and kill me and all
0:19:57 of you if I didn't eat them and I didn't
0:19:59 because I can't anyways
0:20:03 I don't have to be buried by my
0:20:05 decisions
0:20:06 no but I can live with them
0:20:09 I don't have to rethink and redoubt all
0:20:11 of the decisions I make all of the time
0:20:13 but this one was a bad one what do you
0:20:17 want me to do about it I'm gonna do it
0:20:18 again I don't plan on it so look me in
0:20:22 the eye then and tell me that you have
0:20:24 not been tempted to do it again I have
0:20:26 definitely been tempted to do it again
0:20:27 and the more that you do it the more
0:20:30 tempting it becomes yeah
0:20:33 Rhys was unconscious in front of me and
0:20:36 I didn't so why did and I didn't you
0:20:40 didn't this time but why was it even a
0:20:43 Temptation in the first place rather
0:20:44 than just to kill him
0:20:46 I don't know why aren't you tempted all
0:20:48 the time why don't you do it all the
0:20:49 time
0:20:51 to people why it's done
0:20:55 it is done I've never deodorized someone
0:20:58 and I've been tempted I can't it's not
0:21:00 Diablo that tempts you it's the Beast be
0:21:03 okay with this why don't we bring the
0:21:05 other people back at the table so
0:21:06 everyone can discuss it because we might
0:21:08 as well get it done with regardless of
0:21:11 what happens unless you plan on killing
0:21:12 me right now
0:21:14 it has happened
0:21:17 don't I just then we need to figure out
0:21:19 how to move past it I need you to know
0:21:21 that you set the example for all of us
0:21:23 and the example you set is that this is
0:21:25 okay
0:21:26 the example I set is that we've all
0:21:28 taken different means to find ways to
0:21:30 protect people that we care about
0:21:32 and this is one of the weens that I
0:21:34 actually have access to when you cross a
0:21:36 line
0:21:37 it crosses the line for all of us then
0:21:40 you all guys will need to remind me not
0:21:42 to cross it again that's what I'm doing
0:21:44 I understand that but also you're
0:21:47 berating me about decisions that have
0:21:48 been made I understand it and I'm
0:21:50 listening to you but I I'm not gonna go
0:21:53 over it all over again to me it was not
0:21:55 totally honest it's the justifications
0:21:57 it's the I understand that it's done
0:21:58 what's done is done I don't agree with
0:22:00 the justifications I think it's why what
0:22:03 would you do otherwise not to do that
0:22:05 stake him how do you not have
0:22:07 justifications once it's done it's what
0:22:09 you put thought in beforehand you
0:22:11 justify all your actions before is it
0:22:12 done I can't yet again you keep going
0:22:14 back in the past it is done we cannot do
0:22:18 anything besides focusing on a thing I
0:22:20 just that's we have shocking me more
0:22:22 than than you doing it what surprises me
0:22:24 more than you do it is that Johnny is
0:22:26 cool with it honestly I'm not cool with
0:22:28 it I understand why he did it
0:22:31 I you were there and you didn't stop him
0:22:34 you didn't even try we talked about it
0:22:37 beforehand
0:22:39 we knew what we were doing
0:22:42 I don't see a future
0:22:44 where this city holds together
0:22:47 without miles having the power of
0:22:50 Roland's blood
0:22:54 you're all I'm saying right now so yes
0:22:57 but I won't look in the past okay I'll
0:22:59 try and stop looking at the past which
0:23:01 is hard for me to do but I'm going to do
0:23:03 it to say fine then we have a problem
0:23:05 before us do you know
0:23:07 you said the Sabbat is coming problem
0:23:09 before us how how much of the Sabbat is
0:23:12 coming
0:23:13 a lot sounds like all of it uh not all
0:23:16 of it because a huge part of the black
0:23:18 hand left but uh oh almost all of it
0:23:21 most of it do you know what kind of
0:23:23 power the Sabbat wields I do I saw some
0:23:26 of it and because they rampantly yeah
0:23:28 this is not what I wanted to do this is
0:23:30 not how I wanted to have these
0:23:31 conversations but take a moment here
0:23:32 Johnny I saw all of it
0:23:35 can you guys I saw all of it both on
0:23:38 Crusade and when they just hang out I
0:23:40 saw all of it and I'm sorry and I think
0:23:42 we need everyone here can you guys go
0:23:45 gather them up it'll probably be best
0:23:47 for me not to miles is right
0:23:50 do you want to get Bruno or do you want
0:23:52 to get win uh you know
0:23:55 if you want to just go get them both
0:23:56 together let's just go let's just go get
0:23:58 them let's just go
0:24:02 yeah
0:24:04 let's just go ahead
0:24:09 Brita had quietly followed when looking
0:24:13 small scared and lost just keeping close
0:24:17 but not trying to say anything when runs
0:24:23 outside less angry more urgent and when
0:24:27 Brita catches up she is dry heaving in
0:24:29 an alley
0:24:30 can I am
0:24:32 and Bretta Has Lifted her hand to put it
0:24:36 on Wednesday she lets her but it does so
0:24:39 and her muscles are just like
0:24:41 rocks on her back she will
0:24:44 maybe it's the hand maybe it's just the
0:24:48 sensation of it passing
0:24:51 but when
0:24:52 eventually begins to unknot as when
0:24:56 slowly gets a little less tense Brita
0:25:00 gently kind of runs her fingers along
0:25:03 wins back trying to give some small
0:25:06 Comfort win wipes her eyes she tries to
0:25:10 find the words and they just won't come
0:25:11 Britta is also lost in her thoughts and
0:25:15 it doesn't feel like she can pick which
0:25:18 emotional Direction other than that kind
0:25:21 of dread she's pretty willing to share
0:25:24 the silence because it means that she
0:25:26 doesn't have to
0:25:28 figure out what any of this means on one
0:25:31 of the passes on her back when will
0:25:33 reach up and kind of just take British
0:25:35 hand and hold it for a minute Brita
0:25:38 stops initially kind of mistaking it for
0:25:40 maybe having contributed to the upset
0:25:42 but once she realizes that when just
0:25:45 needs the setiness she kind of sits in
0:25:49 this probably honestly gross bar
0:25:52 alleyway good thing she's wearing jeans
0:25:55 when
0:25:57 kind of like lowers herself to a Crouch
0:26:00 she doesn't let go of britta's hand she
0:26:02 just kind of turns her head to look at
0:26:04 her over her shoulder
0:26:07 do you actually know what diablary is
0:26:10 yeah I
0:26:12 well I mean I remember from when we were
0:26:15 all scared that
0:26:16 Johnny had
0:26:18 when we were scared that Johnny might
0:26:20 have done it by accident to Cha
0:26:23 it's
0:26:24 the death of a soul Brita
0:26:27 it is
0:26:29 the murder
0:26:32 of the one thing that makes us people
0:26:34 people were saying that it leaves like a
0:26:38 stain on you forever
0:26:41 we do an awful lot of bad [ __ ] and that
0:26:44 that's the one
0:26:46 that marks your soul
0:26:49 it changes you down to your soul
0:26:54 the destruction of a soul that will
0:26:57 never get the chance to be redeemed it
0:26:59 will never return to the cycle it will
0:27:01 never
0:27:04 it'll just never
0:27:07 last time we checked in on this
0:27:10 Beretta was working through the breaking
0:27:13 of her blood Bond
0:27:15 does that have any particular effect at
0:27:19 this moment or is that still how I'm
0:27:21 working through it personally
0:27:23 so
0:27:25 I mean you still remember feeling all of
0:27:27 these ways about this person you
0:27:28 remember them fondly
0:27:31 I
0:27:33 I don't know what to
0:27:36 when we were all worried that Johnny had
0:27:38 done it to Shaw it seemed like it was
0:27:42 it was maybe the worst thing that
0:27:44 Kindred could do
0:27:46 and I don't know if that's true I guess
0:27:48 there's
0:27:49 I guess there's a lot of room but I am
0:27:52 apparently it's subjective
0:27:55 I just I I remember the way that I feel
0:27:58 I felt about
0:28:00 Roland's with the bond and then I
0:28:02 remember it breaking and I I it felt
0:28:04 violent at the time but I don't know if
0:28:06 that's different because of
0:28:09 and I I don't
0:28:12 I
0:28:13 does it change anything if you do it on
0:28:16 purpose
0:28:18 diablary yeah
0:28:21 I don't know I guess we'll have to ask
0:28:22 our experts foreign
0:28:28 Johnny and Neil come walking out of the
0:28:30 front of the club Johnny immediately
0:28:32 lights up a uh another morally kind of
0:28:35 scans up and down the uh sidewalk
0:28:37 looking for the two of you it doesn't
0:28:38 doesn't seem to to catch Where You Are
0:28:40 by the alley Neo is also looking around
0:28:43 next to Johnny sort of unconsciously
0:28:46 leans in towards him when the morally
0:28:48 goes up like it's a familiar sort of
0:28:50 like almost like Johnny's morleys are
0:28:52 like a grounding sensation just to be
0:28:54 around he is not blinked in like like a
0:28:57 mulcavian has totally forgotten that
0:28:59 he's supposed to be blinking and is
0:29:00 looking around and at some point does
0:29:03 spot the two women and sort of nudges
0:29:05 Johnny and nods ahead over towards them
0:29:08 can we convince the two of you to come
0:29:10 back inside so we can talk more Bretta
0:29:12 looks up at when engaging her reaction
0:29:14 above her own wind glares at Johnny
0:29:19 what else is there to say
0:29:21 I
0:29:23 there's all kinds of things going on
0:29:24 that our coder needs to talk about for
0:29:26 the coming nights I think uh right now
0:29:29 we need to be Solutions
0:29:32 Solutions oriented
0:29:35 um
0:29:36 I I don't even I mean there's some
0:29:39 uh you know I don't
0:29:41 hey Neil just kind of gets lost in his
0:29:44 brain
0:29:45 let me be clear about something he looks
0:29:47 at the three of you each in turn
0:29:51 looking directly into your eyes
0:29:54 what miles did
0:29:56 is disgusting
0:29:58 it's reprehensible
0:30:01 but
0:30:02 there's no but Johnny there is a butt no
0:30:05 the butt is the ass sitting in the club
0:30:07 right now
0:30:09 the butt
0:30:10 is Miles deserves
0:30:14 a lot more respect for the hard decision
0:30:16 that he just made
0:30:18 I stand by him on this awful thing that
0:30:21 he did and the three of you ought to
0:30:24 think about that as well
0:30:25 I'm expecting that at some point in the
0:30:28 coming nights you're going to have a
0:30:29 long talk with your actual feelings on
0:30:31 what he did win winds up a fist and
0:30:34 punches him in the face Johnny takes
0:30:36 that in stride
0:30:37 do not
0:30:39 prescribe to me what miles deserves from
0:30:42 me
0:30:43 that's fair
0:30:45 but don't forget all the [ __ ] that you
0:30:47 owe him I don't owe him someone's Soul
0:30:49 no that's fair rumor has it though the
0:30:52 Roland Diablo rise his sire who gives us
0:30:57 rumor has it that all the elders
0:30:59 diablerize their sires in fact I'm
0:31:01 pretty sure the camarilla is built on
0:31:04 elders Diablo Rising other vampires
0:31:06 Johnny this whole [ __ ] organization
0:31:08 is only because vampires she punches
0:31:11 Johnny catches the fist stop stop please
0:31:14 hold on you are on a very high horse
0:31:16 right now Johnny we can and I'm not and
0:31:19 I'm not here for it please I am I
0:31:21 because right now I feel like I'm
0:31:23 looking up at you sweetness you're the
0:31:25 one telling me morality and what I
0:31:27 should be doing because you know what's
0:31:29 good in this world [ __ ] you
0:31:32 can we
0:31:33 I didn't want all I'm saying is Miles
0:31:37 always deals with us on the up and up
0:31:40 then why didn't he tell me he just did
0:31:43 here no he didn't Neil did
0:31:46 you used my resources
0:31:49 to help you drain another Soul you made
0:31:53 me complicit we are not near the speaker
0:31:56 if we could talk carefully
0:32:02 please
0:32:04 you chose to make me a part of this
0:32:08 there's no words so without telling me
0:32:13 no [ __ ] what you think he deserves
0:32:16 he made a choice for me without me
0:32:18 asking
0:32:20 and if he thinks I'm gonna get over that
0:32:22 just because we got bigger [ __ ] coming
0:32:25 down the pipe
0:32:27 no this
0:32:29 this changes
0:32:32 I will not let this decision break the
0:32:34 cotery
0:32:36 because like you said bigger [ __ ] to
0:32:38 deal with
0:32:40 but don't pretend like you're doing me a
0:32:42 favor
0:32:43 I'm not pretending like I'm doing you a
0:32:45 favor
0:32:46 I'm just reminding you
0:32:49 that it's in miles
0:32:52 someone I thought I knew
0:32:54 wind kind of squeezes britta's hand
0:32:56 she's kind of actually relaxes it
0:32:58 because she's been
0:32:59 she hasn't let go
0:33:01 just been squeezing harder as she's been
0:33:03 getting madder and now she finally seems
0:33:06 to like actually feel the fingers in her
0:33:08 hand and relaxes you start realizing
0:33:11 that Bretta has been intentionally quiet
0:33:14 and has let herself fall behind you
0:33:19 in the way of seeing the two of you
0:33:23 get louder
0:33:25 and more violent and more prone to the
0:33:28 beasts inside of you that as you're
0:33:31 talking about this monstrous thing Brita
0:33:35 is bracing for a monstrous impact
0:33:39 while his Beast doesn't look at ease
0:33:43 he doesn't have that hair on the back of
0:33:45 his neck standing up look that he has
0:33:48 when his Beast is about to take over
0:33:51 Johnny looks genuinely angry but at the
0:33:55 same time every time that win has hit
0:33:58 you Brit is scanning for the that
0:34:01 vampiric impulse sure and it's just it's
0:34:04 interesting to see that it is that this
0:34:06 looks like it is Johnny angry not the
0:34:09 bruja angry when and her Beast are
0:34:12 intermingled at this point it probably
0:34:14 looks it seems though that when the
0:34:17 anger gets highest
0:34:18 she punches or yells
0:34:21 and it quiets the urge to do more
0:34:26 there's been
0:34:27 um
0:34:29 a lot of
0:34:31 unintended consequences to uh
0:34:34 actions
0:34:35 Johnny gives you a hard stare
0:34:38 and I sometimes feel like we have a
0:34:41 narrow view of who are those
0:34:43 consequences roll down on
0:34:45 and who has to shoulder the burden I
0:34:50 I want to be home
0:34:53 I want to be here I want to be
0:34:57 with all of you when I was in my mind
0:35:01 which has been so infrequently recently
0:35:04 all I wanted to do was come back
0:35:06 even knowing all of it
0:35:10 I just
0:35:13 I just
0:35:14 worry that's all
0:35:17 because
0:35:20 we
0:35:22 I'm trying to understand
0:35:24 your rationale
0:35:26 Johnny and miles is
0:35:28 I don't agree with it but I'm trying to
0:35:30 understand it but by doing that we have
0:35:32 a cavalcade it's just just a fracturing
0:35:35 splintering mirror branches of of so
0:35:38 many other problems that have now been
0:35:40 created because of that action and we
0:35:42 need to figure out what to do about it
0:35:44 because
0:35:45 it's gonna all come crashing down and
0:35:47 you're right probably probably a lot of
0:35:50 Elders have gone that but the structure
0:35:51 of the camarilla exists to stop neonates
0:35:53 from doing this and protect the elders
0:35:55 so like miles desire is going to kill
0:35:58 him if he finds out about this and it's
0:36:00 regardless obvious of what the elders
0:36:03 may do that doesn't make it right and it
0:36:06 doesn't justify anyone else doing this
0:36:09 I'm pretty sure miles siren already
0:36:11 knows he does not takes in another one
0:36:14 of those unnecessary breaths trying to
0:36:16 study herself I think you're being
0:36:17 awfully naive about what Clan Venture
0:36:20 does
0:36:22 I was just with him he has been
0:36:25 clandestine and sequestered in New York
0:36:27 City he doesn't know yet
0:36:30 [ __ ] he doesn't know because the
0:36:32 support
0:36:34 I watched the secret spread in front of
0:36:37 my eyes and it had not touched him yet
0:36:40 and even if he does know as soon as it
0:36:42 is public which is days from now
0:36:45 he will be obliged to do something about
0:36:47 it guys how is it and how and so now
0:36:50 we're actually real problem let Brita
0:36:53 talk no I'm just I'm gonna I'm gonna go
0:36:56 inside okay because
0:36:58 we're not supposed to be alone for too
0:37:01 long so what do you guys should be
0:37:03 having this conversation with Miles I
0:37:05 agree I do I I I do what am I supposed
0:37:09 to say to him you don't have to go
0:37:11 inside yet I'm just I don't want miles
0:37:13 to be alone he's got all the power in
0:37:16 the world now he can save New Haven now
0:37:19 what does he need us for
0:37:21 I'm just I don't want and bread is like
0:37:25 definitely close to tears if you want to
0:37:29 be with Miles then go be with miles but
0:37:31 don't pretend he needs us
0:37:33 Prada bites down she looks hurt he
0:37:36 definitely needs us
0:37:38 and she turns and she goes in
0:37:42 she
0:37:44 the very fact that he did it
0:37:46 means that he needs us
0:37:48 at least to make sure he doesn't do it
0:37:50 again or to make sure he can do it again
0:37:52 no do you trust a cannibal at the table
0:37:55 I trust miles I thought I knew miles the
0:37:58 miles I knew wouldn't be this dirty
0:38:01 I don't know if that's true and I Neil
0:38:04 sort of like slumps his shoulders and
0:38:06 follows after Bruno because he also have
0:38:08 a lot better meal one while she's
0:38:09 walking in
0:38:10 there are two truths about miles
0:38:14 he always stands by his word
0:38:17 and aside from breaking that
0:38:20 he'll do anything to win
0:38:23 we Define wind very differently
0:38:27 this is a huge [ __ ] loss
0:38:33 Maybe
0:38:35 but I think he's right
0:38:38 this is the way to win the war
0:38:42 it may be a loss in the short term
0:38:45 don't act like this is a noble thing he
0:38:48 did
0:38:49 this was sealing a power vacuum plain
0:38:51 and simple
0:38:53 at the cost of a soul that can never be
0:38:55 redeemed [ __ ] roll in Soul [ __ ] Rollins
0:38:59 his soul may have had nothing to do with
0:39:00 it I don't necessarily see the
0:39:02 difference I am that's the problem
0:39:05 we're dealing with some heavy [ __ ]
0:39:07 coming down from all angles
0:39:10 and now it's a hell of a lot harder for
0:39:12 me to make peace with
0:39:14 it was never going to be easy for any of
0:39:16 us to make peace I give a [ __ ] if I'm in
0:39:19 a fight I don't even really care if I
0:39:21 die
0:39:22 in a fight but I always wanted to be
0:39:24 able to trust all of you
0:39:26 I think you can still trust miles
0:39:30 we think differently
0:39:37 miles
0:39:38 you sit
0:39:40 alone
0:39:41 there is a loud thrum of Music crowds of
0:39:45 people mingling
0:39:47 and living as though
0:39:49 New Haven we're not about to undergo an
0:39:52 apocalyptic event
0:39:56 and as you brood in silence
0:40:00 one at a time
0:40:02 you begin to see the members of your
0:40:04 cautery return
0:40:06 the first among them
0:40:09 is Brita
0:40:11 Brita still looks
0:40:13 small and scared and honestly closer to
0:40:17 tears than when she walked out after
0:40:19 when
0:40:20 but even though she's wrapped her arms
0:40:24 around herself too tightly and she's
0:40:26 looking at the floor She slowly sits
0:40:29 down next to you welcome back
0:40:32 she kind of peeks up at you and
0:40:35 tries to formulate something to say kind
0:40:38 of nods
0:40:39 very shortly thereafter Neil walks in
0:40:42 after Brita and it sits down at the
0:40:46 table
0:40:47 sort of glancing between the two of them
0:40:49 not really sure what to say
0:40:52 characteristically can't handle silence
0:40:54 for more than like 10 seconds and just
0:40:57 says uh I guess
0:41:00 um would be Solutions oriented
0:41:04 for
0:41:06 um I think the others are coming I think
0:41:08 they're I think Wayne and Johnny just
0:41:10 had to we can get to Solutions when
0:41:12 people say their peace everyone deserves
0:41:14 them
0:41:15 yeah at that point Johnny comes striding
0:41:18 in
0:41:19 he uh grabs the spot when just needed a
0:41:22 few more Moments by herself should be
0:41:24 here soon sounds great
0:41:26 I love being this close in proximity to
0:41:28 speakers I mean if we can
0:41:32 just really you know
0:41:34 something soothing about feeling all of
0:41:36 the music go through my I mean it's
0:41:38 always kind of like this man but if you
0:41:40 if you want to go somewhere else I'm
0:41:42 mostly being sarcastic it's fine we can
0:41:44 I'm also not being sarcastic in some
0:41:46 sense that it's weirdly soothing isn't
0:41:49 it though right yeah it's like sensory
0:41:51 deprivation in some way yeah yeah it's
0:41:53 nice when other stuff drowns everything
0:41:56 else out when we'll walk in Hands In
0:42:00 Pockets Hood drawn up over her head she
0:42:03 goes back to where the codery is but she
0:42:05 doesn't sit she just kind of puts her
0:42:07 back against the wall leans against it
0:42:09 arms crossed
0:42:10 so what else do we need to talk about I
0:42:13 I was going to say we can we can go
0:42:15 somewhere that's more comfortable if
0:42:17 we're done talking about the this thing
0:42:19 I'm talking about kindred's [ __ ] no I
0:42:23 don't care about Kendra [ __ ] it's just
0:42:24 this specific thing I didn't want other
0:42:25 people to be able to and this is the
0:42:27 only spot in the club where no one else
0:42:28 can hear it no matter who or what
0:42:30 they're doing but it's up to you guys
0:42:31 but other stuff like domain stuff and
0:42:34 Kindred stuff I just wanted to keep
0:42:36 miles is things close to the close to
0:42:39 the chest appreciate it let's keep it
0:42:41 all uh talking here that's fine okay
0:42:44 sure before we go anywhere else one
0:42:47 everybody should say what they should
0:42:49 say or what to say when it's not good to
0:42:52 keep it inside it's not good to blow off
0:42:54 in a club either so if we've got
0:42:56 something we need to talk about then
0:42:58 let's talk about it and I can talk to
0:42:59 Miles at another time when we're
0:43:01 actually private Johnny nods at that all
0:43:03 right sure
0:43:05 um miles yeah are you
0:43:09 you
0:43:11 after what does that mean
0:43:15 I'm less affected by this in some ways
0:43:17 than having a demon constantly talking
0:43:20 to me that's back by the way what's back
0:43:22 Z is back yes
0:43:25 he chased Raven out of her body and is
0:43:27 walking around as raven like he was
0:43:30 doing to miles
0:43:32 no Raven isn't there he's fully
0:43:35 possessed her if he's fully possessed
0:43:37 her it probably means she's dead
0:43:39 or so crushed inside of herself that
0:43:43 it's just a demon though or she made a
0:43:46 deal no no she did not
0:43:50 because survival is about survival as
0:43:52 you and not the bargains you make at
0:43:56 least for her
0:43:57 wasn't she so anti-demon that she she
0:44:00 was going she was going to kill us
0:44:03 if the demon was not cleared
0:44:06 is that why
0:44:07 Z might have gone after her or they had
0:44:12 similar goals in mind
0:44:14 I mean she they clearly had a history of
0:44:17 some kind or another based on the books
0:44:20 in the order of the cloven huff and all
0:44:22 of that but what is he going to do with
0:44:26 I guess what is he going to do now that
0:44:28 he has that form whatever he wants right
0:44:31 yep maybe he collected on a deal he made
0:44:34 with her prior he she to my knowledge
0:44:37 has never made deals with demons how
0:44:39 much do you know about Raven a lot
0:44:42 sure
0:44:43 I don't know a lot about demons but I
0:44:46 can
0:44:47 learn more I just haven't had a chance
0:44:49 with everything that's you should also
0:44:52 know
0:44:53 he is taking the agreement to not cause
0:44:57 us harm
0:44:59 seriously
0:45:02 that said
0:45:04 agreement
0:45:05 he said there was an agreement that he
0:45:07 would not harm oh right did the yes okay
0:45:10 but he does like to watch while we
0:45:12 suffer
0:45:13 so he
0:45:15 arrived right before the storm
0:45:17 in the shadowlands did
0:45:20 and watched me rot Shrek
0:45:22 just so that's a nice backdrop for
0:45:24 everything else
0:45:25 Beretta tries to give when an expression
0:45:30 of comfort but it's very hesitant when
0:45:33 is kind of like purposefully not making
0:45:35 eye contact with anybody she seems to be
0:45:38 trying to just
0:45:40 Focus inward
0:45:42 okay
0:45:43 um
0:45:44 is there anyone else I I think I've said
0:45:46 most of my piece but is there anyone
0:45:47 else who wants to
0:45:49 before we start um
0:45:51 is there anything else about miles
0:45:55 right now that we wanna
0:45:57 have said most of my piece not all the
0:46:01 backstory as to what's informing it but
0:46:03 he knows my
0:46:05 opinion on the matter and the problems
0:46:08 it's going to cause
0:46:10 I understand I also understand that
0:46:12 problems are coming one way or another
0:46:14 and I want to ask you a question about
0:46:18 something you touched on okay uh Johnny
0:46:21 says he points at Neil miles visibly
0:46:25 closes his eyes
0:46:26 how did you find out
0:46:29 so um find out what
0:46:32 about miles right yes
0:46:35 I woke up in New York
0:46:38 um in the care of
0:46:41 uh weathers and Amaya and Kabir you told
0:46:44 us the fast forward whole thing
0:46:46 um they said that I had agreed to they
0:46:48 insisted on uh spying on the spot right
0:46:51 uh I uh
0:46:53 snuck into one of their blood orgy that
0:46:58 whatever right you know the Blood Feast
0:47:00 and uh the vicos saw me before lucida
0:47:04 showed up and killed somebody and gave
0:47:06 me an opportunity to run off
0:47:07 and as I was hiding I was in a side room
0:47:10 the secondary room why was Lucia out
0:47:12 there I get to kill somebody I don't
0:47:14 know it was very fortuitous she showed
0:47:16 up when she did I was dead
0:47:18 and a lot of that the past couple weeks
0:47:21 um
0:47:21 but as I was hiding Corman was there in
0:47:24 a room with someone Immortal but
0:47:27 pretty clearly possessed by somebody
0:47:29 that mortal
0:47:31 indicated that they were um
0:47:33 in New Haven or at least context that
0:47:36 they were from New Haven
0:47:37 uh an elder at least or has some sort of
0:47:41 way to hide their presence and how would
0:47:43 how would someone be able to hide their
0:47:45 presence
0:47:46 uh because normally you're able to see
0:47:48 who who would be riding a suit sure but
0:47:52 yes but if they have abilities
0:47:55 Elders can confound even my eyes okay
0:48:00 so uh but somebody who had enough
0:48:03 ability to dominate others that they
0:48:06 could possess someone else so that's
0:48:09 what I'm getting to because you
0:48:11 mentioned something about that and what
0:48:13 I want to highlight
0:48:14 is that regardless of anything else here
0:48:18 we have to be aware that there is more
0:48:20 than likely a mole or a Sabah or Sabbat
0:48:24 spy in the city
0:48:26 who is of either a high enough
0:48:28 generation or in possession of high
0:48:32 levels of dominate that Neil can't
0:48:35 figure out who they are that limits the
0:48:39 list
0:48:40 um couldn't it be a combination possibly
0:48:42 but uh what I was going to say is so the
0:48:45 absence of information is information of
0:48:47 itself so exactly next time depending
0:48:51 it's not a guarantee but next time we we
0:48:53 have some sort of courtly Gathering or
0:48:54 or something
0:48:56 um I don't know if you look around a
0:48:58 room and there's a little black spot but
0:49:00 maybe either either way it's somebody
0:49:02 newer to the city was the impression
0:49:03 that I got uh and also that Carmen was
0:49:06 not telling
0:49:07 some of the others in the Sabbat yet
0:49:09 that they were going to use that that
0:49:12 information to destabilize
0:49:14 New Haven to to feed it to the other
0:49:16 princes so that they all turn and turn
0:49:18 on you politically and kill you do you
0:49:21 know why Carmen was keeping that to
0:49:25 herself I don't I don't if I had to
0:49:28 wager a guess since they want to keep
0:49:30 their Source secret
0:49:32 um I have a description of the guy I
0:49:34 could show uh I don't know if anybody
0:49:37 has
0:49:38 contacts with the
0:49:40 police or whatever but if there was like
0:49:41 a person who went missing that matches
0:49:43 the description
0:49:45 then maybe we could trace their sources
0:49:47 and I I don't know I have some contacts
0:49:50 I've been informed that Marcus vitel is
0:49:52 someone that should be watched and all
0:49:53 my interactions with him put me on edge
0:49:56 I don't know that individual but I can
0:49:58 try and he's the prince from DC okay
0:50:01 I'll give you more information on them
0:50:03 later okay sure we can we can we can do
0:50:06 that
0:50:07 um
0:50:08 this isn't uh directly related I guess
0:50:11 but um
0:50:12 miles are you okay
0:50:16 I was gonna say some more and oh
0:50:19 questions
0:50:22 no it's we can do that if you want to do
0:50:25 that I just you seem
0:50:27 I mean I know you ate somebody so it's
0:50:28 like that's its own thing but like even
0:50:31 outside of that you seem
0:50:33 yes the Dragon
0:50:36 what
0:50:37 the dragon and the Chantry oh yeah you
0:50:40 did tell me about that
0:50:41 um insane released
0:50:44 um an attack that
0:50:47 uh severely uh damaged my psyche or
0:50:50 something like that it's
0:50:52 it's a constant uphill battle
0:50:54 I guess it it's hard to describe but
0:50:57 from how it feels to me it feels like
0:51:01 um
0:51:02 like it ripping away a part of yourself
0:51:06 so both of you have looked Hollow since
0:51:09 that fight yeah it feels um
0:51:13 feels harder to hold on to myself I
0:51:15 don't know if it's like that for you
0:51:17 miles it just I feels like like there's
0:51:22 less of me less of my will less of my
0:51:26 strength that it just I feel hollow is a
0:51:29 good word for it it's an impairment and
0:51:32 a weakness
0:51:33 and I definitely see it being a problem
0:51:36 going forward the more I have to deal
0:51:38 with the other princess Neil bunches up
0:51:42 his face like he's thinking really hard
0:51:44 about some sort of puzzle and then kind
0:51:47 of looking into the middle distance goes
0:51:49 I
0:51:51 if you're willing to go with me on this
0:51:55 um I don't know if it'll work or not
0:51:56 this is a little Uncharted Territory but
0:51:58 I I might have an idea on how to
0:52:01 confront the missing pieces of yourself
0:52:04 that sounds
0:52:06 not fun no it won't be fun well part of
0:52:09 it is fun that's kind of the problem
0:52:11 what yeah we can talk about it later I
0:52:13 just right I might have a
0:52:16 thought about that you might have a
0:52:19 solution
0:52:20 maybe it sounds like Uncharted Territory
0:52:23 this is not I just go with yes I have
0:52:26 ideas we can try to we got it to find
0:52:30 you yeah it won't feel like
0:52:34 like being torn apart again will it
0:52:37 so what you're afraid of Brita kind of
0:52:39 like slumps further in her chair tucking
0:52:42 like her knees in closer anyways sorry I
0:52:46 just you seem
0:52:48 there's it's been a long emotional
0:52:50 exhaustion and then there's
0:52:53 week two so I just you good yeah okay
0:52:57 we're just that's fine
0:53:00 um I'm still trying to talk here I
0:53:05 anyone else thank you
0:53:06 I would like to say my piece and then I
0:53:08 would like just anybody else is free
0:53:12 to State what they want
0:53:14 but the ACT
0:53:16 is heinous and was not without debate
0:53:20 but I also did not see
0:53:22 a way to keep everyone else safe
0:53:25 and I will endanger myself
0:53:28 and all parts of it to keep everyone
0:53:31 safe
0:53:32 is it lonely up there on the cross miles
0:53:34 I don't know it sounds like you're up
0:53:36 here with me
0:53:37 I've never heard the town is like you're
0:53:39 judging I am great very harshly cool
0:53:46 it's
0:53:48 I don't know if it's probably not gonna
0:53:52 every time that I've [ __ ] up or been
0:53:57 something that I couldn't take away or
0:54:00 fix or any of that I've I don't know if
0:54:05 it's the same I just
0:54:07 it's meant a lot to me that you guys
0:54:11 have
0:54:12 been willing to see if I'm so me
0:54:16 um
0:54:17 that's why I was asking you if you were
0:54:20 still you
0:54:22 does not feel like much has changed I've
0:54:25 the attack was more
0:54:28 damaging in some ways
0:54:30 um
0:54:32 Rollins had done and continue to do and
0:54:35 plan to do
0:54:37 much to separate and destroy us
0:54:40 I think
0:54:41 um I don't speak for everybody but I I
0:54:43 think the moment he started preying on
0:54:46 Bretta we all kind of decided he needed
0:54:48 to die
0:54:49 is that an overstatement or he continued
0:54:52 to keep pressing on it yeah on top of
0:54:54 that your own
0:54:56 trial
0:54:57 yeah not great although reminder that
0:55:01 trial was because I was an
0:55:02 accusedeoporist
0:55:04 s because you were all right you're sire
0:55:06 iron well there was an accused diablaris
0:55:08 well he's not accused that he's he's
0:55:10 full-fledged into it
0:55:12 um there's a philosophy amongst the
0:55:15 Warriors of Hakeem the path of blood
0:55:18 that all Hearts blood must be reclaimed
0:55:20 and uh that's the one he wants me to do
0:55:23 so it's I'm not gonna do it but
0:55:26 I gotta admit it's harder miles you said
0:55:30 that Roland's was gonna go further
0:55:35 it seems like he had more plans on you
0:55:38 and tying us to you and then removing
0:55:40 anything that was possibly a problem
0:55:43 he had been spying on us using someone
0:55:47 that Nosferatu which ones
0:55:50 seems like the report came from Fester
0:55:51 there's a noon seen him by the way
0:55:55 speaking of things we wish we didn't do
0:55:56 and could take back
0:55:58 there's an astrato not unless he made
0:56:00 himself known so we don't know if he's
0:56:01 in the city we don't know if he's alive
0:56:03 but why would he not be
0:56:05 Neil looks horrifically guilty
0:56:09 I am
0:56:12 sorry maybe do things
0:56:14 he had put things in my head
0:56:18 um to act like a Manchurian Candidate
0:56:20 and his eyes flick over towards Brenna
0:56:22 and then back
0:56:23 uh I last I saw Fester I had lit him on
0:56:28 fire and he was running
0:56:30 out into the night minutes from sunrise
0:56:34 do we survive that
0:56:37 being lit on what you were lit on fire
0:56:40 you survived okay I get the fire out
0:56:43 yeah and he could find a place to hide
0:56:46 from the side I don't know that's why I
0:56:47 asked anyways he was selling to I mean
0:56:49 it makes sense I suppose I think he's
0:56:51 working for that's what the domain
0:56:54 do yeah not
0:56:57 entirely his fault and I get it
0:57:01 much like run Wick was doing his job
0:57:05 so
0:57:06 um
0:57:07 so he was Professor was spying on me
0:57:12 so that Rollins could
0:57:15 separate us
0:57:17 at least control us but they saw you was
0:57:20 a linchpin and a problem so getting your
0:57:23 triple blood bonded was part of the plan
0:57:26 oh
0:57:28 I think that Roland's was kind of a
0:57:29 creep just icing on that particular cake
0:57:33 right so
0:57:36 um I mean he was insisted upon it though
0:57:37 the few days before right been mostly
0:57:40 ignoring him path of night is a vampire
0:57:43 the Masquerade podcast set in the world
0:57:45 of Darkness Bretta Ashcroft the toreader
0:57:48 was played by Rebecca segalfest Johnny
