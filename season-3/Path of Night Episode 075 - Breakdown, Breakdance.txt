0:00:28 night
0:00:37 last time on path of
0:00:40 night the quartery sought pen dragon's
0:00:42 Aid in the battle against the sabat of
0:00:44 New
0:00:45 York Prince Pendragon demanded the
0:00:47 sanction of mass dibler in the
0:00:50 city miles agreed to the terms and the
0:00:53 quartery grappled with what they had
0:00:56 done as Johnny prepared to help kir seek
0:00:59 jealous Revenge John weathers winds
0:01:01 stalked off into the
0:01:05 [Music]
0:01:27 night when you walk off alone somber
0:01:31 quiet
0:01:32 soon the sounds of the thrumming music
0:01:37 and
0:01:39 Rave become
0:01:42 distant you know we're not really
0:01:44 supposed to walk off Jesus and she it it
0:01:47 she throws a punch just in the direction
0:01:50 of the voice yeah it probably connects
0:01:53 that's you don't have to roll for it you
0:01:55 just hit me in the face um oh ow God
0:01:59 sorry sorry
0:02:02 Ah that's okay are you all right uh-huh
0:02:05 Neil's like licking his gums like
0:02:08 oh uh I was just saying you're not
0:02:10 really supposed to supposed to be you
0:02:14 know buddy system still on or what
0:02:16 someone's going to jump me yeah the saat
0:02:20 here the blackand hander here and and I
0:02:25 know that you and I have different
0:02:29 definition
0:02:30 of how to best survive a fight but
0:02:34 there's a difference
0:02:36 between I mean I've been inside a dragon
0:02:39 yeah yeah I wanted to ask you about that
0:02:42 why why
0:02:44 not
0:02:46 yeah it got people to double down on the
0:02:49 efforts to beat the dragon didn't it did
0:02:52 it had all the aggression put towards me
0:02:55 had me clawing at it from the
0:02:58 inside
0:03:00 you want to
0:03:02 um you want to take this somewhere uh
0:03:06 this feels like a heavy talk uh you want
0:03:08 to take this somewhere not just on the
0:03:09 street and he points up it like a nearby
0:03:12 rooftop
0:03:14 I don't know that I genuinely care okay
0:03:19 that's part of the reason why I really
0:03:20 do want
0:03:22 to you sure this has nothing to do with
0:03:24 the idea that you feel entitled to
0:03:26 everyone's Secrets no no because your
0:03:29 shit's not very secret right now and
0:03:32 that's what I'm worried
0:03:33 about plus and he fishes around in his
0:03:36 pocket and pulls out kind of what looks
0:03:39 like a blood stains joint wind perks up
0:03:42 almost
0:03:44 immediately I don't want to just smoke
0:03:46 this on the
0:03:46 street that's fair and I know you said
0:03:51 all the stuff that you have been doing
0:03:53 for the last [ __ ] 30
0:03:55 years isn't psychosomatic but I think we
0:03:58 both know that it is
0:04:00 and he kind of Waggles what he's got in
0:04:02 his fingers in front of you and this one
0:04:04 isn't so I
0:04:06 figure looking at how you've been doing
0:04:10 since you off the rooftop maybe it's
0:04:13 time you and I sat down and pass the
0:04:14 joint for a little bit I'm willing to
0:04:16 sit and pass a joint with you mhm that's
0:04:19 not fair you [ __ ] know she kind of
0:04:22 smirks a little he
0:04:24 size yeah I know but
0:04:27 uh we're vampires we don't fight fa
0:04:31 so it would
0:04:33 seem so up sure Neil goes over into an
0:04:39 alley there's like a little fire escape
0:04:40 it's like okay um I'm past embarrassment
0:04:44 you want to give me a little boost sure
0:04:48 that's better than sticking a spider
0:04:50 under my
0:04:51 tongue and he uh she crouches down and
0:04:54 puts her hand out so he can step into
0:04:56 her palm and she hoists him up pretty
0:04:58 [ __ ] easily mhm but he's like tall
0:05:00 and gangly enough to grab on and like
0:05:02 hoist himself up do you want to hand up
0:05:04 or you got this on your own if you want
0:05:06 to grab me I'll jump uh and he like
0:05:08 leans a hand down she jumps and catches
0:05:12 him but also uses her free hand to grab
0:05:14 onto the grading so that great cuz he
0:05:16 immediately goes o and like doesn't
0:05:19 almost drop her but gets pulled into an
0:05:21 a he was not ready he was absolutely not
0:05:24 ready she clambers up she probably could
0:05:26 have gotten up easier without his help
0:05:30 the gesture is more important than the
0:05:32 result and he just leads his way up onto
0:05:36 like up this sort of dirty probably kind
0:05:39 of rusty fire escape up to the rooftop
0:05:41 and then just sits at the edge NE even
0:05:45 being on a rooftop like this is still
0:05:47 somebody's kind of cautious so like has
0:05:49 one leg seems most comfortable sitting
0:05:51 across the lip of the roof like one leg
0:05:55 on one leg off like he's straddling it
0:05:57 like well I can't lose my balance this
0:05:59 way and lights this
0:06:03 really strange smelling you've probably
0:06:06 smelled around him before joint like
0:06:10 pennies and weed yeah like pennies and
0:06:12 weed and passes it over to win I think
0:06:16 you probably need this more than I do
0:06:19 partly because I've already had like
0:06:21 four whole ass ones myself early yeah
0:06:23 that roof was potent I gave most of what
0:06:26 I had to Jane and a bunch of the brewha
0:06:29 um
0:06:30 it
0:06:31 seemed seemed like the right thing to do
0:06:34 you probably made some friends for life
0:06:36 with the gesture she kind of once
0:06:38 they're over the lip of the roof she
0:06:40 kind of sits with her back against the
0:06:42 lip cuz she's she's strong she's got a
0:06:45 no small amount of dexterity but she
0:06:48 doesn't know how this is going to hit
0:06:49 her and she doesn't really want to
0:06:50 topple off the roof and she accepts the
0:06:53 joint and first time rules too just be a
0:06:56 little careful I you're one of the
0:06:57 toughest people I know but shit's a
0:06:59 little stronger than it was in the' 60s
0:07:01 yeah that's why I'm sitting here and not
0:07:03 like you yeah so she takes a hit and not
0:07:07 a lot not like a cursory amount but like
0:07:11 a decent hit of the joint and then she
0:07:14 passes it back he takes a little bit and
0:07:19 then as she's breathing out without
0:07:22 Preamble while he still has some in his
0:07:24 mouth just
0:07:26 goes so
0:07:29 why you looking to die
0:07:31 when I'm already dead Neil you know what
0:07:35 I mean and I'm not just talking about
0:07:39 tonight because I miss my
0:07:43 family and you think Diane's going to
0:07:45 take you there think Diane's got a
0:07:48 chance to me it could
0:07:50 be I got about a 66%
0:07:54 chance of not ending up a
0:07:57 ghost that's um
0:08:00 I'm curious about the numbers on that
0:08:02 but I I don't think this is the right
0:08:03 time to ask you about the numbers so
0:08:05 I'll just take get your word and say all
0:08:07 right you got a one in three chance of
0:08:09 being a
0:08:11 ghost right that's what she said I don't
0:08:14 want to be a ghost no no from everything
0:08:16 you told me that [ __ ]
0:08:18 sucks but
0:08:20 either it's an end to everything and I
0:08:23 don't have to think about it anymore
0:08:25 okay or I see my family again because
0:08:29 they not in the
0:08:32 shadowlands and I'm tired of sacrificing
0:08:35 more and more of what makes me me for
0:08:38 the sake of just not dying yeah it's
0:08:41 funny uh I I was having some similar
0:08:44 thoughts I think we are arriving at
0:08:47 different conclusions but
0:08:51 um okay
0:08:54 so what are my chances same as mine what
0:08:58 about Brea
0:08:59 same
0:09:01 okay she probably has more of a chance
0:09:03 of becoming a wraith for the time she
0:09:05 spent there if I had to guess but
0:09:07 following after you what do you think
0:09:09 our chances are when you go down and
0:09:13 then at least she and I follow you prime
0:09:15 miles too cuz that's the logic right
0:09:18 when your family's gone you you go after
0:09:20 them I'm not going after
0:09:23 them this is a selfish act this is for
0:09:27 me I I I understand
0:09:30 stand I need motions the hand so that he
0:09:32 has the joint pack for a second she she
0:09:34 had passed it then he takes another big
0:09:37 hit and passes it back to
0:09:41 win so we're talking math and I know I
0:09:44 know it's different I know circumstances
0:09:46 are different I I know that your family
0:09:48 loved you in a way that my family didn't
0:09:50 love me and I was robbed of I understand
0:09:55 I I I get it I do but I'm just I'm just
0:09:58 thinking about this from my perspective
0:09:59 right I um I was turned when I was like
0:10:04 24
0:10:06 mhm
0:10:08 uh you and I were turned two weeks apart
0:10:11 I know you don't like to act like it
0:10:13 sometimes but I am the older one
0:10:15 here I lived longer as a mortal than you
0:10:18 yeah yeah I know so by that standard I'm
0:10:21 older by like two years at this point
0:10:23 that doesn't count it sure does if that
0:10:26 two weeks counts my two years counts to
0:10:29 okay very nicely done what I'm saying is
0:10:34 I've known you for a long time longer
0:10:35 than any miles longer than I new
0:10:38 Johnny
0:10:40 when you're my family it's
0:10:44 you so if you go chasing after somebody
0:10:48 else
0:10:50 selfishly I got to go chasing after
0:10:54 you brda has no family except for
0:10:57 us so so by the same logic she's got to
0:11:00 chase after the two of us maros not
0:11:03 coming
0:11:04 back assured that Miles doesn't have a
0:11:07 family he's just got us so he's got to
0:11:10 come chasing after us I'm just
0:11:12 [Music]
0:11:13 wondering I'm just wondering where the
0:11:16 chain ends that's all wherever you guys
0:11:18 want it to
0:11:21 end I don't make I try really hard not
0:11:25 to make choices for other
0:11:27 people
0:11:31 it's it's too late for
0:11:34 that by my perspective
0:11:36 anyways
0:11:40 because like it or not when you're my
0:11:43 family you're our family so choices that
0:11:45 impact you are choices you're making for
0:11:48 the rest of
0:11:49 us
0:11:52 no a well reasoned
0:11:54 Counterpoint
0:11:56 it's you we all make choic es based on
0:11:59 what other people do but at the end we
0:12:01 are still alone with our choices you're
0:12:05 right at the end of the day all we are
0:12:08 is the choices that we make and I chose
0:12:12 to not frenzy on that roof full of
0:12:14 people who had just condemned an entire
0:12:17 city to die
0:12:20 horribly not the whole city yeah most of
0:12:23 the city Neil what chance do you think
0:12:26 the humans are going to have what do you
0:12:27 think against the rising of the Dragon
0:12:30 none none against the rising of the
0:12:33 Dragon they didn't have a chance either
0:12:35 way and against the open Warfare of
0:12:37 vampires in the streets who run out of
0:12:39 blood constantly even those who can only
0:12:43 feed from other vampires can still get
0:12:47 something from humans not after a
0:12:50 certain point no at least not based on
0:12:52 the things I've so not the worst of them
0:12:55 not the oldest of them mhm most of them
0:12:57 are not the oldest of them no but
0:13:00 they're being fed on anyways some of
0:13:03 them the
0:13:05 diablerie
0:13:06 doesn't a few Vampires Will with saale
0:13:10 see that's that's not the series of
0:13:11 events that I see the one that you're
0:13:13 Pro the one that you're
0:13:15 professing what do you see I see
0:13:18 vampires feasting on each other some by
0:13:22 the way not all some are going to follow
0:13:25 that call CU some have been waiting
0:13:26 their whole own lives for an opport like
0:13:29 this an opportunity to make the choice
0:13:32 to be a monster and some of
0:13:35 them some of them are going to choose
0:13:37 something
0:13:39 different they're going to choose not
0:13:43 to do you think there's going to be
0:13:46 anyone there who doesn't want that yeah
0:13:51 absolutely which ones I have no idea in
0:13:54 the same way that I think that there are
0:13:56 members of The sabat Who probably
0:13:57 struggle with it
0:13:59 all right well we killed one of those so
0:14:02 and the longer that I am here and making
0:14:06 those
0:14:07 compromises the less a chance I have of
0:14:10 even that slight chance of seeing my
0:14:12 family again I started making
0:14:15 compromises when I agreed to work with
0:14:17 the Giovani I made another compromise
0:14:19 when I didn't
0:14:21 just walk away from
0:14:24 miles and I made another compromise
0:14:26 tonight when I didn't voice my actual
0:14:30 opinion in front of dark Selena I don't
0:14:33 give a [ __ ] I know what was she going to
0:14:35 do try and kill me no not
0:14:38 try she was going to kill
0:14:41 you so I face another Dragon that's what
0:14:44 I worry about when you're throwing
0:14:46 yourself at
0:14:47 dragons because you're looking for an
0:14:50 out I would love an out
0:14:52 Neil and
0:14:54 that's and people keep roping me back in
0:14:59 having me make more and more
0:15:01 compromises making me choose this realm
0:15:05 rather than the
0:15:07 Hereafter you know more about it than I
0:15:09 do the other side but can I tell you
0:15:13 what I've seen and what I think I don't
0:15:15 think I could stop you so she takes the
0:15:17 joint back and I'm telling you right now
0:15:20 because I feel like this is an honest
0:15:21 conversation you want me not to say
0:15:22 something I won't say it she gives a
0:15:24 look and motions for him to continue as
0:15:26 she takes another puff
0:15:29 you didn't ask to get embraced you
0:15:32 didn't ask for any of
0:15:35 this and when for as long as I've known
0:15:38 you you have been stuck in that
0:15:41 moment and you are looking for an
0:15:45 out because it's easier than healing
0:15:50 what is there to heal
0:15:52 Neil there are holes in my heart that
0:15:55 cannot be
0:15:56 healed I think that that is presently
0:16:00 true because you're living in that
0:16:02 moment every
0:16:04 day I think you're right I think we are
0:16:06 just the choices that we make at the end
0:16:08 of the day and we are even as human
0:16:13 beings we
0:16:16 were [ __ ] up idiots who don't know
0:16:18 what we're
0:16:19 doing but we try and we make the wrong
0:16:22 decisions and we [ __ ] up and we hurt
0:16:24 people with those decisions and then we
0:16:26 get up the next day and we try again we
0:16:28 are not some
0:16:30 mathematical equation of
0:16:33 morality weighing the good against the
0:16:36 bad we are just the next decision that
0:16:37 we're going to make the next moment that
0:16:40 we have in our
0:16:42 lives and by giving up by stopping at
0:16:45 that one
0:16:46 decision the one that hurts the most the
0:16:49 one that does the most damage the one
0:16:50 that hurts us the
0:16:52 most then that becomes your
0:16:55 reality then that is the you that exists
0:16:58 because you've decided not to make
0:17:00 another decision not to live in another
0:17:02 moment not to even
0:17:04 try sometimes I
0:17:07 think hoping for something
0:17:10 more
0:17:12 is the worst thing that we can do to
0:17:16 ourselves because it's the hardest thing
0:17:18 that we can do to ourselves and I know
0:17:19 this sounds stupid any like gestures of
0:17:22 the smoke that's around them like yeah
0:17:23 maybe this is kind of impacting my
0:17:25 thoughts right now
0:17:27 but
0:17:33 I'm in a tangent but I I promise this is
0:17:35 going
0:17:35 somewhere I've been thinking motions for
0:17:38 him to keep going then a lot about
0:17:42 diablerie and I think you maybe better
0:17:45 than anyone cuz you've known me the
0:17:47 longest understand
0:17:50 why he found me I think I mentioned that
0:17:53 when I came back he found me and
0:17:56 he Tor to bruha I was actually worried I
0:17:59 was going to see her here tonight CU
0:18:00 that would be really awkward she was in
0:18:02 a shower I put a towel over her but I
0:18:04 didn't know what to do I um he was
0:18:07 talking about justice hakeem's
0:18:10 justice that we are all
0:18:14 monsters that no Kindred deserves to
0:18:17 live because we are inherently monsters
0:18:20 and that the just thing to do the right
0:18:22 thing to
0:18:24 do the
0:18:26 mathematically correct thing to do is to
0:18:29 take as many of us off the board as
0:18:31 possible to reclaim all of the heart's
0:18:33 blood to deize everything you can in
0:18:36 your path because the soul of a vampire
0:18:39 is already damned and so taking all
0:18:42 those pieces off the board does the most
0:18:46 good for the
0:18:47 world and he wanted me so badly to do
0:18:50 the same
0:18:52 thing earlier T night theat were sort of
0:18:54 saying something
0:18:56 similar from a different direction but
0:18:58 but that the end result you know who
0:19:02 cares join up with our side put down the
0:19:05 Antideluvians because at the end when
0:19:06 they rise everyone's going to die so get
0:19:09 on the same [ __ ] winning team and
0:19:12 come fight them with us it doesn't
0:19:13 matter what happens to you the greater
0:19:16 good I mean you are
0:19:21 a you and I have talked philosophy and
0:19:24 psychi for years at this point it's a
0:19:27 very utilitarian way of looking at
0:19:29 things but
0:19:30 I for
0:19:32 me can't see them that
0:19:35 way there are choices that I've made and
0:19:37 they may have been the right choices and
0:19:40 I can feel them weighing heavy on
0:19:43 me but the more I'm thinking about them
0:19:46 the more I'm thinking about where I am I
0:19:48 I
0:19:49 know I know my Beast is winning out I I
0:19:53 know I should feel more than I do about
0:19:55 some of the things that I've done some
0:19:57 of the things that I'm
0:19:58 doing
0:20:04 but I have to believe for me and
0:20:07 unfortunately for you that means I have
0:20:09 to believe for you whether you like it
0:20:10 or not that we are more than what we
0:20:14 have done we are what we can still
0:20:18 do as far as the diablerie is concerned
0:20:21 the mass unleashing we didn't do that I
0:20:24 I don't know if you caught the windfall
0:20:25 on that roof but we didn't have a choice
0:20:28 that was something that was
0:20:29 predetermined to
0:20:31 happen pen Dragon came up on that roof
0:20:34 with an idea in his head we could have
0:20:38 said no and it wouldn't have done
0:20:39 anything except get us he would have
0:20:43 done
0:20:45 exactly what he wanted to do regardless
0:20:47 of our
0:20:48 complacency which means Miles saying
0:20:51 yes that doesn't buy pen Dragon anything
0:20:54 miles can say yes and then go talk to
0:20:56 yon Peterson and yon Peterson can say
0:20:57 [ __ ] that
0:20:59 I don't think he
0:21:00 will
0:21:02 but Miles saying that is not necessarily
0:21:05 even a miles
0:21:06 endorsement it's just a decision that
0:21:10 was made in the moment I don't want to
0:21:11 see the suffering that's going to be the
0:21:13 unleashing of
0:21:15 this unfortunately I think we have to
0:21:18 see it and here's why I say that that's
0:21:21 why
0:21:23 because because when without us standing
0:21:26 there people like you and people like me
0:21:28 going no there's another way showing
0:21:31 people there's another option what do
0:21:32 you think happens somebody like miles
0:21:34 who's done it once and honestly I think
0:21:36 regrets it he can justify all he wants
0:21:38 in his head but you know him and I know
0:21:40 him
0:21:42 mhm what happens if our voices are not
0:21:45 there they
0:21:47 weren't next time we had a chance to say
0:21:50 something and I didn't I fancied
0:21:54 surviving living another night talking
0:21:57 about the grand things I'm not talking
0:22:00 about global politics or the Jihad or
0:22:03 pen Dragon I'm talking about miles but
0:22:05 it all starts or brda no it doesn't it
0:22:07 starts in the individual level when yeah
0:22:10 that's exactly it and when we fail to
0:22:12 uphold our integrity that is when we
0:22:15 stop
0:22:17 surviving that is when we become
0:22:21 monsters and you're the one who told me
0:22:23 there's a way back from being a
0:22:26 monster so all that [ __ ] with your dad
0:22:31 and with Claire and all of that that
0:22:34 didn't we just bullshitting me to make
0:22:36 me feel better or did you actually
0:22:38 believe that when you said
0:22:40 it I still believe it then there's a way
0:22:43 to come back from being a monster no
0:22:45 matter how bad the choices we've made
0:22:48 are you're the one who told me that
0:22:50 there's a way back so I'm here on this
0:22:53 roof telling you that there's a way back
0:22:56 but not if you just
0:22:59 stop and I'm not talking about the
0:23:01 rooftop even tonight wi I'm talking
0:23:03 about all of it from the very beginning
0:23:06 I know you're a Gangrel I know you and
0:23:08 I have very different ideas on how to
0:23:11 best survive a fight I know you make
0:23:13 jokes about putting me in a Baby Bjorn
0:23:15 because I disappear that's not a joke
0:23:17 that's going to happen yeah when so we
0:23:18 can talk about that in a little bit cuz
0:23:20 that's
0:23:23 again not actually helping me survive
0:23:25 it's helping you feel better about my
0:23:27 survival not hearing
0:23:30 me it's going to
0:23:34 happen
0:23:38 why because I can't let you wander down
0:23:40 the same path I'm
0:23:44 not [ __ ] so I you talked me out
0:23:47 of wanting to greet the son that's what
0:23:50 I'm getting at you oblivious
0:23:53 tot there's a tiny Quirk of a
0:23:56 smile
0:24:02 I'm not going in the Baby Bjorn and he
0:24:04 passes The Joint
0:24:06 back when he passes it she kind of like
0:24:08 grabs him by the wrist and pulls him
0:24:10 over to hug him he hugs her back I'm
0:24:13 just [ __ ] tired man I
0:24:17 know I want it to be done I
0:24:20 know I'm tired of being the tough one I
0:24:25 know it's okay not to be a tough one
0:24:29 sometimes have you met you people you
0:24:31 need a tough one have you met you people
0:24:34 you need somebody to break
0:24:36 exting you need someone to hug and cry
0:24:40 on sometimes that's why the Baby Bjorn
0:24:43 does double duty man you can just be
0:24:45 there to hug I know you're joking but
0:24:47 also it would get me killed let's not do
0:24:49 that okay let's that's a bad I don't
0:24:52 know how some of the new stuff I can do
0:24:54 works it might not we might have to
0:24:55 experiment please don't do that just
0:24:57 going to use your legs to like kick
0:25:01 people he like hugs her really tight and
0:25:04 is quiet for a long moment like letting
0:25:05 her talk about stupid [ __ ] I might go
0:25:08 with a sling instead because that's just
0:25:10 a lot less difficult to do on the fly it
0:25:14 you know it's just a one and done just
0:25:16 put your butt right in
0:25:18 it and then we jump into the dragon's
0:25:20 mouth together and I keep you just super
0:25:22 don't want to do that see this is what
0:25:25 I'm talking about with like me if you
0:25:28 just don't get swallowed by a dragon cuz
0:25:30 it can't find you like that's a how
0:25:32 about well then you do the not finding
0:25:34 us thing right when it's about to
0:25:36 swallow us okay right when it's about is
0:25:38 a little you know what we can talk about
0:25:39 this later we can we can come up with
0:25:41 the tactics later here's the deal
0:25:43 where's the joint he passes it back over
0:25:46 she takes another hit how about you
0:25:48 finish that one I've had
0:25:52 enough just the brewha
0:25:54 bake of they cannot handle their [ __ ]
0:25:58 are you shocked kind of they're a bunch
0:26:01 of warrior poets they don't get stoned
0:26:03 often enough they're actually pretty
0:26:05 chill I know I was a little
0:26:07 surprised the brewha are good folks when
0:26:10 they're not being paid off by bad people
0:26:13 everybody needs a
0:26:15 cause
0:26:18 here's if it makes you feel any better
0:26:22 oh
0:26:26 boy I've been doing a lot of
0:26:29 reading I don't talk about it a lot cuz
0:26:31 we've been so busy recently
0:26:34 but and he looks up cuz they're on the
0:26:36 rooftop and he just points right at the
0:26:38 red
0:26:40 star I'm not surprised you're tired when
0:26:43 I'm tired too
0:26:46 but I'm going to keep walking and I know
0:26:50 you're going to keep walking and I need
0:26:52 somebody around to keep me in check cuz
0:26:53 I know I'm not in my right mind right
0:26:55 now I think you're closer than you think
0:27:03 R eventually heads
0:27:06 back dances spends time with Eden
0:27:09 looking after her and while some of the
0:27:12 others have
0:27:13 left there is at least one member of the
0:27:16 quartery that is still present inside at
0:27:19 this
0:27:20 moment
0:27:22 and while dancing to this base that rums
0:27:28 through your
0:27:30 senses you catch a glance of
0:27:34 miles
0:27:35 miles is approached by A-Dog and C
0:27:40 dog when BR is Dancing with Aiden she
0:27:43 makes sure to keep the dancing lowkey
0:27:46 it's nothing like when she's dancing
0:27:47 with Johnny or when she's dancing by
0:27:50 herself she is encouraging Eden to have
0:27:53 fun but she's trying to keep Eden safe
0:27:56 so she's trying to keep her among the
0:27:58 Mortal throng trying
0:28:00 to show her that she has support keep
0:28:04 her near the ghoul that's meant to be
0:28:06 watching her and just for herself for
0:28:10 her own mentality trying to like lose
0:28:13 herself a little bit in the comfort of
0:28:15 dancing and that beat do I see the
0:28:18 approach or do I just spot miles and
0:28:20 then the crowd kind of loses no your
0:28:22 spot miles being approached by A-Dog and
0:28:24 C dog I'm going to just look to find eye
0:28:27 contact with the ghoul that's meant to
0:28:29 be looking over Eden apart from that no
0:28:31 other move okay while you enjoy your
0:28:35 dance miles you get an up nod I have a
0:28:39 questioning look but return the
0:28:43 nod hey what's up
0:28:47 hello I lynching my wheels a while back
0:28:50 and I was wondering if you might be
0:28:51 willing know was the solid I did pay you

0:28:55 exchange of favors but I will hear you
0:28:57 you out C-Dog looks over semantics bro

0:29:07 Antics oh why don't you
0:29:10 continue we wondering if we could buy
0:29:13 some quick wheels off of you he kind of
0:29:16 runs his hand through this like bleached
0:29:19 blonde hair that he's got with like a
0:29:22 buzz cut I'm not entirely sure your
0:29:26 affiliation

0:29:33 vampire yes uh all right you're a
0:29:37 vampire um we're going to need to
0:29:39 transport somebody can't tell you

0:29:46 on your wheels if you tell me who see
0:29:48 that girl over there that kind of
0:29:49 gestured
0:29:50 Eden we saw dark Selena talking to some
0:29:53 friends about her she's
0:29:55 special and you've been in Trust Ed with
0:29:57 this car Black's been asked to grab her
0:30:02 if we grab her we're blackand

0:30:08 affiliation is with a
0:30:10 saat

0:30:14 confused you run with the sabat of
0:30:18 course bro we said we're vampires not
0:30:21 not all vampires run with a
0:30:23 sabat okay they're kind of like they try
0:30:26 to humor you
0:30:29 great all right our boy Rufio is fat
0:30:31 stacks we'll get you covered I assume
0:30:34 you mean money at that point

0:30:57 walking around with that uh uh sword
0:31:01 yeah he has a sword okay he's got like
0:31:03 10 of them miles is just so confused
0:31:06 about either just trying to help them
0:31:08 out because they'll be so easy to foil
0:31:13 or or just
0:31:16 not seeing that there is a vague gesture
0:31:20 in their Direction BR is going to herd
0:31:23 Eden towards that ghoul if she can find
0:31:26 him
0:31:27 she's not leaving Eden to be clear she's
0:31:30 just making sure the ghoul is around mhm
0:31:35 and making sure that there's something
0:31:37 to fall back on should there start to
0:31:40 need to be a reason to take action she
0:31:44 gets back into
0:31:45 eyeline she wants to keep Eden at a
0:31:48 reasonable distance from this but she
0:31:51 wants to maybe get a little bit closer
0:31:53 so that she might be able to hear miles
0:31:55 if he calls for her miles definitely
0:31:57 looks uh not threatened at all
0:32:01 um mostly
0:32:03 incredulous okay um I guess you could
0:32:07 bring rufy over here and we can discuss
0:32:10 the sale of a vehicle hold up they just
0:32:12 looked at us they lean in like real
0:32:15 close trying to like block brsh view of
0:32:18 you that goes like 100 pounds I'm going
0:32:21 punch the [ __ ] out of her and we're
0:32:22 going to take her meet us in the alley
0:32:24 we'll go over payment Rufio can't come
0:32:26 in right now he's working on some stuff
0:32:29 I will meet you in the alley he stares
0:32:31 at you with these like kind of like soft
0:32:37 blue
0:32:40 eyes and he leans in close so close that
0:32:44 like his stubble on his face almost
0:32:47 scratches against your cheek and he
0:32:50 whispers to you
0:32:54 I and then they start making a move
0:32:56 towards BR they're going to take her
0:33:00 now you have misunderstood or as you
0:33:03 Ponder
0:33:06 this they look at you and like gesture
0:33:10 as though they're like punching their
0:33:11 hands into their palms like pretty much
0:33:15 confirming right [ __ ] now
0:33:16 underestimated how stupid these men are
0:33:19 without any context all I see is them
0:33:22 turn towards me start approaching turn
0:33:25 back make punching motions well they
0:33:27 they put their backs to you okay so I
0:33:29 don't see that let make yeah it's
0:33:31 actually very clever oh yeah yeah for
0:33:33 sure uh the subur please remind me uh
0:33:36 they are they mostly shirtless if I
0:33:39 remember correctly or is that just Rufio
0:33:41 uh they actually have a lot of shirt
0:33:43 right now they they're wearing these
0:33:45 huge [ __ ] jerseys
0:33:47 right so while looking at one I'm going
0:33:51 to Pat the one I kind of remember being
0:33:54 the lesser of the two uh on the face and
0:33:58 say go as I tell him to
0:34:01 go oh are you using dominate I am using
0:34:04 Dominic oh that's right you have that
0:34:05 Elder touch dominate
0:34:07 yes so you you put your hand on his
0:34:10 cheek I'm patting him like a little
0:34:13 you're slapping him in the face yeah I
0:34:15 light slap to his face go okay I would
0:34:17 have clapped him on the shoulder but
0:34:19 they wore too many
0:34:21 shirts what is their willpower three
0:34:25 cool
0:34:29 total combined
0:34:33 thanks two successes okay and he just
0:34:37 heads up and then I look at the other
0:34:38 one I'm like so uh just before we get
0:34:40 started I really want you to tune in to
0:34:43 what I'm saying here just move right in
0:34:45 here and listen like what he starts
0:34:46 walking back to you yeah I've got a
0:34:49 really good plan for you I just need you
0:34:50 to really like listen to me just get
0:34:53 closer he listens but like he has does
0:34:57 look like a good listener that's fine
0:34:59 I'm going to De Mesmerize
0:35:02 him he also a three three got
0:35:06 it that's better that'll be six
0:35:09 successes what do you tell him all right
0:35:12 one of the two dogs
0:35:16 um all right
0:35:19 dog when we finish this conversation and
0:35:22 I will let you know you are to leave
0:35:24 this party find a vehicle far away from
0:35:26 this party party and then whenever you
0:35:29 get information from your superiors you
0:35:31 are to text this number when you are
0:35:35 alone he gives an understanding nod now
0:35:39 I'm going to mind wipe this memory from
0:35:42 him and then I will end the conversation
0:35:45 targets current will power points three
0:35:49 just
0:35:52 checking five successes May reconstruct
0:35:55 entire periods of subject
0:35:58 life
0:35:59 well that's certainly
0:36:02 enough I remove this part of the
0:36:05 conversation where I've dominated him
0:36:07 and his friend and have they've come
0:36:11 he's come up with the idea to go steal a
0:36:13 car because they'll totally not get
0:36:14 caught does he still know who Eden is I
0:36:17 don't think I'm going to be able to
0:36:18 change that information they're they're
0:36:20 going to give it back to
0:36:21 him he accepts all of the dominates he
0:36:24 says to you I'mma steal the best SUV I
0:36:28 could find and then he slips out seeing
0:36:32 that he has disappeared R approaches
0:36:36 miles kind of watching the exit and says
0:36:40 actually miles is moving towards you at
0:36:42 the same time they meet in the middle
0:36:45 sorry their kind of boss or something
0:36:48 was giving me trouble earlier but I I
0:36:50 don't know if I cost that was his b
0:36:53 their boss the one with the mul
0:36:55 Katana um
0:36:58 Rufio yeah yep
0:37:01 okay well they've been dealt with but
0:37:04 they were planning on kidnapping
0:37:07 Eden okay that must mean more people
0:37:11 than just them right well apparently
0:37:13 dark Selena was talking to some sort of
0:37:15 black hand about her oh no okay
0:37:19 um
0:37:21 so yeah we need to get her safely out of
0:37:24 here I mean BR kind of like moves the
0:37:28 conversation over if miles will follow
0:37:31 her towards Eden yeah we we'll signal
0:37:35 the ghoul and we'll go up towards the
0:37:37 VIP lounge because we have less access
0:37:39 less people to access up there Eden
0:37:42 jumps out of the throng of people and
0:37:45 starts dancing with
0:37:46 Miles I mean okay this is about as safe
0:37:49 as going to be anyway so that's fine as
0:37:52 long as we both keep an eye on her it's
0:37:53 okay BR like partially it becomes clear
0:37:57 that he just doesn't think that anybody
0:37:58 else could take her away from here and
0:38:00 also keep her safe br's mind just kind
0:38:03 of
0:38:04 reboots
0:38:06 there's she sees Eden and like the joy
0:38:10 that she's able to inject in this awful
0:38:13 situation and for everything that BR is
0:38:15 feeling she can't really deny Eden that
0:38:19 urge it's basically the same urch that
0:38:21 she has so she sees Eden choose to dance
0:38:24 with
0:38:25 Miles and and yeah just it is
0:38:29 effectively like a reboot and a kind of
0:38:32 strangled smile comes out she doesn't
0:38:35 mean it it's just it's rough and she
0:38:38 looks at Miles and sees that he's
0:38:39 accepting the situation he gives her a
0:38:41 nod and just like this this is what we
0:38:43 do let's go come on keep moving
0:38:49 forward going tries to like think of a
0:38:53 good response but she kind of just
0:38:55 giggles
0:38:57 she doesn't really know what to do with
0:38:59 this information other than to like take
0:39:01 a step towards miles and like without
0:39:05 words asked to join in the dance he
0:39:07 makes room and so it'll be
0:39:09 Trinity she's still there's still the
0:39:12 trace of that Panic that's like
0:39:14 threatening to come up but this is seems
0:39:17 as good a solution as any when will at
0:39:20 some point in all this she will kind of
0:39:23 not looking for them she will just kind
0:39:25 of like make a line for the bathroom as
0:39:27 you pass through you actually catch a
0:39:29 glimpse of Eden engaging in the pul
0:39:32 Fiction dance towards Bria and Miles I
0:39:37 am able to what the hell I am able to do
0:39:39 that I am unsure if BR is able
0:39:43 to respond she's kind of a aware of
0:39:47 what's going on but she's not looking to
0:39:49 interact at the moment she is looking to
0:39:51 clean her [ __ ] up yeah you're not going
0:39:54 to get pulled from your objective Brit
0:39:57 is a little busy uh giggling and wonder
0:40:01 at seeing miles open up like this and
0:40:03 take care of Eden and it's definitely
0:40:05 cheering her up it's contributing to the
0:40:07 silliness herself trying to join in on
0:40:10 that Spirit trying to learn a little bit
0:40:12 from The Ventrue one his
0:40:15 audacity miles it's actually kind of
0:40:18 having a good time now that we de with
0:40:20 some peons and I was able to let out
0:40:22 some steam yeah this is I mean I feel
0:40:24 like that was part
0:40:25 of
0:40:27 time uh there is one thing that however
0:40:29 that does catch your attention as the
0:40:31 three of you are having this frankly
0:40:34 kind of a happy little moment in the eye
0:40:37 of a storm you see that from the VIP
0:40:41 room looking down over the mass of
0:40:45 Mortals and the group of you your eyes
0:40:50 meet Roman pen dragons who is just
0:40:55 watching the three of
0:41:01 few I kind of position a little bit away
0:41:04 I was like okay don't look up a pen
0:41:06 Dragon staring directly at
0:41:09 us I pay no attention to the man behind
0:41:11 the curtain what happens to Brit's face
0:41:14 because I we we have to describe what
0:41:16 just happened I don't know what is that
0:41:19 expression can you help
0:41:21 [Laughter]
0:41:25 Blan so I don't know you had a phone
0:41:27 call or not I am not entirely sure up to
0:41:29 date what's going on there but um I'm
0:41:32 not explaining this right now and she
0:41:34 kind of jerks her head towards Eden and
0:41:37 BR is no longer after having blanched uh
0:41:42 nearly able I mean she's trying to keep
0:41:45 her back to the direction that you said
0:41:47 but the silliness is not great it's not
0:41:50 a great cover for silliness I don't know
0:41:53 he he's very intense looking at us right
0:41:56 right now and um so I figured you should
0:41:58 know before you know you catch his eyes
0:42:01 like I did and fr smack Smiles in the
0:42:08 chess I'm just giving you
0:42:13 information do you need help do you want
0:42:16 to just stay here but he is just boring
0:42:19 a hole into the back of my head
0:42:21 currently I can feel it now I can't stop
0:42:24 so what does it matter
0:42:26 I mean based on reaction it definitely
0:42:28 matters but um I mean yeah of course it
0:42:31 matters I just do you want to do
0:42:33 something or not that's what I'm saying
0:42:35 miles I don't I don't know how to
0:42:37 process everything that happened tonight
0:42:39 let
0:42:40 alone
0:42:42 everything and I don't know if he's
0:42:45 looking at you because you just made the
0:42:47 deal on the rooftop I don't know if he's
0:42:48 looking at me and honestly I don't know
0:42:51 if it has anything to do with what we
0:42:52 just learned I don't know either either
0:42:54 and sometimes processing is overrated I
0:42:56 am just giving you information you can
0:42:58 choose to do something with that or not
0:43:00 like in the worst way possible miles
0:43:03 what BR knows she's like according to
0:43:05 mile standards wrong so she just kind of
0:43:08 throws her hands
0:43:09 up yes dancing hands
0:43:13 up she doesn't feel wrong to clarify she
0:43:15 knows she's wrong according to my
0:43:18 standards which we all know is actually
0:43:21 wrong and like also understanding that's
0:43:25 part of the point decide what you want
0:43:27 to do with the information or not but
0:43:29 we're here we're now this is you're
0:43:31 going to see him sooner or later send
0:43:34 your intense
0:43:35 gaze can we like what's the trajectory
0:43:39 can we like move out of line of sight or
0:43:41 he's in the VIP lounge uh that would be
0:43:44 no oh my God okay
0:43:46 um the only other thing I could do is we
0:43:49 could be more of a
0:43:51 spectacle what do you
0:43:53 mean we can we can turn this dance up a
0:43:56 little bit here and see if we can't get
0:43:58 more people watching us then it won't be
0:43:59 any
0:44:00 different I'm a little worried about
0:44:02 Eden for that we're not letting you she
0:44:04 kind of gives a look I know how to dance
0:44:07 no no you're you're doing really well
0:44:08 don't worry I can help thanks no problem
0:44:13 it's nothing to do about you dancing I
0:44:15 just want to make sure you're safe am I
0:44:17 not
0:44:18 safe you're safe with us just kind of
0:44:21 like kind of appreciates miles's
0:44:24 confidence about that come on kiddo
0:44:26 we'll show them how it's done you too I
0:44:30 BR looks very much like she's like about
0:44:34 to kind of continue flinching continue
0:44:38 disagreeing but she runs through the
0:44:41 math in her head and actually kind of
0:44:45 like even though she was clearly
0:44:48 disagreeing with miles before swallows
0:44:50 it down and looks to him gives a bit of
0:44:54 a nod showing that he's actually kind of
0:44:58 still managing to be the lifeline in the
0:45:00 situation that as embarrassed and unsure
0:45:03 as she is and how little she can even
0:45:07 mull over her own feelings and come to
0:45:09 her own conclusion that she's going to
0:45:11 take his guidance in this and follow his
0:45:13 decision make this more of a spectacle
0:45:16 like he said turn it up draw the crowd
0:45:20 play
0:45:21 along BR looks to Miles you think you
0:45:25 can get the DJ to play something better
0:45:28 I mean that shouldn't be
0:45:29 hard miles says with disdain about the
0:45:32 song Choices all right then let's go
0:45:36 turn it
0:45:37 up all right I'll be right back and I
0:45:42 make my way to the front where the DJ
0:45:44 with the
0:45:46 flashlights the DJ is bobbing his head
0:45:49 and these powerful flashlights that are
0:45:53 strapped to the sides of his head blind
0:45:56 you as he turn your direction he's like
0:45:59 yo yes I would very much like for you to
0:46:03 put the song on for me what kind of song
0:46:06 you want Grandpa you want you want fun
0:46:08 like Thriller you want what you want
0:46:12 like you look like you're like Will
0:46:14 Smith you want some Will Smith bro
0:46:16 you're an 80s boy P busting out the King
0:46:19 of Pop right now is so yeah yeah sure
0:46:23 well you bad bro always
0:46:26 why don't you put on Thriller I have
0:46:28 some guests and it sounds like a fun
0:46:30 time so yeah yeah which you like some
0:46:34 money with that too uh yeah he he can
0:46:36 barely hear
0:46:38 you I get really close with and I pull
0:46:41 like like $1,000 out I don't
0:46:44 know pocket money walking around mil
0:46:47 spending $1,000 would be like I'm next
0:46:49 on the playlist right [ __ ] is so
0:46:51 I get real close like Thriller Michael
0:46:54 Jackson yeah
0:46:57 yes yeah why was that a question it was
0:47:02 kind of my idea but all right now it's
0:47:04 my idea thank
0:47:06 you okay he got him he agrees excepts
0:47:11 [Laughter]
0:47:13 $1,000 I get down once the music starts
0:47:17 to transition um theoretically the DJ
0:47:20 probably only Waits a little while
0:47:23 there's a scratch on the board
0:47:27 and some dramatic ass Michael Jackson
0:47:31 music starts to
0:47:35 play miles's idea causes BR to crack a
0:47:39 smile that's right and she tries to keep
0:47:44 miles's energy and his pump and
0:47:48 Circumstance in mind audacity is fine no
0:47:52 I'm going to keep on putting variations
0:47:53 on it than you okay
0:47:58 and she decides to launch herself into
0:48:01 the dancing with Flare both to take her
0:48:03 mind off of the situation take her mind
0:48:06 off of what to do about Roman pen Dragon
0:48:09 to try to keep Eden spirits up to
0:48:11 welcome miles back in she tries to catch
0:48:14 eyes with wind from across the room pull
0:48:17 her back in if she's visible wi is
0:48:20 probably just coming out of the bathroom
0:48:23 she notices miles having a moment with
0:48:25 the D J and senses some [ __ ] maybe
0:48:29 about so she kind of looks to find any
0:48:32 one of the Coterie she can find eyes fall
0:48:34 on Brea eyebrow quirks up like what we
0:48:38 doing well baa is looking to see who
0:48:42 else she can pull she's looking for COD
0:48:44 she's looking for friends regardless she
0:48:47 is just as a toror as a dancer as
0:48:51 someone who is in above her head but can
0:48:56 connect to the music to the things
0:48:58 around her that can give her beauty give
0:49:01 her Joy she's almost choosing to fall
0:49:05 into the toror curse in this moment to
0:49:08 try to Revel in what she
0:49:11 is and not think too much about what she
0:49:15 is at the same time she can't do it she
0:49:17 can't fit it all in her mind there's too
0:49:19 much and this seems like the path
0:49:23 forward miles matches her for flare
0:49:25 while also helping Eden out where she
0:49:28 needs it occasionally I just don't think
0:49:30 she has quite the same experience Eden
0:49:33 is pretty much like what is this song
0:49:35 she has no idea teach me the old ways so
0:49:38 I you know I I boost her performance
0:49:41 essentially by occasionally like a
0:49:43 little bit of guidance here and there
0:49:45 little subtle stuff while at the same
0:49:48 time coming back and matching flare for
0:49:49 flare with uh Bria that's difficult to
0:49:52 do are you getting
0:49:54 competitive sometimes it's a little bit
0:49:56 harder when I'm trying to do two things
0:49:57 at the same time de performance you got
0:49:59 to be competitive buddy dance battle
0:50:02 bro yes
0:50:05 PVP I'm spending blood
0:50:11 then on what
0:50:14 dexterity miles can pump his [ __ ] to
0:50:18 seven not a
0:50:22 problem remember you do add your
0:50:24 Celerity rating to this Ro yeah that's
0:50:26 my biggest
0:50:27 issue hence I was like I'm going to need
0:50:30 that I like this started as a joke and
0:50:32 now you're like I'm going to spend
0:50:33 [ __ ] like eight blood [ __ ]
0:50:37 you s dexterity performance Rebecca you
0:50:41 need help with that dice pool she
0:50:43 doesn't have big I don't know that I
0:50:44 should spend willpower on this I did not
0:50:47 oh that's not what you meant
0:50:51 [Music]
0:50:54 okay so many ones oh no remember specks
0:50:58 guys yep uh my Speck in performance is
0:51:00 singing It's not relevant for the moment
0:51:02 your dexterity spec will probably
0:51:03 comeing a graceful will yeah that'll do
0:51:05 it there's a clap miles can use big
0:51:09 hands there's a clap as one of the steps
0:51:12 I think I'm okay on my deck back did you
0:51:15 actually pump your decks up yeah to what
0:51:18 uh eight
0:51:20 God so you just pumped it extra for the
0:51:22 round pretty much oh God successes uh I
0:51:27 got 10
0:51:28 successes wow miles is a child of the
0:51:32 80s as though you have awakened a
0:51:36 sleeping
0:51:38 Dragon you find that miles is an
0:51:43 impeccable
0:51:45 dancer and
0:51:47 then Eden kind of starts to fade away
0:51:51 and the crowd starts to fade away and
0:51:54 all you see is Miles dancing oh God damn
0:51:59 it and you begin to stop dancing I need
0:52:04 a self-control check thank you at
0:52:07 difficulty
0:52:09 9 your willow that is a
0:52:13 botch oh
0:52:15 God I I'm not making this [ __ ] up I see
0:52:19 it that's two1 sure is [ __ ] it miles you
0:52:22 come to realize something has gone
0:52:23 terribly wrong
0:52:26 in your perfect plan you used too much
0:52:29 blood augmented yourself too much and
0:52:32 now the toror is L was two di you you
0:52:36 bumped your dexterity to to H you said
0:52:40 what's your
0:52:41 Celerity I have five Celerity I put you
0:52:44 in a DEX pen same Dex pool okay we're
0:52:47 not arguing this you [ __ ] up fix it I
0:52:50 did not she didn't do it good enough can
0:52:54 can I roll to notice this is happening
0:52:56 this is all happening right in front of
0:52:58 you okay so when recognizing that brida
0:53:02 has become hypnotized by miles's sick
0:53:06 moves and I mean it's Flawless wi kind
0:53:09 of hooks her finger inside her own mouth
0:53:12 like she's a fish being drawn in by
0:53:13 bro's hook and like stops and does like
0:53:16 gills like she's just dancing over to
0:53:19 her trying to be surreptitious about the
0:53:21 whole thing that's not surreptitious but
0:53:22 go for you're doing the fishing move in
0:53:25 the middle of Thriller to be like no I
0:53:26 don't notice this wind subtly approaches
0:53:30 FR if someone has noticed you they're
0:53:33 not looking no um and she will kind of
0:53:36 like gently take Bri's hands and kind of
0:53:40 like gently move them back and forth
0:53:42 like they're just dancing further away
0:53:45 from the crowd I think if you just take
0:53:47 her out of sight and like take my
0:53:50 mesmerizing dance performance just get
0:53:51 her sight line a little out of it you
0:53:53 should be okay should be that's the goal
0:53:54 that's the goal I don't want to do twirl
0:53:57 this is about you um miles this is your
0:54:01 moment this is my
0:54:04 moment once way to solve the problem of
0:54:06 who's looking at who um along the way
0:54:09 she will take Eden's hand and they will
0:54:12 they will dance with brda a little bit
0:54:14 further away and they will just kind of
0:54:17 middle school girl dance by the time BR
0:54:22 comes out of it there's lots of people
0:54:26 at this point
0:54:27 clapping and impressed by the groups
0:54:32 dancing of course miles is very much
0:54:35 standout I give them a proper bow big
0:54:38 dude is clapping recognized him to be
