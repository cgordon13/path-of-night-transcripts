0:00:32 [Music]
0:00:36 foreign
0:00:41 set out on their mission to destroy Vito
0:00:43 santosa they successfully made it past
0:00:46 chanchi defenses but it barely
0:00:48 maintained her Humanity after killing an
0:00:49 alkaline the others swept through
0:00:51 killing many tremir the group split
0:00:54 Brita discovered more and more signs of
0:00:56 infestation of this institute as well as
0:00:58 a fleeingReissReiss offered a
0:01:00 bargainder to try to keep Vito alive
0:01:02 parent arrived back to brother changed
0:01:05 as she encountered the Sentosa Peru
0:01:07 echoed Vita meanwhile at the prince's
0:01:10 office Johnny met up with Miles Wynn and
0:01:12 Ira and Johnny revealed that he had an
0:01:14 unconscious werewolf in the trunk of his
0:01:16 car
0:01:16 the group received a phone call
0:01:19 [Music]
0:01:27 miles
0:01:28 your phone rings miles here miles this
0:01:32 isReiss how can I help you Rhys hang up
0:01:35 I think we have an unusual opportunity
0:01:38 where in which you and I might help each
0:01:40 other all right I'm listening as a show
0:01:44 of good faith the premier supported your
0:01:45 practices claim I like to think that
0:01:47 this is a step in the right direction
0:01:50 for us
0:01:51 but
0:01:53 I'm afraid matters have grown
0:01:54 complicated
0:01:56 all right how complicated
0:01:58 do you know where Britta is
0:02:01 last time I checked I thought she might
0:02:03 be in Hartford
0:02:05 well she's much closer than that
0:02:08 and
0:02:10 a mutual enemy
0:02:13 as currently a threat to her
0:02:16 all right what do you want me to do here
0:02:18 I believe she's doing well enough for
0:02:20 now okay but she will need help
0:02:24 and I am
0:02:25 willing
0:02:27 to permit access to the location she is
0:02:30 for some reason found herself in so that
0:02:32 you might help her
0:02:34 but there is something I need in
0:02:36 exchange the senior Chantry
0:02:39 to call that mine might be something of
0:02:41 a stretch tonight
0:02:43 now when you first change video zantosa
0:02:48 the fragments of the book of Nod that
0:02:50 were in his possession
0:02:51 where are they
0:02:53 hold on I have about I was about to
0:02:56 cover over the phone but I'm like wait
0:02:57 he's super hearing anyways I'm sure you
0:03:00 also just put on hold if you want
0:03:02 um
0:03:03 I'll call you back quick hold please I I
0:03:08 mute and I mute the phone actually
0:03:10 do
0:03:11 do we have any paperwork we found with
0:03:13 veto this
0:03:16Reiss is looking for it I'm sorry dude I
0:03:19 have a werewolf unconscious in the back
0:03:21 of my car and you're on the phone with
0:03:24Reiss talking about some [ __ ]
0:03:26 paperwork uh Brita is in the Chantry
0:03:31 from the minute Miles said hello Rhys
0:03:35 IRA has gone very still
0:03:39 and is radiating snitch energy that's
0:03:42 just very clue like this is the thing
0:03:45 that I'm extremely interested in and I
0:03:46 am trying very hard and failing to
0:03:48 pretend that I'm not that interested in
0:03:49 what's going on right now wait soReiss
0:03:51 has Brita no she's in there I thought
0:03:56 she was with
0:03:57 Pendragon who the [ __ ] is watching her I
0:04:00 I thought it was Neil it could be a
0:04:03 thing but he wants whatever paperwork we
0:04:06 found with veto okay it was Neil and I
0:04:10 had it Neil took it
0:04:13 I don't think any of us got it back
0:04:16 if if we got any of the stuff back that
0:04:20 the premier seized like when someone
0:04:23 when a bus happened to like steer in
0:04:26 front of the cop car and crash the car
0:04:28 that had his Khalif in it didn't we fax
0:04:30 that to the just the car's office I'm I
0:04:34 I don't personally remember any
0:04:36 paperwork I have no idea how a fax works
0:04:40 and uh this is getting a little bit
0:04:43 frustrating yeah
0:04:45 um what kind of paperwork doesReiss
0:04:47 want Johnny can I get an intelligence
0:04:50 about Laurel well he didn't say not out
0:04:52 loud he did not
0:04:55 two successes with two successes uh you
0:04:59 recall that Neil had gotten a hold of
0:05:03 what looked like Sabbat paraphernalia
0:05:05 some like
0:05:06 documents of some sort pertaining to the
0:05:09 book of Nod and you remember that they
0:05:11 went to go make copies of it but you
0:05:13 don't quite recall what happened after
0:05:15 that now I'm getting a little bit
0:05:16 frustrated with talking about all this
0:05:17 paperwork because I do remember that
0:05:20 Neil happened to snatch up some Arcane
0:05:24 Sabbat let's say uh tomes well I
0:05:27 wouldn't call that paperwork are we
0:05:30 talking about all that like ritual
0:05:32 components that he grabbed I don't know
0:05:34 he's just looking for it I haven't asked
0:05:36 him there was paper paperwork that Neil
0:05:38 and I looked through it was I could it
0:05:41 was in a language I couldn't read it was
0:05:43 old old yeah because this isn't just
0:05:45 paperwork this is we're talking about
0:05:46 like Sabbat dark magic rituals okay so
0:05:49 the answer is we don't know where any of
0:05:50 it is right now without Neil present we
0:05:53 have no idea what's happening
0:05:55 and he's gone AWOL apparently not with
0:05:58 Brita because he's not in the Chantry
0:06:00 right now he could be hiding I kind of
0:06:03 did see it she kneel for a second
0:06:06 um what yeah
0:06:09 she was
0:06:12 channeling through the body of dashwood
0:06:14 where the [ __ ] is dashwood uh currently
0:06:17 in Ramirez's trunk how many people do
0:06:20 you have in trunks tonight Johnny look
0:06:22 it's been a weird night all right don't
0:06:23 get on my ass about this let's refocus
0:06:25 here so we don't have anything well I
0:06:28 mean we have dashwood presumably with
0:06:30 Neil's Consciousness inside second up
0:06:34 Ira I see you over there yes sir Grace
0:06:36 can you get us into the Chantry into the
0:06:39 Chantry yes yeah I don't see why not
0:06:41 although if the Regent was allowing you
0:06:43 access to the Chantry it was more of a
0:06:45 bargain yeah he likes to do that [ __ ]
0:06:48 yes I don't know if you grasped what
0:06:52 he's bargaining with there
0:06:54 no you're not allowed in the Chantry so
0:06:58 if he's allowing you access
0:07:01 either he doesn't give a [ __ ] about that
0:07:03 Chantry anymore or
0:07:06 things have gone so bad that he's
0:07:09 desperate or I guess third he's trying
0:07:11 to get you over a barrel probably I was
0:07:14 gonna say killed but
0:07:16 possibly all three but that sounds like
0:07:19Reiss you need somebody who knows their
0:07:21 way I mean I haven't been to
0:07:24 this one but you need somebody who knows
0:07:27 their way around Chantry
0:07:29 I'm happy to provide at least a little
0:07:32 bit of guidance great what do you charge
0:07:34 for it
0:07:36 would you believe me if I just said I'm
0:07:37 happy to be here no nobody's happy to be
0:07:40 in New Haven yeah I don't believe that
0:07:42 either I will accept it for now we are
0:07:44 on a time frame yeah because Brita is
0:07:47 involved hold please I unmute the phone
0:07:50 race miles sorry we're trying to figure
0:07:53 out what book that was
0:07:55 I the book of Nod miles
0:07:59 I yeah it's been a while
0:08:01 um that's the name of the book
0:08:05 great we don't have it who has it uh
0:08:08 Neil has it
0:08:10 isn't he one of you he's not here right
0:08:12 now last time we knew he was with Brita
0:08:14 he is not with Brito
0:08:17 what is happening over there
0:08:19 hmm
0:08:21 I don't know that I could easily explain
0:08:23 it in a way that you would understand
0:08:26 is there somebody that of the people you
0:08:29 know I know that would easily understand
0:08:30 it I know of no one who can speak slowly
0:08:33 enough
0:08:33 but I'll try sounds good
0:08:36 Vito zantosa has been sought now for
0:08:39 some time
0:08:40 specifically because of his connection
0:08:41 to whatever it is that Lies Beneath the
0:08:45 house
0:08:46 What Lies Beneath the house as part of a
0:08:49 much greater whole
0:08:51 he is the means by which we could tap
0:08:54 into it discern the true name of the
0:08:57 ancient
0:08:58 and accomplish
0:09:00 well accomplish important things all
0:09:03 right unfortunately
0:09:06 the methods by which we have kept veto
0:09:09 detained have been
0:09:12 less successful than we had hoped
0:09:16 the century is no more
0:09:20 and what remains of it
0:09:22 brother wanders through alone
0:09:25 now
0:09:26 I believe that whatever it is that is
0:09:29 happening on a global scale has agitated
0:09:32 this thing like a cousin calling out to
0:09:36 a cousin
0:09:37 brother to brother
0:09:40 and that bond has caused something
0:09:44 within veto to awaken
0:09:47 we need to know
0:09:49 what it was that veto was protecting
0:09:52 everything we can about his research and
0:09:54 the nature of his relationship with them
0:09:57 the thing beneath the house
0:10:00 if I can find out what that is
0:10:03 perhaps we can prevent
0:10:06 well what seems to be the next step in
0:10:09 all of this
0:10:10 all right well if you let us in there I
0:10:14 will get Neil to give you the pages that
0:10:17 we do have as soon as we get locate them
0:10:20 I can make this arrangement
0:10:22 however
0:10:24 it is imperative the video zentos has
0:10:27 kept alive
0:10:29 we'll do our best I'd rather leave her
0:10:32 there alone
0:10:34 than risk him
0:10:36 you cannot grasp the importance of this
0:10:38 you know she's just as likely to kill
0:10:40 him on her own too
0:10:42 you clearly don't understand what I've
0:10:44 just explained to you not entirely but I
0:10:46 don't feel like you know the entirety
0:10:48 rate is going to die unless you help her
0:10:49 and I'm not going to let you help her
0:10:51 unless you promise me your word of
0:10:53 honors are then true as a member of the
0:10:56 clan of Kings levito's existence will be
0:10:59 preserved
0:11:00 because all of Kindred kind May one
0:11:02 night depend on it do you understand
0:11:06 I do I've also been working on that and
0:11:09 do I have your word your grace
0:11:15 I will keep him alive
0:11:17 thank you
0:11:19 when you arrive to Yale University
0:11:22 I will have
0:11:23 what remains
0:11:25 escort you to the Chantry right I take
0:11:29 it you won't be there
0:11:31 I'm there now
0:11:33 see you then
0:11:35 he hangs up win kind of like as soon as
0:11:38 miles hangs up
0:11:39 puts up her hand
0:11:41 don't
0:11:42 tell me
0:11:44 the specifics
0:11:46 of what you promised because if I don't
0:11:49 know them it doesn't matter if I break
0:11:51 them and it's all on me
0:11:54 and I will do what we need to do
0:11:59 and then you blood hunt me afterwards
0:12:01 we'll figure it out Grace is desperate
0:12:03 he didn't try to force me to do anything
0:12:05 particular there so Iris phone rings do
0:12:08 I recognize the number you do
0:12:10 in just a second
0:12:12 let me open my phone Apprentice
0:12:15 region
0:12:17 escort his grace and his companions to
0:12:20 the Chantry ensure that he's successful
0:12:22 in his mission and also ensure that the
0:12:26 specimen veto zentosa is preserved
0:12:29 in the event that they should jeopardize
0:12:32 Vito's existence
0:12:34 kill them
0:12:36 he hangs up
0:12:39 people don't say goodbye around here do
0:12:41 they
0:12:42 don't tell me what he said to you either
0:12:44 looks like he was about to say something
0:12:46 and then just shrugs and goes you can
0:12:50 tell the rest of us later whatever you
0:12:51 want Sheriff
0:12:53 I want to get my girl out of there and I
0:12:56 want whatever's putting her in danger to
0:12:59 die
0:13:00 and if that's the region that more than
0:13:02 suits me you coming with us or do you
0:13:05 have other orders no
0:13:07 RegentReiss doesn't really want to go
0:13:10 there on his own he has asked me to
0:13:13 escort you there unsurprising
0:13:15 so the San Chantry seems to have his
0:13:17 amezi infestation it's a meatsi
0:13:20 infestation like a hell Health sort of
0:13:22 yeah that's what I got the gist of and
0:13:24 britta's in it correct what is what's
0:13:27 the plan gear up we'll attach a phone
0:13:30 number and drop the werewolf off of the
0:13:32 edge of the force and head to the
0:13:33 Chantry we just don't have time for this
0:13:35 I don't know that that's a good idea
0:13:37 either though what do you want to leave
0:13:39 it here it's a loop line yes and it's
0:13:43 alive yes
0:13:46 what if okay this is a it was also
0:13:49 frenzying in the middle of downtown New
0:13:53 Haven I've never heard about a Lupine
0:13:55 doing that unless it was brought there
0:13:58 by the Sabbat and I didn't see any hint
0:14:00 that this about was there
0:14:02 William shawl can I ask a question sure
0:14:05 you just did why is it alive
0:14:08 that's also a great question because I
0:14:11 put several silver bullets into its
0:14:13 skull so I'd love I'd love for someone
0:14:15 to tell me why it's still alive I mean
0:14:17 why didn't you kill it off afterwards
0:14:18 before you put it in the truck is the
0:14:19 question I think unless if I'm hearing
0:14:22 you right he tried
0:14:27 I was going to drain it of all its blood
0:14:29 but I promised someone I wouldn't but as
0:14:32 far as I know putting several bullets in
0:14:34 a skull and especially with the Lupine
0:14:36 if they're silver ought to have killed
0:14:38 it in the first place are we crushed for
0:14:40 time yes then let's go we'll I don't
0:14:44 know like werewolves building cells at
0:14:47 the Chantry I don't want to bring a
0:14:49 Lupine into a zamizi infested Chantry
0:14:52 thanks very much what does it meets the
0:14:53 infested part does throw a wrench in
0:14:55 that yeah yeah it [ __ ] does take him
0:14:57 to my shack I don't give a [ __ ] well
0:14:59 that's also something to invested it's
0:15:01 fair
0:15:02 um
0:15:03 all right I can track Brita someone
0:15:06 Drive the thing to Wallingford and then
0:15:08 meet us at the Chantry when they can we
0:15:10 can just if time is pressed let's just
0:15:12 find there if he's out
0:15:15 he's out it's it's what little what is
0:15:19 the little freaking Mountain here where
0:15:21 the where did the woods over here if
0:15:24 you're talking about sleeping giant
0:15:26 sleeping giant right we'll just drop
0:15:28 them off at the edge of sleeping giant
0:15:30 or you can bind him tape him put some
0:15:33 silver in his mouth or whatever the hell
0:15:35 you got and just throw him in a lock
0:15:37 basement somewhere so we can deal with
0:15:39 the problem you think we have a silver
0:15:41 we're just laying around for that matter
0:15:43 just binding him I'm not sure you've
0:15:45 ever seen a what a blue point like a
0:15:49 wall or a girder or something on the top
0:15:51 of the car enough we are dropping him
0:15:53 off and then going to the Chantry fine
0:15:55 let's go thank you you're the prince
0:15:56 hello in the center show drop them off
0:15:59 where exactly sleeping giant yes if
0:16:01 we're pressed for time taking a a
0:16:03 leisurely right onto the mountain isn't
0:16:05 exactly the best idea we're going are we
0:16:09 taking the car with the Lupine in it
0:16:11 that also feels like a terrible plan
0:16:12 kick him into the bay
0:16:14 that'll work look it this werewolf is my
0:16:17 problem I'll deal with it I'll meet you
0:16:19 all at the same time you brought him
0:16:21 here he is our problem now I don't think
0:16:24 that's the case win I don't give a [ __ ]
0:16:26 what you think it's in our city now it's
0:16:28 been it was in the city before I brought
0:16:31 it here Johnny said he's gonna drop it
0:16:32 off then try are we talking and walking
0:16:35 what are we doing here let's go right
0:16:37 you got more than a two-seater yes we
0:16:40 have more than a two-seater is it the
0:16:41 Hummer or is it the SUV we're probably
0:16:43 just take an SUV and you said this the
0:16:45 Chantry is is infested like hell house
0:16:47 was yes all right I'll pick a few things
0:16:49 up on the way there great we'll meet you
0:16:51 there leave mine one of my numbers with
0:16:54 him the werewolf we need to talk
0:16:59 Johnny kind of looks upset with that
0:17:01 idea but he kind of rolls his eyes like
0:17:04 he doesn't have a better one nods and
0:17:06 heads out wind hasn't stopped walk
0:17:08 moving towards the garage at this point
0:17:09 Ira do you need anything no Freight it's
0:17:13 rock and roll and with that the group of
0:17:15 you start to head out as you do miles
0:17:17 you notice that some of the displaced
0:17:21 princes
0:17:22 a kind of middling around chatting with
0:17:25 each other making small talk but
0:17:29 wherever they congregate it always seems
0:17:31 to be as close to your office as
0:17:34 reasonably possible and then you're off
0:17:36 God damn it Neil what if I may get an
0:17:40 air horn
0:17:45 but a role initiative I'll spend for two
0:17:48 rounds of Celerity sounds good
0:17:51 19. Peron will be acting on a 15 Vito
0:17:55 zantosa acts at the end of each round
0:17:57 how close did glass break near me when
0:18:01 you turn quickly to see the source of
0:18:04 the glass breaking you see that Davido
0:18:06 zentos hold his hand up to the glass
0:18:08 very gently tapped it with a finger and
0:18:11 shattered the reinforced glass how close
0:18:15 is Peru Peru is merely steps away then
0:18:19 he is getting shot because I'm afraid
0:18:21 that Majesty won't work on him
0:18:23 so Bretta seeing Peru and so close is
0:18:27 going to aim for a head shot it's
0:18:30 difficult at this range but she doesn't
0:18:32 think she can't afford to let him get a
0:18:34 grapple on her wwjd what would Johnny do
0:18:38 uh go ahead and give me an attack roll
0:18:40 your difficulty is seven
0:18:44 does either spec Grace full or
0:18:47 Sharpshooter count Sharpshooter that is
0:18:49 for successes three successes will
0:18:52 carryover and you'll enjoy plus three
0:18:54 dice of damage for headshot
0:18:58 five damage with a deafening staccato
0:19:02 you open up multiple rounds hit him
0:19:06 squarely in the head and despite the
0:19:09 surface damage it doesn't seem that he's
0:19:12 actually impeded Britta cries out his
0:19:15 name just one more time just hoping that
0:19:18 maybe shooting him could knock him out
0:19:19 of it but it that hope is quickly
0:19:22 disproven
0:19:25 he fails The Willpower roll to resist
0:19:28 foreign
0:19:31 he reaches towards you his in his eyes
0:19:34 you can see he's desperate and pleading
0:19:37 but he isn't in control of himself but
0:19:40 there is something in his eyes that
0:19:42 would lead me to believe he is in there
0:19:44 he is fighting it but not successfully
0:19:47 passenger in a hijacked car yeah a meaty
0:19:51 hand reaches out in an attempt to
0:19:52 Grapple you do you wish to attempt to
0:19:54 dodge yes okay uh sacrifice for Solarity
0:19:57 action and rolled X Plus Dodge or
0:19:59 dexplus Athletics
0:20:02 a lot of ones
0:20:04 but still three successes
0:20:06 two is four
0:20:09 he reaches out and grabs you lifting you
0:20:12 into the air with ease Vito speaks
0:20:17 look at you
0:20:20 flesh so pure
0:20:22 sweet
0:20:24 ever since that night I found you I knew
0:20:28 that we would be together
0:20:30 it is the gift
0:20:32 of my father
0:20:34 to erase all that divides us
0:20:38 and unite our species
0:20:41 to make us one do you understand parent
0:20:44 please let me go veto I don't know what
0:20:47 you're what you mean I I don't Vito
0:20:50 walks towards you his hands up sort of
0:20:53 the way that a surgeon might after their
0:20:57 hands have been washed and they're ready
0:20:58 to perform surgery seeing that Bretta if
0:21:01 she's able to within the time constraint
0:21:04 activate Majesty you are unable to do so
0:21:07 until next round so uh you are the only
0:21:11 one with Solarity actions which actions
0:21:14 are limited to me since I am in grapple
0:21:16 in order to take physical actions such
0:21:18 as moving away or attacking someone you
0:21:21 must first either Escape break or
0:21:24 reverse the grapple I would like to use
0:21:26 my last Clarity action to try to slip
0:21:29 out of the grip roll it dexterity plus
0:21:31 brawl difficulty six and if I have no
0:21:34 bra you're no penalty for uh talents I
0:21:37 will use the willpower
0:21:40 six successes including the willpower
0:21:43 six successes defeats is three and
0:21:46 Lively you slip free of his grasp and
0:21:48 drop to your heels next round are you
0:21:51 spending the same amount of Solarity for
0:21:53 extractions I will spend three blood
0:21:56 four or three rounds of Celerity not
0:21:58 four I want to keep that one extra dice
0:22:00 seeing the game you're playing video
0:22:02 zentos will spend for celebrity but it
0:22:04 drops down to her heels and she feels
0:22:07 that incoming slowness of the world that
0:22:10 Solarity brings but she sees that veto
0:22:12 isn't slowing down so having seen a
0:22:16 brief glimpse of Peru and hoping against
0:22:19 hope that she might not have to kill him
0:22:21 she
0:22:22 spends another willpower to activate her
0:22:26 majesty and as she does the awful things
0:22:29 Vito says about her contribute more to
0:22:31 her power in the situation hopefully
0:22:34 Baron staggers towards you fighting
0:22:37 desperately to free himself a veto but
0:22:39 for whatever reason this potent Elder
0:22:42 cannot
0:22:44 what is the difficulty of resisting your
0:22:46 majesty a subject must make a courage
0:22:48 role difficulty equal to the vampire's
0:22:51 Charisma plus intimidation to a maximum
0:22:53 of 10. what is your charisma plus
0:22:55 intimidation eight perun fails to resist
0:22:58 your majesty and is unable to spend will
0:23:01 power at all so he cannot overcome it by
0:23:04 the power of His generation he staggers
0:23:07 back and in a fit of rage Vito's Beast
0:23:11 is roused by your resistance
0:23:15 he lets out a howl of frustration and
0:23:17 when he does
0:23:18 he throws his beast from himself into
0:23:22 parent and parents body begins to Warp
0:23:26 and twist and grow and over the course
0:23:29 of mere moments he assumes the Zulu form
0:23:33 and now perun's Towers nearly eight feet
0:23:37 in height
0:23:39 a lanky clawed bone spine monster you
0:23:44 actually recognize this as being
0:23:45 something very similar to what happened
0:23:46 to win yeah do not resist me I was a
0:23:51 reflexive action
0:23:54 does not resist your majesty
0:23:57 your action
0:23:59 Brita would not have stopped to check
0:24:02 she's running
0:24:05 better runs
0:24:07 behind her she can hear the sounds of
0:24:08 Vito screaming in frustration and you
0:24:11 may get into what is another long tunnel
0:24:14 passageway and that seems to head to a
0:24:16 different quadrant of the Chantry there
0:24:19 you see more of the winding orange
0:24:23 fleshy tissued fungus whatever it is
0:24:27 and there you make it to a door the door
0:24:30 is currently sealed and in the distance
0:24:33 behind you you can hear Vito's footfalls
0:24:36 [Music]
0:24:40 the group review arrived to the site at
0:24:42 Yale and there you can see there are
0:24:45 ambulances fire trucks police state
0:24:48 reporters talking something about some
0:24:50 sort of Riot that broke out among
0:24:51 students as a car overturned whatever's
0:24:54 going on it's tearing the city apart
0:24:57 ahead at the actual Library it seems
0:25:00 quite peaceful the throng of Mortals
0:25:04 seem to subconsciously avoid it so IRA
0:25:08 miles and wind
0:25:10 the group of era gathered waiting for
0:25:13 your fourth to arrive before you go in
0:25:15 so what's the plan chantries are
0:25:17 fortified there's gonna be a lot to go
0:25:21 on but if it's amitsy I don't know much
0:25:23 about the flesh Crafters
0:25:27 but
0:25:28 I can figure out a general layout but if
0:25:31 I'm being honest I just got to town so I
0:25:34 don't know this one specific looks over
0:25:36 at Miles you carry your Katana on you
0:25:39 yeah you Grace
0:25:41 if you permit me any kind of gestures
0:25:43 with one of his sort of gloved hands but
0:25:45 with one of the ungloved fingers towards
0:25:47 the katana things might get bad if
0:25:50 there's a bunch of some easy stuff in
0:25:52 there oh undoubtedly do you want me to
0:25:55 fortify your steel a bit you coming on
0:25:58 to him
0:26:00 you're gonna magic up the sword only if
0:26:03 you want
0:26:04 it's not the eyebrow Waggles
0:26:08 Ira is like very deliberately ignoring
0:26:10 the sheriff at this point
0:26:13 be like no I'm not I'm talking to the
0:26:14 prince I'm not dealing with this yeah
0:26:16 that'd be great is there anything we
0:26:17 should know before we talk to Rhys
0:26:19 I don't
0:26:20 think so
0:26:21 so I can track brita's Beast if I can
0:26:24 get a cent on it so I can probably find
0:26:26 her in there once we get in
0:26:28 some range of her
0:26:30 I think knowing where they keep the
0:26:33 stuff that they would like like Vito
0:26:35 that they would keep there the bottom
0:26:37 it's far down there's probably going to
0:26:39 be holding cells experimental areas
0:26:43 things that keep way down down deep so
0:26:46 they gotta go up if they're gonna try
0:26:48 and get out that's where the most
0:26:51 defenses lie okay so if you can get us
0:26:53 down there expediently I can probably
0:26:55 pick up her Trail there's also bound to
0:26:58 be a security room
0:26:59 so long as the lights of the cameras
0:27:02 aren't actually shattered even if the
0:27:04 power's off I can take a look
0:27:07 Dragon obese is one thing but there's
0:27:09 going to be things in there that are
0:27:10 intended to confuse the senses this
0:27:13 doesn't this doesn't rely on tricks this
0:27:17 accounts for tricks
0:27:18 you say that I do say that
0:27:22 either way we can find a friend down
0:27:24 there that said as well
0:27:26 um Lex what's the spiritual landscape of
0:27:28 this area look like ghosts or Spirits
0:27:32 very little if at all in the way of
0:27:34 ghosts which is unusual
0:27:37 Yale I was home to a lot it's a very
0:27:40 important place and the spirit world
0:27:44 here seems poisoned rotting black veins
0:27:49 kind of exude from this location like an
0:27:52 ale house just like at Hell House this
0:27:55 is bad guys wind just kind of like mid
0:27:58 conversation kind of like just starts
0:28:00 looking around and she's clearly seeing
0:28:03 things that are beyond the reporters and
0:28:05 the police tape and
0:28:07 the flipped cars this is for Ira who
0:28:12 hasn't known wind very long it it would
0:28:14 be easy to assume things didn't rattled
0:28:16 her very easily at this point
0:28:18 um but for Miles who knows that wind
0:28:20 doesn't rattle super easily she is a bit
0:28:23 rattled we know that going in no but
0:28:26 it's it's Hell House part two it's
0:28:28 poisoning the spirit lands and it's
0:28:32 bleeding in and it shouldn't be
0:28:34 happening like the hell house had years
0:28:37 to get that level of corruption if
0:28:39 you're seeing something like that it
0:28:42 means whatever it is that they had down
0:28:44 there breached containment as I pass the
0:28:47 sword to Ira holds his hand out for him
0:28:50 yeah I try to get a read on him I'm
0:28:52 trying to get a sense of like is he on
0:28:54 the up and up is he some sort of like
0:28:56 roll me a perception empathy the [ __ ] I
0:29:00 run manipulation subterfuge
0:29:02 does my spec in Hidden motives apply
0:29:04 sure does
0:29:08 some eight dipole
0:29:11 and a couple of ones
0:29:13 miles how many successes do you have
0:29:15 four successes with my multiple ones it
0:29:18 means I only get three successes then I
0:29:21 just use command no
0:29:24 tell me
0:29:27 what are you hiding Ira is very clearly
0:29:31 interested in more than just being a
0:29:34 helpful guy the sword thing is truly on
0:29:37 the up and up although he's also doing
0:29:38 it clearly because he's seen you now go
0:29:41 out of the office twice both times with
0:29:42 the katana so he's also trying to do it
0:29:44 as a way to butter you up great
0:29:46 um it's working
0:29:48 between him getting extra like listening
0:29:52 close curious whenReiss was on the
0:29:55 phone and mentions of the region in
0:29:57 general and the fact that he sort of has
0:30:00 been talking like you know well I'm new
0:30:02 to the area but I'm also kind of
0:30:04 familiar with the general layout of
0:30:07 maybe multiple tremir chantries he's
0:30:09 definitely interested in more than just
0:30:12 being helpful and grabbing Bretta he may
0:30:15 not know what yet based on the overall
0:30:17 levels of curiosity but he's definitely
0:30:19 here for a purpose and it's not just hey
0:30:22 I'm new in town like that was that was
0:30:24 [ __ ] right based on that it seems
0:30:26 like he's here weirdly enough not for us
0:30:28 this time which is I don't know I don't
0:30:30 know how to feel about this there's like
0:30:32 all the [ __ ] rolls our way so it's I
0:30:34 think he's here for something else so
0:30:36 like cool keep doing that
0:30:40 miles your sword for the next scene
0:30:43 we'll do an additional four dice of
0:30:45 damage got it it's actually as Ira's
0:30:48 performing his magic and they're a
0:30:50 little discreet Corner away from prying
0:30:53 eyes that Johnny arrives just in time to
0:30:56 catch it what does he see him doing with
0:30:57 the blade there is sort of a he's like
0:31:00 encanting under his breath and moving
0:31:02 his fingers in these little geometric
0:31:05 patterns and then like tracing the
0:31:07 fingers specifically the fingers that
0:31:08 don't have gloves over that like don't
0:31:10 have the leather of a glove over them uh
0:31:12 and are exposed over the metal of the
0:31:14 blade and you see like a little bit of
0:31:16 like static discharge almost as he
0:31:19 doesn't it's pretty the effect is
0:31:21 actually pretty subtle the sword it
0:31:23 doesn't really Shine Anymore it doesn't
0:31:25 look anything except when he hands it
0:31:27 back to Miles any like give in the steel
0:31:31 that would have been there is gone it is
0:31:34 the platonic ideal of a sword
0:31:37 specifically the platonic ideal of Miles
0:31:39 sword and gives it back and just goes
0:31:41 well
0:31:43 should at least have
0:31:45 strengthen the bonds on the atoms within
0:31:48 the steel so shouldn't be breaking
0:31:50 anytime soon and should hold that edge
0:31:52 at least for a little while as he hands
0:31:54 it back to Miles Johnny Johnny gets
0:31:57 steps out from the driver's side of the
0:31:58 car and kind of gives him a disdainful
0:32:01 look he's uh just wearing his uh white
0:32:04 T-shirt and a pair of uh Wayfarers
0:32:07 um his leather jacket is in the back
0:32:09 seat he shuts the door goes over and
0:32:12 starts fumbling around in the back seat
0:32:14 you can see he takes out a armored vest
0:32:16 that he puts on over the armored vest he
0:32:18 straps on a shoulder holster where he uh
0:32:21 sits the the revolver that he has into
0:32:23 that he then puts his leather jacket
0:32:24 back on and fits a matte black ax to his
0:32:29 back and then he grabs a gym bag and
0:32:32 takes the gym bag and lifts it up out of
0:32:36 the vehicle you can see that it's
0:32:37 actually looks like it weighs quite a
0:32:39 bit he brings that around to the to the
0:32:42 trunk of the vehicle where he opens up
0:32:44 and pulls out a little red gas can he
0:32:47 shuts the trunk and sets both down on
0:32:50 the back of it out of the gym bag he
0:32:52 pulls two fingerless leather gloves that
0:32:55 he fits on and then grabs a chainsaw
0:32:57 that he opens the get the the gas can to
0:33:00 and starts filling up she's
0:33:04 he's still smoking a morally while he
0:33:06 does this Amazon brand
0:33:10 is your uh Ira looks back over at Johnny
0:33:13 and then back to Miles as he hands the
0:33:14 Katana back over just finish all bring a
0:33:17 chainsaw out of the Chantry it seems
0:33:20 like it what you don't bring chainsaws
0:33:21 to your chantries
0:33:23 no it's called the bruja greeting he
0:33:27 comes walking over festooned with
0:33:29 weapons chainsaw in his hands cigarette
0:33:32 in his mouth means you might be able to
0:33:34 keep up with me like the last time we
0:33:35 went into one of these places like this
0:33:37 it was a Chantry or a Hell House a hell
0:33:39 house because both times were awful yeah
0:33:42 I'm sorry you've been in a Chantry
0:33:43 before Salem I don't Lex what do I know
0:33:47 about the shantry in Salem anything only
0:33:49 intelligence classical difficulty seven
0:33:51 this is a tendai pool
0:33:53 div seven you said dip five for me right
0:33:56 now and so five successes you know that
0:33:58 a great deal of information regarding
0:34:00 the change has been rejected but that
0:34:02 doesn't mean that all details have
0:34:03 escaped to you you're aware and that the
0:34:06 Salem Shane tree had been founded quite
0:34:08 some time ago by JohnReiss however when
0:34:12 a major conflict began to break out
0:34:15 between operation Longbow and some of
0:34:18 the local quarries disaster struck when
0:34:21 a coven of witches by the name of the
0:34:22 order of the cloven hoof caused some
0:34:25 event so terrible that the Chantry
0:34:27 needed to be closed downReiss is
0:34:30 actually held in great esteem by the
0:34:33 clan because of the number of tremair
0:34:35 that he saved from the disaster
0:34:37 personally it once was a major location
0:34:39 for a high Saturday but rumors have it
0:34:43 that a mysterious group known as the
0:34:45 order of the worm had designs upon the
0:34:49 location while the pyramid loyal tremir
0:34:52 were able to stop their efforts what
0:34:55 rests there now is so terrible that they
0:34:58 had to clear out how long ago was this
0:35:00 uh this is some but maybe a decade ago
0:35:02 at least you know what information you
0:35:05 have by official reports right there
0:35:07 were frowns for a second
0:35:09 I'm in the Salem Chantry yep so
0:35:13 this code remakes it a habit of barging
0:35:16 into RegentReiss's Treasures Clint
0:35:20 Romero makes it a half an inviting us in
0:35:22 also tomorrow night stories can we get
0:35:25 into the Chantry here now please and get
0:35:27 Brita yeah who is Brita by the way she's
0:35:30 our cotery mate yes who am I looking for
0:35:32 toriador really pretty be more specific
0:35:34 at all she's gonna to be the only pretty
0:35:36 Toreador in the Chantry running around
0:35:38 zimitzi town Ira looked sideways and
0:35:41 then looks back and goes can you be
0:35:44 any detail
0:35:45 s gray eyes dark hair 19-ish thank you
0:35:49 and starts walking into the library
0:35:51 shall we sounds good it'sReiss meeting
0:35:53 us here I was unclear oh yeah
0:35:58 it might be convenient for everybody if
0:36:00 we don't mention how quickly I found you
0:36:03 after the Regent called me and he walks
0:36:06 through the door into the library didn't
0:36:08 I ask him about something we should be
0:36:10 talking about before yep okay
0:36:13 is it your mirror what do you expect
0:36:16 more wands
0:36:19 they're following I don't do that he
0:36:21 talks less like he has a dick in his
0:36:23 mouth thanReiss does Let's Go Johnny
0:36:25 brings up the rear hear the dick in the
0:36:27 mouth comment I ever gets weird not
0:36:28 self-conscious and stubs out his
0:36:30 cigarette
0:36:31 wind wasn't being quiet he ain't Neil
0:36:34 but he's got decent senses
0:36:35 the group of you make your way in
0:36:38 very quickly Ira you notice something's
0:36:41 wrong surveillance is down when you get
0:36:44 to the main entrance the shantry by the
0:36:47 way is designed to essentially be a
0:36:49 vault with great care taken to make sure
0:36:52 that it is even harder to get out and
0:36:55 than it is to get in however the vault
0:36:58 door entrance has been torn off its
0:37:00 frame and casually tossed aside
0:37:03 apparently this Brita isn't just some
0:37:05 torreidor in addition to this there's a
0:37:08 fine layer of Ash over the floor your
0:37:12 friend she
0:37:14 a killer not by her choice not my
0:37:17 question
0:37:18 why does it matter because we're walking
0:37:20 through a field of dead right now we're
0:37:23 gonna be walking into a field of dead
0:37:25 exactly my point when he does have a
0:37:28 point this ash is one of your clan I'd
0:37:31 have to check but either way to answer
0:37:34 your question she's capable of killing
0:37:36 but I don't think this is British work
0:37:39 if she does kill someone it's gonna be
0:37:42 point blank with an assault rifle on the
0:37:44 back of the head Ira just immediately
0:37:45 starts looking around for bullet holes
0:37:47 none here but the hand that tore the
0:37:51 vault door off its frame is rather small
0:37:53 and delicate you can tell by the half
0:37:57 inch imprint of a hand on the steel
0:38:00 that was a she's not the one that tore
0:38:02 this door off no no which gets to the
0:38:05 point that there's something else going
0:38:07 on here maybe she didn't come in alone
0:38:09 maybe coming here wasn't her choice who
0:38:13 would neb your friend she was nabbed
0:38:16 from us last time we knew Prince printer
0:38:19 again out of Hartford from operation
0:38:20 Longbow sometimes sometimes he does have
0:38:24 an army of bruja at his disposal he says
0:38:27 looking at the door and the imprinted
0:38:29 hand why would pen Dragon make open War
0:38:32 on an entire Chantry no idea we're gonna
0:38:35 have to go in and figure it out so we're
0:38:36 going down yes yeah down finding yeah
0:38:39 because you know how we can answer all
0:38:40 this we talk to her Sheriff I understand
0:38:42 your desire I don't think you do enough
0:38:45 you could charge into a scenario we
0:38:48 don't understand we could all die and
0:38:50 that doesn't help Yokota remain then
0:38:53 stop talking and start moving it pains
0:38:55 me to agree with him but we do have to
0:38:57 be careful here I know that I think we
0:39:00 need need to stop analyzing the ashes of
0:39:02 dead people and focus on people we can
0:39:04 save Because by the way there's no
0:39:06 ghosts here there's no ghosts in Yale
0:39:09 there is one as you say it
0:39:11 winds kind of had jerks and you see
0:39:14 Romeo down the hall looking your way
0:39:19 [Music]
0:39:22 but our charges sound the hallway and
0:39:24 desperation she does not drop Majesty as
0:39:28 she's going she yells out Fido don't
0:39:32 change me I don't I don't want to be
0:39:34 changed and she tries to get the door
0:39:36 open all things change
0:39:39 and you can start to see his shadow
0:39:41 Crest over the entrance to the tunnel
0:39:44 and then the vault door opens from the
0:39:47 other side Freda charge us through it
0:39:50 might be a trick but might anything be
0:39:52 we get on through and you see shrike and
0:39:57 give you a nod and shut the vault door
0:39:58 behind you you look like you've seen a
0:40:00 ghost
0:40:01 Vito's On The Other Side Peru has been
0:40:04 infected or something he's trying to
0:40:06 fight it yeah [ __ ] him where's Romeo I
0:40:10 don't know is the sword going to hold
0:40:11 against what Reddit takes hold of shrike
0:40:14 and like well first of all is there any
0:40:17 form of locking mechanism on the door
0:40:18 yes has he locked it no he Britta locks
0:40:22 it immediately
0:40:25 and then goes to try to get shrike to
0:40:27 move away from the door
0:40:29 don't touch me Greta rolls her eyes
0:40:31 let's go of his arm and starts moving
0:40:34 okay hold on there's something you need
0:40:37 to see what
0:40:40 listen
0:40:42 and your curiosity starts to get the
0:40:44 better of you and when you extend your
0:40:46 senses you hear this mumbling coming
0:40:50 from one of the cells like a group of
0:40:52 people we're way underground and no
0:40:55 one's been checked in here for a while
0:40:57 but for some reason some little gaggle
0:41:01 of inmates seems to be aware of what's
0:41:03 going on out there in the east
0:41:06 looks over is this area infected with
0:41:09 the orange yeah you can definitely see
0:41:12 some signs of it yeah Shrek doesn't seem
0:41:14 to care about a little fungus and he
0:41:18 takes you to what looks like some sort
0:41:20 of uh kind of really old stone cement
0:41:24 steel like holding pen and inside of it
0:41:27 is a group of people who are like
0:41:31 covered in dust they've been here for a
0:41:34 long a long time
0:41:36 there are cups of blood kind of stained
0:41:39 with them kind of strung about
0:41:41 and a lot of them Pace in circles
0:41:44 sometimes they all speak in unison for a
0:41:47 single word or two and then start
0:41:49 mumbling about other things with my
0:41:51 heightened senses up can I hear
0:41:53 heartbeats are breathing do they appear
0:41:55 to be mortal I see the cups but there
0:41:58 are no heartbeats coming from the room
0:42:00 and when you look really close through
0:42:02 this like slot that is opened up so you
0:42:04 can spear into the room you can see
0:42:07 clearly that they are infected as some
0:42:09 of them have this these growths that
0:42:13 kind of cause them to more wobble than
0:42:15 walk
0:42:16 some of them are their faces are almost
0:42:19 unrecognizable because of the mutations
0:42:22 that they've experienced as a result of
0:42:24 whatever it is as veto has been doing
0:42:27 britta's expression softens with Petty
0:42:30 and horror but she tries to talk through
0:42:33 the slot can you think for yourselves ah
0:42:39 they gasp
0:42:41 and a handful of them apart
0:42:44 one steps forward and nervously
0:42:47 scratches the back of his neck and you
0:42:50 recognize his body language
0:42:52 new it is not Neil but the way he walks
0:42:56 the way he looks at you the way he
0:42:58 he worries visibly about you you know
0:43:01 that's Neil Bretta still raises her
0:43:04 assault rifle to the slot there's been
0:43:05 too many tricks

0:45:37 where are you
0:45:39 I'm right here
0:45:40 yep but I I I'm ready almost got you
0:45:44 killed thin blood just looks at you
0:45:46 slack jawed I suddenly there's devoid of
0:45:49 the expression that Neil had just
0:45:51 moments ago
0:45:52 Neil Neil shrike speaks up no it doesn't
0:45:57 look like any of them are Neil uh you
0:45:59 know
0:46:00 it does show here that they tried to get
0:46:02 one is Neil important to you brother
0:46:05 goes to see what he's looking at he head
0:46:07 over and he is going through literal
0:46:10 file cabinets and within them is a list
0:46:14 of people who haven't checked into this
0:46:17 room and it looks like based on what
0:46:19 he's saying is the tramir made an effort
0:46:22 of gathering as many seers as they could
0:46:24 lock them in here and used their insight
0:46:27 to gather information on upcoming
0:46:31 um events so to speak in terms of
0:46:33 Kindred society and one of them one of
0:46:35 the people they tried to get was someone
0:46:38 named Neil
0:46:39 Bretta covers her mouth and horror as
0:46:42 she realizes how long these people must
0:46:45 have been here does the amount of names
0:46:48 is it equal to the amount of people or
0:46:50 does it seem lower
0:46:52 the number of names listed is actually
0:46:55 greater than the number of people that
0:46:59 are in that room even taking into
0:47:01 account that some of them would be
0:47:02 missing like Neil yeah going through a
0:47:06 trek actually gives you a hand it seems
0:47:09 like whenever Vito needed flesh whatever
0:47:12 that means they just kind of grabbed
0:47:14 Despair and threw them incredible
0:47:16 automatically focus on the horror of the
0:47:19 task thanks shrike before there's a
0:47:22 strange pause that she's not it doesn't
0:47:24 matter she's focused on the task and
0:47:26 she looks back over hurriedly just
0:47:29 muttering yes to shrike before going to
0:47:33 the bar not the bar of the slot right
0:47:35 that's the only place you can see
0:47:37 through yeah it's again like another big
0:47:39 steel like door with a slot that can
0:47:42 slide open to interact she looks too
0:47:44 thin blood and she says
0:47:46 do you know of an Eden
0:47:48 burnt Lilith
0:47:51 far away from Eden
0:47:55 eat a near last daughter of Eve
0:47:59 last daughter
0:48:02 last daughter they start kind of nodding
0:48:04 to each other does someone someone here
0:48:06 named Eden or
0:48:09 I I really do I have academics would
0:48:14 that be helpful this is more uh
0:48:15 associated with your training but yeah
0:48:18 I'll go ahead and allow for an academics
0:48:19 give me a intelligence academics a
0:48:21 difficulty alrighty
0:48:24 two successes with two successes you
0:48:27 recall during your training those who
0:48:30 worship the Lilith would say it and it
0:48:33 translated to roughly all hail Lilith
0:48:35 and do I have any perspective on who
0:48:38 this Lilith is you are aware of her
0:48:43 significance her cultural significance
0:48:44 among the Mortal masses you also know
0:48:47 that she apparently has some sort of
0:48:49 significance to vampire kind but the
0:48:51 details you don't know okay brother
0:48:54 racks her mind and she goes back to join
0:48:58 strike where he was at the filing
0:49:00 cabinets looking for the women's names
0:49:03 if there's anything like an Eden or a
0:49:06 Lilith he puts his hands up and actually
0:49:09 backs away he's like why don't why don't
0:49:10 you do the research for a bit I'm gonna
0:49:12 go check on our teammates how much
0:49:15 research does there appear to be this is
0:49:17 a pretty decent number of filing
0:49:19 cabinets then Beretta is just going to
0:49:24 NAB a pile from E and from l in the
0:49:28 appropriate spots and keep up with
0:49:29 shrike so I haven't a parent I was
0:49:32 walking with him in where we went and
0:49:36 everything went black and I lost track
0:49:38 of him and the other
0:49:40 um
0:49:40 he started speaking really
0:49:43 tonelessly
0:49:46 and it seemed like he wasn't really like
0:49:50 like his bones weren't in the usual
0:49:52 order and and he started talking like
0:49:55 vetoed us and I I shot him when he came
0:49:59 towards me he's still alive but he's
0:50:01 he's it's like Vito throws his beasts
0:50:05 into people and it changes them into
0:50:07 something more powerful but monstrous
0:50:10 hmm it makes probably for the first time
0:50:13 and an honestly nervous face
0:50:16 we should get together the rest of the
0:50:18 team and he starts kind of like talking
0:50:21 into comms and Greta keeps on looking
0:50:23 through the files as she's walking just
0:50:25 dropping the ones that aren't relevant
0:50:27 along the way give me an intelligence
0:50:29 investigation
0:50:33 two successes with two successes you do
0:50:35 find that there is a cell that is
0:50:37 specifically meant to hold someone named
0:50:41 Eden a great deal of information on her
0:50:44 seems to have been redacted but it looks
0:50:46 like they've been holding on to her for
0:50:49 almost two decades
0:50:51 does the cell seem to be along the way
0:50:55 Beretta keeps an active eye out for it
0:50:58 and when they pass it she's going to try
0:51:00 to unlock it you get to it uh it's a
0:51:03 door actually just kind of further down
0:51:05 the block uh it has the same slot and
0:51:07 everything she'll look through first
0:51:09 just in case it's a little too Orange in
0:51:11 there when you look through you see
0:51:15 someone who's got a very slight build
0:51:17 perhaps maybe a little malnourished
0:51:20 she's pale it's kind of like long dark
0:51:23 kind of messy hair isn't very isn't
0:51:25 brushed very often in terms of clothes
0:51:28 she's dressed in the kind of gown that
0:51:30 someone might might wear in like a
0:51:32 hospital there's the start of a room but
0:51:35 it's very very Spartan probably a bit
0:51:38 chilly
0:51:39 and you hear a heartbeat coming from her
0:51:43 this girl is alive
0:51:45 are you yourself
0:51:47 she looks up yeah
0:51:50 I'm gonna try to open the door but and
0:51:53 Bretta just starts trying
0:51:55 to check
0:51:57 there seems to be an electronic lock on
0:51:59 it and then you start to hear the
0:52:00 banging on the vault door ravito had
0:52:03 been coming from
0:52:04 and as he bangs on the vault door
0:52:08 sounds start coming from the room that
0:52:10 held the thin Bloods hissing and
0:52:13 gnashing and they start banging on their
0:52:15 door trying to get out are there any
0:52:17 other doors between that and myself just
0:52:21 a long haul then I'm just very quickly
0:52:24 going to attempt larceny on this go
0:52:27 ahead and give me a DEX Larson
0:52:28 difficulty
0:52:30 nine
0:52:33 okay
0:52:34 two successes
0:52:36 two successes you hear the click that
0:52:40 you hope to hear
0:52:41 and the door slides open and inside the
0:52:45 girl gets up and starts to kind of
0:52:47 stagger towards you as if maybe
0:52:50 maybe they've gone a bit without feeding
0:52:52 her and giving her water Bretta dartson
0:52:55 grabs hold of our wrist and keeps
0:52:56 running I'm sorry I don't really have an
0:52:59 explanation but we're going you you hear
0:53:01 like bare feet slap against a cement
0:53:04 floor she tries to keep up with you
0:53:06 and behind you and now in the hall
0:53:10 you see something truly terrible
0:53:13 those thin Bloods their bodies have
0:53:17 molded together and whole chunks of the
0:53:21 veiny fungus that has grown along the
0:53:25 wall has peeled off of it and began to
0:53:29 arrive and become animated
0:53:32 and this mass of meat and Vito zantos's
0:53:38 will begins to rush down the hall
0:53:41 barreling toward the two of you
0:53:47 the group of your head down the hall
0:53:49 again it's a tunnel
0:53:51 will win you know that fungus
0:53:54 Johnny you do too in fact you
0:53:58 specifically recognize it from that
0:53:59 douchebag boyfriend you once had to put
0:54:01 down
0:54:02 this fungus whatever it is
0:54:05 same sort of stuff as you arrive to
0:54:08 Romeo he kind of gives this somber wave
0:54:12 are you you he not for now
0:54:16 okay
0:54:18 what are you doing here I can't really
0:54:20 explain that okay then what I can tell
0:54:23 you
0:54:24 is that brother's in a lot of trouble
0:54:26 and what's after her is bad bad news
0:54:30 I hope as best I can that's all I need
0:54:33 can we see him no okay Ira is looking at
0:54:37 the sheriff with like a questioning eye
0:54:40 how are there other people we should be
0:54:43 worried about down there other than
0:54:45 what's after her yeah don't trust anyone
0:54:48 down here but pretty including you he
0:54:51 nuts including me okay then help as best
0:54:54 you can I guess
0:54:55 when you want to let us know what you're
0:54:56 seeing Romeo he says Brit is down there
0:54:59 there could be others don't trust anyone
0:55:00 we see including him oh good thing I
0:55:02 can't see him
0:55:03 guess you guys lucked out on that one
0:55:05 the group of you head towards what
0:55:08 becomes this kind of foyer space looks
0:55:11 like there's a security room set up this
0:55:13 is kind of the main area for observing
0:55:16 the spaces that are arranged for the
0:55:18 Chantry is power working power is
0:55:21 working Ira goes over to like the
0:55:24 observation bank and the cameras and
0:55:26 just starts suspiciously expertly like
0:55:29 flipping through Premier security
0:55:32 protocols looking for anything he can
0:55:35 say as you head over there's a couple of
0:55:38 things that you do notice one a number
0:55:41 of the security devices like cameras the
0:55:45 tech is like rotted like like an age to
0:55:48 decades and is in disrepair when you get
0:55:51 to the computer itself tapping on Keys
0:55:53 the keys don't move the computer
0:55:56 it seems like it is frozen in time
0:56:00 huh as an aside
0:56:03 if you see any of this fungus don't
0:56:05 touch anything is it gonna try and touch
0:56:08 me
0:56:09 it's not gonna try the answer is yes I
0:56:11 will probably try to touch you you can't
0:56:13 let me be a little catty but not right
0:56:15 now down here not for that I think for
0:56:17 that it's fine but okay your friend
0:56:20 Bretta Romeo's taking us
0:56:23 okay don't know who Romeo is Romeo's a
0:56:26 wraith he used to be kindred non-tremier
0:56:29 at this point I need you to make a
0:56:31 willpower roll at difficulty seven to
0:56:33 not become lost hi and welcome into this
0:56:35 yeah we'll do extra dice instead of the
0:56:37 increased difficulty just bonus to I
0:56:38 sequel two what do we give current
0:56:39 willpower or total total okay
0:56:43 foreign
0:56:45 successes also four successes five
0:56:48 successes right here
0:56:50 so he's lost I got it so always a space
0:56:54 time here
0:56:56 seems woefully inconsistent
0:57:00 and there are times where you guys are
0:57:03 finding some sort of ambiance to this
0:57:07 place trying to disorient you and remove
0:57:10 your ability to determine which way
0:57:12 you're headed at any given moment you
0:57:14 push through
0:57:15 but are well aware that any slip up
0:57:18 means that you can get lost in a room
0:57:20 forever
0:57:22 this place got a real bad Vibe well
0:57:25 most times you're not welcome here
0:57:29 feels fine if you're welcome
0:57:31 hey your friend Brenna he's the IRA is
0:57:34 continuing to like mash on buttons and
0:57:36 just like get really simultaneously
0:57:38 frustrated and curious
0:57:40 like scientific curiosity mixed with
0:57:43 like why isn't it [ __ ] working
0:57:44 because your friend Brita
0:57:47 she
0:57:48 just like a regulatory door she 'd [ __ ]
0:57:51 around with
0:57:52 time or whatever the hell and he's just
0:57:54 like continuing to smash on the buttons
0:57:56 somebody locked this in place
0:57:58 if I can't hit the keys I can't hit [ __ ]
0:58:01 it's just full stasis not on her skill
0:58:04 set this ain't any pharmaturgy or
0:58:07 recognize either it's nothing that she's
0:58:09 ever shown us but it's very possible the
0:58:11 mushrooms could be growing in and who
0:58:13 exactly was Romeo warning us about other
0:58:16 people that were here
0:58:18 who else is here I don't know someone
0:58:21 this besides veto and besides Clan from
0:58:24 here is Romeo still around
0:58:27 Romeo can you can you us any
0:58:30 I can't did Brita lock the computer in
0:58:33 place no it wasn't Berta okay well it
0:58:36 doesn't really help us a whole lot here
0:58:38 no it doesn't so let's keep going
0:58:40 ask your Romeo friend what level she's
0:58:44 on what's she around just give me a
0:58:46 description and I can find it she looks
0:58:48 at him
0:58:49 the Sears the thin Bloods
0:58:52 she kind of gives Romeo this
0:58:55 hence of look and she doesn't break eye
0:58:58 contact from Romeo
0:59:01 she's with the Sears and the thin Bloods
0:59:04 Ira I mean you guys have only met him
0:59:07 like an hour ago but like usually has
0:59:09 this sort of like cocky putting on
0:59:11 errors like I'll just schmooze the
0:59:14 Sears and thin Bloods is the first time
0:59:16 that anyone's talked about tramir or
0:59:18 shantry stuff where he looks
0:59:21 lost just like it's there and gone he
0:59:25 like puts his face up pretty quick again
0:59:27 but looks confused and gets this frown
0:59:30 on his face like is that deep inside
0:59:31 Romeo like I can show you the way as far
0:59:34 as we can trust you then yeah okay
0:59:36 let's end the lights go out power is
0:59:38 gone everything becomes pitch black and
0:59:43 the group of you can hear this familiar
0:59:47 skittering hold on when spuns of blood
0:59:50 and Pops gang relies wax you this place
0:59:54 is like a [ __ ] lab right or they're
0:59:56 like
0:59:57 just in tubed power cables on the walls
1:00:00 or anything oh yeah yeah okay hey uh
1:00:04 watch your eyes for a sec I'm gonna get
1:00:06 the lights back on do a quick combat
1:00:08 starts roll initiative [ __ ]
1:00:14 uh it's just so everyone's aware blind
1:00:17 fighting rules mean that all of your
1:00:19 combat rolls are at plus two difficulty
1:00:21 am I blind fighting you are not sweet
1:00:23 Johnny be real careful with that
1:00:25 chainsaw
1:00:27 that's 13. Johnny will spend three blood
1:00:30 on extra actions and that will leave me
1:00:34 with a 18. dry my Katana that'll put me
1:00:38 at 22. [ __ ] yeah
1:00:40 I am not using Focus mind to act a
1:00:42 little bit faster so I'm going to be at
1:00:44 a big old nine miles you can't see the
1:00:48 problem but you can hear them it's your
1:00:51 action I'm going to
1:00:54 um cut the problem you may make your
1:00:56 attack a difficulty
1:00:58 looks like one success you may roll
1:01:00 damage remember you're plus four
1:01:05 eight damage you hear a loud
1:01:09 squelching sound combined with that of a
1:01:13 coconut being sliced open and then
1:01:16 roll to soak a single level of
1:01:18 aggravated damage as something sizzling
1:01:21 hot splashes against your flesh the
1:01:26 wow seven successes it doesn't hurt am I
1:01:30 getting an acid impression yes
1:01:33 they literally
1:01:36 it has acid
1:01:38 flood internals something what Johnny
1:01:41 you're not totally sure what you just
1:01:42 said but it's your turn Johnny is going
1:01:45 to take a dragon as morally as he pulls
1:01:48 the rip cord on the chainsaw it as it
1:01:51 kicks into life and a loud growling
1:01:54 Rumble fills the chamber you better get
1:01:57 those lights working fast Ira any guns
1:01:59 the chainsaw that's my action
1:02:03 when what am I seeing yes you see
1:02:07 something that looks like
1:02:10 melon-sized ticks their bodies these
1:02:14 [ __ ] but their legs are long and
1:02:17 spindly like that of a daddy long legs
1:02:19 and they move very gracefully and these
1:02:23 things come clicking and lining their
1:02:26 backs and the sides of their jaws are
1:02:29 these fingers and you saw when miles hit
1:02:33 it that it was reaching and as it
1:02:36 brushed against his skin his flesh
1:02:40 rippled for just a moment these things
1:02:42 are flesh crafters and when he split it
1:02:47 open he revealed that its core is made
1:02:50 from like some sort of humanoid skull
1:02:52 and within the juices kind of came
1:02:55 bursting at this orangey white kind of
1:02:57 hot puss that's sizzled against his
1:03:00 flesh there's a dozen of in here I think
1:03:03 I'm going to start by spending a blood
1:03:05 for my claws where is IRA Ira is over by
1:03:11 the computers looking for he's kind of
1:03:14 reaching around where there's a
1:03:15 collection of cables okay when we'll
1:03:17 move to cover Ira as he is doing he had
1:03:21 said he was going to get the lights on
1:03:22 and that will increase our odds of
1:03:24 success immeasurably so she's gonna move
1:03:27 over by him and give him some cover and
1:03:30 as she moves her horrifying fingernails
1:03:34 just to say that they elongate does not
1:03:37 do credit to how horrifying they become
1:03:39 the edges of her nails where the skin
1:03:42 meets the nail splits as they grow past
1:03:45 where she can reasonably hold Nails you
1:03:49 know it would probably bleed and be
1:03:51 horrifying to anyone else but this is
1:03:53 almost a almost meditative for her at
1:03:56 this point and she steps in to guard IRA
1:03:59 and says guys they're like the ticks
1:04:02 from Hell house but longer legs and they
1:04:05 can flesh craft they have fingers don't
1:04:07 let them touch you
1:04:09 what's the layout of this room it's dark
1:04:11 like coming through a single door or
1:04:13 something like that
1:04:14 um are they they came in through uh
1:04:17 these event shafts that are in the area
1:04:19 and through other entrances to the room
1:04:22 so they're all over got it they're all
1:04:23 over there's not a single entrance point
1:04:25 they're coming in from everywhere
1:04:26 they're about a dozen pyra okay make
1:04:30 sure you're not touching at me and watch
1:04:31 your eyes I'm gonna get the lights on
1:04:33 and Lex I'm gonna uh light myself up
1:04:36 cast well I need one success but six
1:04:39 successes that same Arc Light that he
1:04:41 used to snap the cigarettes on earlier
1:04:43 Ira starts to like very rapidly become
1:04:47 covered with this like Saint Elmo's Fire
1:04:49 just an aura of crackling electricity
1:04:52 until he is just a pillar of lightning
1:04:54 and with his hand attached to the power
1:04:57 cable Lex he's gonna basically just
1:05:00 juice up the room and as much as the
1:05:03 lights are going not with the intention
1:05:05 to like overload all the lights but to
1:05:06 get the power working and even on his
1:05:08 own he is
1:05:09 seemly bright where the point if you
1:05:12 look directly at him you're probably
1:05:13 gonna like she has her back to mess up
1:05:15 your eyes so he provides a great deal of
1:05:18 light himself and charges up all the
1:05:21 bulbs so they're shining bright to the
1:05:24 point where they might pop but don't and
1:05:26 then with my second mental action uh if
1:05:28 one of these things is skittering I'm
1:05:29 going to point a finger were there power
1:05:32 in these cables there was a loss of
1:05:34 power so there's a total loss of power
1:05:36 so I can't draw on the power of the
1:05:38 cables nothing there yet okay uh then
1:05:40 I'm going to with one hand still on the
1:05:42 cable he very quickly like almost
1:05:45 without looking at it points his fingers
1:05:47 and makes a finger gun shape uh with his
1:05:51 other hand and points at one of the
1:05:54 things that is like skittering towards
1:05:56 them and channels the electricity is
1:05:58 going to snap one of the shots off go
1:06:00 for it
1:06:01 success it's a bunch of successes roll
1:06:03 your dicer damage and just set the the
1:06:06 blue white light of electricity and the
1:06:09 weird kind of like Stark Shadows that
1:06:12 must throw on these spider things
1:06:13 probably does not help anything about
1:06:16 how creepy they are no it's awful yeah
1:06:18 how much power am I do I need to keep
1:06:20 the lights on I have 14 dice of
1:06:23 electricity four dice will probably do
1:06:25 it okay so don't run out too fast I'm
1:06:27 just gonna use six dice right now
1:06:29 foreign
1:06:33 there's that Telltale sound like a
1:06:37 lightning bolt and it is hit and it
1:06:40 explodes
1:06:42 need everyone who has fortitude or armor
1:06:45 to soak two levels of aggravated damage
1:06:49 soaked all right
1:06:53 I've got three success
1:06:55 um do tens explode if I have a spec
1:06:57 what's your Speck tough as Nails yes
1:06:59 eight you also soak Ira as the only one
1:07:03 in the room who does not have fortitude
1:07:05 apparently holds his coat up over his
1:07:07 face and the acid hits the coat and
1:07:09 starts to sizzle into it but does not
1:07:11 actually eat through the coat everyone
1:07:13 is attacked by these creatures is there
1:07:15 any way I can take Iris for him I'll
1:07:17 allocate an extra one to you I'm going
1:07:20 to say thran miles four on win two on
1:07:24 Johnny one on Ira might it make sense
1:07:27 that there's more on Johnny than uh Than
1:07:29 Miles sure just because uh he killed one
1:07:32 near him that I have not actually gone
1:07:34 after one so
1:07:35 can I
1:07:37 Perry you may sacrifice an action to
1:07:39 Perry yes
1:07:43 miles are willing to Parry two successes
1:07:47 four you batted away with your sword
1:07:49 Johnny
1:07:51 the first attack plainly misses
1:07:54 as is right and robber
1:07:56 wow okay both attacks will simply miss
1:07:58 you how's this right improper it's a
1:08:00 chainsaw nope okay
1:08:02 next one on okay
1:08:05 all of them is Johnny
1:08:08 miles your hit
1:08:11 no successes on flesh crafting you're
1:08:13 okay good but it is up on your shoulder
1:08:16 and you can actually feel its fingers
1:08:18 grabbing your ear and kind of trying to
1:08:21 weave it into whatever shape it imagines
1:08:23 IRA
1:08:25 for successes yeah
1:08:28 yeah yeah yeah
1:08:30 uh oh if it touches me uh it
1:08:33 automatically takes lightning damage
1:08:34 roll the damage is that before or after
1:08:36 this it leaps on you and explodes that's
1:08:39 only one die high voltage
1:08:42 yeah it sucks too yeah well it's only
1:08:45 one
1:08:46 good try I don't want to do anything for
1:08:48 that so like worth it there's one
1:08:50 success to flushcraft
1:08:51 Ira you will suffer one uh Health level
1:08:55 of damage that might be healable like AG
1:08:58 depending on a few factors otherwise
1:09:00 it's permanent uh the [ __ ] does that
1:09:03 mean
1:09:04 the whole sections of your face are
1:09:07 peeled away and knitted into like
1:09:11 drooping jowls that hang from the bottom
1:09:14 of your chin oh Ira freaks the [ __ ] out
1:09:17 like this is not the kind of [ __ ] he
1:09:19 does yeah give me the courage check uh I
1:09:21 can't rush right oh then you're good
1:09:22 when wind sees what it does and that IRA
1:09:26 has no defense other than his pretty
1:09:28 coat uh she throws an arm out in front
1:09:31 to intercept another attack for on him
1:09:34 it fails win has three successes on you
1:09:39 you will lose two Health levels am I
1:09:42 soaking no as it simply takes an ear and
1:09:45 the inner portions of your hearing
1:09:48 mechanism drum and all I got two more on
1:09:50 you
1:09:51 one success and his two successes to
1:09:55 flush crafty further the other one leaps
1:09:57 on to you and starts pulling all of the
1:10:01 flesh from your hip and on the side and
1:10:04 starts to break it down into simple
1:10:07 muscle and fat tissues spraying it
1:10:10 against the wall
1:10:12 the next one is three successes
1:10:16 this has four successes to strip help
1:10:19 bubbles from you okay these These are
1:10:21 absolutely unsocable too yeah [ __ ]
1:10:25 um
1:10:26 so she has one left before and that is
1:10:28 end cap okay you're still up holy [ __ ] I
1:10:32 have a question about how these things
1:10:34 are moving they're scattering around
1:10:36 sort of spider like but are they
1:10:38 crawling up walls like spiders or do
1:10:40 they seem to have to walk on the floor
1:10:42 and they do seem to have to walk on the
1:10:43 floor okay good good to know celebrity
1:10:47 actions so when after this Onslaught
1:10:50 just kind of gives this grunting sound
1:10:53 and her glowing eyes close for just a
1:10:55 minute and then she opens up with just
1:10:58 resolve to stay on her feet as long as
1:11:00 possible get out of the room we gotta
1:11:02 get out of here you're keeping the
1:11:04 lights on keeping them alive with me
1:11:08 everyone's gotta get out of here well
1:11:10 Johnny is going to uh chop apart the
1:11:13 three things in front of him let's go I
1:11:17 don't suppose Swift would apply here
1:11:19 hell yeah go far all right
1:11:23 you're not trying to be graceful
1:11:26 you're just rushing around the room
1:11:28 waving that [ __ ] around uh eight
1:11:30 successes to hit the first one God damn
1:11:32 okay seven will carry over it is
1:11:34 strength plus four aggravated damage
1:11:37 go ahead Jesus Christ
1:11:40 six uh levels of aggravated damage it
1:11:43 bursts into a horrific mess and this
1:11:47 crawling hissing cyst splashes the area
1:11:51 around it but most of the spray lands
1:11:53 harmlessly against your jacket uh let's
1:11:55 do this two more times
1:11:57 holy [ __ ] that was all but one success
1:12:00 on that so that's another eight
1:12:02 successes okay seven carry over last
1:12:05 time I had a couple of tens but this
1:12:06 time it was just all six [ __ ] two
1:12:08 thousands Jesus
1:12:09 [Music]
1:12:10 not as good as last time though
1:12:13 seven successes actually was better uh
1:12:16 You're Gonna Roll soak against one point
1:12:18 of aggravated damage is my armor
1:12:21 degrading at all no two successes okay
1:12:24 you absorb the damage on the other three
1:12:27 successes this time
1:12:30 foreign six levels of aggravated damage
1:12:33 roll to soak two levels of aggravated
1:12:35 damage
1:12:36 as the chainsaw crunches and and
1:12:41 squelch's this thing into nothingness
1:12:43 for successes but two ones so I actually
1:12:46 only soak two okay that's all of it Oh I
1:12:49 thought you said there was three three
1:12:50 levels of that too oh never mind I
1:12:52 soaked I barely soaked too we go to
1:12:54 around two miles I will
1:12:57 lit into three attacks let's go miles
1:13:01 yeah
1:13:03 first one is no good
1:13:07 second one is three successes two carry
1:13:09 over into damage
1:13:11 and two successes on the last one
1:13:15 six damage on the first one
1:13:18 five damage on the second one
1:13:20 both of them are destroyed I need you to
1:13:23 roll Stroke versus one egg
1:13:25 and roll soak against two egg first one
1:13:29 I soaked with three
1:13:32 five or six on the second one okay two
1:13:35 more destroyed Johnny you're a Go Johnny
1:13:38 is also going to split uh into three
1:13:41 attacks
1:13:42 actually so I'm only spending blood for
1:13:44 one Celerity this turn meaning my attack
1:13:47 pool is Dex 5 for Celerity three melee
1:13:52 so uh that's 12. if I split into four
1:13:58 that would be three dice per right yes
1:14:00 that's some chancy math well now he's
1:14:03 sold on it yeah let's [ __ ] do this I
1:14:06 don't know what you're going for there
1:14:07 Tim never tell me the odds because I
1:14:09 will take the worst ones possible Johnny
1:14:12 Roars and starts swinging the chainsaw
1:14:14 about
1:14:15 in Wild arcs
1:14:20 first one's botch
1:14:24 [Laughter]
1:14:28 okay everybody hold on hold on hold on
1:14:32 everyone who is not Johnny needs to roll
1:14:35 a d10 let me know what you get
1:14:39 and once we determine who rolled the
1:14:41 lowest what's that and everyone everyone
1:14:42 I will say what happens next yeah
1:14:45 YouTube Britta I'm like you never know
1:14:46 where this chainsaw is gonna end up
1:14:49 seven seven
1:14:51 Oh no I got seven too that's one on a
1:14:55 d10 from old Lyra all right Johnny
1:15:01 roll damage at a minus three die penalty
1:15:04 for the record I have two more Health
1:15:06 charges in this coat before it gets shot
1:15:09 [Music]
1:15:12 strength plus one die okay yeah it's not
1:15:16 really like an accurate purposeful
1:15:18 strike
1:15:19 them yeah it's more like the backswing
1:15:23 was a bit of an initiative
1:15:25 six egg
1:15:28 that is way less than I expected good
1:15:31 because if it was much more I was
1:15:33 [ __ ] dead yeah I know I'm gonna be
1:15:35 real I thought Garrett just killed here
1:15:36 as Johnny swings one leaps gracefully
1:15:39 over him a quick little thing and before
1:15:42 Gianni could pivot to follow up the
1:15:45 chainsaw Clips against Ira ripping his
1:15:50 coat and the teeth digging deep into his
1:15:53 flesh Ira with a chainsaw to the gut
1:15:56 from a bruja Iris screams like just in
1:15:58 absolute agony whether he's uh
1:16:02 caught up in the moment or just doesn't
1:16:04 seem to care Johnny just grimaces and
1:16:06 chases after the little tiny spider
1:16:08 thing and hacks at it again I got two
1:16:10 Health levels left
1:16:12 does Ira electrocute me when I hit him
1:16:14 technically yes yo roll a damage die
1:16:19 yeah with my electricity spec that
1:16:21 that's two
1:16:23 I could soak that though right two
1:16:25 damage it's only lethal yeah
1:16:27 I soak two yep you're good there's a
1:16:30 snap of electrical discharge as the
1:16:32 chainsaw tears out my insides Johnny
1:16:35 next to that girl
1:16:38 succeeds with one success
1:16:40 so nothing carries over to damage right
1:16:43 but it is for damage on a chainsaw right
1:16:46 that's right
1:16:48 six aggravated damage is reduced to a
1:16:51 smear and three levels of aggravated
1:16:54 damage pop up at you Johnny
1:16:56 he soaks too I need a self-control check
1:16:59 a difficulty eight when you take your
1:17:01 first level of damage
1:17:03 um I don't think this is my first level
1:17:05 of damage tonight oh right no it's not
1:17:07 carry around but I like a lot right no
1:17:10 it is actually oh my gosh that's right I
1:17:12 haven't actually been hurt
1:17:15 God damn you can also hey man I'd love
1:17:18 if you spend a willpower right now oh
1:17:20 yeah no [ __ ] that I just spent a
1:17:21 willpower we're good all right sounds
1:17:23 good
1:17:24 because this is the time Johnny is that
1:17:28 all of your attacks do you solve one
1:17:29 more uh I still have two more yep oh
1:17:31 yeah go ahead go ahead I'm going for
1:17:33 broke unfortunately it's a roulette
1:17:36 um so he's really amped the tension in
1:17:38 the air because we have no [ __ ] idea
1:17:40 how this is gonna go no I'll tell you
1:17:41 what I'm gonna spend a wolf heart on
1:17:42 both these more attacks because you know
1:17:44 what we just need these to land and
1:17:45 these things to die
1:17:46 um me botching that up in the first go
1:17:48 is really putting us behind in terms of
1:17:50 the uh killing the killing here
1:17:54 that'll be three successes on the next
1:17:56 attack two carry over
1:17:59 foreign
1:18:01 aggravated damage it will burst dealing
1:18:04 one level of aggravated damage to you
1:18:06 which he easily soaks his fourth attack
1:18:10 uh two successes one carry is over into
1:18:13 damage
1:18:16 uh 11 AG
1:18:18 O Okay that one is very dead very very
1:18:22 dead and it grinds up in the chainsaw's
1:18:26 teeth spraying a level of aggravated
1:18:28 damage up at you which he soaks again
1:18:30 okay
1:18:31 it's on you when
1:18:33 hooray you can also spend one's on your
1:18:36 back one's on your hip
1:18:39 three on the first one hit two dice will
1:18:42 carry over into damage
1:18:46 and one success both hit first one I get
1:18:49 two dice of damage that carry over my
1:18:52 strength is four
1:18:54 and then seven more cool
1:18:59 damage dice don't explode right depends
1:19:01 on your strength uh respect rending it
1:19:05 explodes
1:19:07 11 11 AG
1:19:11 it dies horrifically as your clawed hand
1:19:16 dips into its meaty wet coconut like
1:19:19 flesh and your for your hands uh you
1:19:23 will soak against three levels of
1:19:25 aggravated damage
1:19:29 dies very much so it resurrects in
1:19:33 Michigan we'll deal a level of
1:19:35 aggravated damage to you go ahead and
1:19:36 roll soak this is for the first soaking
1:19:40 a lot
1:19:44 and a paltry five okay win actually
1:19:48 takes the one that's on her shoulder
1:19:50 pecking at her ear and smashes it into
1:19:53 the one on her hip with claws through
1:19:55 both of them and that just kind of
1:19:57 shakes them off you run the last two
1:19:59 apart unaffected by their oily acidic uh
1:20:04 innards and for the moment the room is
1:20:06 silent aside from the loud arcs of
1:20:09 lightning that are keeping the room lit
1:20:11 and the massive chainsaw that's running
1:20:13 Iris I'm sorry man I'm not used to
1:20:15 people being so close by that I don't
1:20:18 want to cut in half with this thing Ira
1:20:20 is keeping a hand on like the power
1:20:22 cable to keep power to the facility but
1:20:25 otherwise it's like leaned over like
1:20:28 hunched over leaning against the
1:20:29 computer console just those like Humane
1:20:32 not that old of a kindred like he's
1:20:36 panting and just like
1:20:38 IRA
1:20:40 so call on your blood that's gonna take
1:20:44 a little bit more than that to heal this
1:20:45 I know but you can fix it so don't start
1:20:49 panicking okay I'm not panicking but I
1:20:52 need time 10 minutes and I could at
1:20:54 least fix my face but we gotta go find
1:20:56 your friend right yeah he looks around
1:21:00 and he looks at the like [ __ ]
1:21:02 horrible zumizi [ __ ] and just in a
1:21:06 moment where like the mask slips a
1:21:08 little bit more again it just goes
1:21:11 the [ __ ] were they doing here looks over
1:21:14 miles I'm sorry I wasn't meant to fight
1:21:18 [ __ ] like this I'm meant to fight on the
1:21:20 Torches the night is young Johnny Powers
1:21:23 down the James the chainsaw and it kind
1:21:25 of like offers him a shoulder to grab
1:21:28 onto he doesn't like actually grab him
1:21:30 because he doesn't want to get uh
1:21:31 shocked again but no if I touch you
1:21:33 you're gonna shock and we need the
1:21:35 lights let's um
1:21:37 somebody froze this [ __ ] computer
1:21:38 let's get out of here Romeo you still
1:21:40 around he nods kind of looking wide-eyed
1:21:45 at the horror he said you could lead us
1:21:47 to her
1:21:47 I know where she is and you're leading
1:21:50 us to her yeah okay you said not to
1:21:53 trust I'm doubling down I understand
1:21:55 it's okay
1:21:56 I get it this way he's kind of starts
1:21:59 jogging off in a direction Ira even
1:22:02 glowing electrically like it doesn't
1:22:05 seem to affect his stuff and he pulls a
1:22:07 morally out and sticks in his mouth and
1:22:10 it just [ __ ] snap lights offers one
1:22:12 over like puts the pack down near Johnny
1:22:15 as he kind of reaches the pack out
1:22:18 Johnny has already fished out his own
1:22:20 and kind of just like nods to him puts
1:22:23 it back and then goes I don't I
1:22:25 appreciate it but we we're gonna need
1:22:27 the power and I don't want to shock
1:22:29 nobody so I I'm gonna give me a second
1:22:33 and he rolls his left sleeve up and
1:22:36 there's like a like a bracelet made of
1:22:38 like little red beads and he just pushed
1:22:40 two of them in his mouth and snaps him
1:22:42 off and will gain three blood then lifts
1:22:45 himself off the ground with his mind and
1:22:48 starts levitating essentially floating
1:22:51 down the hallway so he does not have to
1:22:53 walk because apparently the mental
1:22:55 strain for Ira is way easier than like
1:22:58 he's [ __ ] up he's not walking well and
1:23:00 just goes
1:23:01 uh Sheriff you and your ghost friend
1:23:04 she's already started walking lead on
1:23:06 Miles says that quick swipe at the store
1:23:08 to get the rest of the acid off of it
1:23:10 and keep close these things might Ambush
1:23:12 us from anywhere she is still moving but
1:23:16 it's clear one of her legs is having is
1:23:19 like dragging just a little
1:23:21 um from where the meat was torn away but
1:23:24 she if she notices she doesn't say
1:23:26 anything Johnny pushes him to give you a
1:23:28 shoulder to help uh help you walk if
1:23:30 there's gonna be a lot more of uh that
1:23:33 kind of thing
1:23:35 in here
1:23:36 if I could make a suggestion
1:23:39 they love to get up Paulson personal but
1:23:42 essential you got a gun and if we can
1:23:45 just keep backing away and not have to
1:23:47 touch them this gun's got special
1:23:49 ammunition I'm not gonna waste on these
1:23:51 things I mean I have a regular gun
1:23:53 staying at range might be
1:23:57 Tactical
1:23:58 that's for sure you're not quite sure
