0:01:15 [Music]
0:01:28 service
0:01:31 the quarter is rounded up each VI are
0:01:34 brought outside there there are eight
0:01:38 black
0:01:39 SUVs that are gathered up Johnny with
0:01:44 your experience with all manner of cars
0:01:49 getaway vehicles etc etc you know that
0:01:53 these vehicles are up armored
0:01:55 bulletproof glass The
0:01:58 Works you are
0:02:00 a Cordy approached by the trio of josian
0:02:05 who were present for the
0:02:08 unusually quick and quiet conclave that
0:02:11 Prince Davenport endured the three are
0:02:15 very quick to introduce themselves
0:02:17 leading the trio is a very young man he
0:02:22 doesn't even look old enough to
0:02:24 drink and is all smiles and charm he's
0:02:29 in his uniform and he introduces himself
0:02:32 as archon Glenn he insists he doesn't
0:02:37 really do the last name thing and he's
0:02:40 going to be kind of your guide to uh
0:02:44 Harford and states that he's got two of
0:02:48 his best friends along for the ride who
0:02:50 will be watching your backs the other
0:02:51 two do not speak to you at all the first
0:02:54 of which is archon Travis who is an
0:02:57 older looking woman she looks to be
0:02:59 about her mid-40s old older than the
0:03:02 group of you still like she's very
0:03:03 sturdy definitely has this athletic
0:03:05 build some salt and pepper to her hair
0:03:08 she is of the bruha clan and just sort
0:03:13 of keeps her arms crossed and maintains
0:03:15 this kind of stone cold expression she
0:03:19 tends to keep her eye on Neil
0:03:22 specifically but a little bit more
0:03:24 relaxed also a bruha is archon Tully and
0:03:29 Tully keeps this pair of kri that are
0:03:34 hidden on her like outfit and kind of
0:03:38 slung on this like single point sling
0:03:40 and at her hip is a kind of very nice
0:03:45 like MP7 SMG it's just [ __ ] loaded
0:03:48 out with weapons yeah she kind of keeps
0:03:52 an eye on Johnny but like there's a
0:03:54 different vibe to the way the two of
0:03:57 them keep eyes on you guys right
0:04:00 Travis she looks like if Neil blinks or
0:04:03 tries to use opy skate or anything she's
0:04:06 just going to DM him T's just kind of
0:04:08 into Johnny's like look and kind of just
0:04:12 appreciates the man's arms and
0:04:16 interestingly enough you actually
0:04:18 recognize her as one of the bruha that
0:04:19 were in attendance uh right on that
0:04:21 rooftop so some of the brewha were
0:04:24 snitches maybe Glenn shakes hands offers
0:04:29 each of these earbuds that used for
0:04:30 communication the event the vehicle gets
0:04:32 whay and everyone separated he will
0:04:35 indicate to you that there are other
0:04:37 archons who are up ahead the pathway to
0:04:40 Hartford has been scared as best they
0:04:43 can but there is news of cunic sorcerers
0:04:47 being in the area and that the
0:04:51 Vykos uh has been spotted in Middletown
0:04:57 mere nights ago gross so there are sabat
0:05:02 who are further up north even than New
0:05:07 Haven sorry what is cunic
0:05:11 sorcerer
0:05:13 oh Glen speaking uh the the zisi are um
0:05:20 basically
0:05:22 infernals and they wield this terrible
0:05:25 sorcery from
0:05:26 wakia and uh lots of
0:05:30 very Dracula themed um Magics they're
0:05:34 basically terrible kill them on site
0:05:37 unfortunately if it's a golden ex
0:05:38 sorcerer that's very good what they do
0:05:39 you probably won't see
0:05:41 them got it I think just use your uh
0:05:46 black hand training it'll be fine and he
0:05:48 just kind of like heads over to the SUV
0:05:49 let's go guys I kind of Nod at
0:05:52 Glen Johnny uh Johnny kind of looks over
0:05:56 at
0:05:57 Tully and kind of uh just glances back
0:06:00 at Glenn's way got a [ __ ] loose
0:06:03 tongue doesn't
0:06:04 he yep anyone ever knock it out of his
0:06:07 [ __ ] head Johnny it's it's it's okay
0:06:11 he's tougher than he
0:06:12 looks you have to be if he's an archon R
0:06:16 looks ashamed and she's holding her hand
0:06:18 close to herself but she's cooperating
0:06:21 cuz right now he looks about as tough as
0:06:22 a [ __ ] Jolly Rancher I'm just going
0:06:25 to get in the car at this point whatever
0:06:27 car they indicate they bring you guys to
0:06:29 uh one of the more Central SUVs the most
0:06:34 of these vehicles they look exactly the
0:06:37 same when you check plates all of their
0:06:39 plates are the same before W is able to
0:06:43 get in Glenn holds up his hand he's like
0:06:46 ah actually her power wishes to speak
0:06:49 with you you'll be riding with her to
0:06:51 Harford then she can come and make me
0:06:54 I'm riding with my Coterie his lips thin
0:06:58 and he says
0:07:00 I've got to warn
0:07:02 you when she punishes people she hits
0:07:05 them where it hurts she kind of looks at
0:07:08 Neil and BR he gives like a slow nod
0:07:12 Johnny gives when a reassuring nod you
0:07:16 might want
0:07:17 to do as her power says I got things
0:07:21 that I control here I'll keep an eye
0:07:23 out that's not what I'm worried about my
0:07:26 free will is about to come become a
0:07:28 luxury I can't afford anymore Glenn kind
0:07:31 of gives you this look it's already
0:07:34 gone no I could make this a
0:07:37 problem I'm debating how worth it it is
0:07:40 he raises his watch up to his mouth your
0:07:44 power uh when gavat wishes to speak with
0:07:47 you at a few moments lucenda is seen
0:07:50 coming outside she is accompanied by a
0:07:54 pair of archons you had not seen inside
0:07:57 with her
0:07:57 earlier and she starts heading towards
0:08:01 you where's Xavier in all this is he
0:08:04 still deep inside or is he at the door
0:08:06 he is inside okay she walks past you
0:08:09 does not say
0:08:10 anything when she arrives to the
0:08:14 SUV she opens the door her SUV which is
0:08:17 a few cars down she gestures to the back
0:08:22 seat what is your permanent will power
0:08:24 score
0:08:28 seven with over 10 successes mhm you
0:08:32 find your free will suppressed utterly
0:08:35 and without any words you
0:08:40 obey and you go over to the other SUV
0:08:45 and your Coterie sees you disappear
0:08:48 into the back seat you scoot
0:08:51 in and she sits in the backseat with you
0:08:54 and shuts the
0:08:56 door the two uh archons that were
0:08:59 walking with
0:09:00 her one of them climes climbs into the
0:09:03 driver's seat the other one climbs into
0:09:06 the passenger seat as everyone gets into
0:09:09 their assorted SUVs they start pulling
0:09:12 out one takes a right out of the parking
0:09:15 lot another one takes a left about 40
0:09:19 seconds pass one takes a right out of
0:09:22 the parking lot another one takes a left
0:09:24 out of the parking lot and this process
0:09:26 continues until all SUVs are out
0:09:30 there's a moment where you think you
0:09:32 might actually be able to spot some of
0:09:33 the other SUVs that are just like yours
0:09:36 but over the course of a minute or two
0:09:38 they're scattered all over New Haven and
0:09:40 are headed off in their respective
0:09:47 directions seeing the writing on the
0:09:49 wall miles got into the car was
0:09:51 instructed sat right behind the uh the
0:09:54 driver's seat and waited for this little
0:09:57 Caravan to get going Brea kind of looks
0:10:00 quickly between the other members of her
0:10:03 Coterie and makes a choice as soon as she
0:10:08 sees where mil sits to slip in from the
0:10:11 other side and place herself at a
0:10:13 triangle between them probably
0:10:15 technically next to miles but so that
0:10:18 she can see Neil not in that exact
0:10:20 middle seat Neil ever since the
0:10:22 confessions has not said a word not made
0:10:25 a noise has not attempted to op Escape
0:10:27 but for all intents and purposes is
0:10:28 trying to shrink into like a pocket of
0:10:32 reality where no one's paying attention
0:10:33 to him no one looks at him he's not
0:10:35 looking at anyone extremely pliable and
0:10:38 when everyone starts getting into the
0:10:40 SUV just gets in slinks into the back in
0:10:44 the bench seat like away from everyone
0:10:46 and then actually instead of sitting in
0:10:48 the middle even where you can see
0:10:49 everybody scoots over and is sitting
0:10:51 behind miles so that he can like see
0:10:54 where BR is see where Johnny is but
0:10:56 cannot actually look at miles joh um
0:11:00 lingers a long while watching the rest
0:11:03 of the Caravan load up specifically he
0:11:05 watches when go off with Luc send before
0:11:09 kind of realizes that he's just standing
0:11:11 outside while everyone's loaded into the
0:11:13 uh SUV looks back kind of assesses his
0:11:16 options and uh loads up into the uh uh
0:11:20 shotgun with T at the wheel the SUV
0:11:24 peels out and you hit the road at first
0:11:27 it's kind of a quiet Drive no music is
0:11:31 played and the group of you are left
0:11:33 with your thoughts the silence is broken
0:11:36 by a Zippo clacking as Johnny lights up
0:11:40 amle you don't mind if I smoked this in
0:11:42 here do you he says blowing a huge cloud
0:11:46 of smoke in in Tully's Direction not a
0:11:48 lot of reasons to blow smoke at
0:11:52 someone fair
0:11:55 enough everyone in the car can
0:11:59 probably tell even though Brea wants to
0:12:02 be subtle about it that she's checking
0:12:06 in emotionally trying to take
0:12:08 temperatures trying to read people Neil
0:12:10 is pretty clearly like that level so far
0:12:14 beyond a panic attack that you're
0:12:16 functionally catatonic you know he's not
0:12:18 actually completely out of it you can
0:12:20 see his eyes darting around like marking
0:12:23 where they are it's half hour 45 minutes
0:12:26 depending on traffic to get to you know
0:12:28 the heart for area and for the first you
0:12:31 know for that first 10 minutes of the
0:12:32 ride he's just constantly like in a
0:12:34 feverish State looking around but has
0:12:37 ascended truly to the level like Beyond
0:12:39 Panic miles is sitting there quietly do
0:12:43 we get to keep our weapons yes you do
0:12:45 all right so he's holding essentially
0:12:47 he's holding the sword upright between
0:12:49 his feet kind of looking out the window
0:12:51 and
0:12:53 just wondering what is going to be
0:12:55 happening next so toally where we headed
0:13:00 Prince Pendragon is hosting
0:13:03 the uh war
0:13:06 council his arm is gathered up they are
0:13:09 ready to make the move towards uh New
0:13:12 York but we need to make sure defenses
0:13:16 for the region are organized
0:13:19 properly
0:13:21 so you will be sitting at the table and
0:13:25 there are some choices that you'll be
0:13:26 needing to make At The Mention Of the
0:13:30 fact that we're going to Pendragon's
0:13:32 Manor Neil's eyes focus a little bit and
0:13:35 flick over directly at BR for the moment
0:13:38 baa is more focused on Miles there's the
0:13:42 mention of the war council plans that
0:13:44 need to be made and Neil sees BR trying
0:13:48 to give
0:13:50 miles a flicker
0:13:52 of it's meant to be an encouraging smile
0:13:55 but of course she's not sure of it kind
0:13:58 kind of turning her body to indicate
0:14:01 that she'd be receptive to
0:14:04 conversation but she sees his body
0:14:06 positioning and she's not ready to push
0:14:08 miles can feel it so he lets it go I
0:14:15 don't know what is going to be asked
0:14:18 here
0:14:19 yet seems like there have been plans
0:14:22 made without me being in on them to some
0:14:25 degree so I'm going to find out like the
0:14:28 rest of you what we're going to be asked
0:14:29 to
0:14:30 do do you think some of the plans that
0:14:33 we' got over we might be able to adapt
0:14:35 them for
0:14:36 this I don't know seems like most of our
0:14:40 plans were just a a bait and switch for
0:14:43 Pendragon to declare his open season on
0:14:47 New
0:14:49 York we'll do what we
0:14:52 can I still don't like the idea of
0:14:54 sacrificing any particular City but
0:14:55 we'll see
0:14:57 what information is is in front of
0:15:00 us br's eyes flick over to Neil like she
0:15:04 wants to ask him a
0:15:06 question and she
0:15:09 bites down on her words she isn't quite
0:15:14 willing to call attention to him just
0:15:17 yet look like he can't quite help
0:15:19 himself when BR looks over he just
0:15:24 says uh maybe maybe if we're going to be
0:15:26 there we can get your jacket back
0:15:29 like he can't quite focus on the larger
0:15:30 stuff and he definitely can't focus on
0:15:32 miles but his he's just focusing in on
0:15:35 one little potential Silver Lining he
0:15:39 might be able to control in some way R
0:15:43 how exactly did you leave on terms with
0:15:45 Pendragon last time you saw
0:15:47 him br's brain has to reconfigure that
0:15:51 question uh the separation between the
0:15:54 tone of this moment and whatever memory
0:15:58 that
0:15:59 her mind goes back to
0:16:02 is
0:16:04 Stark
0:16:07 um I'd say the Rave made things a
0:16:11 lot
0:16:13 better we
0:16:16 um her eyes flick not just to toie but
0:16:21 to
0:16:22 Johnny to
0:16:24 Neil not so much miles she almost
0:16:29 kind of shrinks more in miles's
0:16:31 Direction like she feels that's uh the
0:16:36 person covering her back in this it is
0:16:39 apparent that you do have sight line to
0:16:42 both Neil and miles and their eyes but
0:16:46 position Johnny's in and the way he's
0:16:47 sitting it is impossible to see the
0:16:50 expression on his face oh and because
0:16:53 and and something might be weird is is
0:16:55 normally when you're in the back seat
0:16:57 Johnny's in the driver's seat you can
0:16:58 usually see his eyes in the mirror and
0:17:01 it's kind of uncomfortable seeing him in
0:17:03 the passenger seat here where he is
0:17:06 [ __ ] it is unreadable to see what's
0:17:08 on his face all you can see is just kind
0:17:11 of the
0:17:12 the the you know yellowish smoke kind of
0:17:17 rising up from the uh from the
0:17:20 cigarette
0:17:22 um Prince pandragon and I talked and
0:17:27 it seemed to go well so I think
0:17:30 that's
0:17:33 better um you don't have to really go
0:17:36 into anything about what the two of you
0:17:38 have going on but is there anything that
0:17:41 we should be concerned about with how
0:17:43 he's going to act or treat or anything
0:17:48 that we can do to help you with that BR
0:17:51 weighs her options looking around at the
0:17:53 car but she hears Johnny's question in
0:17:57 seriousness and and there's some
0:18:01 unwillingness to speak uh that she just
0:18:04 has to swallow down because she's not
0:18:06 willing to not say this even if there's
0:18:10 some strange archon in the
0:18:12 car
0:18:14 um we we kind of more than talked
0:18:20 and that that's
0:18:22 um that's not something I I want you
0:18:24 guys to be worried about because that's
0:18:27 your business I just that's something
0:18:30 he's been respectful about and I don't I
0:18:33 know you guys are protective and I
0:18:36 appreciate that I I I know
0:18:38 why it's
0:18:42 just
0:18:44 um despite everything despite the
0:18:49 strangeness of everything that we go
0:18:51 through the all of the possible Horrors
0:18:55 and everything that isn't right
0:18:57 everything that that we need to
0:19:00 navigate I feel I can trust him in that
0:19:05 way I get if you think that's stupid but
0:19:09 Johnny turns back so you can see his
0:19:11 eyes I don't think it's stupid at all if
0:19:15 you're confident he's being respectful
0:19:18 and you like that you don't need any
0:19:20 backup you're good kid I just want to
0:19:23 make sure you get a chance to let us
0:19:24 know if if there's anything we can do to
0:19:26 give you back up there he will spend a
0:19:29 point of willpower to extend iron heart
0:19:32 to you for the duration of what's going
0:19:34 on there is an odd spread of emotion
0:19:38 like the Iron Heart catches her in the
0:19:39 middle of it right at the beginning of
0:19:42 it there is this burst of guilt and
0:19:46 self-consciousness that probably due to
0:19:48 this being the first time she's talking
0:19:50 about it and there is all of the
0:19:53 awkwardness of a daughter talking to her
0:19:56 dad about sex
0:19:58 it's not that simple of course there's a
0:20:00 lot of conflict I brda is feeling almost
0:20:04 ready to be judged right there's there
0:20:07 there's an understanding of the weight
0:20:09 of her Admissions and the complexity of
0:20:13 the situation that she is admitting to
0:20:15 and the man she's admitting to it with
0:20:19 but as you imbue her with iron heart and
0:20:22 you demonstrate your acceptance and your
0:20:25 trust that bravery bolsters her
0:20:28 and all those feelings remain they just
0:20:32 convolute into gratitude and uh
0:20:36 relief and Brea kind of sags and lets
0:20:42 out a waving but true
0:20:46 smile I
0:20:49 I thanks Johnny of course
0:20:52 good I know that makes
0:20:55 some Neil I still appreciate you coming
0:20:59 for me it made me feel safer when I was
0:21:02 he's going to separate us
0:21:03 again all of us well I me all of us he's
0:21:06 going to separate you from all of us
0:21:09 I need you if this is what you want to
0:21:12 tell
0:21:13 me specifically that you don't want
0:21:19 anyone to come for you if that's what
0:21:21 you
0:21:21 want I need you to tell me uh explicitly
0:21:26 specifically that you you don't
0:21:29 need us want us to to to come for you or
0:21:32 to be there because he's going to get
0:21:35 you alone
0:21:37 again I really I need you to know that I
0:21:40 appreciate you protecting me and I don't
0:21:45 want to ignore the words of warning I I
0:21:47 don't mean to push anything that
0:21:50 anyone's done for me in the situation
0:21:52 aside it like I said it could be foolish
0:21:56 but Mom
0:22:01 I feel something and I want to explore
0:22:04 that
0:22:06 feeling I really do I
0:22:08 I I'm okay with being alone with
0:22:12 him and I am I don't want you to come
0:22:16 for me and I I am uh there's things I
0:22:20 want to feel before all this goes
0:22:24 down you you know the look on Neil's
0:22:27 face he very clearly does not know but
0:22:31 doesn't say anything to like countermand
0:22:34 her it makes me feel
0:22:38 um I hope you're not mad at me
0:22:40 especially with you trying to help me
0:22:44 and Elsa trying to help me and Elsa's
0:22:49 final request was for me to get you away
0:22:52 away from him
0:22:54 but
0:22:56 I sometimes we have to
0:23:00 trust that each of us knows sometimes
0:23:03 what's best for the other so I that's
0:23:08 what you want that's that's that's fine
0:23:10 it's not like we could do anything about
0:23:12 it in his own house anyways try to get
0:23:14 your jacket back though I think I can
0:23:16 get my jacket back Neil and BR is very
0:23:19 clearly saying that like to try to give
0:23:21 Neil and anchor the mavian is very like
0:23:25 he's upset things are not going wrong
0:23:27 and seems very clearly focused on like
0:23:30 like material anchors to an outof
0:23:33 control World maybe it doesn't make
0:23:35 sense but he protected me from dark
0:23:40 Selena I feel safe with him so please
0:23:44 know it's
0:23:45 okay I'll let you know if I ever don't
0:23:49 feel like that okay Neil looks like he's
0:23:52 going to say something else and then
0:23:53 leans forward and looks at the archon
0:23:55 driveing the car doesn't say anything
0:23:58 and sort of sits back in the seat and
0:24:00 starts looking out the window by the way
0:24:03 speaking of dark Selena if she ever
0:24:06 comes and takes me away you absolutely
0:24:08 have my my permission to come for my ass
0:24:11 I had already made that decision yeah I
0:24:12 don't think it's a good idea i'
0:24:14 appreciate it it's yeah I I'd already BR
0:24:17 might not have otherwise been able to
0:24:18 laugh the joke but you can almost hear
0:24:20 the echo of your own Iron Heart and the
0:24:23 giggle that manages to come out Milo
0:24:26 Smiles a little bit at that looking at
0:24:28 the window but he's clearly just not
0:24:30 wanting to talk about all of the things
0:24:33 that just happened and from all the way
0:24:37 back through the beginning of the night
0:24:40 until now and he's just waiting to see
0:24:43 which Hammer is going to drop next it
0:24:46 can he knew it was coming sooner or
0:24:49 later he's been doing what he could to
0:24:50 keep it off but here we are Johnny um
0:24:55 stubs out his morally into a little ash
0:24:58 tray in the center
0:25:00 console pops another cigarette into his
0:25:03 mouth and turns to Tully you smoke she
0:25:06 shakes her head nope not anymore fair
0:25:10 enough well if you change your mind and
0:25:12 he puts the uh cigarettes down on the
0:25:14 center console just in case she wants
0:25:17 one like five minutes in she kind of
0:25:20 gives us like shrug picks up a cigarette
0:25:23 and lights
0:25:25 it I just um
0:25:28 I know exactly from my own
0:25:32 perspective what it's like to have to
0:25:34 walk into a car like that and I can't
0:25:36 stop thinking about
0:25:40 when when's tough as hell she'll be all
0:25:44 right
0:25:46 is what happens when you become an
0:25:49 archon the justicar wanted her for three
0:25:52 nights it says everything I think you
0:25:54 need to know BR kind of soggs into her
0:25:56 chair as she realizes what Neil
0:26:00 means tell you work for
0:26:03 lend I work for Yan Peterson and the
0:26:05 Jans but yes what has been implied is
0:26:11 true
0:26:13 it's something like
0:26:16 this I
0:26:18 think I think externally I think
0:26:20 throughout the
0:26:22 camia you know people are going to see
0:26:24 this as a as a promotion or as a as a
0:26:27 reward for win or or whatever but I
0:26:29 think the people in this car need to
0:26:31 remember need to understand that this
0:26:33 was her worst
0:26:36 nightmare we can't forget that this is
0:26:38 this is exactly everything she didn't
0:26:42 didn't want to happen and I mean she
0:26:44 only stuck around and this is only
0:26:46 happening
0:26:48 because
0:26:51 she we need to remember she didn't want
0:26:54 this no matter what she says going
0:26:57 forward
0:26:58 forward even if there's not a damn thing
0:27:00 we can do about it I know Adventure
0:27:03 do but she's not going to know better
0:27:06 than all the rest of you she's not going
0:27:09 to remember miles I know
0:27:12 that that's why I'm saying we need to
0:27:15 there's only so much we can
0:27:17 do we'll see what we can do later do you
0:27:21 think we'll get to see her
0:27:23 tonight maybe I don't think so but is
0:27:28 the justic car attending the war meeting
0:27:31 at Prince Pendragon's estate she's
0:27:34 expected to be present yes just others
0:27:36 will be fighting in New York I think
0:27:38 it's likely we'll probably see her
0:27:40 whether we can talk to her or not that's
0:27:42 a whole different
0:27:43 story and if we can't talk to her
0:27:47 answers a whole bunch of [ __ ]
0:27:48 questions about what's going on in that
0:27:51 car
0:27:53 ride I know we don't have wi here but I
0:27:56 don't know how many more chances we're
0:27:58 going to get
0:28:00 to to talk as a group it's not the whole
0:28:04 Coterie but we're in this
0:28:09 together nothing we say at Pendragons
0:28:12 is going to be private from the minute
0:28:14 we step on that on the grounds of his
0:28:17 domain nothing we say is private I'm not
0:28:20 talking about private I just
0:28:22 mean this is really when things get bad
0:28:25 right so
0:28:28 We're In It
0:28:31 Together things going to be tough I
0:28:33 don't think they're going to be that bad
0:28:35 we got much worse on the
0:28:38 horizon I mean the saat are sending all
0:28:42 the shovel heads right at
0:28:43 miles so it's
0:28:46 coming hey tly I remember you you were
0:28:49 at the Rave weren't
0:28:50 you that's correct I don't think I
0:28:53 remember Travis being there though was
0:28:56 Travis there
0:28:58 Travis was present under different
0:29:00 identity I gota gotta so how long the
0:29:04 two of you Nars been assigned to
0:29:05 watching us ever since the attack that
0:29:08 happened at the NOS fru
0:29:10 estate
0:29:13 gotcha have you been in the
0:29:16 city that's
0:29:18 correct so you you mind sharing what
0:29:22 your assignment was were you just
0:29:23 watching us to keep give us a uh a hand
0:29:27 on things
0:29:30 or we were to monitor resistance against
0:29:35 the uh sabat and uh
0:29:39 any um Gehan cult activities taking
0:29:44 place within the domain pra is listening
0:29:49 even she's hiding to whatever extent she
0:29:52 can hide that that really perks up her
0:29:54 attention but she feels
0:29:58 very nervous about
0:30:02 that Neil you had implied that
0:30:07 was a kale boox set up by War what was a
0:30:12 Oh War yeah um the it just all moves in
0:30:16 the Jihad War knew that the sabat were
0:30:18 coming to attack the gala he lured pend
0:30:21 Drang in there so he could die that's
0:30:24 why all the Nas ratu and a lot of the
0:30:25 mcavans escaped um
0:30:29 why a lot of the toy Ador didn't mhm it
0:30:33 was it was just a uh using Elders using
0:30:37 the the sabat attacks to off their
0:30:39 rivals or attempting to maybe that's
0:30:43 why maybe that's why War let me
0:30:48 go cuz he thought I would die with
0:30:51 Prince pandragon knowing the way the
0:30:53 elders think he probably didn't care
0:30:55 either you died or you didn't and he
0:30:57 could get you
0:30:58 later not to be Cavalier but trying to
0:31:01 think the way that ERS
0:31:05 think that I'm it's also why they left
0:31:08 faster behind because they didn't care
0:31:10 about
0:31:13 him it's not that they were helpless
0:31:16 like like I
0:31:18 was they just didn't
0:31:23 care so let me get this straight tell
0:31:26 you
0:31:27 you got to the city after that whole
0:31:30 mess in Rhode
0:31:32 Island that's correct and you're so two
0:31:37 bruha archons got sent to New Haven
0:31:40 didn't make themselves known didn't help
0:31:43 out in any way just to observe how the
0:31:45 resistance was going and to look out for
0:31:48 ganna Cults that's
0:31:50 correct all right it's an interesting
0:31:53 use of resources
0:31:55 there it's not not uncommon in terms of
0:32:00 compartmentalization so what that says
0:32:02 to me is that you really didn't give a
0:32:03 [ __ ] about how the resistance was going
0:32:06 you were here just to look out for Gehan
0:32:10 cols if you're asking if my presence was
0:32:14 motivated by some desire to save the day
0:32:17 and be em emotionally driven towards
0:32:21 looking out for my pals no that's not
0:32:23 why I was there I was there because I
0:32:25 was assigned to be there to complete a
0:32:26 task I did that yeah no obviously I'm
0:32:30 just curious as to why the [ __ ] you guys
0:32:33 are concerned about
0:32:35 kults the Coterie that you are with and
0:32:38 other Kindra within the domain had lost
0:32:41 some of the trust of the camara's
0:32:43 leaders we were there to see if any of
0:32:46 these rumors were
0:32:48 founded we found that all of them were
0:32:51 it isn't that the camria didn't want to
0:32:53 help you it is that the camria could not
0:32:55 trust you what rumors exactly we talking
0:32:58 about Neil
0:33:01 right yeah do you have any copies of the
0:33:03 book of Nod
0:33:05 yeah none on
0:33:07 me do any members of recorder have a
0:33:10 black crescent moon on their
0:33:12 Palm
0:33:14 yeah yeah miles Diablo has an elder of
0:33:17 his own
0:33:18 Clan Johnny looks back at Miles what
0:33:21 about it was there talk of gehenna on
0:33:24 the rooftop and other places it must be
0:33:28 see the funny thing though is
0:33:31 that the that book of
0:33:34 Nod that was uh material that we
0:33:37 recovered from
0:33:39 Shaw was it
0:33:41 destroyed I think it was it was given
0:33:44 over to the people that needed to see it
0:33:45 in the domain it was sent to archon
0:33:47 Peterson's office
0:33:49 yeah so we we told you about that yes
0:33:53 and then he sent
0:33:55 archons right
0:33:58 archon's looking for us archon's
0:34:01 monitoring the domain monitoring the
0:34:06 domain so we as a Coterie rooted out
0:34:11 people with the book of Nod report to
0:34:13 the people we're supposed to and then
0:34:15 you watch us from the Shadows do you
0:34:18 believe that you reported
0:34:19 everything at the time yeah I think we
0:34:22 did believe you've reported everything
0:34:24 since I believe we have
0:34:28 and I think that maybe we could we would
0:34:30 have been better equipped to deal with
0:34:31 this [ __ ] if you assisted us and told us
0:34:34 maybe some of the things we should have
0:34:35 been looking out for instead of hiding
0:34:38 around your prince was given his
0:34:41 instructions that was what he needed I
0:34:43 think you freaking Josie and archons
0:34:45 botched this whole thing up and created
0:34:47 a situation for yourselves it's it's not
0:34:51 their fault is it not I think they could
0:34:53 have been they could have assisted us
0:34:55 and things would be a lot more in hand
0:34:56 it's got to be exhausting but we to be a
0:34:59 josian right now it's got to be
0:35:00 exhausting to hide in the shadows
0:35:01 probably no
0:35:04 Johnny
0:35:06 Jos correct me if I'm wrong Aron Stamp
0:35:10 Out G
0:35:12 aults and it's got to be an exhausting
0:35:14 job right
0:35:16 now they have to be stretched so so thin
0:35:20 right now it has to be exhausting it
0:35:22 can't be entirely their fault and you
0:35:25 guys didn't report the moon on my hand
0:35:29 so I don't even understand what that
0:35:31 [ __ ] means it's a sabat symbol as far
0:35:34 as I know my sire had a sabat moon on
0:35:37 his hand it's it's brda respectfully I
0:35:43 don't care what the [ __ ] the Moon
0:35:46 is but the camaria does well then they
0:35:50 should have told me more about that
0:35:53 trust is a commodity that doesn't
0:35:55 spend well we we learned that after
0:35:58 reporting the [ __ ] B book a nod to
0:36:00 Jan Pieterzoon trust and respect is a
0:36:03 two-way street it's been going one way
0:36:06 for a long [ __ ] time and now I think
0:36:08 the Street's [ __ ] closed
0:36:11 I I still can't entirely blame the
0:36:16 archons when the justic car says don't
0:36:18 look
0:36:19 up you can't look
0:36:23 up
0:36:25 um
0:36:27 speak speaking of speaking of trust
0:36:33 um I'm
0:36:34 sorry well I'm sorry you found out
0:36:40 you it's not what
0:36:42 I the whole point is you were never
0:36:45 supposed to find out and I'm sorry that
0:36:47 that's where you
0:36:55 are I wasn't supposed to find out no
0:37:00 defeated the entire
0:37:04 purpose I did it so that you I don't
0:37:06 want to talk about this now we get
0:37:08 through this Siege we'll talk about
0:37:12 it
0:37:15 okay BR slowly leans a bit
0:37:19 over offering a hand out to Miles he
0:37:23 visibly moves away from you he does not
0:37:26 want to and be touched he's not looking
0:37:29 anyone brda doesn't seem him offended
0:37:32 there's a slight pause as she registers
0:37:34 the reaction and moves back into her
0:37:38 space we're still
0:37:40 needed we still have a city to
0:37:42 defend and we'll see what happens
0:37:46 next we'll keep on giving it our best
0:37:52 effort good the Aron says
0:38:01 when your Coterie is gone and it is
0:38:05 just you her power and two of her
0:38:10 vassels she doesn't really look at you
0:38:13 but about 10 minutes into the journey
0:38:16 she
0:38:17 says you wish to speak
0:38:20 Aron am I able to yep I wanted to ride
0:38:24 with my people unfortunate
0:38:28 why wasn't that acceptable because we
0:38:30 are going to have a conversation and
0:38:32 that couldn't wait no she holds her
0:38:34 wrist out and you feel compelled to
0:38:36 drink can I make a willpower challenge
0:38:38 to try and resist you may not this is
0:38:41 oppressive and demonstrous
0:38:44 behavior but to her it seems totally
0:38:47 routine that's the worst part so
0:38:51 when dying a little
0:38:55 inside question
0:38:57 if I bite do I have to be gentle or as
0:39:00 long as I'm following the order it
0:39:01 doesn't matter how your free will is
0:39:04 suppressed you will essentially obey
0:39:08 what she is making you do to the best of
0:39:10 your ability with best
0:39:13 intentions her mind screaming at her
0:39:16 to use her fangs fill this woman with
0:39:20 Venom rake her claws down her arm so
0:39:24 long as she's dripping let's be
0:39:25 maliciously compliant
0:39:27 but her body will
0:39:29 not
0:39:31 follow and when feels the cage around
0:39:34 her getting
0:39:36 smaller your body betrays you and once
0:39:40 she has decided you have enough you were
0:39:43 given new instructions and she says
0:39:46 maintain eye contact with
0:39:48 me and you do so and she meets your eyes
0:39:52 this woman is seems very young and again
0:39:54 you see those when when she an important
0:39:57 note is when she removes her red leather
0:40:00 glove to have you drink from her wrist
0:40:03 there is a mark upon her hand and you
0:40:06 recognize it to be the mark of the beast
0:40:09 do you have any um academics yes I do
0:40:13 okay Al you can May roll intelligence
0:40:14 academics the difficulty is
0:40:17 seven two successes with two successes
0:40:20 you are aware that the mark of the beast
0:40:23 is something of a legend
0:40:27 among the camria it is said that uh long
0:40:32 ago not terribly long ago but long
0:40:35 enough there was a follower of set who
0:40:41 made all kinds of
0:40:44 Mayhem when posing as the ventu justar
0:40:49 she had infiltrated the camia so
0:40:51 thoroughly that she was posing as a
0:40:54 justicar when exposed in response to
0:40:57 this there was a list made of the Most
0:41:00 Wanted Kindred on the planet the most
0:41:04 hated enemies of the Camara for whom a
0:41:07 global blood hunt was not
0:41:10 enough a task force was made to hunt and
0:41:14 eliminate these
0:41:16 Kindred and those who bear the mark of
0:41:19 the beast are their
0:41:21 Hunters the setite was named
0:41:25 ctii and when she posed as
0:41:30 justicar Luc sind was her Chief
0:41:33 archon and now Luc sind Bears the mark
0:41:37 of the beast first among
0:41:40 Alister the organization within the
0:41:43 camria who is dedicated to hunting the
0:41:45 members of what is known as the red list
0:41:49 in order to be a member of the red list
0:41:51 you must be one of the most dangerous
0:41:54 vampires that the camria has to offer do
0:41:56 I know any names from it list from the
0:41:58 list other than they are largely unknown
0:42:00 gotcha they are just these quiet figures
0:42:02 that show up to cities to hunt vampires
0:42:05 who are thought to be impossible to kill
0:42:08 if they're even
0:42:11 vampires
0:42:13 Aron you have a
0:42:17 mission Prince Davenport has been deemed
0:42:20 too unreliable and dangerous for Kindred
0:42:25 Society on too many occasions he has
0:42:27 betrayed our values when it suits
0:42:29 him and therefore he is to be destroyed
0:42:34 executed for his
0:42:35 crimes and due
0:42:38 to the camara's needs in terms of morale
0:42:42 it was deemed that this would not be
0:42:43 happening before the siege of New
0:42:45 Haven
0:42:47 however we have on good authority that
0:42:49 you Haven with him that he trusts you to
0:42:53 rest with
0:42:54 him that when he is in his most
0:42:56 vulnerable States you are close
0:43:01 by when this opportunity presents itself
0:43:05 after the siege of New
0:43:07 Haven you are to slay miles
0:43:14 Davenport [ __ ] you you try you try so
0:43:19 hard to stand up to her and protect
0:43:22 miles and be who when cabitt is
0:43:27 but as she meets your
0:43:29 gaze your body does not obey
0:43:33 you it exists at this elder vent's
0:43:38 whim know this wind
0:43:42 cabin every evil you thought the camria
0:43:45 was capable of it is and
0:43:49 more you will destroy miles Davenport
0:43:54 and in doing so
0:43:56 you will redeem the rest of your
0:43:58 Coterie for its crimes against the
0:44:01 camria they too are found
0:44:06 guilty there is not enough
0:44:09 venom inside wi to match how much is in
0:44:14 her
0:44:16 eyes for a moment
0:44:19 as her
0:44:21 power talks and con continues to
0:44:26 spue this vital against the only people
0:44:29 that
0:44:31 have given win reason to
0:44:36 live when for a moment
0:44:39 feels herself back on the night of her
0:44:43 Embrace holding
0:44:45 her terribly prematurely born baby in
0:44:48 her hands and
0:44:51 Powerless to
0:44:52 save her
0:44:54 daughter
0:44:58 and her body
0:45:01 completely at the
0:45:03 hands of someone else once
0:45:08 again everything is ripping apart inside
0:45:13 her Neil was very right there
0:45:16 is there has been no healing there has
0:45:19 just been
0:45:22 covering and all the
0:45:24 covers
0:45:27 fragment
0:45:30 tear
0:45:32 Decay with each
0:45:34 word that this woman
0:45:39 speaks and unable to do anything
0:45:43 else she wants so
0:45:47 much to just rake her claws across her
0:45:52 own
0:45:54 throat so that she cannot follow these
0:46:00 orders and all that
0:46:02 happens his Tears of
0:46:06 Blood flood down her
0:46:11 face and she tries very hard to stick up
0:46:14 a middle finger and it's just not
0:46:16 happening and even that small Act of
0:46:22 rebellion that death that when had
0:46:26 bearded for so long that she didn't want
0:46:30 to be like the Gangrel that exists and
0:46:32 have stopped
0:46:36 living and she feels herself
0:46:40 becoming this animate
0:46:45 husk rended
0:46:49 apart and all she's permitted to
0:46:52 do is give a small nod
0:46:57 you will keep this matter close to your
0:47:00 chest and conceal the truth of your
0:47:02 intentions from all members of your
0:47:05 quoty and Beyond it is our
0:47:09 secret I will give
0:47:12 you two small
0:47:15 gifts as a reward for your service
0:47:19 Aron first I relieve you of
0:47:22 responsibility for what must be done you
0:47:25 you have no choice you have no means of
0:47:28 circumventing
0:47:29 it you will obey you will see this
0:47:33 mission to its
0:47:35 completion and when your loved
0:47:38 ones mourn the passing of
0:47:42 miles you will at least know that you
0:47:44 could not stop
0:47:46 it and she rests her hand over yours and
0:47:50 she pulls it away nothing happens when
0:47:53 she desperately tries to pull away and
0:47:56 the mission becomes a
0:47:59 Dominate and then she
0:48:03 says do not discuss
0:48:06 this and your recollection of this
0:48:11 conversation becomes
0:48:14 Unshackled chained
0:48:17 down and you are given intrinsic
0:48:20 knowledge that should you speak of this
0:48:23 or try to speak with this you'll be
0:48:26 racked with horrific debilitating pain
0:48:30 and will never successfully reveal
0:48:34 it she takes her hand off your
0:48:39 hand she gives a slow
0:48:42 nod and the other two archons who had
0:48:45 been quiet up until this
0:48:48 point begin to introduce themselves to
0:48:51 you the first one
0:48:53 says welcome to the team
0:48:56 his tone is
0:48:57 grim and you kind of you can kind of
0:49:00 tell there's this acknowledgment of your
0:49:03 circumstances though he's been there
0:49:05 himself at some point can she flip him
0:49:07 off yes she does so you could have
