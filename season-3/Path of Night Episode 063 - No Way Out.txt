0:00:29 [Music]
0:00:36 last time on path of night
0:00:39 a quarter reads October what they've
0:00:40 been through well apart after some
0:00:42 conflict they rallied just as Ira
0:00:45 returns to the group
0:00:49 [Music]
0:01:01 [Music]
0:01:04 thank you
0:01:09 [Music]
0:01:23 there is a knock at the door
0:01:26 Ira is standing there holding like two
0:01:30 cartons of morleys
0:01:33 I figured it was
0:01:34 polite to just
0:01:37 knock instead of coming in I yeah also
0:01:41 apparently miles doesn't believe in
0:01:42 security and doesn't have a people so
0:01:44 she opens the door why the hell does he
0:01:47 not something about computers I don't
0:01:49 need computers it's a okay hearing all
0:01:52 this Brita goes into the kitchen to try
0:01:54 to wash the blood off her face when kind
0:01:57 of steps out of the way and motions for
0:01:59 him to come in Ira walks in and just
0:02:02 comes into the lounge and as he does he
0:02:05 tosses a carton of morallys towards
0:02:08 Johnny Johnny catches the uh the carton
0:02:11 Smiles a big grin uh and takes the cigar
0:02:15 that he was uh nursing and puts it out
0:02:18 in an ashtray nearby courtesy of Clinton
0:02:21 tremeer we're almost becoming friends
0:02:23 Zyra dude you better be careful he does
0:02:27 not smile opens the other carton pulls a
0:02:31 single pack out and then tosses the
0:02:34 second pass second carton to Johnny and
0:02:38 says and
0:02:40 this one's from me Johnny catches the
0:02:42 second carton kind of looks at the first
0:02:46 one and goes all right fine you can have
0:02:50 the premiere ones back then enhance the
0:02:52 first carton back to him Ira puts a hand
0:02:54 up and just shrugs and goes keep it for
0:02:57 the house then I was telling miles I
0:03:00 need to keep the house stocked I'll go
0:03:02 over and put him in a drawer he reaches
0:03:04 a hand slowly inside his coat
0:03:08 and then pulls out a small book
0:03:11 for win or like a small book and then
0:03:15 hands it sort of towards win
0:03:17 stopped at a used bookstore while I was
0:03:20 out
0:03:22 Sheriff you and I
0:03:24 didn't always completely see eye to eye
0:03:27 but I thought this might be a
0:03:30 mending of bridges a bit wind kind of
0:03:34 reaches out and takes the book a little
0:03:36 what what do now this this does not
0:03:39 compute but she just but I thank you the
0:03:43 book is a uh history of thales of
0:03:48 melitus I don't know if I'm saying that
0:03:50 right but uh the first Greek philosopher
0:03:53 who pontificated about uh science and
0:03:57 electricity and electrochemistry just
0:04:00 truly some academic nerd [ __ ] of like I
0:04:03 know you like philosophy so I got you an
0:04:05 electricity philosophy book oh no one
0:04:08 will love or say you don't have a sense
0:04:09 of humor
0:04:11 and she kind of like perches on the back
0:04:14 of the couch and Ira goes and sits down
0:04:17 in like one of the chairs there's like a
0:04:18 lot of chairs and couches around this
0:04:20 area right yeah in the general living
0:04:22 room dead area Bretta comes back in
0:04:25 pressing a hand towel to her face to dry
0:04:29 it off and finds a chair to curl up into
0:04:32 sorry if I'm interrupting the
0:04:36 conversation I'm sure everyone has a lot
0:04:39 to talk about
0:04:40 the girl where is she right now
0:04:43 sleeping okay good she's probably tired
0:04:48 I assume that's full of pizza funny
0:04:50 enough we were actually just starting to
0:04:51 talk about Clan premiere why'd you say
0:04:54 courtesy of
0:04:57 what the clearance it's like a shy nod
0:05:00 well
0:05:02 technically
0:05:03 all of my money comes from Clan Premiere
0:05:07 so if I bought them
0:05:09 Clint Premier bought them does that mean
0:05:12 you stole the other pack
0:05:14 I was hoping there would be sort of a
0:05:17 philosophical demarcation the gesture I
0:05:20 picked up on it thank you Johnny tears
0:05:22 open one of the car one of the packs
0:05:24 pulls out a cigarette and lights it up
0:05:26 as soon as Johnny lights up a cigarette
0:05:27 and says it's okay to smoke in the space
0:05:29 Ira opens the one pack that he pulled
0:05:31 out of the carton and also lights a
0:05:32 cigarette well regardless who it's from
0:05:35 still smokes like a Morley good wind
0:05:38 starts flipping through the book just
0:05:41 kind of so getting a little intoxicated
0:05:43 by the smell of an old book what were we
0:05:46 talking about Clan Premiere actually yes
0:05:50 that sort of the prompt of in what
0:05:53 Manner and capacity if I can answer
0:05:56 questions I will I think we were talking
0:05:59 about how much we can trust
0:06:01 Reiss and for that matter how much we
0:06:03 can trust you
0:06:05 you seem to be on the level for the most
0:06:07 part but the timing of you entering the
0:06:09 city's got everyone a little spooked I
0:06:11 think understandable you want to answer
0:06:13 to any of that as far as the timing is
0:06:16 concerned
0:06:18 I can't say much in my own defense how
0:06:22 does one defend against coincidence
0:06:25 I will say that I was glad that I was
0:06:27 here
0:06:28 I and he pauses and he looks thoughtful
0:06:31 for a little bit
0:06:33 I understand that I may have earned some
0:06:36 trust but not a great deal
0:06:39 I have perhaps a way to assuage you that
0:06:43 the things that I say are
0:06:45 true but paradoxically it is a ritual
0:06:48 that I would perform
0:06:52 so you would have to inherently trust
0:06:54 that I had performed the ritual and it
0:06:56 did what it said
0:06:57 unless sure if you're a learned
0:07:00 individual huh
0:07:01 have you ever heard of the bone of Lies
0:07:04 yeah I have two
0:07:07 I usually use them for interrogations
0:07:11 Beretta gives
0:07:13 a bit of a wide-eyed look at that
0:07:15 admission kind of like peeks over at
0:07:18 miles
0:07:19 I mean it's a legit way to verify he's
0:07:21 telling the truth admittedly I only have
0:07:24 a couple and
0:07:26 if I could be so bold
0:07:29 I have a few questions as to the
0:07:32 trustworthiness of some of you in this
0:07:34 room as well
0:07:35 I understand I'm the outsider here but
0:07:38 and his eyes specifically look at Brita
0:07:42 who is wiping the look of concern off
0:07:45 her face very slowly after miles seems
0:07:48 casual and then he also actually looks
0:07:50 at miles before kind of settling back
0:07:52 into a neutral case I'd be happy to
0:07:55 engage in a bit of quid pro quo you have
0:07:59 made a disadvantage though so if that's
0:08:02 not how you want this to go it's not how
0:08:04 it would go I'll leave that in your
0:08:06 hands Your Grace this is your domain and
0:08:09 your Haven remind me the bone doesn't
0:08:12 compel you to tell the truth if you lie
0:08:16 the bone will compel the truth but what
0:08:20 if you say I'm not answering that then
0:08:22 then I suppose that's not a lie for a
0:08:25 proper interrogation usually the powers
0:08:27 of all specs and
0:08:30 sometimes dominate are used in
0:08:32 conjunction in full honesty I won't do
0:08:36 either of those
0:08:38 I am trying to act in a spirit of trust
0:08:41 here
0:08:43 we can also
0:08:45 just have a conversation but again I'm
0:08:49 trying to
0:08:50 show that I am somewhat trustworthy I'm
0:08:52 interested to hear what exactly you mean
0:08:55 by quid pro quo with these bones I would
0:08:58 hold it you could ask me a question I
0:09:00 would be compelled to tell the truth or
0:09:02 at least that I could not tell you
0:09:05 then I passed the bone to one of you to
0:09:07 whom I have a question
0:09:08 I'll even if you want tell you the first
0:09:12 question that I would ask again I'm
0:09:14 trying to be
0:09:16 on the level
0:09:18 so to speak when kind of gives miles a
0:09:21 look
0:09:22 and trucks it's up to you I'm okay with
0:09:26 it if you guys think it's okay
0:09:28 I think the fact that we can say I'm not
0:09:30 talking about that there's no compulsion
0:09:32 to hold the bone
0:09:34 just drop it yeah just give me one of
0:09:37 your bones and ask me one of your
0:09:38 questions do you want to go first yeah I
0:09:41 was going to offer to okay calm yourself
0:09:44 win I regret it's just this book is so
0:09:47 goddamn funny I'm sure everyone looks
0:09:51 confused like pick a funny book and then
0:09:53 it's like oh okay yeah talking about
0:09:56 boning The Prince and he sort of Pats
0:09:59 his jacket pockets down and then pulls
0:10:01 out what looks like a human jawbone and
0:10:04 passes it over to Miles
0:10:06 use human bits for this kind of oh
0:10:11 Hal morbid it does not have to be a
0:10:13 Jawbone but ritualistically it's all I'm
0:10:18 going off on a tension yeah gotcha Your
0:10:21 Grace my question for you is can you
0:10:24 think of a reason that you would share
0:10:28 as to why your
0:10:31 katana
0:10:32 is Tainted with demonic magics
0:10:36 win is desperately minding her own
0:10:38 business reading that book
0:10:43 I didn't know it had an aura
0:10:46 Ira aware of sort of the generous nature
0:10:50 of how he worded that nods at like
0:10:53 okay miles gave me more of an answer
0:10:56 there than he needed to
0:10:58 and nods
0:11:00 well it does anyone with any form of
0:11:05 pharmaceutical sight would be able to
0:11:07 tell just by looking at your sword that
0:11:09 it has been touched by the Demonic so
0:11:12 you may want to
0:11:14 get rid of it
0:11:15 Brita gave Zyra a dubious look and then
0:11:18 miles the same dubious look she does not
0:11:20 think this is uh likely
0:11:23 laughs
0:11:24 this is not uh just a Mall katana
0:11:29 that I picked up casually
0:11:32 I'm aware
0:11:33 I am
0:11:35 familiar with the atomic structure of
0:11:37 the blade
0:11:39 it's good Steel
0:11:41 and it is also a beacon that you have
0:11:43 been in contact with the Unholy
0:11:47 which would be frowned upon should any
0:11:50 orcon or simply anyone who wishes to
0:11:54 hold things over you
0:11:56 there are factions of the camarilla who
0:11:59 would use it as an excuse to Snuff your
0:12:01 life if they saw it I'm aware of such
0:12:04 factions I just wanted to bring it to
0:12:06 your attention
0:12:08 so you can understand that a newly
0:12:10 minted prince in possession of a
0:12:13 demonically tainted blade
0:12:16 could
0:12:18 arouse
0:12:20 some mistrust can you get that
0:12:22 enchantment off
0:12:23 after a long pause of consideration Ira
0:12:27 just goes there may be a way where you
0:12:31 could keep it were you willing to let go
0:12:33 of the enchantment
0:12:36 could you put a better one on it not
0:12:38 with any form of permanency ah like how
0:12:40 long are we talking hours
0:12:43 hoping for a year
0:12:47 Ira gets this one the bone does not
0:12:50 darken
0:12:52 there's no way for literally anyone in
0:12:55 the codery to know this but Ira just
0:12:57 immediately flashes back to every tramir
0:13:00 who studies Alchemy bullying him for
0:13:01 having like trash transmutation
0:13:05 it's just like oh if you can help fix
0:13:08 this problem it would be appreciated
0:13:11 can do your grace
0:13:14 I put a the bone down on the table uh
0:13:17 Ira reaches for it and picks it up Jenny
0:13:20 Hannah smirks well you don't want to
0:13:21 hear questions from maybe first Ira puts
0:13:24 it back down on the table if you wish I
0:13:26 thought we were going back and forth but
0:13:28 Johnny picks up the uh the little
0:13:29 Jawbone kind of looks at it like it's a
0:13:31 trinket shoot honestly Central I didn't
0:13:35 have a lot of questions for you that's
0:13:37 what I thought he puts it back on the
0:13:39 table
0:13:41 [Laughter]
0:13:52 um
0:13:53 yeah Johnny you and I aren't uh aren't
0:13:55 known for holding our tongues so well
0:13:58 I'm uh gonna go get my guitar away guys
0:14:00 formulate your thoughts actually I'm
0:14:03 gonna go walk away basically oh you
0:14:06 actually thought of something I did he
0:14:07 picks the Jawbone back up
0:14:09 just for my own notification are you
0:14:11 bound to Lord Reiss
0:14:14 Reiss
0:14:17 did wake me up with his blood
0:14:19 without
0:14:22 using the path of blood he had the means
0:14:24 to do to do to get me up clean and he
0:14:27 decided to give me a little blood
0:14:31 at the Time Prince rolands thought that
0:14:34 this was just peachy powernauts well Mr
0:14:38 Reiss was the Santa shawl at the time
0:14:40 and I do recall that he used his uh
0:14:43 powers
0:14:45 on the ventral
0:14:47 puts the the Jawbone backed out on the
0:14:49 table I will reaches for it again so do
0:14:52 you have questions for me yep
0:14:54 please Sheriff when we were facing down
0:14:58 the dragon you looked scared but there
0:15:00 was a moment
0:15:02 in the fight
0:15:04 where you looked like you were five
0:15:06 years old and you had just broken your
0:15:09 mother's prized China Dish
0:15:12 what's that about Ira who was the one
0:15:15 who offered this little game and it was
0:15:19 like I got yeah let's play this uh did
0:15:22 not think that anyone caught that and is
0:15:24 not happy about it uh and that clearly
0:15:27 flashes across his face
0:15:29 Lord Reiss attempted to kill Eden in the
0:15:33 chaos and I intervened
0:15:36 ow
0:15:38 there's a ritual
0:15:40 chill of the windsaber
0:15:43 once it is enacted
0:15:45 by breaking a pane of glass while
0:15:47 looking at the Target
0:15:49 and this takes some time to prepare it
0:15:50 as an elder level ritual you said it
0:15:52 would cut his head off it would
0:15:55 decapitate the person it was targeted at
0:15:58 hey
0:16:01 it's sad
0:16:05 have a plus one die bonus to your frenzy
0:16:07 check thank you thank you yep
0:16:14 it is a single success with one success
0:16:17 you keep your beast in check you can
0:16:20 feel your anger and you can feel this
0:16:24 hungry animal kind of pain inside of you
0:16:28 side to side waiting for the chance to
0:16:30 kill Ira who has zero points in empathy
0:16:33 continues on not quite noticing
0:16:36 that protests
0:16:38 like murder staring at him Johnny who is
0:16:42 kind of smiling at the whole pageantry
0:16:44 of this silly little Jawbone event has
0:16:47 suddenly gotten very quiet and is
0:16:50 staring at Brita
0:16:52 waiting to see if she's gonna snap and
0:16:55 he has to intervene before she kills
0:16:56 someone how did you stop it how did you
0:16:59 know it was gonna happen through
0:17:02 thamaturgical sight I am trained to look
0:17:05 at
0:17:06 call it the weave of magic
0:17:09 as an elder level we're too old there is
0:17:11 no way to stop it
0:17:14 he was gonna have me kill her
0:17:16 but it didn't happen the amulet is not
0:17:20 an elder level ritual
0:17:22 it was through the amulet that he was
0:17:24 focusing on Eden
0:17:27 most individuals even most accomplished
0:17:30 tremeer would not have been able to do
0:17:33 anything
0:17:34 why
0:17:35 because once magic is enacted it is
0:17:38 based on the will of the user if the
0:17:40 will of the user is successful there is
0:17:42 no stopping it
0:17:43 unless
0:17:45 you have the means
0:17:48 and you have the means
0:17:50 I do
0:17:53 what are you actually doing here
0:17:57 in New Haven
0:17:59 could you please rephrase the question
0:18:02 what was I doing here or what am I doing
0:18:04 here first one then the other what were
0:18:07 you doing here in New Haven
0:18:09 investigating Lord Reiss
0:18:11 win while you're flipping through the
0:18:12 book
0:18:13 you stumble upon a loose piece of paper
0:18:16 or receipt with something scrawled on
0:18:18 the back of it when
0:18:21 curiosity kind of peaked at a random
0:18:25 treasure in a book in a used bookstore
0:18:27 book
0:18:28 lays off Ira for a second and peeks at
0:18:31 it the note says in Ira's handwriting
0:18:35 stop me
0:18:37 don't let me take her
0:18:42 in the lull when she's not questioning
0:18:45 Ira puts the bone down on the table and
0:18:48 looks at Brita maybe still not clocking
0:18:52 that she's like caged violence uh she's
0:18:55 certainly staring at you either way he
0:18:57 kind of stares back in a didn't set the
0:19:00 rules of this little engagement but I
0:19:02 have questions for the girl in The Tack
0:19:05 outfit who killed the premiere I think
0:19:08 about this time I come back with the
0:19:10 katana
0:19:11 does slowly get up and pick up the bone
0:19:15 why is it seemingly way worse than what
0:19:18 I left it
0:19:19 I spoke
0:19:21 what did you say
0:19:23 hurtful things apparently
0:19:25 apparently appointed questions I have a
0:19:28 book you should read Ira I'll be right
0:19:29 back apparently Rhys tried to kill Eden
0:19:33 when we were fighting the dragon he
0:19:36 cannot just stop can he no he can't oh
0:19:40 God
0:19:42 apparently IRA has some little tremeer
0:19:45 tricks up his sleeve that prevented him
0:19:47 from doing so well not clear exactly how
0:19:51 that happened sounds like that I piss
0:19:53 him off right and good
0:19:54 only a select few are given the training
0:19:57 to learn those tricks
0:19:59 the tremeer don't generally appreciate
0:20:02 those not totally loyal to the clan who
0:20:07 can counter what the clan can do my
0:20:10 experience Clan from here doesn't
0:20:12 appreciate a whole lot loyalty
0:20:16 dedication Focus study
0:20:21 well might as well
0:20:24 I'm Sorry Miss Ashcroft um as much as
0:20:27 I'm very curious to ask you a few
0:20:29 questions
0:20:30 as a point of emphasis
0:20:32 for what I'm about to say could I any
0:20:36 puts the hand out for the bomb Brita
0:20:37 does not hesitate in handing it back
0:20:40 Ira holds the bone and kind of fingers
0:20:43 the teeth inside the jaw just sort of
0:20:45 absent-mindedly
0:20:47 the premiere
0:20:49 appreciate loyalty much like the ventru
0:20:53 who have a rigid hierarchy who
0:20:56 appreciate loyalty to the clan
0:20:59 the premiere much the same the premiere
0:21:01 and the Ventura have long long been
0:21:03 allies
0:21:04 and Clan Premiere has built its
0:21:07 political strength as a relatively new a
0:21:10 relatively young clan in the grand
0:21:12 scheme
0:21:13 on its thermaturgical night
0:21:17 and
0:21:19 there are tricks
0:21:21 one could say almost an entire
0:21:23 discipline to itself
0:21:25 to counter
0:21:26 the ways of thomaturity
0:21:28 to stop magic unweave it in its tracks
0:21:32 but Clans from here obviously keeps an
0:21:36 extremely tight hold
0:21:38 if you're known to possess this ability
0:21:39 and are not one of what are known as the
0:21:41 asters
0:21:43 who are and Ira looks what gives like a
0:21:46 nostalgic smile almost
0:21:49 the boogeyman of Clan tramir sometimes
0:21:52 the entirety of the clan will hunt you
0:21:55 down
0:21:56 you will have made an enemy of all of
0:21:59 Clan Premiere and they will close ranks
0:22:03 from all their Petty squabbles
0:22:05 the same sort of thing happens when
0:22:07 there are rogue Thomas urges about those
0:22:09 who know the secrets of Clans ramir
0:22:12 those who know how to perform
0:22:15 pharmaturgy
0:22:18 particularly some of their
0:22:20 more dangerous paths
0:22:23 and if you break from the clan or if you
0:22:26 are found to have been trading these
0:22:28 secrets
0:22:29 if you do not show the loyalty to the
0:22:33 tremair that they appreciate
0:22:36 they will stop at nothing to hunt you
0:22:39 down
0:22:40 and they will send men like me
0:22:43 to find you
0:22:45 and to stop you
0:22:47 and there is very little that anyone can
0:22:50 do about it and at that moment wind pops
0:22:53 up from behind the couch with a broken
0:22:54 off wooden chair leg in her hand and
0:22:57 attempts to stake IRA
0:23:01 oh
0:23:02 when you've seized the edge and leaving
0:23:05 over the couch you're making your move
0:23:07 you have surprise you will take an
0:23:09 action and then everyone is going to be
0:23:12 rolling initiative you do have an
0:23:14 additional two-day bonus for uh doing it
0:23:16 from behind Okay when has pumped her
0:23:19 stats to try and give the edge in this
0:23:21 because melee is not where she is
0:23:23 strongest but absolutely you have the
0:23:25 ability to have taken time to prepare as
0:23:27 directed Eden is hiding
0:23:32 does my Swift spec count yeah it's fine
0:23:34 okay five successes four will carry over
0:23:37 into damage dice stake still plus one
0:23:39 day damage now before you move your dice
0:23:41 staking is definite ah then that is for
0:23:44 successes okay three will carry over
0:23:46 into damage dice stake steel strength
0:23:49 plus one die of damage so you do have an
0:23:51 additional die from that as well Ira
0:23:53 will also
0:23:55 against staking Ira currently has a 20
0:23:58 die soak pool
0:23:59 [Music]
0:24:03 um I will be spending for potents for an
0:24:05 additional level of damage I got uh
0:24:08 rolled a bunch of ones on the second
0:24:09 half so I got five successes so did I
0:24:12 the impact of the stake is absorbed he
0:24:15 has to take Eden incapacitate when as
0:24:18 you drive the stake towards it not only
0:24:20 does it feel like Ira's shirt is buffed
0:24:24 like he did for you guys in the Chantry
0:24:26 it's almost like his heart itself is
0:24:29 made of stone and now we roll initiative
0:24:33 spending two blood for Celerity Brita is
0:24:37 at a 12. miles spending two blood for
0:24:40 Celerity I will be at 19. do you roll
0:24:45 for your Katana because I very yes
0:24:47 specifically mentioned it so you would
0:24:48 go get it oh yeah no I definitely Quick
0:24:50 Draw that so I essentially just shoot
0:24:52 the sheath off and it's ready to go when
0:24:55 13. Johnny one blood for Celerity 15.
0:24:59 Ira spending my Readiness 26. Ira react
0:25:04 first on you Ira will stand up from the
0:25:07 couch as the sheriff attacks him from
0:25:10 behind and out loud says I knew I
0:25:13 couldn't trust any of you but on his
0:25:16 face it is very clearly a sort of look
0:25:19 of relief and like okay thank God she
0:25:23 understood me but it his words it's like
0:25:26 he's play acting at no one just in case
0:25:28 he's being watched sort of thing maybe
0:25:30 and then Lex he will I will spend for
0:25:33 dual thought and then he looks at what
0:25:36 to his estimate or the two most
0:25:39 dangerous or like unknown factors in the
0:25:41 room he saw the Senate all whoop [ __ ]
0:25:45 yesterday and specifically his ass even
0:25:47 by accident and also looks at Brita who
0:25:52 he didn't see do a lot of [ __ ] but was
0:25:55 with a crowd of people killing a bunch
0:25:57 of Tamir and so she's an unknown factor
0:25:58 so throws a handout at Johnny and we'll
0:26:03 use transmutation to harden the air
0:26:05 around himself or around him and then
0:26:08 reaches a hand into his coat pulls out a
0:26:11 Rowan wood stake and rips a cord off of
0:26:14 it and throws it at Brita is this your a
0:26:16 normal and dual thought yes for the rest
0:26:19 of the scene Johnny the air hardens
0:26:21 around you like a force field uh you
0:26:24 cannot move past it even with potence uh
0:26:27 you are trapped in place and because I
0:26:29 got seven successes on it it lasts for
0:26:31 the rest of the scene he throws the hand
0:26:33 out and crystallizes the air around
0:26:35 Johnny sort of trapping him in place
0:26:38 and then throws the stake not like he's
0:26:41 throwing it like a knife but like
0:26:42 underhand tosses it towards Brita and as
0:26:45 he pulls the cord off it sort of like
0:26:48 splinters a little bit to turn into a
0:26:50 little animate steak that launches
0:26:53 itself at her chest declaring Dodge now
0:26:55 yep
0:26:57 it's a lot of eights but it ain't a nine
0:26:58 so there are no successes on the attack
0:27:01 roll as the little stake like splinters
0:27:03 open and launches itself at your chest
0:27:05 British digestion is successful but
0:27:07 still spent correct still spent yes
0:27:09 however as it misses it does not seem to
0:27:12 be done it will still be coming at you
0:27:13 miles I will toss the sheath off of it
0:27:18 in in a smooth motion go for an upward
0:27:22 strike on him not quite understanding
0:27:24 the situation but watching win Attack
0:27:27 miles is in I have no actions to Dodge I
0:27:31 do not have Celerity Lex as his sword
0:27:33 comes at me can I reflexively counter
0:27:36 thumb to get that dark Thumb off yes you
0:27:38 may I don't want to run around with that
0:27:40 people he's gonna get in trouble
0:27:42 you're rolling versus one success then
0:27:45 uh easily get it okay Ira as the sword
0:27:48 comes in uh throws a hand up not
0:27:50 defensively but pulls the magic off of
0:27:52 it
0:27:55 six successes five will carry over into
0:27:58 damage my silk pool against not getting
0:28:00 staked is not as good
0:28:03 uh six successes though and you're Dyson
0:28:06 fire time huh yeah big hands counts for
0:28:08 this right big hands counts for this
0:28:12 nine I will take three and uh my shirt
0:28:17 is cut and Twain hot
0:28:21 uh as miles attacks him Ira looks at him
0:28:23 and just goes
0:28:24 I'm sorry about this your grace
0:28:27 but the girl can't stay here either she
0:28:30 comes with me or more will come for her
0:28:33 he's still kind of confused really
0:28:36 um Cairo looks extremely sad but like I
0:28:40 understand that I I need to be doing
0:28:42 this but also it is weird the amount of
0:28:45 magic that he's throwing out to be also
0:28:46 be taken down so very confused by all of
0:28:50 this
0:28:51 do you say anything
0:28:53 um he just kind of looks Resolute at
0:28:57 this point and just seeing if anybody
0:29:00 else has more information to throw it at
0:29:01 this point he's just he's moving in to
0:29:03 back up his team at this point and try
0:29:04 to figure it out understood Johnny
0:29:06 Johnny will let loose a Roar from inside
0:29:10 the prism that promises the threat of
0:29:13 ridiculous violence upon your dumbass
0:29:16 Premiere ass
0:29:19 um if I can use that to bolster my team
0:29:21 with uh perhaps some uh iron heart you
0:29:25 may spend a point of willpower and uh
0:29:27 stop tossing out Iron Heart Buffs hell
0:29:30 yeah
0:29:33 I don't think Miles needs it as much as
0:29:35 the other two but you're also down on
0:29:37 Willpower aren't you I am at half my
0:29:39 normal willpower yeah
0:29:42 yeah I'm gonna spend three willpower my
0:29:44 last three wheel power I'm gonna give
0:29:45 each guys each one of you guys a uh Iron
0:29:48 Heart bonus to resist mine affecting
0:29:50 thong I don't know that you have it but
0:29:52 there's another reason I got dominate
0:29:55 Johnny do you say anything no Johnny
0:29:58 just lets out just kind the kind of like
0:30:02 Angry Johnny Roar that the hairs on the
0:30:06 back of everyone's neck stand on end the
0:30:10 codery knows that this is a promise of
0:30:12 violence and it is inspiring to hear
0:30:15 that kind of Battle Cry for Ira
0:30:18 it is perhaps chilling in a way that he
0:30:23 has not experienced yet all right next
0:30:25 is win on 13. it's a win hearing
0:30:29 Johnny's Battle Cry and knowing that he
0:30:32 would be on this guy like like flies on
0:30:37 [ __ ]
0:30:38 when decides to take the spirit of what
0:30:42 Johnny is and she just leaps at IRA and
0:30:45 attempts to Grapple him X Plus brawl
0:30:48 [Music]
0:30:49 let me know if you have any successes
0:30:51 short answer yes he is grappled when
0:30:54 vaults off the back of the couch onto
0:30:57 IRA and just wraps her arms and legs
0:31:00 around him as tight as she can and
0:31:02 attempts to take his legs out from under
0:31:04 him but at minimum she is attempting to
0:31:06 hold on to him and keep him from being
0:31:08 able to move
0:31:11 thank you thank you that's what I was
0:31:13 going for
0:31:14 uh miles you're on Celebrity one
0:31:17 initiative 19. I'm gonna move to the
0:31:20 side and like stab him through
0:31:21 horizontally and just be like I really
0:31:24 don't want to be doing this in my house
0:31:25 I just got here my apologies you're
0:31:28 Grace this isn't what I wanted to be
0:31:31 spending my evening doing either yeah I
0:31:33 think we're all of One mind on that when
0:31:35 what the [ __ ] he's has to try and take
0:31:38 Eden incapacitate him I will not fail
0:31:44 Clan Premiere and Lord Reiss and he puts
0:31:48 particular emphasis on the word Lord I
0:31:51 stab him harder nine successes to attack
0:31:53 yeah it will carry over yeah
0:31:58 six I only got one
0:32:01 so I have one Health level remaining I
0:32:05 move to the side just a straight
0:32:08 sideways stab right through the middle
0:32:10 trying to kind of keep out a direct eye
0:32:13 line because I'm aware that that might
0:32:15 be a problem and I really don't know
0:32:17 what your generation is so I just know
0:32:20 that you have similar powers to my own
0:32:22 and I've seen you shrug off the presence
0:32:26 and chug an actual keg of blood well
0:32:29 yeah I figured that had some indicators
0:32:31 there were enough signs to know that Ira
0:32:34 at least has some blood [ __ ] yeah and
0:32:36 just be like
0:32:38 I sorry it came to this Ira grunt by the
0:32:42 way uh does not very clearly does not
0:32:44 have the I do not feel pain power up
0:32:47 like did not have a chance to cast that
0:32:50 so Grunts and looks extremely pained and
0:32:53 just through gritted teeth just says
0:32:56 I explained
0:32:59 what happens
0:33:00 to Rogue thunderges with my particular
0:33:03 skill set
0:33:04 and the tramir
0:33:07 will come for her
0:33:09 no she is here if she stays here
0:33:13 I have to take her well good thing we
0:33:16 got to you first
0:33:18 I shouldn't I've trusted you but when I
0:33:21 mean well you can't see his eyes so
0:33:23 Britain Johnny can see his eyes probably
0:33:25 right I don't know how much empathy
0:33:28 either one of you has or chooses to have
0:33:30 in this moment but uh his words say one
0:33:32 thing and his eyes say something
0:33:34 completely different honestly I'm
0:33:35 looking at this sick I'm not looking at
0:33:37 you neither one of you may notice Johnny
0:33:39 looks mad as hell Johnny's low on blood
0:33:41 and low on Willpower and he's very angry
0:33:43 the other two were actively avoiding my
0:33:45 eyes so so his Nuance of emotion and
0:33:48 empathy is limited hey you gotta you got
0:33:51 a wooden stick chasing me around that's
0:33:53 where my eyes are
0:33:56 speaking of I think we're on Celerity
0:33:58 Johnny yes we are Johnny so Johnny
0:34:00 understands that the write-up for this
0:34:01 spell says indestructible in other dumb
0:34:04 words but he's going to use strength
0:34:05 Athletics to break the [ __ ] out of this
0:34:07 prism
0:34:10 reusing uh strength Athletics to break
0:34:13 the hell out of this prison and I'm
0:34:15 gonna spend the blood to have uh
0:34:16 potent's ad uh successes
0:34:20 seven successes to break the [ __ ] out of
0:34:22 this prison you press through this
0:34:24 little liquid oxygen and feel the prism
0:34:28 kind of like almost crack but it doesn't
0:34:32 move it doesn't give Brita the Instinct
0:34:36 arises to grab something to put the
0:34:38 stake in but then Bretta the second
0:34:41 thought is to grab the steak give me Dex
0:34:44 plus brawl you're right difficulty nine
0:34:51 does graceful apply yes that is three
0:34:55 successes you grasp the steak in your
0:34:58 hand and you fill it splinters grasp at
0:35:01 your like a thumb and resist to the best
0:35:03 of its ability but you currently have it
0:35:05 held it's also awarded versus Kindred I
0:35:08 have gloves on I do not know if that
0:35:10 affects the scenario will not stop it I
0:35:11 need it it'll deal three levels of
0:35:13 damage I need you to rule soak
0:35:16 two successes you take one level of
0:35:17 lethal damage I need you to make a
0:35:19 self-control check
0:35:20 sizzles in your hand there is a cry of
0:35:23 pain and then her self-control is tested
0:35:26 are you spending a little Tower no I
0:35:28 have I don't know how long this is going
0:35:31 one success okay you maintain control of
0:35:34 your Beast so there's a cry of pain and
0:35:37 then Bretta reels herself back in and
0:35:41 she still seems confused but her
0:35:43 attention is fixated in that quickened
0:35:46 state that Celerity brings you towards
0:35:48 the tussle on the ground miles do you
0:35:50 still have actions you got one more I
0:35:51 have one more what are you doing
0:35:55 your grace
0:35:57 all I have to do is bring the girl and
0:36:01 make my report to the council
0:36:03 to see the downfall of Lord Reiss and my
0:36:07 own promotion
0:36:10 three to hit two will carry over into
0:36:13 damage
0:36:17 seven damage five soaked which is enough
0:36:21 to fill in that last one and put Ira
0:36:23 into torpor
0:36:24 he looks like he's going to say
0:36:27 something else partly play acting partly
0:36:30 pleading and then
0:36:33 the sword does what it does
0:36:39 and torper his skin tightens and he goes
0:36:45 very stiff crumbling to the ground as
0:36:48 this like dehydrated corpse when when he
0:36:52 goes to torp or when carefully puts her
0:36:56 feet down to make sure he doesn't go
0:36:58 crashing to the ground and kind of
0:37:00 gently lowers him to the ground
0:37:01 when he hits torpor does the effect on
0:37:04 Johnny stop and does the sake stop no
0:37:07 would you like us to continue that in a
0:37:09 round yes you are still in combat you've
0:37:12 only taken one Celerity action so it's
0:37:13 still a year ago okay
0:37:15 so with her last Celerity action and
0:37:18 holding this painful warded stake I
0:37:23 would like to break it if I can feel
0:37:24 that there's a life within it it is
0:37:26 animated yeah I cannot confirm her to
0:37:29 know whether or not his wife but yeah
0:37:31 yeah if I if it seems to be I don't know
0:37:33 if there's gonna be a morality role or
0:37:35 not as an animated unit rather than
0:37:37 those splinters coming off as splinters
0:37:40 nope it is very much an animated unit
0:37:42 then I will try to break it imagine like
0:37:44 something that moves about as quick as
0:37:45 like a house cat like chasing you around
0:37:47 attempting to like essentially yeah kill
0:37:50 you I'm just gonna break it over your
0:37:53 knee Turf over the knee sounds perfectly
0:37:55 fine give me strengthless brawl I will
0:37:57 spend a willpower okay
0:37:59 four successes including the willpower
0:38:01 through carry over into damage now rule
0:38:04 strength plus uh three
0:38:07 two uh it starts to develop cracks Brita
0:38:10 cries out for help saying this the stake
0:38:14 is still trying to get me and it hurts
0:38:16 when I touch it and I don't know what to
0:38:17 do and she's kind of just thwacking it
0:38:19 against her knee next round brother take
0:38:21 three lethal roll soak
0:38:24 that's a one and a ten does that cancel
0:38:26 out to zero or to one cancels out to
0:38:28 zero okay so three lethals taken on top
0:38:31 of one lethal miles I will attempt to
0:38:33 cut the steak she said that is a danger
0:38:37 roll it different
0:38:38 five successes four will carry over into
0:38:41 damage eight damage with us the stake
0:38:44 goes still and then half of it collapses
0:38:47 to the ground is the other half still
0:38:49 fighting no Brita immediately drops the
0:38:52 half when it goes still and inanimate
0:38:55 and she pulls her hand back close to
0:38:58 herself clearly hurting
0:39:02 Johnny continues to try to break free
0:39:03 from the prison
0:39:05 um he will spend uh blood for uh potents
0:39:10 that's nine successes to Break Free with
0:39:13 nine successes you can feel fragments of
0:39:16 this unbreakable barrier getting loose
0:39:20 into the liquid oxygen that you're
0:39:21 trapped in but it holds unfortunately
0:39:24 the codery sees something very bad
0:39:27 happen within the prison Johnny's eyes
0:39:30 start to lose focus and you can see him
0:39:34 being gripped by hunger frenzy because I
0:39:37 am at zero blood and I'm at zero
0:39:40 willpower so stuck within this prism is
0:39:43 a very big bruja problem
0:39:46 [Music]
0:39:50 we still in rounds you are out of rounds
0:39:54 for now when recognizes
0:39:59 she is still very much in fight or
0:40:01 flight she looks to Miles and Brita take
0:40:04 Eden and go okay and when hefs Ira up on
0:40:09 her shoulder and goes out the door you
0:40:12 rush out the door what are you doing
0:40:14 with Ira I'm gonna put him like I'm
0:40:15 assuming there's a garage or something
0:40:16 for miles's cars I gotta assume you got
0:40:19 a big ass garage my man I can't put him
0:40:21 in there is there
0:40:23 shed
0:40:24 the pool house
0:40:28 I put Ira in the pool house put up in my
0:40:31 garage that's where the important things
0:40:33 I Lounge him comfortably on like a pool
0:40:36 house couch and just kind of look at him
0:40:39 and say message received she has one
0:40:41 blood left and two willpower so she
0:40:43 should not be around Eden right now and
0:40:45 so she just kind of leaves him sorry how
0:40:47 much blood do you have one I'm gonna
0:40:49 need a self-control track okay uh
0:40:52 remember that your self-control is
0:40:53 capped at how much blood you have all
0:40:55 righty whichever is lower between the
0:40:57 two as well power in there yeah what if
0:41:01 you're if you hear if your blood pool
0:41:03 ends up lower than your self-control you
0:41:05 roll your blood pool
0:41:07 so I'm going to spend a willpower highly
0:41:09 recommended
0:41:10 one success with one success you manage
0:41:13 to keep from doing something you may
0:41:15 regret well to Ira since it seems
0:41:17 important to narrate I have four blood
0:41:20 and one willpower as I am running
0:41:22 towards where I think the guest rooms
0:41:25 are since I think that is where Eden may
0:41:28 be give me a perception plus alertness
0:41:31 the difficulty of this challenge is six
0:41:34 okay that is reduced by well technically
0:41:37 four but it goes down to three due to
0:41:39 the minimum
0:41:40 so then there are three successes with
0:41:44 three successes you find Eden hidden
0:41:48 kind of like having slipped into miles's
0:41:53 room and she is there under the bed
0:41:56 kinda peeking out from behind the
0:41:59 comforter that kind of like is draped
0:42:01 over the king size or king-sized bed
0:42:04 does the path out of miles's room lead
0:42:07 through the area that Johnny is in uh
0:42:10 yes does miles have a private bathroom
0:42:12 yes he does so Beretta generally in her
0:42:17 experience of frenzying vampires has
0:42:19 seen line of sight to be relatively
0:42:21 important and
0:42:23 silently she like running full speed
0:42:27 kneel sound outstretches a hand to Eden
0:42:29 hoping she'll take it and come out I'm
0:42:31 gonna need a manipulation leadership
0:42:34 role
0:42:37 I did not speak so I don't think hey
0:42:39 applies and that is two's successes with
0:42:44 two successes you convince her and
0:42:46 though she hesitates for a moment she
0:42:49 does take your hand Britta offers what
0:42:52 she can of a comforting smile and that
0:42:54 small moment of outstretching the hand
0:42:56 towards her to pull her out and trying
0:42:59 to lead her in as quick and as stealthy
0:43:03 and exit to the bathroom as she can to
0:43:06 find the two of them a new hiding spot
0:43:08 you'll definitely notice that she looks
0:43:12 like she has been crying her movements
0:43:15 are very rigid and every time she hears
0:43:18 Johnny bellowing from his cage she seems
0:43:23 very shaken up by the wrathful bruja by
0:43:27 the time she makes it to the bathroom
0:43:28 with you yeah you guys can you can roll
0:43:31 the explore stuff I figure I'll lock the
0:43:34 door behind us and I'll narrate how well
0:43:36 that hide answer attempt happens after
0:43:38 the roll sure go for it
0:43:42 four successes okay you do a very good
0:43:44 job hiding so Bretta makes sure as I
0:43:47 said to lock that door behind the two of
0:43:49 them and she takes Eden over to Miles
0:43:53 what kind of shower do you have and or
0:43:56 bathtub is there a curtain it should be
0:43:58 the question I'm asking curtains okay so
0:44:02 in that case what I'm gonna do so the
0:44:06 shower is separate from the bass and the
0:44:08 fact that it is like its own walked off
0:44:10 area and it's kind of like this
0:44:12 combination of tile and naturalistic
0:44:14 stone and like extraordinarily fancy
0:44:16 like Rave 360 yes there's no like cover
0:44:19 is what you're saying
0:44:20 I mean there's a wall I'm spending this
0:44:24 last week I don't of course I'm not
0:44:27 spacing out when I'm trying to save a
0:44:29 kid's life there's a gigantic Tome hot
0:44:31 tub deal in there one of those like big
0:44:34 90s like whirlpool tubs huge yeah
0:44:37 difficulty six nine
0:44:42 with the willpower to successes so
0:44:45 spotting that this space is incredibly
0:44:48 beautiful unfortunately for bread in
0:44:50 this moment she abandons what her
0:44:52 previous thought was and instead drags
0:44:54 Eden drags this too harsh she's trying
0:44:56 to guide Eden as quickly as possible to
0:44:59 both of them are very small they're
0:45:01 gonna fit inside the cabinets understood
0:45:03 if Eden seems okay with it she's trying
0:45:05 to pull Eden in for a like a hugs very
0:45:08 Cooperative so she'll pull her in for a
0:45:10 hug when they're kind of like in the
0:45:12 cabinets uh that's probably necessary
0:45:15 regardless just for this cramped space
0:45:17 but she's trying to like instill some
0:45:19 comfort in oh and if I can in this
0:45:21 position I'd like to cover Eden's ears
0:45:23 uh yeah you can absolutely
0:45:26 yeah
0:45:29 we will cut to win returning from the
0:45:34 Full House Full House where she is
0:45:36 stashed Ira she made sure his body was
0:45:38 comfortable but she also made paints to
0:45:40 make sure he's not going to get
0:45:41 accidentally zotted by sunlight thank
0:45:43 you yep happy to help I'm just standing
0:45:46 there confused
0:45:49 like what the hell she she puts herself
0:45:52 in front of Johnny where he is
0:45:53 slathering in the cage and she looks at
0:45:56 him ignoring everything else in the room
0:45:58 Johnny I am here for you I'm hungry too
0:46:02 as soon as this glass is gone we're
0:46:05 gonna go eat but I need you to come back
0:46:08 until then okay and she puts her hand up
0:46:10 against the glass and she will attempt
0:46:13 to quell him now four-year-old
0:46:16 regardless of what the outcome is the
0:46:19 prism is going away so if you succeed
0:46:21 the prism is going away with Johnny
0:46:24 feeling a little better and able to
0:46:25 communicate like a person if you do not
0:46:28 succeed in the role you're the nearest
0:46:30 meal
0:46:31 go ahead and roll no pressure
0:46:35 well that's not great
0:46:39 [Music]
0:46:40 oh no
0:46:42 what you looking at pal an eight and two
0:46:44 ones I or no have a request we're back
0:46:48 in rounds maintaining same initiative
0:46:49 wait a second yep I have a request and
0:46:51 you can feel free to say no but I have
0:46:54 been not I Ira but I kneel have been
0:46:57 weak of nightmares guilt showing up to
0:47:01 talk to the cotery and do [ __ ] and I
0:47:03 know I'm having a weird night right now
0:47:05 elsewhere but is it possible to adjust
0:47:08 this outcome a little bit with a guilty
0:47:11 empathy kneel give me a willpower roll
0:47:13 difficulty nine
0:47:16 that one pulls away then it cancels out
0:47:20 the nine leaving one ten so one success
0:47:25 mark this against your total number of
0:47:27 uh opportunities there two left and when
0:47:31 his rage is too great and he's been
0:47:34 through just too much this past night
0:47:37 and at the worst time possible there is
0:47:41 a shimmer and the container that holds
0:47:46 Johnny at Bay Fades and as Johnny is
0:47:51 right about to Lunge for you
0:47:54 the phone rings
0:47:55 and this startling ringing sound Echoes
0:48:00 and catches the two of you and just the
0:48:02 most awkward time and you both find
0:48:04 yourselves quickly looking towards the
0:48:06 phone Johnny his hands have outstretched
0:48:10 with impossible speed and gripped Wind
0:48:13 by the shoulders and he looks down at
0:48:15 her as his teeth start to pull back
0:48:19 his eyes Focus
0:48:21 do you want to get that why don't you
0:48:23 take a walk I'll walk over and get the
0:48:25 phone miles here

0:48:59 you wins
0:49:01 for a minute it looks like it doesn't
0:49:03 matter to her that Johnny is about to
0:49:05 rip her throat out she's too relieved to
0:49:08 hear that her emotional support milk is
0:49:11 okay guys and she her face just kind of
0:49:14 relaxes and changes yeah Neil I'm here
0:49:16 oh okay yeah I'm so sorry I know I I

0:49:54 tell me what needs to be said no please

0:49:58 frenzying rap notes at that point in the
0:50:01 background here
0:50:02 and they're just things chasing the car
0:50:05 all right unless wind understands how
0:50:08 Predators work and so she doesn't like
0:50:10 Dart away from Johnny she like gradually
0:50:13 slides away while his attention is
0:50:15 elsewhere but she doesn't want to draw
0:50:17 his attention so she kind of slides
0:50:19 closer to the phone Johnny lets her go
0:50:21 and starts edging towards the front door
0:50:23 hey uh yeah no I'm just I'm just calling
0:50:25 because I wanted to let you know because

0:51:25 nail uh stop I can get food without you

0:52:09 and if uh well we're trying our best to
0:52:11 be here okay and think there's a lot to

0:52:15 gonna talk about it over the phone but
0:52:16 we're we're okay I assume I speak for
0:52:19 everyone when I say we love you but I at
0:52:21 least speak for me when I say I love you
0:52:23 okay okay uh last thing I because I I
0:52:25 don't think that there's someone in New
0:52:28 Haven
0:52:29 if I don't make it back okay there's
0:52:31 someone in New Haven who knows about is
0:52:33 Miles the prince right now yeah okay
0:52:35 yeah there's someone do you I don't want
0:52:38 to give context or anything just to tell
0:52:40 Miles there's someone in New Haven who
0:52:42 knows about the cutout
0:52:46 deal
0:52:47 this meal and she like starts like
0:52:49 pushing the hey connect back and then
0:52:52 after a minute she of just trying she
0:52:54 kind of like reluctantly puts the phone
0:52:56 down you hit star 69 but it doesn't get
0:52:59 you to him I start moving off come on I
0:53:02 think I should be able to let you feed
0:53:03 without killing the person
0:53:06 um but yeah I have combat girls across
0:53:07 the street most of my ghouls live nearby
0:53:10 but not on the property so I will take
0:53:13 you there and I'll let you be outside
0:53:15 and then I will bring them out to you
0:53:17 and we will do our damage not to kill
0:53:19 this barely contained restraint Johnny
0:53:22 kind of glassy-eyed follows you it's
0:53:25 like dealing with somebody who's kind of
0:53:27 like at the edge of some kind like not
0:53:30 drunk but barely hanging on yeah
0:53:38 when with one blood in her does she have
0:53:41 enough blood in her system that she's
0:53:43 not going to immediately feed in frenzy
0:53:45 on the first person she sees how much
0:53:47 would you have one no being in the
0:53:49 presence of someone is a friendly
0:53:50 stimulus for you but you do get a role
0:53:52 okay just you're just rolling one down
0:53:54 all right so I'm gonna leave the house
0:53:55 if I can okay where are you going out
0:53:57 the front door are you going with Miles
0:53:59 and Johnny are you going somewhere else
0:54:00 she'll go out the back door if we're
0:54:02 butted up against the woods and
0:54:06 um when we'll go out into the woods so
0:54:10 she will try not to kill the animals
0:54:11 that she feeds on
0:54:13 whether she remembers whether that was
0:54:15 successful or not is unclear you call
0:54:19 dear to you and you feel the Beast rise
0:54:23 I need a self-control you have uh just a
0:54:26 single die
0:54:28 one success
0:54:30 with one success and feral Whispers you
0:54:34 are able to speak to these dear do you
0:54:36 have an offensive to animals yes I do
0:54:38 okay so they're not even so frightened
0:54:40 of you so just tell me how you want to
0:54:42 handle it when basically says I do not
0:54:45 want to betray your trust but I need
0:54:48 help and I will be good to the herds of
0:54:51 deer and your Offspring for however long
0:54:55 I am capable of doing so but if you can
0:54:57 help me now I will see that trust
0:55:00 returned they are drawn to your
0:55:04 magnetism and don't seem to resist when
0:55:08 you go to feed from them
0:55:10 and the only thing that is strange is
0:55:14 the dozens of ravens gathered overhead
0:55:18 in the branches watching you
0:55:21 when win has taken enough
0:55:24 she looks up she thanks the deer she
0:55:27 licks the wounds so that which is
0:55:29 probably gross they're covered in texts
0:55:31 but she closes the wounds with a lick
0:55:34 and she looks to the Ravens and just
0:55:38 kind of [ __ ] ahead at them as they
0:55:40 don't usually watch when Raven's not
0:55:42 around the Ravens watch you with human
0:55:44 intelligence well that's very weird
0:55:48 she would it be animal can or empathy to
0:55:51 a can like attempt to discern the intent
0:55:54 of these normally it would be animal Ken
0:55:56 but again they watch you with human
0:55:58 intelligence
0:56:00 give me empathy which which trait and
0:56:03 empathy uh perception
0:56:06 one success with one success you are
0:56:11 confident these are not natural Ravens
0:56:14 they are Ravens Ravens but like these
0:56:17 are not the ones that you normally would
0:56:18 interact with and when they have
0:56:20 finished watching you feed
0:56:22 any allowed Rush of flapping wings they
0:56:27 take off and fly away when with feral
0:56:31 Whispers calls out to one of them to see
0:56:33 if any of them will come back it doesn't
0:56:35 understand without feral Whispers she
0:56:37 will call out for one of them to come
0:56:39 back they do not obey Wynn makes a note
0:56:41 of this
0:56:42 and win's head becomes a little clearer
0:56:46 and she kind of closes her eyes for a
0:56:48 minute and just kind of processing and
0:56:50 she sends Brita a text there is no reply
0:56:53 if you send to britta's cell phone
0:56:56 unless there is a reply I don't know
0:56:58 about because I cannot be in between
0:57:00 everything that's happened I don't have
0:57:02 my cell phone tell me what you sent I
0:57:05 fed are you safe
0:57:07 yes where are you
