0:00:40 set an emotional goodbye to kneel before
0:00:43 Neil left to find the kidnappeda miles
0:00:46 killed and diabolarized up in rolands
0:00:48 but in the process said a demon free
0:00:50 Johnny and wind back miles up as he
0:00:53 claims Praxis and becomes the prince of
0:00:55 New Haven meanwhile Prince Pendragon
0:00:57 brings Buddha to bork's Scala there the
0:01:00 quarter becomes further entangled in the
0:01:02 regional politics and red encounters
0:01:03 tomahira seeking more information on how
0:01:06 house this about attacked the gala
0:01:08 killing many including also Linden Neil
0:01:10 Beretta Pendragon and a few allies

0:01:15 arrived to New Haven escobir calls
0:01:17 Johnny Nguyen out of control as a storm
0:01:19 worsens in Sri Lanka a mysterious light
0:01:21 flashes
0:01:26 we pick up again with Brita and Neil on
0:01:29 the road
0:01:30 with friends and enemies
0:01:33 Roman Pendragon seems to keep Brita
0:01:36 close
0:01:37 sort of watching the road as they go
0:01:41 the bruja that accompanied them one is
0:01:44 on each side of the little truck
0:01:46 watching for signs of trouble Fester's
0:01:49 at the wheel every now and again Fester
0:01:51 glances out towards Neil looking nervous
0:01:54 either worried that the Sabbat May well
0:01:57 be on their tail or just uncomfortable
0:02:00 in the presence of a
0:02:03 moody Roman pen dragon
0:02:06 in the distance as the group of you
0:02:09 Journey
0:02:10 you start to see
0:02:12 glimpses of clouds starting to
0:02:15 illuminate out towards the water
0:02:18 we're uh we're gonna have to find
0:02:22 we left the party late and we're we're
0:02:24 gonna have to find some place to
0:02:26 Professor how how close are we to
0:02:29 to New Haven to
0:02:31 getting New Haven's closer than West
0:02:32 Hartford so I figured unless
0:02:35 we're not going to make it to the do we
0:02:37 have to look for fascia gives a nervous
0:02:39 look I don't know if we're gonna make it
0:02:40 anyway at this rate okay um
0:02:43 if we can
0:02:44 if you could pull the truck over
0:02:45 somewhere and uh
0:02:47 took like a we have a little bit of time
0:02:49 I can
0:02:51 we can all sleep in the truck
0:02:53 um so long as nobody gets mad about me
0:02:56 making sure it's safe to sleep in the
0:02:58 truck point of order one of the bruja
0:03:01 says
0:03:02 my Lord he turns to pen dragon
0:03:05 I sense that there is trouble
0:03:08 the vigos watches us as we travel
0:03:11 I do not know that simply parking
0:03:13 someone will provide us the shelter we
0:03:15 need in order to protect ourselves from
0:03:17 it
0:03:18 oh no I meant I could protects of the
0:03:20 Sun and not the um
0:03:23 I don't uh it's a ward against someone's
0:03:26 watches do you know how they're
0:03:28 watching us is there a
0:03:31 um we need to get somewhere underground
0:03:32 or part of my training has me sensitive
0:03:35 to such things and if the viko swatches
0:03:40 it is watching one of us
0:03:43 and with a little bit of hesitation he
0:03:46 looks towards Pendragon who is clearly
0:03:48 the like most priority Target in the
0:03:51 bunch Bretta had been watching The Brew
0:03:54 hot listening raptly not just because of
0:03:57 the danger but because
0:04:00 she's been so curious about starting to
0:04:03 understand her own connection with her
0:04:06 aspects very very slowly that the idea
0:04:08 of him having training in this matter
0:04:10 it's interesting to her own
0:04:13 sensibilities but then that rather
0:04:16 academic curiosity shifts to a more raw
0:04:20 curiosity at the somewhat hidden look as
0:04:24 you sort of ponder your extra sensory
0:04:27 ability uh you tap into it just enough
0:04:29 that you can feel a powerful psychic
0:04:32 presence like like an animal sniffing at
0:04:36 the back of your hair and you get the
0:04:39 impression that might likely be what
0:04:41 this person's referring to just to
0:04:43 confirm in case there's not layers upon
0:04:46 layers of danger in the situation
0:04:49 she looks to the speaking bruja and puts
0:04:53 forward
0:04:54 that presence that feels
0:04:57 hunting
0:04:59 the presence of a hungry thing yeah
0:05:02 faster slows to a stop and pulls over
0:05:06 all right sounds like we need to go over
0:05:08 a plan yeah yeah that's um
0:05:11 uh
0:05:13 if
0:05:15 so they're watching one person not not
0:05:18 the area and if they're not just looking
0:05:20 at us from the astral realm and just
0:05:24 kind of following the group of us around
0:05:26 even if they are there they would only
0:05:28 be looking after you know they could
0:05:31 only follow one person if we if we
0:05:33 scatter a little bit
0:05:36 um maybe return to our separate domains
0:05:38 or or um go into separate areas and and
0:05:42 sort of hunker down for the day they
0:05:44 won't be watching us during the day so
0:05:46 right presume away they can't I mean the
0:05:50 sun is still the sun
0:05:52 um the vi goes is capable of things that
0:05:54 would seem odd even to Kindred
0:05:56 okay fair enough I um pen Dragon it says
0:06:01 are they in the
0:06:05 I don't really want to look
0:06:07 um
0:06:08 I don't know thoughts I feel like I'm
0:06:10 we're going to split into two groups he
0:06:13 looks at Neil and fester
0:06:16 the two of you will be escorted by one
0:06:18 of mine you will lay low for a time I I
0:06:21 um
0:06:22 but it's Pendragon so he like files
0:06:24 quiet pretty quick
0:06:25 you he points at Fester
0:06:28 seemingly Not Having learned his name
0:06:30 quite yet drive to the nearest hotel
0:06:33 we will stop there
0:06:35 split into separate rooms if we're in
0:06:38 two groups but in in the same location
0:06:41 wouldn't that be is that actually
0:06:43 what do we just get like five or six
0:06:45 rooms if you split into too many rooms
0:06:47 they'll simply burn the building down if
0:06:49 we're close enough we might be able to
0:06:51 help each other
0:06:53 oh um
0:06:55 okay so uh fester and uh Brita and I
0:07:00 will be in one room and no that's not
0:07:02 what I said you drive faster kind of
0:07:07 turns around and starts her up
0:07:10 Neil throws a glance at fester and then
0:07:12 throws like some panicky eyes back over
0:07:16 on Brita I was like wait very clearly
0:07:19 has an expression like wait wait what
0:07:21 okay I I thought I had things starting
0:07:23 to get under control and now I feel like
0:07:24 I'm losing control of them again Bretta
0:07:26 gives Neil the kind of barely controlled
0:07:31 neutral like there's a wideness to her
0:07:34 eyes but she is trying to keep her
0:07:37 expression otherwise normal
0:07:40 and she just very slightly shakes her
0:07:44 head if she sees him start to stutter
0:07:47 and argue
0:07:50 okay so we'll get
0:07:53 we'll get two rooms right we'll be right
0:07:56 next door he like still looks a Brita
0:07:59 um we'll be right there close enough to
0:08:01 all help each other
0:08:04 right
0:08:06 does your um okay uh Neil you're better
0:08:11 than I am with the abilities of all
0:08:14 specs if you can keep a lookout too I
0:08:17 had thought about it but sometimes
0:08:19 things that you see can't help but to
0:08:23 see you but if you if you want I can um
0:08:26 foreign
0:08:27 yeah I guess so I don't mean to no no no
0:08:31 I'll um
0:08:32 yeah I'll uh
0:08:34 I'll I'll give it a look
0:08:36 um
0:08:37 and if you want once we get to the hotel
0:08:39 room I can make sure that it's uh your
0:08:42 room uh and he's like looks at Pendragon
0:08:45 he looks at the space between Pendragon
0:08:47 and Brita like not quite able to look at
0:08:49 either one of them
0:08:50 um where the lack thereof yeah
0:08:53 I can help to Ward it from the day if
0:08:58 you
0:08:58 want these kinds of
0:09:01 roadside motels aren't always the most
0:09:04 secure of that if you yeah
0:09:09 um but I'll yeah I'll look now and Neil
0:09:13 is going to first just sort of try and
0:09:17 perceive someone watching from the
0:09:19 astral realm to see if there's like
0:09:20 literally is like a an astrally
0:09:22 projected presence here
0:09:24 he's not going to advertise to everyone
0:09:27 in the van the fact that that is
0:09:28 something he can do because he doesn't
0:09:29 want to get volunt told to go be a
0:09:32 national like distraction but he's gonna
0:09:34 look around the lightning of the clouds
0:09:37 is making the prospect of throwing his
0:09:40 perceptions up into the Stars not a
0:09:43 welcome one so he doesn't really want to
0:09:45 do that right now when you gaze into the
0:09:47 astral
0:09:49 you notice that there is no person
0:09:51 watching instead it is just a sensation
0:09:56 like a distant star looking down on you
0:09:59 okay
0:10:01 um
0:10:01 so if they're
0:10:04 I don't know how they're doing what
0:10:05 they're doing exactly but if it is
0:10:09 similar to what I think it is um being
0:10:12 indoors
0:10:13 they can't see us
0:10:16 um and they can't hear us either way so
0:10:18 just as a getting under a roof yeah
0:10:21 good idea and
0:10:24 um
0:10:25 I'd say cloud cover would help but
0:10:27 that level of potency probably not
0:10:30 um so
0:10:32 yeah Fester gets off the road
0:10:34 into some Barons area where there really
0:10:39 wouldn't be much of a kindred population
0:10:41 and there is the types of Hotel like
0:10:46 extended stay hotels that you have like
0:10:48 little apartments essentially
0:10:50 group of you
0:10:52 uh feel the truck come to a stop the
0:10:56 like little FedEx truck
0:10:59 I'll take care of the arrangements
0:11:02 Roman simply gets off the truck and
0:11:05 beckons Brita and one of the bruja to
0:11:08 join him Freda dips her head and moves
0:11:10 to get off the truck sort of not quite
0:11:13 avoiding Neil's eye contact it's similar
0:11:17 to when they were in the gala of maybe
0:11:19 if I don't look at him then attention
0:11:21 won't be put his way Neil is looking
0:11:24 like directly wide-eyed no no guile no
0:11:29 subterfuge of what's running through his
0:11:31 mind on his face and almost looks for a
0:11:34 minute like he's going to just like
0:11:35 reach out and grab her uh like no no if
0:11:38 I don't let you off the truck then you
0:11:40 know I can just pretend none of these
0:11:41 problems happen
0:11:42 but she pretty successfully manages not
0:11:45 to acknowledge the beginnings of the
0:11:47 Outreach hand taking those steps off the
0:11:50 truck she makes sure that she is
0:11:54 as presentable as she can be I mean with
0:11:58 no shoes and doubtless I think everyone
0:12:01 here would be covered in what blood
0:12:04 smoke Ash except for maybe Fester Fester
0:12:07 might still look dapper but as far as
0:12:10 she can handle it just tries to use the
0:12:13 act of uh pulling herself together to
0:12:15 pull herself together
0:12:17 they're still sort of part of it is
0:12:20 keeping a lookout this is an unfamiliar
0:12:22 place in an extremely unfamiliar
0:12:24 circumstance and there's something so
0:12:26 surreal about walking into an Extended
0:12:30 Stay hotel's lobby with these Kindred
0:12:33 presumably Lobby I'm not sure but
0:12:35 regardless she's going to be heightening
0:12:38 her vision looking around trying to see
0:12:41 if there's anything important to be seen
0:12:43 but also just a little stuck in the
0:12:46 oddness of that feeling in comparison to
0:12:49 the unyielding tension inside there is
0:12:52 just one person working the lobby and
0:12:56 they're just kind of quietly mopping
0:12:57 here's a light echo through the space
0:13:00 I'll be right with you I rush over to
0:13:02 the counter Roman approaches and there's
0:13:04 a quiet exchange between the two the
0:13:07 young man grabs a set of keys and lays
0:13:10 them out on the counter Roman takes one
0:13:12 looks to you and says come
0:13:17 okay
0:13:18 the third bruja takes to see it in the
0:13:21 lobby and seems to wait Berta takes
0:13:23 stock of that and seeing that there is
0:13:27 another key left out does that she's
0:13:29 sold the last thing you see of that bruh
0:13:32 is they actually uh seem to take out a
0:13:35 phone and start dialing a number I have
0:13:38 my heightened Vision up is it possible
0:13:40 to catch a glimpse the only thing you
0:13:42 will hear as you go there isn't really
0:13:45 much to see because of the angle yeah
0:13:47 you do hear him say we have a situation
0:13:54 back on the UPS truck so uh we doing
0:13:57 this thing or I don't really know what's
0:14:01 um as soon as Brita is out of sight line
0:14:03 like as soon as she steps out of the
0:14:04 truck and Neil can't see her anymore he
0:14:06 starts getting like really agitated
0:14:08 digging through the seat cushions for
0:14:10 key of like dropped coins or just
0:14:14 looking for things takes his hand
0:14:16 dropped Neil we're heading to a hotel
0:14:20 if you have any idea how much weird [ __ ]
0:14:22 is lying around hidden that no one's
0:14:23 seen in a while
0:14:24 yeah yeah yeah yeah I know um let's
0:14:27 worry about that for a while okay you
0:14:29 just survived [ __ ] hell
0:14:31 yeah but I didn't I'll make it through
0:14:33 this too
0:14:34 I I didn't uh I didn't do everything I
0:14:37 was supposed to I um

0:14:47 next couple of nights I don't have to
0:14:48 burn anything to make it so that we can
0:14:50 just keep going everything will be
0:14:53 um and he looks over the other bruja
0:14:55 who's like he's still in the track with
0:14:57 us right uh she's just kind of stoically
0:15:00 watching she's just watching okay
0:15:02 um
0:15:03 hey so like are we supposed to go get
0:15:05 our key or are we where's the is that

0:15:19 to the room okay well I don't know what
0:15:20 the room is that was there was a
0:15:21 question I just asked is like we don't
0:15:22 have that's not the question you asked
0:15:24 inside come
0:15:26 on she gets out of the truck Nelly pulls
0:15:28 his hands over his face to truly like in
0:15:30 the the beginning stages of a low-grade
0:15:33 panic attack just starts following
0:15:35 um she heads inside uh she actually
0:15:37 gives the other bruja not picks up the
0:15:39 keys
0:15:40 checks the number
0:15:41 all right this way

0:15:59 sort of like rummaging through his fanny
0:16:01 pack that he strapped on over the tuxedo
0:16:02 by the time uh you're headed out of the
0:16:05 area that bruja that was waiting in the
0:16:07 lobby heads over to the guy at the
0:16:09 counter grabs him by this shirt pulls
0:16:12 him close to the their eyes are meeting
0:16:14 and he starts to talk to him and then
0:16:17 you're off and around the corner in the
0:16:18 hall
0:16:19 just need to know fanny pack over suit

0:16:55 um
0:16:56 I don't I mean you can open the door but
0:16:58 don't leave the
0:16:59 last time we were in a you know what
0:17:01 doesn't matter and Neil will just start
0:17:03 slowly going through the stages of
0:17:05 enacting a ritual like drawing with
0:17:09 blood and Ash
0:17:10 his own blood and that there's plenty of
0:17:13 Ash about to Mark the windows and the
0:17:15 doors of the room by the time you're
0:17:16 done you notice that there is this odd
0:17:20 thing that you noticed
0:17:22 briefly for just a handful of seconds
0:17:27 shower went silent
0:17:32 and there is a flash of light
0:17:36 miles
0:17:38 you're suddenly jostled from some
0:17:40 daydreaming as Johnny enters closing the
0:17:43 door behind him
0:17:44 you're standing in front of the mirror
0:17:46 adjusting your tie preparing to address
0:17:48 the domain things have been strange
0:17:51 lately reports of unusual behavior
0:17:53 things in the sky Shadows that move on
0:17:57 their own the domain is restless and the
0:18:01 presence of these astonites having
0:18:03 arrived in force has caused every little
0:18:06 problem to seem like an exposed nerve
0:18:10 playing in the background is your TV
0:18:13 watching the news and stories of the
0:18:16 horrors being experienced in Sri Lanka
0:18:18 as a result of this sudden
0:18:22 terrible weather condition that they
0:18:24 have pulling down on the lapels of my
0:18:27 new rust-colored suit straighting my
0:18:30 matching tie and white shirt so the
0:18:33 court ready to
0:18:34 to meet with me Johnny gives you a look
0:18:37 up and down taking in the new attire
0:18:40 you've picked out he blinks a little bit
0:18:43 most of he's uncomfortable with the new
0:18:47 scenario that he's been thrust into
0:18:48 Johnny stands about five foot nine for
0:18:53 five foot ten eleven somewhere around
0:18:55 there just under six feet he wears a
0:18:58 thick biker jacket that has seen a lot
0:19:03 of wear and tear a small little
0:19:05 scratches and wounds have been repaired
0:19:07 all over the jacket itself and it seems
0:19:10 that he's gotten rid of his usual blue
0:19:13 jeans and red and black Buffalo check
0:19:17 shirt for something a little bit more
0:19:19 acceptable for your court and what he
0:19:21 deemed more acceptable was a pair of
0:19:23 black jeans and a black button-up shirt
0:19:27 I was very surprised you didn't pick
0:19:28 white and black Buffalo
0:19:30 foreign
0:19:33 he brushes his uh wavy dark hair back
0:19:36 behind his ears well I think they're
0:19:39 about as ready for you as they're ever
0:19:40 gonna be this is your court though
0:19:43 so you call the shots and they'll dance
0:19:46 to the tune everything's been a problem
0:19:48 since
0:19:50 well since I took over essentially but I
0:19:52 feel like that's just how things go only
0:19:54 news wasn't gonna be easy yeah the new
0:19:57 hassa might turn a new fun addition to
0:19:59 the whole mix everybody's jostling to
0:20:02 figure out what their place is now
0:20:04 I think if anything it just works in
0:20:05 your favor and think more information
0:20:07 and whatnot is always good
0:20:09 more vampires here is comes with good
0:20:12 comes with bad
0:20:13 I just mean that it the other princes
0:20:17 that have fled to your domain are less
0:20:19 likely to take a shot at you when
0:20:22 there's a new player in town that no
0:20:24 one's sure about yes and they're all
0:20:26 convinced that this is a horde of
0:20:27 asomite Assassins
0:20:28 waiting to strike from the cover of
0:20:30 Darkness at any moment well we don't
0:20:32 know that they aren't I mean I like to
0:20:34 think that they're not well at least not
0:20:36 going to strike me from the darkness
0:20:37 anytime soon maybe not the whole the
0:20:39 whole lot of them but who's to say one
0:20:42 or two of them aren't well I'm going to
0:20:43 have to hope to trust them and we can
0:20:45 hopefully get ahead of any of those
0:20:47 coming out but currently not my biggest
0:20:50 issue well what is your biggest issue
0:20:52 all these strange occurrences going on
0:20:54 yeah well
0:20:57 I think you should
0:20:59 stop worrying about coincidences in the
0:21:02 in the domain and start focusing on the
0:21:04 actual practical problems we still have
0:21:07 Sabbat around they've been quiet since
0:21:10 we struck the habit I think they're
0:21:12 probably just getting ready for their
0:21:14 next move true we do need to start
0:21:17 hunting them soon we can't give them the
0:21:19 opportunity to recover from this we have
0:21:23 to push the advantage right
0:21:25 aside from Sabbat there's a whole host
0:21:28 in the domain that the loyalties are
0:21:31 questionable
0:21:33 considering the fact that operation
0:21:36 Longbow is still very much active and
0:21:42 if uh Longbow reaches out to all of
0:21:46 these new princes and decides to get
0:21:48 their loyalty
0:21:49 well that might be uh that might be it
0:21:52 for your rain your highness
0:21:55 I mean I don't particularly like the way
0:21:57 he said that but uh I guess we'll deal
0:21:59 with it as we come along I don't really
0:22:02 have much to do to stop that until at
0:22:05 least Neil and Ando Britta returned or
0:22:08 we hear information from them because
0:22:09 really the biggest context we have with
0:22:12 them there is a knock up on the door
0:22:14 Johnny looks over to Miles you want me
0:22:17 to get that I'm not expecting anyone so
0:22:19 Johnny strides over to the uh to the
0:22:23 door upon opening it a very attractive
0:22:27 woman with bronze skin bows he
0:22:30 recognized her to be Nara of the
0:22:31 asomites
0:22:32 forgive my intrusion I simply wish to
0:22:35 warn you that members of the independent
0:22:38 Clans have arrived an ambrogino of the
0:22:41 Giovanni and nikalis of the followers of
0:22:44 set at mentioned the followers have said
0:22:47 Johnny Cox an eyebrow and uh glances
0:22:50 back towards miles maybe they finally
0:22:53 come to ask for their own at least
0:22:56 tolerance in this domain johnny makes a
0:23:00 expression that does not look amused
0:23:04 look I'm willing to hear them out those
0:23:06 folks have been after me for a long time
0:23:09 all right miles
0:23:11 we got enough problems with it as it is
0:23:13 just try to keep that in mind yes yes do
0:23:16 not antagonize the snake people I get it
0:23:18 yeah
0:23:21 yeah don't don't agonize the snake
0:23:23 people let's start by calling them set
0:23:25 tights all right
0:23:26 well
0:23:28 Nora thank you for letting us know the
0:23:30 independence have arrived where would
0:23:32 you like to uh meet them we'll meet them
0:23:35 down there we'll take them in open court
0:23:37 no make sure that runwick is about if
0:23:40 you could I know you're not a messenger
0:23:41 but it would be appreciated
0:23:43 which only kind of looks over at Nara
0:23:45 kind of puzzled that she's taken so
0:23:48 quickly to becoming part of the Court
0:23:51 here and he tries to remember what her
0:23:54 position is so she holds no official
0:23:58 position
0:23:58 but works directly with the keeper of
0:24:02 Elysium to defend the Masquerade while
0:24:05 it might be seen as gauche to give an
0:24:07 asamite a position within the domain
0:24:10 she is certainly a contributor yeah the
0:24:13 last night or two to do so your grace
0:24:17 what do you wish for me to tell the
0:24:19 independent visitors
0:24:21 that I'm happy to meet with them and I
0:24:24 will talk with them in a few moments she
0:24:27 bows her head and kind of uh makes her
0:24:31 way off back to the rest of Court
0:24:33 leaving the two of you again alone
0:24:36 so we can get a room or something where
0:24:38 you can meet them but do you want to
0:24:40 make some of your announcements first I
0:24:42 think that might be best I think we
0:24:43 should get the court settled and then we
0:24:46 will grant them Hospitality for the stay
0:24:48 so that we can have any discussions out
0:24:51 in
0:24:52 you know where they're aware that they
0:24:54 are safe just traditional stuff and you
0:24:57 are planning on settling the court right
0:24:59 yes it's not my intention to get into
0:25:01 more fights he gives you a wary eye
0:25:04 all right
0:25:06 I'll uh
0:25:07 go get their attention for you hmm we
0:25:10 should go down together
0:25:11 all right let me just grab my Katana
0:25:13 here I go over I smooth back my blonde
0:25:16 hair grab the katana and sheath and make
0:25:18 a nod for us to move out towards the
0:25:20 court
0:25:25 together you make your way into the
0:25:28 court and as you open the door Tim yes I
0:25:32 need a will power roll
0:25:34 ticks up eight plus
0:25:36 that's a zip okay as you enter the court
0:25:38 you see there are various memories of
0:25:41 the domain who stand to greet you and
0:25:45 among them are three individuals in the
0:25:49 back
0:25:50 now you have I asked someone to have
0:25:52 joined the court you have the former
0:25:53 princess who have joined the court you
0:25:55 have the individuals who have already
0:25:57 been long-standing members of the New
0:25:59 Haven Court but in back it is three
0:26:02 Outsiders one of them is kind of a
0:26:06 strong jawed Italian man with like Bella
0:26:09 Lugosi Vibes in terms of like his
0:26:11 haircut and the black suit that he wears
0:26:13 beside him uh seemingly having engaged
0:26:16 in some friendly conversation before you
0:26:18 entered is a uh very attractive black
0:26:23 woman with tight braids with flecks of
0:26:26 gold kind of weaved into it she has a
0:26:30 lot of this gold jewelry that she's
0:26:33 wearing it's never like in gaudy or too
0:26:35 much it's all perfectly carefully placed
0:26:39 and along our collarbone on her exposed
0:26:43 hip due to like the low rise like the
0:26:46 low like hip jeans and like uh very dark
0:26:50 acid washed like denim that she wears
0:26:52 you see various tattoos all of them
0:26:56 depict some form of hieroglyphics
0:26:59 our lipstick has a flecks of gold and
0:27:02 then the same with the outer eye shadow
0:27:04 she very much has this look going that
0:27:07 captures your attention instantly it is
0:27:09 Kali someone you have had many
0:27:11 conversations with in the past at her
0:27:14 right stoic
0:27:16 and unmoving
0:27:19 is this hulking mass of a man wearing a
0:27:22 suit on his neck is the tattoo of Cobra
0:27:25 and for whatever reason he is wearing
0:27:28 sunglasses at night indoors and as a
0:27:31 bald head you recognize Cobra the
0:27:35 warrior of the setites that you have not
0:27:37 seen for some time the court Rises when
0:27:40 you take your seat the court is seated
0:27:42 and the room quietly watches to see what
0:27:44 you will say New Haven the knights have
0:27:48 been unusual to say the least and we're
0:27:51 here to discuss the unusual activities
0:27:53 that have going on and to see if we can
0:27:55 come to some sort of consensus or path
0:27:59 forward to hopefully dealing with them
0:28:01 and maybe maybe it means nothing to the
0:28:03 court of New Haven and it's just
0:28:04 Oddities hoping that a few of you will
0:28:07 come forth in the coming night to
0:28:09 discuss what you may know currently we
0:28:12 have some guests any ushers for
0:28:15 ambrosino and they're those which do you
0:28:19 invite to you first
0:28:21 and Virginia's the oldest correct you
0:28:24 have only what I have described oh God
0:28:27 oh God yeah I'm gonna go to the emergino
0:28:28 first and Regina strides forward
0:28:32 good evening oh Grace good evening I
0:28:35 have traveled too far to the domain of
0:28:36 New Haven in search of a protege one who
0:28:40 I have taught the secrets of the
0:28:43 Giovanni 2 with the expectation that she
0:28:46 would perform services in exchange
0:28:48 much to my disappointment win is not
0:28:53 present tonight
0:28:54 I was hoping to speak with her
0:28:57 I'm searching for a term of respect here
0:28:58 why don't you go ahead and enroll me and
0:29:00 educate a difficulty how to get what uh
0:29:03 intelligence
0:29:04 it's not a big title
0:29:08 come on do I
0:29:10 [ __ ] it yeah I do I don't want to piss
0:29:12 this guy off
0:29:16 two successes okay with two successes
0:29:19 you are aware that provided you are not
0:29:25 um actively insulting to him an array of
0:29:28 titles might work but something like sir
0:29:30 or Mr Giovanni all of these these things
0:29:34 are perfectly acceptable you're not
0:29:36 personally aware of how what Giovanni
0:29:38 titles are how they work but so long as
0:29:40 you are not actively insulting him he is
0:29:44 probably not going to take offense Mr
0:29:46 Giovanni I will inform when that you're
0:29:49 here and we shall make it so that you
0:29:52 can come together as soon as possible
0:29:54 she is currently dealing with something
0:29:56 that is important to the domain but I
0:29:59 understand her obligations to you thank
0:30:01 you surely you can understand that in
0:30:04 these tumultuous times my ability to
0:30:07 wait is limited I will send her a
0:30:09 message as soon as we're done here thank
0:30:12 you he bows his head deferentially to
0:30:14 the prince and once excused before
0:30:17 excuse them you will find that you will
0:30:19 have Hospitality in my domain for as
0:30:22 long as you need thank you and while I
0:30:24 would normally accept this for another
0:30:27 man
0:30:28 the Giovanni promise already grants me
0:30:30 this
0:30:35 congratulations on your new Praxis
0:30:41 and he turns and heads to the back what
0:30:43 carefully doesn't whisper yeah
0:30:46 uh of course all right
0:30:49 I will gesture for Kelis and Cobra Cobra
0:30:53 escorts khalis out into the open floor
0:30:55 She bows perfectly Your Grace I have
0:30:59 been sent
0:31:01 by those who I serve and offering
0:31:03 as you well know her name because
0:31:06 there is unfinished business between
0:31:09 your grace and the followers of sin we
0:31:13 forged an alliance through battle
0:31:15 against the Wayward bruja and we risked
0:31:18 our numbers on behalf of you at your
0:31:20 request
0:31:21 it was understood that in exchange you
0:31:24 would open your minds to the gates of
0:31:26 sin
0:31:27 and I've simply been sent
0:31:30 to see that promise carried out now
0:31:33 there are reactions
0:31:37 the asomites nor in particular are
0:31:40 perfectly still when Kali speaks but it
0:31:44 is like uh it is like energy that is
0:31:48 still and waiting for the opportunity to
0:31:52 be suddenly in a great deal of emotion
0:31:54 there they they're poised like [ __ ]
0:31:58 jungle cats ready to strike others don't
0:32:01 quite seem to understand exactly what's
0:32:04 being said but the tramir do and they
0:32:08 kind of also watch you expectantly
0:32:10 likely because they are aware of the
0:32:14 agreement you turn down
0:32:16 from Reiss and the bruja predictably
0:32:21 there's this quiet [ __ ] knew it
0:32:23 coming from some he takes it miles takes
0:32:27 it in for a few looks it over
0:32:30 Mrs khalis I do indeed recall the debt
0:32:34 that I owe the asomites for preventing
0:32:38 well I'm gonna let you roll up
0:32:40 [ __ ] give me a wish plus etiquette
0:32:43 difficulty six
0:32:46 I will take
0:32:47 seven successes okay
0:32:49 how would you like to rephrase that can
0:32:53 we start from the beginning
0:32:55 Mrs kalis I'm aware of the debt that I
0:32:57 owe the followers of set for their help
0:33:00 and prevention of the previous Praxis
0:33:02 and I am aware of the terms that I had
0:33:04 said at the time last time I was aware
0:33:08 it was a debt owed but it would be
0:33:10 nothing that I did not wish to do this
0:33:13 Gates while mentioned previously was not
0:33:17 anything that was agreed upon I am very
0:33:20 open to discussions about what
0:33:23 how to fulfill this debt to the
0:33:25 followers of set your grace
0:33:27 the debt was clear
0:33:29 surely
0:33:31 you do not believe that the followers of
0:33:33 set would risk their own lives in
0:33:35 support of you for such a frivolous
0:33:38 trait
0:33:39 I believe that the follows the set who
0:33:42 were very wise in seeing the past that
0:33:45 may come about and saw that this debt
0:33:47 was worth more in the future than
0:33:49 anything previously they were offered I
0:33:51 am very happy to fulfill my end of that
0:33:53 bargain but I wish to do it on terms
0:33:56 that I understand which was part of the
0:33:58 agreement
0:34:00 the followers have said preach
0:34:03 Enlightenment Johnny rolls his eyes
0:34:06 all that we intend to do
0:34:09 is meet such a request
0:34:11 to make you aware to open your eyes
0:34:15 I would free you from the Aeons and I
0:34:18 think we might have some fun
0:34:21 I think this is best discussed behind
0:34:23 more closed doors where we figure out
0:34:25 this agreement respectfully your grace
0:34:28 Ivan sent to collect you
0:34:30 the debt is to be paid tonight
0:34:33 you are to collect me indeed Your Grace
0:34:36 I'm to escort you and ensure your
0:34:39 comfort yes but that is not what you
0:34:42 said you said collect me yes
0:34:44 yes it would hardly be the first prince
0:34:46 collected by Norfolk I'm sure does
0:34:49 anyone in the crowd of princes look
0:34:51 uncomfortable with that comment oh yeah
0:34:56 I have much pressing business tonight so
0:34:59 as stated before I am willing to have a
0:35:02 discussion and it may involve me going
0:35:05 along with you respectfully Your Grace I
0:35:07 do not come here to negotiate an
0:35:09 agreement that has already been made
0:35:11 The Venture Marcus vital speaks up your
0:35:15 grace they come offering snake oil why
0:35:18 don't we simply remove them from the
0:35:20 domains that we can carry on with a
0:35:21 business that needs to be handled
0:35:24 you have my support brother
0:35:26 kalis
0:35:27 the agreement that I made was negotiable
0:35:30 from the get-go and it has not been
0:35:33 established I am not going to be
0:35:35 strong-armed into being collected this
0:35:39 night we can have a discussion about
0:35:41 this
0:35:42 or you can leave
0:35:44 she bows her head
0:35:46 if you refuse
0:35:48 I am left with no choice but to informed
0:35:50 nothing of your honor Cobra grunts like
0:35:54 like almost like a good one
0:35:58 as stated before I'm aware of the deal
0:36:01 that I made thank you for your time your
0:36:03 grace is she bowserhead and she starts
0:36:06 walking away back to you when she leaves
0:36:10 until the follow-up sets can
0:36:14 produce someone that is not going to
0:36:18 challenge everything I say I will find
0:36:21 them no tolerance in my domain what is
0:36:24 Johnny
0:36:25 because Garrett's reaction is great
0:36:31 Johnny who's probably been kind of uh
0:36:35 standing a few Paces off to the uh off
0:36:39 to the side from uh from miles has just
0:36:41 been kind of looking at uh the muscle
0:36:45 the set sites have brought and kind of
0:36:47 trying to look at opportunities where he
0:36:49 can break that he he kind of just looks
0:36:52 smugly satisfied and surprised that
0:36:54 miles going this this far to just stick
0:36:57 it to the satites
0:37:00 and other new business
0:37:02 has been a few days and I would like to
0:37:04 establish the positions of the New Haven
0:37:06 Court for the position of Center shawl I
0:37:09 would like to promote Johnny Johnny kind
0:37:11 of looks over at you like you [ __ ]
0:37:13 stupid
0:37:14 and he kind of grew like instinctly
0:37:17 reaches out and grips like the marble
0:37:19 hand railing next to him
0:37:22 even though he has been standing in the
0:37:23 center shell spot give it a give
0:37:28 don't give in to your instincts YouTube
0:37:32 for keeper of Elysium I would like to
0:37:36 promote dashwood back to the position he
0:37:38 held in the previous administration he
0:37:41 stands in bows Your Grace thank you for
0:37:43 my Sheriff I would like to promote wind
0:37:45 cabin as a quiet Applause
0:37:48 and for Scourge I would like to promote
0:37:50 back into his original position
0:37:54 randwick stands and Baus thank you your
0:37:56 grace quickly out of curiosity what kind
0:37:59 of mean does he wear in court the same
0:38:01 could we see that we have seen him
0:38:03 previously in yeah he's a pretty
0:38:06 non-descript man unassuming it'll go
0:38:08 overlooked yeah my understanding of the
0:38:11 current privilege and I wish the Clans
0:38:13 if they wish to change these or I have a
0:38:16 misunderstanding to please come see me
0:38:18 and we will rectify
0:38:19 uh currently the bruja previous
0:38:22 primogens is not around for now I'm
0:38:27 we'll have Johnny
0:38:29 the marble railing cracks and like
0:38:31 breaks apart under his grip as the
0:38:35 primogen
0:38:37 pieces of stone work fall clattering to
0:38:40 the floor
0:38:42 see that railing must have been weakened
0:38:44 during the previous practice
0:38:47 if the court notices
0:38:51 they leave Johnny alone this time
0:38:54 in terms of the mulcavians
0:38:56 I believe that is Knicks the Gangrel
0:38:59 uh win the toridor is Elsa uh the ventru
0:39:04 uh I will currently maintain as the
0:39:07 prince used to
0:39:08 for the Nosferatu uh was Renwick and
0:39:11 Fred Jamia was Reiss
0:39:13 Nick speaks up she looks to Dash with
0:39:16 the radio give me the radio and he gives
0:39:20 her this uh fearful look and he takes
0:39:23 out this [ __ ] radio he carries and he
0:39:26 gives it to her and she starts
0:39:28 moving the dials about not totally
0:39:31 competent in the use of a radio and this
0:39:36 tune starts to come in sounds uh some
0:39:39 sort of news casting in another language
0:39:42 and she gets up and she starts walking
0:39:46 out body twitching and ear pressed to
0:39:49 the radio
0:39:51 gonna politely ignore that
0:39:53 I would ask the privileging council to
0:39:55 reaffirm a harpy as quickly as possible
0:39:58 so that the domain can be whole again
0:40:02 otherwise the strange occurrences in New
0:40:05 Haven are concerned to us all I wish to
0:40:07 take a brief break come back to that and
0:40:10 please be ready to present any of the
0:40:12 findings or knowledges that you may have
0:40:15 so we may best be prepared to handle
0:40:17 anything coming our way
0:40:19 and I get up the court stands and I walk
0:40:23 off the stage so that they can get about
0:40:25 their business and so that I can text
0:40:27 when Johnny Broods after him
0:40:30 as the two of you head off to the side
0:40:32 you take out your phone you get ready to
0:40:34 send a text message using your T9 and
0:40:38 the truth you hear the click of the door
0:40:40 closing behind you there's a handful of
0:40:42 individuals come out of obviously

0:41:39 have brown eyes all of them are on the
0:41:41 same height all of them are dressed and
0:41:44 okay you're looking street clothes clean
0:41:47 and not wrinkled up but just kind of
0:41:49 street clothes what is your proposition
0:41:52 my proposal Your Grace Johnny reaches
0:41:56 behind his back uh grips the knife
0:41:58 hidden in his uh in his jacket it's
0:42:01 Praxis initiative could I have spent for
0:42:03 uh one round of physical increasing to
0:42:06 Davis yes yes you may all right
0:42:09 gentlemen the initiative is going to be
0:42:10 as follows miles you will be acting
0:42:13 first out of 19. two members of this
0:42:16 Ambush
0:42:18 will be acting Under 12 initiative and
0:42:20 Johnny you're on nine the remaining
0:42:23 three act together on E
0:42:26 so miles or on you all right with the
0:42:30 flashing my blade coming out of it
0:42:31 Scabbard I will point it at one person
0:42:34 uh pointing my sword at the the prince
0:42:36 essentially and looking at one of the
0:42:38 other faceless goons I will order them
0:42:40 to kill I am using command they're The
0:42:44 Willpower of six minus two difficulty
0:42:46 for voice so that'll make it a four
0:42:51 eight successes with eight successes
0:42:56 the subject of your eye finds themselves
0:42:58 compelled to turn on their Ally we will
0:43:02 go to the two individuals that will be
0:43:05 acting on the 12th the first one reveals
0:43:07 a crowbar hidden behind his back
0:43:10 you sense the presence of a ward when
0:43:13 the weapon is brandished and he takes
0:43:16 his crowbar and he swings it on you
0:43:20 they have three successes under attack
0:43:22 so this is new so quick addendum on my
0:43:24 turn can I spent two points to do
0:43:26 personal armor yes you may all right
0:43:28 [ __ ] gross
0:43:31 two points of blood
0:43:32 correct I roll 42 difficulty eight
0:43:36 looks like two successes dang it okay
0:43:39 I'm gonna go ahead to damage yep you
0:43:41 will be rolling against two sources of
0:43:43 damage one is an immediate three lethal
0:43:47 that you're hit with
0:43:48 and then this will be uh whatever he
0:43:51 rules for his attack
0:43:54 so it'll be three damage and then two
0:43:56 damage
0:43:58 eight successes so you have soaked all
0:44:01 of the damage caused by the ward and now
0:44:03 you are rolling soap versus the damage
0:44:06 of the actual blow itself
0:44:09 looks like four the below hits
0:44:12 you find yourself unmoved by the uh
0:44:15 attack the other individual reveals
0:44:18 claws
0:44:21 they too have three successes on the
0:44:23 attack and because claws equals AG We
0:44:26 Roll right you will not be using your
0:44:28 stamina doing my personal armor roll
0:44:31 nope only one success Okay so
0:44:35 you will be rolling your fortitude
0:44:36 against one egg
0:44:38 three successes he rakes at your suit
0:44:42 shredding the rust color jacket as she
0:44:45 claws at your back and we get to Johnny
0:44:47 so quick recap how many individuals are
0:44:49 in the room there are five Men Sailing
0:44:52 the two of you two of them have already
0:44:53 attacked one with a crowbar that
0:44:55 radiates this baleful energy and the
0:44:58 other has struck with claws Akin they're
0:45:02 not quite as uh long as impressive as
0:45:05 wins
0:45:06 bigger so there's three other
0:45:09 individuals one of whom he pointed out
0:45:11 and used a whammy on yes so two two who
0:45:17 are yet to attack including the prince
0:45:19 cool Johnny is going to draw the uh or
0:45:24 actually write his combat started he
0:45:26 drew his knife
0:45:28 he has a a long trench knife in his hand
0:45:31 with a set of uh spiked Knuckles over
0:45:34 his fist
0:45:36 and he is going to plunge that into the
0:45:38 head of the guy who was talking
0:45:41 potent's on damage is that
0:45:43 um per attack that is for the round for
0:45:46 the round so I'm gonna go ahead and
0:45:47 spend that now
0:45:49 yeah it's a knife so diff five
0:45:53 six successes a five dice will roll over
0:45:57 into damage
0:45:58 [Music]
0:46:00 so six successes on the dice plus five
0:46:04 additional for uh potents so 11 lethal
0:46:08 okay so he's Gonna Roll soak
0:46:12 he does have some fortitude
0:46:15 with five successes he only takes six
0:46:18 levels of damage and is smash to the
0:46:19 ground with a knife buried in his Temple
0:46:23 he Twitches as his nerves are played
0:46:27 with by the knife but he seems just
0:46:30 active enough to be able to move after
0:46:34 that three actions are taken the first
0:46:36 of the bunch reveals the switchblade and
0:46:39 they turn uh under the directive of
0:46:41 miles and stab their ringleader
0:46:45 foreign
0:46:46 with one success way to go buddy
0:46:51 too lethal
0:46:53 and the ringleader stays up after that
0:46:55 the ringleader goes and he attempts to
0:46:58 dread geez Johnny I'm just here with
0:47:01 scourge
0:47:03 he's six
0:47:05 Johnny yes his wounds are so significant
0:47:08 that while he growls and bears his fangs
0:47:10 at you
0:47:11 uh the knife that's buried in the side
0:47:13 of his head kind of keeps him from
0:47:16 looking impressive enough to affect you
0:47:19 he has botched his rule he may not
0:47:22 utilize presence on you period
0:47:25 the last one reaches out and grabs a
0:47:28 hold of miles and then we are on to
0:47:30 Solarity actions uh miles are you taking
0:47:33 any Solarity I have two Celerity actions
0:47:35 what is your first cellular area more
0:47:37 likely cutting this guy's arm off that's
0:47:39 hurting me
0:47:41 in order to do that you will need to
0:47:43 break free of his grapple sure what's
0:47:45 that entail it is a strength plus brawl
0:47:47 roll and it does take your action to try
0:47:51 three successes three successes is
0:47:54 enough to escape the Full Nelson that he
0:47:56 tried to keep you in
0:47:57 Johnny how many Solarity actions do you
0:48:00 have five
0:48:03 let's see about that first one
0:48:05 Johnny's first Solarity action is going
0:48:09 to be stepping on the handle of the
0:48:12 knife that he buried in the leader's
0:48:13 head and use that to leverage a pop on
0:48:18 the top of the skull so he's going to
0:48:20 curb stomp his head because of his prone
0:48:22 position you're at a plus two die bonus
0:48:25 [Music]
0:48:27 nine successes
0:48:30 okay that was taking away two ones
0:48:35 eight successes uh uh we'll roll over
0:48:39 into damage
0:48:40 so that's one plus eight plus my
0:48:43 strength which is currently six
0:48:46 [Music]
0:48:48 so that's eight plus uh five from my
0:48:52 potents so 13 damage
0:48:56 um this is a boot Stomps that's bashing
0:48:58 but I did describe stomping the knife
0:49:01 utilizing the knife will make a lethal
0:49:03 so 13 lethal okay
0:49:06 he has three successes so you will take
0:49:09 10 levels of lethal damage with one
0:49:12 Health level he had remaining
0:49:14 so
0:49:16 the boot comes down there is an awful
0:49:19 squelching noise and some of it ends up
0:49:22 on the ceiling some of it ends up on
0:49:24 your clothes some of it ends up on miles
0:49:26 but where your boot landed there isn't
0:49:30 very much left
0:49:31 and aside from the missing head that is
0:49:36 surrounded by gray matter Gore his body
0:49:38 quickly begins to rot he doesn't turn to
0:49:41 Ash but he definitely turns into this
0:49:44 old dry desiccated corpse the others
0:49:47 look shocked at what they have seen and
0:49:51 too afraid of the consequences of what
0:49:54 they might suffer if they yield they
0:49:56 continue their attack albeit perhaps too
0:50:00 slowly as we go back to miles
0:50:03 so I threw off this guy's arm so it
0:50:06 sounds like it's
0:50:12 I'll be five successes four will roll
0:50:14 over into damage
0:50:18 four it was soak one and take three
0:50:21 levels of damage
0:50:23 he is not made to frenzy by this great
0:50:25 so it sounds like I hit off the arm with
0:50:27 one and just come down with a diagonal
0:50:29 slice just straight through the middle
0:50:30 on him classic oh
0:50:36 it's good Johnny Johnny will uh pivot on
0:50:42 the spot and come up with a vicious
0:50:45 Rising uppercut to the guy with the uh
0:50:48 switchblade and just try to take his
0:50:50 head off
0:50:53 10 successes Jesus oh boy okay so nine
0:50:57 are going to roll over into damage
0:51:00 [Music]
0:51:03 there's at least a row of sevens that I
0:51:06 say with my potents that is 16 bashing
0:51:10 damage gross
0:51:11 [Laughter]
0:51:15 it will soak one
0:51:18 taking 15 levels of bashing damage but
0:51:20 it's bashing damage so they have it and
0:51:22 the Kindred condition halves that into a
0:51:25 mere Seven health levels of Bastion
0:51:27 damage rendering them unconscious
0:51:31 Johnny sacks into the head they flip
0:51:34 back they land on their neck they stop
0:51:36 moving
0:51:38 Johnny
0:51:39 is everyone around you is moving very
0:51:42 slowly by comparison you begin to
0:51:44 realize that you have time on your side
0:51:48 and you can continue your attack you can
0:51:50 light a cigarette you can do almost
0:51:51 anything you want to them in the
0:51:53 meantime please take your remaining
0:51:55 three actions are there any heavy
0:51:58 objects in the room there are expensive
0:52:01 things are often heavy and so
0:52:05 there are portraits on the wall with big
0:52:07 heavy expensive frames a massive desk
0:52:10 huge chair covered in thick heavy
0:52:13 expensive leather
0:52:15 fortunately miles has provided you an
0:52:17 arsenal
0:52:20 everything I have is very heavy because
0:52:23 it's all expensive that's right the
0:52:26 money makes it way more as as tempting
0:52:29 as the desk is he might need that for
0:52:31 business later
0:52:33 but is there maybe like a large
0:52:38 marble Bust or statuette standing
0:52:42 somewhere along the uh the way I'll
0:52:44 consider that a question for Miles you
0:52:47 had mentioned tasteful art had been a
0:52:50 previous description for this office I
0:52:52 don't know if that's included but I
0:52:54 recall those words yeah I'd imagine
0:52:57 there's some sort of like I imagine
0:52:59 there's some sort of Buster statuesque
0:53:03 thing I haven't yet figured out what it
0:53:05 is but I feel like it's not going to
0:53:06 matter in the next 10 to 15 seconds so
0:53:08 you know there is a marble bust of the
0:53:12 famed Roman general Scipio a little
0:53:15 Johnny is going to uh grab scipio's face
0:53:18 and an overhanded smash Mr crowbar into
0:53:22 the ground
0:53:26 since he attacked miles during a chance
0:53:28 I had his back I will say yes because it
0:53:31 is hilarious
0:53:33 that's too dice it is
0:53:37 uh six successes five will carry over
0:53:41 into damage
0:53:42 the subject come with damage I was gonna
0:53:44 say what is the damage rating on a
0:53:46 marble statue of Scipio I'm gonna give
0:53:49 that a four die damage bonus for the
0:53:52 irony
0:53:54 no it's marbling I'm gonna say that
0:53:59 okay you did that
0:54:02 uh 13 levels of damage which I'm
0:54:05 guessing is lethal with a marble statue
0:54:07 it is they'll soak three and be reduced
0:54:11 to torpor Scipio as you're used to
0:54:13 powder
0:54:16 salted the Earth then [ __ ]
0:54:18 I've got two actions left and we have
0:54:21 the claws and the guy who's been struck
0:54:24 by the katana for my fourth Celerity
0:54:26 action I'm simply going to grab the guy
0:54:29 with claws
0:54:32 just three successes to grab him
0:54:34 sufficient he is grabbed celebrity five
0:54:37 Johnny um with one hand on each of his
0:54:41 arms I'm just going to simply try and
0:54:43 literally pull his arms out of the
0:54:45 sockets and and disarm him I do like the
0:54:49 theme of the new Hammett we're going to
0:54:50 take her arms off
0:54:53 no touchy
0:54:56 seven no touch
0:54:58 no touch pants off or hands off I'm
0:55:01 gonna call it a clinch so you are
0:55:03 rolling strength plus ball for uh damage
0:55:05 understood and I'm gonna go ahead and
0:55:07 spend a point of willpower on this one
0:55:08 up if that's okay it is okay
0:55:13 six plus my five levels of potence
0:55:16 that's 11 damage this Oak too uh so they
0:55:20 will be taking nine levels of bashing
0:55:22 damage which is then halved to four
0:55:24 levels of Bastion damage uh you very
0:55:27 easily dislocate one of the arms with a
0:55:29 very loud popping noise and then you can
0:55:33 even like under his T-shirt you can see
0:55:35 the way his skin stretches adding inches
0:55:39 of length to his arm
0:55:41 round two
0:55:45 miles what is that that one guy left it
0:55:47 up in front of me there is one guy uh
0:55:51 the other one is currently in the grasp
0:55:54 of uh Johnny I'm gonna look him in the
0:55:56 eye with the blood I got all the blood
0:55:58 drips off my sword unless he wants to so
0:56:00 just and uh command him to be still
0:56:03 current willpower he has a willpower
0:56:05 rating of five
0:56:07 so that'll make him a three for you yes
0:56:10 six rounds he remains still his turn he
0:56:14 remains still
0:56:16 five rounds remaining of being still
0:56:19 Johnny your turn Johnny will continue to
0:56:23 try and wrench the arms free
0:56:26 and that'll be another 11.
0:56:28 okay
0:56:32 he rolls over into lethal damage falling
0:56:35 unconscious and his left arm is torn
0:56:38 clean from his body his grace likes to
0:56:41 keep those that raise fingers to him and
0:56:44 he tosses the arms towards miles I
0:56:46 didn't spend the first letter to this
0:56:47 turn that it's been celebrity either
0:56:49 yeah good
0:56:51 miles a pair of arms lands at your feet
0:56:54 it's your turn what do you do and Johnny
0:56:57 raise a hand to me not raise a finger
0:57:02 laughs
0:57:04 and then I would kill this guy okay
0:57:08 [ __ ] right here
0:57:14 you're going to [ __ ] talk do it
0:57:15 accurately
0:57:17 a level of unprofessional
0:57:23 just says there might yet be another
0:57:25 round of combat the silence is filled
0:57:28 with a buzzing noise
0:57:29 for Johnny
0:57:31 Johnny does not carry a cell phone
0:57:34 so Johnny kind of like rolls his eyes
0:57:37 the Beeper withdraws two stakes from his
0:57:40 jacket and will stake the remaining two
0:57:43 unconscious uh vampires it is
0:57:46 hilariously easy for you to press a
0:57:49 stake through someone's ribs which is
0:57:51 not easy he pulls the uh he pulls the
0:57:54 Beeper off his belt without looking at
0:57:55 it kind of just points the two of them
0:57:57 we might not want to kill them we might
0:57:59 want to question them about some of how
0:58:03 they they did this let's see if they had
0:58:04 more conspirators that uh that crowbar
0:58:07 looked awfully weird to me it definitely
0:58:09 was
0:58:10 um he looks looks down at the Beeper it
0:58:12 is an SOS from your daughter
0:58:14 is there a number attached or it is her
0:58:17 number attached Johnny kind of pushes
0:58:19 past miles over to the desk and and sits
0:58:22 down and picks up the phone and calls
0:58:24 the uh calls the number I look at that
0:58:26 torn space where my code is just
0:58:28 ignoring Johnny more than likely it's
0:58:30 something concerning to him and I did
0:58:32 get him [ __ ] like two and a half
0:58:33 seconds ago so it feels about right look
0:58:37 at my poor bust of Scipio the one eye
0:58:39 that's left looks back up at you
0:58:41 dismayed I knew it was coming bro I'm
0:58:44 sorry
0:58:45 and um pulled the two bodies off while
0:58:48 he's making his phone call and basically
0:58:50 give him the the semblance of room and
0:58:53 then I will send the text to win that I
0:58:55 was starting to do before I was rudely
0:58:57 interrupted by some lesser Prince win
0:59:01 your Mentor ambrosino is in town and has
0:59:04 hospitality and would like to meet you
0:59:05 as soon as possible
0:59:11 win you've received a text message
0:59:15 after this kind of slightly disorienting
0:59:18 flash of light the TV is playing
0:59:21 something on the news you don't really
0:59:23 care at this point right now you're just
0:59:25 worried about Kabir who is lying on the
0:59:28 ground on the floor occasionally
0:59:31 twisting and murmuring about something
0:59:33 in his weird torpid like state
0:59:37 you can feel his pain may have a
0:59:40 willpower difficulty eight
0:59:42 don't love that
0:59:43 [Music]
0:59:45 one success
0:59:47 okay
0:59:48 with one success you experience a
0:59:51 strange sensation
0:59:54 an odd way the lighting in the room
0:59:57 shines a little brighter than maybe it
0:59:58 should and things don't line up like the
1:00:01 atoms that make up the universe around
1:00:04 you aren't aligned the way that they're
1:00:06 supposed to be
1:00:07 something is wrong reality is unreal
1:00:13 and In This Moment of clarity you
1:00:15 realize
1:00:17 that you may have some sort of power
1:00:19 over it
1:00:20 to a very limited
1:00:22 but existing extent
1:00:25 as you Ponder why they're not anything
1:00:28 is true
1:00:30 and if everything is permitted
1:00:33 one of the windows to the motel room
1:00:35 begins to grow cold
1:00:37 so cold that you can see the Frost
1:00:40 building up on it and through the other
1:00:42 side the eyes of a cat
1:00:46 when
1:00:48 time has been a very strange thing
1:00:51 now that she's been looking through
1:00:54 at the world through basically like an
1:00:57 attempt at 3D Vision but without the
1:00:59 glasses and she keeps getting these
1:01:01 glimpses of the world with the glasses
1:01:03 on her first thought is to
1:01:06 look and see if Kabir is still next to
1:01:08 her
1:01:09 when you look to Kabir what condition is
1:01:12 he in let me use that point of willpower
1:01:14 to take narrative control for this
1:01:16 moment
1:01:17 do you seize this
1:01:18 or Let It Go
1:01:22 if I seize it now
1:01:25 does that mean it's gone you'll receive
1:01:27 a number of opportunities to do this
1:01:28 that you may use
1:01:30 equal to the number of successes you
1:01:32 have had
1:01:35 at this time I will not cease narrative
1:01:38 control
1:01:40 he shares in Quakes as nightmares wreck
1:01:43 his body
1:01:44 beads
1:01:45 of blood red sweat
1:01:48 form at his forehead and he can tell he
1:01:51 is having horrific feverish nightmares
1:01:55 when makes contact with the cat eyes at
1:01:59 the window for a brief instant sort of
1:02:01 to acknowledge that it's there
1:02:03 but she's
1:02:05 doesn't generally give a [ __ ] when Mr
1:02:07 Perfect shows up
1:02:09 when has posted up by Kabir and
1:02:12 it's been forever it's been for an
1:02:14 instant it doesn't
1:02:16 makes sense how long it's been
1:02:19 she has a small stockpile of towels and
1:02:22 blankets and
1:02:23 and books
1:02:25 she's been beside him tending to him but
1:02:28 maybe he's also been asleep maybe time
1:02:31 has been longer
1:02:33 but she takes one of the towels
1:02:35 that's nearby and
1:02:37 wipes his face
1:02:39 and just kind of squeezes his shoulder
1:02:42 I'm here
1:02:44 it's gonna be okay
1:02:47 she doesn't know if it's gonna be okay
1:02:50 but
1:02:51 might as well comforted a man if if
1:02:55 possible as if the universe conspired to
1:02:58 prove you wrong the lights in the motel
1:03:00 go out
1:03:02 TV flickers back on
1:03:05 snow and static become loud in the room
1:03:09 distractingly loud
1:03:11 and you begin to hear the news report
1:03:14 storm
1:03:16 a storm coming in the shadowlands the
1:03:18 underworld perishing
1:03:20 sixth grade maelstrom
1:03:23 the sixth great maelstrom
1:03:26 the sixth great maelstrom
1:03:29 now that a boy can survive
1:03:32 is it the newscaster's voice or a
1:03:35 different voice it is a different voice
1:03:37 whose voice is it you're not terribly
1:03:39 sure but then the bathroom light turns
1:03:41 on and starts to flicker on and off and
1:03:43 on and off and on and off and every time
1:03:45 it comes back again some sort of
1:03:48 humanoid Shadow grows longer
1:03:51 hey girl I've got some bad news
1:03:55 I know you're here so how much worse can
1:03:57 it really get bold question that storm
1:04:00 they've well you've been warned about
1:04:02 and that eventuality it's coming the
1:04:06 whole Cosmos is cracking like an egg and
1:04:09 what's inside is about to surface they
1:04:12 are not gonna like what comes about I
1:04:14 get the feeling neither are you well
1:04:18 it depends
1:04:20 the cynical side of me welcomes in the
1:04:22 opportunity to see you suffer I'm
1:04:25 willing to tolerate a lot just to see
1:04:27 that happen but there are some things
1:04:29 some things I even I dare not think of
1:04:32 some things then
1:04:34 I better left than imagined for fear it
1:04:37 may come to life is that why you keep
1:04:39 coming to me so you feel like you have
1:04:40 some power over the things you're afraid
1:04:42 of they're medium they're all meant to
1:04:44 come to you that's the price you pay for
1:04:46 looking where you shouldn't wind kind of
1:04:48 gives a smirk but doesn't say anything
1:04:51 they call it the sixth grade Maelstrom I
1:04:53 know what they call it they also call it
1:04:55 the last yeah I know that too why are
1:04:59 you here to tell me things I already
1:05:00 know
1:05:01 because there are things you don't and
1:05:03 I'm here to sell them to you for a price
1:05:07 it's cute there's things you think I
1:05:08 need from you that I can't get from
1:05:10 other people things that you need now
1:05:12 what about Joey what about him don't you
1:05:16 think Joey deserves a chance away from
1:05:18 it
1:05:19 why are you asking me that well a
1:05:22 challenge whether or not you needed
1:05:24 something
1:05:25 and I think you do
1:05:27 I think Joey needs something
1:05:30 I think
1:05:31 El Charon
1:05:33 still has his boys out and about
1:05:36 and The Boatman
1:05:38 may be able to save him
1:05:41 but he's got to get to The Boatman
1:05:44 and you think that you're the one to
1:05:45 make the escort
1:05:47 wow
1:05:48 I think I'm the most likely to succeed
1:05:51 not my dice to roll though I suppose and
1:05:53 what do you want in return for this
1:05:56 uncharacteristically altruistic Act
1:06:03 I Wanna Know
1:06:04 out of this place
1:06:06 I want a night of the storm
1:06:09 you see
1:06:10 way back Way Way Back
1:06:15 that storm
1:06:16 opened up the Labyrinth
1:06:19 to the great beyond
1:06:21 and something came out
1:06:23 the uh scientific term
1:06:28 the small fan yeah sounds a real
1:06:31 scientific
1:06:33 I don't make the terms chair on oh green
1:06:38 hero of the Dead Road out to face him
1:06:42 1v1 son of a [ __ ]
1:06:44 and he
1:06:46 the greatest Among Us the most respected
1:06:50 most powerful
1:06:52 he won the night
1:06:55 but it cost him everything and now he's
1:06:57 gone
1:06:58 and I was one of them one
1:07:02 they
1:07:04 wow
1:07:05 let's just say they're not the top of
1:07:09 the food chain
1:07:12 Grandma's waking up Grandma who the
1:07:15 antithesis of God
1:07:18 and she's hungry
1:07:20 and boys like Joe here used to pick a
1:07:22 dumb nut much safer
1:07:25 oh Joey might have an opportunity to
1:07:29 find his peace and move on
1:07:31 I'm sucking for a place to lay low why
1:07:34 do you think you deserve that this isn't
1:07:36 about deserving
1:07:37 this is a matter of transaction
1:07:41 so what do you say
1:07:43 do it for the kid
1:07:45 is Joey's fate something I can control
1:07:47 with my one narrative control Joey's not
1:07:50 in the scene
1:07:55 I would like to [ __ ] around a bit with
1:07:57 some necromancy let's find out how it
1:07:59 goes when is attempting to compel Mr
1:08:03 Perfect to ensure that Joey's that Joey
1:08:07 is safe okay in the best way she knows
1:08:10 how the role for this is going to be
1:08:13 first against my point of blood and then
1:08:16 you are going to roll manipulation plus
1:08:17 occult against his willpower at
1:08:21 difficulty six
1:08:22 and I am going to spend a willpower on
1:08:24 this have I been refreshed at all or am
1:08:26 I still sitting where I was
1:08:28 uh you were sitting where you were okay
1:08:35 how many successes do you have four one
1:08:38 two three four five six seven successes
1:08:42 on the part of Mr Perfect so there is a
1:08:45 drawback to this if the ghost wins the
1:08:48 vampire loses a number of points of
1:08:51 willpower equal to the ghost's net
1:08:53 successes so you will lose three points
1:08:56 of willpower
1:08:58 you exert necromantic power over the
1:09:00 specter
1:09:01 but find yourself having underestimating
1:09:04 how
1:09:06 interconnected and willful these
1:09:08 creatures are and he shakes free of the
1:09:11 magic just long enough to give you a
1:09:12 glare you [ __ ] can she now exert
1:09:16 narrative control you may if you so
1:09:18 choose our roles are flipped I won by
1:09:21 three understood you see things starting
1:09:23 to go wrong and you bank on that
1:09:25 inconsistency in reality and finds that
1:09:29 it worked that as he hisses at you he
1:09:34 suddenly begins to grow quiet as you
1:09:37 issue your command now with three
1:09:39 successes
1:09:40 the vampire May issue three orders as
1:09:44 outlined for one success alternatively
1:09:46 they may demand the ghosts fulfill one
1:09:49 difficult and dangerous task or a simple
1:09:52 assignment that has an extended duration
1:09:55 up to one month the ghost May delay such
1:09:58 orders with willpower now one success
1:10:00 okay the ghost must perform one simple
1:10:03 task for the vampire that does not place
1:10:05 it in certain danger it must attend to
1:10:08 this task immediately although it can
1:10:10 delay compulsion and pursue its own
1:10:11 business at the cost of one will power
1:10:13 point per scene the ghost may not attack
1:10:15 the vampire until this task is complete
1:10:17 it is possible to issue the task of
1:10:20 answering one question in which case the
1:10:22 ghost must answer truthfully and to the
1:10:25 best of their knowledge so what is going
1:10:27 on as you can send it to do one really
1:10:29 really dangerous thing three very simple
1:10:32 things or something that is not terribly
1:10:36 difficult to do but he is stuck doing it
1:10:38 for a month so what do you compel Mr
1:10:42 Perfect to do what I would like is to
1:10:45 tell Mr Perfect you will send me a
1:10:47 fairyman who will ensure my Joey's
1:10:49 safety as he moves on he lets out a hiss
1:10:54 the Shadows the lights the TV playing
1:10:58 everything kind of returns to just as it
1:11:00 was and kind of standing inches off the
1:11:04 ground is Mr Perfect this ugly
1:11:07 desiccated thing or the eyes of a cat an
1:11:11 old tattered clothing that gives last
1:11:14 nod clearly wanting to fight it but then
1:11:17 he is gone also
1:11:20 Kabir is gone and you are alone in the
1:11:23 motel
1:11:24 when
1:11:25 takes a minute she would like to
1:11:27 celebrate this victory
1:11:29 and you feel that as you shoved reality
1:11:31 in favor of yourself something else
1:11:34 happened
1:11:35 she will activate Spirit tracking and
1:11:37 attempt to find Kabir
1:11:43 Johnny who do you call he grabs the
1:11:46 phone off of Miles desk that he
1:11:50 mercifully left standing dialed the
1:11:52 number on his beeper for his daughter
1:11:56 10. Jessica that's pretty bad I
1:12:02 I don't know if you know what's going on

1:13:05 you have any silver Jessica
1:13:07 no I don't
1:13:09 if you or any of your friends can find
1:13:11 pure silver so it is a bane against
1:13:14 these creatures do not fight it but if
1:13:18 you are cornered
1:13:20 silver is how you can fight it I will be
1:13:24 there as soon as I can baby I'm so sorry
1:13:26 there is a noise like crunching metal in
1:13:30 the distance and she hangs up
1:13:33 Johnny holds the phone to his ear listen
1:13:36 to the dead air for a second longer than
1:13:39 he should his lips almost trying to
1:13:42 force more time for him to tell her that
1:13:44 he loves her and then he puts the phone
1:13:46 on the receiver
1:13:48 miles I have to go my daughter's in

1:14:00 Neil out to do his ritual stuff that's
1:14:02 right we have the revolver with the six
1:14:04 silver bullets correct I think uh
1:14:06 Arabella got it for us Johnny does
1:14:09 indeed draw the revolver from its
1:14:12 shoulder host holster and check on those
1:14:14 six silver bullets to make sure they're
1:14:15 there they are all still there now
1:14:18 Johnny I need a willpower roll at
1:14:21 difficulty eight
1:14:23 two successes both tens you have two
1:14:26 successes in the idea
1:14:31 campuses you
1:14:33 see you but you find yourself able to
1:14:36 pretty easily find where this trouble
1:14:39 might be happening and over in uh one of
1:14:42 the residential areas you see
1:14:45 one of the old like late 90s Volkswagen
1:14:48 Beetles now they used to be like the
1:14:50 bright colors it's like a green one that
1:14:53 is flipped upside down and smashed there
1:14:56 are cars that are parked all over the
1:14:58 place some have like been caught in
1:15:00 minor fender benders there are no people
1:15:02 around and that rare occasion where you
1:15:05 do find someone they're hiding
1:15:08 shivering curled up in balls and Afraid
1:15:12 and waiting to die delirium he lowers
1:15:15 his head
1:15:16 and he listens carefully from for sounds
1:15:19 of violence on the air you walk through
1:15:22 the densely populated area that is
1:15:25 somehow over the ghost of moments
1:15:27 transformed into a ghost town you can
1:15:30 hear the footfalls of your boots this
1:15:32 place has never been so quiet
1:15:35 and eventually you hear a footfalls kind
1:15:39 of moving behind where the old stone and
1:15:42 mortar walls
1:15:43 he unsheathes the revolver and turns to
1:15:47 face the source gum pointed at the
1:15:49 ground Embraces himself for whatever is
1:15:52 about to come around the corner
1:15:54 around the corner and there's Ramirez
1:15:57 who shines a flashlight on your face
1:15:59 Johnny puts a hand up to to cover his
1:16:02 eyes oh what the hell man
1:16:04 Flex the flashlight off as Johnny met

1:16:53 happening everywhere the whole world's
1:16:55 going crazy Johnny it kind of blinks a
1:16:58 little bit not really like his brain not
1:17:01 really wanting to establish the truth of
1:17:02 what he's saying I
1:17:04 I don't know what you're talking about

1:17:28 bullets inside of it if it kills me or
1:17:32 I'm incapacitated you need to get this

1:17:36 mortified at the idea of killing someone
1:17:39 all right here's the thing here's here's
1:17:42 my part right okay for a moment
1:17:46 a few of the guy's pain
1:17:47 he's haunted by his daughter

1:17:51 Johnny's expression of guilt is plain to
1:17:55 see as it washes over his face I don't
1:17:58 think he's all bad maybe if we can just
1:18:00 get through to him or something he's not
1:18:01 all bad he didn't deserve to lose his
1:18:04 daughter
1:18:04 let's just you know

1:18:13 thank you
1:18:15 and the two of you started sending out
1:18:16 to look for the others Neil
1:18:19 [Music]
1:18:23 we pick up again with you marking the
1:18:25 walls with your blood and preparing the
1:18:27 windows so that the daylight doesn't
1:18:29 breach through and kill everyone
1:18:32 with you kind of quietly watching
1:18:35 holding this warm little cup that he's
1:18:37 he's prepared is Fester
1:18:40 you can't drink it but he can enjoy the
1:18:44 smell all the watch as you prepare their
1:18:46 hotel room except for all the weird
1:18:48 blood room uh blood runes and the
1:18:50 circumstances kind of a cozy domestic
1:18:53 scene Fester definitely seems interested
1:18:55 in making the best of it and in the
1:18:58 bathroom you hear the sound of the
1:18:59 shower turning off the sink begins to
1:19:02 run and then Fester moves to stand
1:19:04 closer SWA
1:19:06 what's supposed to happen next I uh I
1:19:09 don't know man I um
1:19:12 I'm
1:19:15 we need to get back to New Haven and we
1:19:17 need to get rid of back to New Haven I I
1:19:19 don't know how to do that right now I
1:19:22 mean Sun's gonna be up any minute and I
1:19:24 just
1:19:24 I don't know I'm gonna be honest I'm
1:19:26 getting some pretty weird vibes from
1:19:28 your Toyota friend there yeah
1:19:31 okay so you see it too right yeah
1:19:34 what I don't know everything kind of
1:19:36 went crazy after that but when we were
1:19:37 back at the gala she
1:19:41 Prince work had something and was
1:19:43 talking to her and then like some weird
1:19:46 people that were saying some [ __ ] to her
1:19:48 that I didn't understand and then um you
1:19:51 know Pendragon was like stomping around
1:19:52 and like he was just like politics or or
1:19:55 whatever but there's like she was like
1:19:58 holding on to him and he was holding on
1:19:59 to her and they did not make eye contact
1:20:01 with me and
1:20:04 I don't know man I don't know I I'm
1:20:06 pretty good at reading people but but
1:20:07 then also sometimes I get inside my own
1:20:10 head and I don't I'm not always the best
1:20:12 with that Neil
1:20:14 do you want my professional opinion I
1:20:16 honestly I trust your opinion a lot when
1:20:19 it comes to these kind of observations
1:20:21 like yeah yeah I would yes
1:20:24 it kind of gives the impression that
1:20:25 she's a little embarrassed like
1:20:28 no don't Rescue Me
1:20:30 is it like she's trying to get laid
1:20:33 that
1:20:34 you didn't see that she like looked away
1:20:37 from you when you when you tried to like
1:20:39 say stuff to her I just if I'm being
1:20:42 totally honest I kind of assumed that
1:20:43 she just like was
1:20:44 like nervous and didn't want me to [ __ ]
1:20:46 it up like yeah no I got that too but I
1:20:49 think you're missing the other half here
1:20:52 it's like a like a like a hostage
1:20:55 situation like death on the line kind of
1:20:57 Neil
1:20:58 the [ __ ] vampires yeah I know every
1:21:01 single conversation they have is with
1:21:03 someone that might one day try to kill
1:21:05 them
1:21:07 that's not that's not exactly a turn off
1:21:09 anymore you know what I mean like this
1:21:10 isn't like she's been a she's been a
1:21:13 vampire for like what a couple of months
1:21:15 man you know those habits haven't had
1:21:17 time to set in I think
1:21:20 oh God I hope
1:21:22 she's a toyer it's like [ __ ]
1:21:24 programmed in there
1:21:27 can she even like
1:21:30 can she what let's go there what's going
1:21:32 on Neil I wasn't watching physical
1:21:33 questions what's the question yeah I
1:21:35 understand it actually works faster okay
1:21:39 I've done sex
1:21:43 all right just just so I know that you
1:21:45 know explaining to me
1:21:48 for Lola
1:21:50 I just want to hear you say it so I know
1:21:52 that you know because I know

1:22:02 know it's
1:22:04 oh yeah maybe but also no back it up now
1:22:07 no now we're here now I don't want to be
1:22:10 here man it's like one of our in prison
1:22:13 guards it's just like washing their
1:22:14 hands in the other room like I don't
1:22:16 want to have these like weird
1:22:17 conversations about their boss and like
1:22:18 sailing away from they get back no the
1:22:20 [ __ ] the matter with you we talk now
1:22:23 just forget we have
1:22:27 different ideas of what is and is not in
1:22:30 earshot don't [ __ ] condescend me it's
1:22:33 not condescending I'm just I've had a
1:22:35 stressful day some of you can we not
1:22:37 fight right now [ __ ] that
1:22:39 that's half my point so here's what I'm
1:22:41 thinking
1:22:42 okay okay
1:22:44 friend
1:22:45 is uh
1:22:47 just having a moment
1:22:49 right you're here trying to rescue her
1:22:52 or something what's going on you ever
1:22:54 been um I put a ton of thought into it
1:22:57 and I've been having a Time recently and
1:22:59 let's do some thinking I tired of
1:23:04 things being taken away and
1:23:08 um you ever been
1:23:11 kidnapped human held hostage oh yeah
1:23:14 yeah
1:23:15 in those moments would what would you
1:23:18 have done to have somebody there with
1:23:20 you even if they couldn't do anything
1:23:22 just to
1:23:23 so you weren't alone
1:23:25 I follow what you're saying things are
1:23:28 oh man
1:23:31 you and I have always been pretty tight
1:23:32 I think but uh
1:23:35 things are always different at home
1:23:36 they've been different the last couple
1:23:39 of months and you know doing that doing
1:23:41 that math doing that social math I um
1:23:44 I don't want to go back to the way
1:23:45 things were when she wasn't around with
1:23:47 Cutlery you know what I mean no I have
1:23:49 no [ __ ] idea what you mean right now
1:23:52 I don't know I just what's different now
1:23:55 people
1:23:56 they I mean we're all we're together
1:23:58 more we're we're doing things we're
1:24:01 moving forward we're talking to each
1:24:03 other or being proactive we're
1:24:06 um
1:24:07 you know there's like a uniting force
1:24:09 there's like a like a glue in the middle
1:24:10 of everything that that wasn't there
1:24:12 before you know and you think root is
1:24:14 that glue well
1:24:16 if things were different before than
1:24:18 they are after she showed up then yeah
1:24:19 yeah I do think she's she's that little
1:24:22 she's you know win's been around a lot
1:24:25 more
1:24:26 um
1:24:27 Johnny and I have actually had like
1:24:29 conversations and and done [ __ ] together
1:24:32 miles doesn't just look at me like I'm
1:24:36 gross or useful you know
1:24:39 just it's been nicer recently and maybe
1:24:42 this is I don't know my perspective is
1:24:44 probably [ __ ] flawed because I've
1:24:45 been wrestling with
1:24:47 [ __ ] recently you know who I am as a
1:24:50 person
1:24:52 how monstrous things can be I I don't
1:24:56 know I'm all confused thinking about
1:24:58 myself like this isn't it's really easy
1:25:00 to look at everybody else sometimes it's
1:25:02 hard to look at you and yourself and
1:25:05 so I just I don't know her being alone
1:25:09 being snatched out of the cities and sit
1:25:11 well with me not after everything and
1:25:14 so so this is you uh taking steps to
1:25:18 make sure that things don't change too
1:25:19 much for New Haven okay that's the goal
1:25:22 that's
1:25:23 I don't even know if it's magnanimous to
1:25:26 say you know I don't know if I can say
1:25:28 New Haven I
1:25:29 freeze my uh information for you yeah
1:25:33 what happens when this little neonator
1:25:36 decides that she does want things to
1:25:38 change
1:25:40 I haven't fought that far ahead thought
1:25:43 that far ahead
1:25:44 well I don't I don't know
1:25:49 um the future is
1:25:51 visible but immutable
1:25:54 or a visible but mutable
1:25:57 you know so I I mean faster it's the end
1:26:01 times man the [ __ ] does that even mean
1:26:03 though I mean it and you know what it's
1:26:05 always the end time I don't know no no
1:26:07 no no I mean yes yes yes like a henna
1:26:10 end times man come on now there's no
1:26:12 such thing as gehenna no no no I'm not
1:26:16 even I'm not gonna pretend what you have
1:26:18 is a uh volatile situation between the
1:26:22 sex right now and in the other room
1:26:24 right
1:26:26 they got the glue of New Haven
1:26:29 which
1:26:30 probably got a better term for it well I
1:26:33 didn't come up with the term glue of New
1:26:34 Haven and I didn't mean New Hampshire
1:26:36 okay Neil and then you got the guy
1:26:40 who has a [ __ ] Army mm-hmm
1:26:43 what if maybe uh this started as Romans
1:26:47 playing but now we're in your friends
1:26:50 game
1:26:51 maybe she's uh
1:26:54 how do I put it tenderly for you
1:26:58 okay well maybe she's gonna seduce him
1:27:01 get this guy to become invested in New
1:27:04 Haven's future
1:27:06 I what if she's more competent than
1:27:10 you're given her credit for that's all
1:27:11 I'm saying you're saying I should have
1:27:13 faith in her everybody around me is so
1:27:15 [ __ ] self-sacrificing all the time
1:27:17 you know I was hoping if you're waiting
1:27:20 for your turn everybody to risk it all
1:27:22 for your friends you're kind of missing
1:27:24 the point
1:27:25 yeah
1:27:27 I don't think we really had a moment
1:27:29 that's a little off topic I'm
1:27:32 thanks for bringing me tonight and I'm
1:27:35 really really glad that you're okay
1:27:37 I appreciate the hell out of that Neil
1:27:39 thanks for slowing down long enough to
1:27:40 see me yeah yeah
1:27:43 and then you're reminded of a
1:27:45 conversation you never had and a moment
1:27:47 you never experienced and you were taken
1:27:49 back to the night that you were held in
1:27:52 custody waiting for your destiny to be
1:27:54 determined while on trial for your sires
1:27:58 crimes and you are reminded of a moment
1:28:00 where a figure slipped into the room the
1:28:03 way they approached you
1:28:05 the way they met your eyes
1:28:08 the way they give careful instructions
1:28:11 as though the future will laid before
1:28:13 them and they could plod your course as
1:28:16 if to create a specific moment and you
1:28:19 hear the words not clearly but murmured
1:28:22 into the recesses of your mind
1:28:24 and you recall the need
1:28:26 for fire
1:28:27 that fire
1:28:29 would ward off the unclean
1:28:32 and open the way to your sire
1:28:36 and when you come to
1:28:38 and realize where you are you can feel a
1:28:43 cool breeze from the morning the window
1:28:47 open smashed lights scorching down to
1:28:51 the carpet chunks of glass
1:28:54 bits from the molotov that you quietly
1:28:57 stepped away from Fester to make
1:28:59 and you can hear the distant screaming
1:29:01 of your friend who runs through the
1:29:03 remnants of the night in search of cover
1:29:05 Before Dawn finally strikes
1:29:08 and you find yourself steadily closing
1:29:11 the curtains
1:29:12 and Sun proofing the room all over again
1:29:16 from the bathroom
1:29:18 a man enters your space he is dressed as
1:29:22 the Assassin who had haunted you through
1:29:25 Boston and as his hood is pulled back
1:29:28 you recognize your sire
1:29:35 Fredo you make a way down a long hallway
1:29:38 with Roman and once through the door he
1:29:42 silently closes it behind the two of you
1:29:45 you can feel the weight of the distant
1:29:47 Sun soon
1:29:49 it will take you
1:29:51 and you will be overcome with Restless
1:29:53 sleep
1:29:54 the old bruja
1:29:57 despite the Surly expression he had
1:30:00 earlier
1:30:01 he seems
1:30:03 distracted now as if attempting to focus
1:30:06 on reaching the next night
1:30:10 so slowly he takes off the coat that is
1:30:14 covered in blood and dust
1:30:16 and
1:30:18 as she starts to remove the layer of
1:30:21 Filth from him he looks to you
1:30:25 you're a soldier
1:30:27 bread is not entirely sure the meaning
1:30:30 of that statement and a couple
1:30:33 possibilities run through her mind
1:30:36 things that he shouldn't know about her
1:30:40 but Rita does what she can to conceal
1:30:43 that confusion
1:30:46 and looks down by this point walking
1:30:49 through the hallway most of the filth
1:30:51 that would have gotten on her
1:30:53 would have been left in the hallway but
1:30:57 there's still so much Ash and remnants
1:30:59 of the fight
1:31:02 um I I guess
1:31:05 you guess
1:31:08 it's not really my first thought to
1:31:11 fight
1:31:12 but if it comes to it
1:31:15 what is your first thought
1:31:17 he approaches
1:31:19 and like as though you had no say over
1:31:23 the matter
1:31:25 he like pulls you by the corset and
1:31:28 makes you hold still while he starts
1:31:29 undoing it there's a soft noise of
1:31:32 confusion she at first thinks that she's
1:31:35 done something that he finds to be wrong
1:31:37 but as soon as she understands the
1:31:40 intention
1:31:41 she starts doing math in her head she
1:31:43 starts trying to figure out when she was
1:31:45 there during the long process of getting
1:31:47 the stress on with help does this seem
1:31:50 like she could even be like no I'll get
1:31:53 it off or does it seem like that would
1:31:55 be mathematically impossible before the
1:31:57 sun came up I think your main concern
1:32:00 here is the morning sun yeah
1:32:02 realistically you could not get it off
1:32:04 by yourself without a great deal of that
1:32:06 he could probably have more Tech
1:32:09 it's why I called it math because I'm
1:32:11 trying to figure out not only could I
1:32:13 get it off by myself and could I get it
1:32:15 off by myself in any form of timely
1:32:18 manner so Britta does the math as
1:32:20 quickly as she can trying to figure out
1:32:22 exactly even if she were to protest what
1:32:25 it would be worth
1:32:26 there's a tensing as that thought
1:32:28 happens but especially with the
1:32:31 roughness of how he starts but it's the
1:32:35 reasonable thing to do it's just
1:32:36 rational at this point right to let him
1:32:40 help her
1:32:41 so she sells and says
1:32:44 I realize that not everything can be
1:32:47 worked out but
1:32:51 um I guess that is my first instinct
1:32:53 compromise
1:32:55 yeah and what are your instincts tell
1:32:57 you about this
1:32:59 this about onslaught
1:33:02 why wouldn't the vicos target you there
1:33:07 as you ask you kind of realize the two
1:33:10 of you are in front of a mirror
1:33:12 and you can see his reflection behind
1:33:15 you considering the question
1:33:18 the vicos is old it's
1:33:22 it is
1:33:23 a loyal member of the Sabbath but it has
1:33:26 its own intentions its own designs
1:33:31 if I were to guess
1:33:35 I would say that if the vikos were to
1:33:38 pursue me an hour to meet final death at
1:33:41 the hands of the Sabbath I would be made
1:33:43 immortal
1:33:45 I might even be remembered as a good man
1:33:47 in the eyes of my clan and it is wise
1:33:50 enough to know that I am none of these
1:33:51 things
1:33:53 so it is better to take the victory that
1:33:56 they came for and plan the next step
1:33:59 so long as I'm here John Peterson's
1:34:02 dreams of unification are unlikely
1:34:06 my instinct is that it's meant to be a
1:34:09 massive show of force to demonstrate
1:34:13 that those powerful in the camaria
1:34:15 wouldn't be able to stand up to the
1:34:18 Sabbat
1:34:20 to try and make sure that people are
1:34:23 afraid and to use that fear
1:34:26 most of the camera runs
1:34:29 most of them
1:34:30 would hide and wait for someone else to
1:34:33 fight their fights
1:34:35 they wouldn't exactly fetch a sword if
1:34:38 sent to collect one in the midst of a
1:34:39 fight
1:34:42 but you did
1:34:44 but it looks down there's not really
1:34:46 anywhere to look with there being a
1:34:49 mirror and the proximity
1:34:52 when you summoned me to kill me
1:34:57 you made it pretty clear that
1:35:01 you um
1:35:04 that there were certain things that you
1:35:06 valued
1:35:07 in potential allies
1:35:11 that you didn't appreciate the cowardice
1:35:14 of running when you asked for
1:35:18 us to meet you and that you
1:35:21 that you wanted your
1:35:24 instructions to be understood so I
1:35:26 wanted
1:35:27 to
1:35:28 show that my code rate could be that
1:35:32 and now I
1:35:36 there's a lot of things that we
1:35:38 are but um
1:35:42 when we
1:35:43 decide to do something we mean it
1:35:47 so yeah
1:35:48 I am
1:35:51 you you didn't kill me and I know that
1:35:54 you could have
1:35:57 and I am
1:36:00 I'm hoping that will be true for my
1:36:02 codery too
1:36:05 well
1:36:07 the nature of my relationship with your
1:36:10 quotery
1:36:12 is in the hands of you and your
1:36:13 companions
1:36:15 I think I have been forthright with my
1:36:18 intentions
1:36:20 have I not
1:36:22 I think so
1:36:25 the question becomes
1:36:27 what is it that you want in all of this
1:36:33 I think that we managed to
1:36:36 fight our way out by working together
1:36:40 and I think that
1:36:43 that's what's needed if people
1:36:46 if the camera if
1:36:49 all of that if if we're to survive the
1:36:53 Sabbat
1:36:55 secrets
1:36:57 are poisoned to this plan of yours you
1:37:01 see that do you know
1:37:04 it's
1:37:06 there's not many safeties
1:37:09 in
1:37:11 in that plan but
1:37:14 some Secrets take even the smaller
1:37:16 safeties away
1:37:19 and no wonder what safeties are at risk
1:37:22 he says running his hands down the sides
1:37:25 of your arms until his hands
1:37:29 are over yours
1:37:31 and then he starts to pull your gloves
1:37:33 off
1:37:35 and then he casually tosses your gloves
1:37:38 aside
1:37:39 he retakes your hands
1:37:43 and then holds them up so that your
1:37:46 palms are facing the mirror
1:37:48 and your crescent moon is laid bare illa
1:37:52 instinctively would have tried to pull
1:37:55 her hand close to herself but she
1:37:57 probably wouldn't have put up much of a
1:38:00 physical resistance it's probably the
1:38:02 first real demonstration of him being
1:38:05 forceful as he kinda does not let you
1:38:09 recoil from what he intends to
1:38:11 demonstrate and he forces you to see the
1:38:15 Crescent Moon on your palm even in that
1:38:17 even when she can't fight that movement
1:38:20 there's the automatic curling of her
1:38:22 fingertips and words towards her Palm as
1:38:25 if that could help to cover it it likely
1:38:27 absolutely not not with it being not
1:38:30 with her Palm being spread to face the
1:38:32 mirror it's just an instinct and the
1:38:36 absence of a heartbeat to be going crazy
1:38:39 feels heavy in her mind because there's
1:38:43 just Instead The Silence of listening to
1:38:45 the room and her eyes immediately flick
1:38:49 up to his trying to figure out exactly
1:38:51 exactly I mean he almost did that like
1:38:54 he knew it would be there
1:38:56 she's thinking through the the mirror
1:38:58 that was in the room that he provided
1:39:00 her the various moments and she's trying
1:39:02 to figure out him sitting in the limo
1:39:05 commenting on the Crescent Moon outside
1:39:07 she's trying to figure out if he seems
1:39:09 like he already knew something
1:39:11 what Trust
1:39:13 can there be
1:39:15 between the black hand and eye the
1:39:17 flicker of confusion on britta's face
1:39:20 widens to a pretty immediate jolt of
1:39:26 apprehension as she realizes that the
1:39:28 general of the camerian Army against the
1:39:31 Sabbat is asking her if she's Blackhand
1:39:33 effectively and reflexively she says I'm
1:39:37 not I'm not Blackhand it's I I know they
1:39:40 have I've seen on delcado's Palm this
1:39:43 but it's not the same thing I don't know
1:39:45 um why it's listening how do you know
1:39:47 Delgado he's in The Killing Spree and
1:39:49 part of that pack he we just killed his
1:39:52 Abbott
1:39:54 and you know him and no other way
1:39:57 Brett has already been called out on a
1:40:01 secret that she really thought she could
1:40:03 have kept a bit better and she knows
1:40:06 from his visits to New Haven that
1:40:09 Pendragon is aware of Johnny Sabbat
1:40:12 rumors she's
1:40:15 parsing through what she wants to say
1:40:17 there don't worry about opening my can
1:40:19 of worms [ __ ] save yourself but
1:40:21 brother would worry
1:40:24 she doesn't want to say it but she
1:40:27 doesn't think that there's really a way
1:40:29 out of the conversation that doesn't end
1:40:32 worse than saying it so
1:40:35 um
1:40:36 he was um
1:40:39 Johnny sire before Johnny got to the
1:40:42 camarilla
1:40:43 my sire was also Sabbat
1:40:47 very hesitant flicker of relief that
1:40:51 Britta regrets as soon as it gets on her
1:40:53 face because she's not certain if that's
1:40:55 accurate does this please you
1:40:58 he says clearly having noticed her
1:41:00 reaction
1:41:01 um I I tell
1:41:04 I guess I'm just hoping that it means
1:41:06 that you would have
1:41:08 empathy
1:41:10 I and the words kind of die in her
1:41:14 throat as he Echoes that word but it
1:41:17 does seem to be close enough to where
1:41:19 she was going to finish her sentence and
1:41:21 she kind of awkwardly nods
1:41:23 empathy is not in my nature
1:41:26 but perhaps more importantly it doesn't
1:41:29 explain why you have the Crescent Moon
1:41:33 and why those Kindred were looking for
1:41:36 you
1:41:37 Freda finds herself self-conscious of
1:41:41 not just the crescent moon but
1:41:43 the fact of how cold
1:41:45 that I see chill innate to her hands and
1:41:49 her eyes flick back up to her Palm as
1:41:52 they keep talking about it she wants to
1:41:55 keep looking down but she feels so caged
1:41:58 in that it's like one of the only ways
1:42:01 she feels she can even squirm is to kind
1:42:04 of look around while she's looking
1:42:05 around he takes off her corset an
1:42:08 automatic jerk to try to cover herself
1:42:14 once that's happened he goes back to
1:42:16 Preparing himself for the day's rest
1:42:19 listen he lets go he does let go
1:42:23 well with that being the case she will
1:42:27 lift well is it it's falling to the
1:42:30 floor isn't it yes so she crosses to the
1:42:34 nearest Sarah like a little kind of that
1:42:37 sort of end blanket the kind of blanket
1:42:39 at the end of a bed yes she'll grab that
1:42:42 and just try to cover herself quickly
1:42:45 don't make a mess he warns
1:42:47 and he heads to the bathroom stops at
1:42:51 the doorway and says to you I have not
1:42:54 decided
1:42:56 whether or not I will toss you out to
1:42:58 greet the Sun
1:43:00 but know that it is on my mind
1:43:04 shakely nons and adjusts
1:43:08 so to make absolute sure that the
1:43:12 small blanket is only touching the parts
1:43:15 of her skin that were covered by the
1:43:16 dress therefore no Ash no blood no
1:43:18 anything luckily that means her hands
1:43:21 are perfectly clean they actually was
1:43:23 wearing gloves but she looks at him and
1:43:28 very quietly in a bit of a final play
1:43:32 voice shaking
1:43:34 she says
1:43:36 I know that the people that Warwick is
1:43:39 working with put this Mark on me when I
1:43:42 was still immortal I don't remember much
1:43:45 but I've gotten bits and pieces like
1:43:47 that I know that they're not the black
1:43:51 hand
1:43:52 they're a separate organization they're
1:43:55 there called the tomahira
1:43:59 before he closes the door he actually
1:44:01 looks a little disarmed by the sudden
1:44:06 Blast Of Truth coming from Brother about
1:44:09 it
1:44:10 and he seems to close the door
1:44:14 starts the shower and begins to decide
1:44:18 what he's going to do about you
1:44:20 once the water is going and it provides
1:44:23 that very temporary illusion of safety
1:44:26 there's a kitchenette right there is
1:44:29 Berto will head over
1:44:31 well one thing first actually before the
1:44:33 kitchenette there's windows in this room
1:44:35 or no there are since her hands are
1:44:38 clean uh she will go and make sure that
1:44:41 each and every one of them is close and
1:44:44 if she has to use something to cover
1:44:47 them further to ensure that there's not
1:44:50 further Danger from the Sun she'll do
1:44:52 what she can but after that she'll go
1:44:55 over and scrub off what she can using
1:44:59 the kitchen sink and probably starting
1:45:01 sitting on the counter
1:45:03 so that she can get the grime off of her
1:45:06 feet and work up she's not looking to
1:45:09 fully clean herself just to take that
1:45:13 smallish chance of uh bettering her
1:45:16 chances of not muddying up the room with
1:45:18 all these you know remnants of dead
1:45:21 people and battle and sort of dry off
1:45:25 with and probably there's a little like
1:45:28 towelette or something but as if your
1:45:30 efforts could be sensed you feel the
1:45:33 pull of Roman summons
1:45:36 how strong is that it's pretty strong
1:45:38 it's even worse because I've been
1:45:40 summoned before right right I mean I
1:45:42 don't have a choice that's basically
1:45:45 like I ask how strong is it because I'm
1:45:47 basically asking how fast am I moving
1:45:50 you realize you have been summoned but
1:45:55 by the time you do your hand is on the

1:48:59 [Laughter]
1:49:02 Rob Rebecca is visibly squirming uh but
1:49:06 was not the one most upset by this that
