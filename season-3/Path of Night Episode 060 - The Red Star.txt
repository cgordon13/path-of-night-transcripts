0:00:24 discretion is advised now let's walk the
0:00:27 path of night
0:00:29 [Music]
0:00:36 last time the path of night the
0:00:38 quarterly fought veto one final time
0:00:40 Johnny bolstered by mysterious magic
0:00:43 struck him down only for the corpse to
0:00:45 take form as a terrifying Dragon ready
0:00:48 used enchantments Reiss gave her to
0:00:51 weaken it but unknowingly paved the way
0:00:53 for Reiss's plot to kill Eden to unfold
0:00:56 I remained the tough call to save the
0:00:58 last daughter of Eve and revealed
0:01:00 himself as an aster
0:01:02 arrived and assisted miles as he beat
0:01:05 back the weaves of Flesh monsters when
0:01:07 wind was swallowed by the dragon to
0:01:10 knock slow time and together the quarter
0:01:13 he managed to take down The Shard of the
0:01:14 Elvis and survive
0:01:16 [Music]
0:01:26 all that's left now is
0:01:29 a mass of burning flesh
0:01:33 as the fire begins to consume this entry
0:01:37 the systems that normally would contain
0:01:39 the fire long exhausted at this point
0:01:41 and it's just a matter of time before
0:01:44 this Subterranean Haven is destroyed
0:01:47 completely by the fires
0:01:49 a group of you
0:01:51 those of you who can move better than
0:01:53 others
0:01:54 start to gather up
0:01:56 and Survey just how bad things have
0:01:58 gotten
0:01:59 Britta in particular is scrambling back
0:02:01 from the side of the explosion and eyes
0:02:05 wide at the idea of fire she looks the
0:02:08 group
0:02:09 there's there's so much that's flammable
0:02:12 in here we really gotta go so when
0:02:14 effectively standing very close to the
0:02:17 center of the explosion when she came
0:02:20 out the acid burned until it burned into
0:02:23 fire and she is she is effectively naked
0:02:26 not effectively she's actually naked
0:02:29 clothes having been burned off hair
0:02:31 eyebrows eyelashes
0:02:33 but she doesn't have a scratch on her
0:02:36 that said she has just been inside a
0:02:38 dragon her eyes are very wide and she is
0:02:41 kind of looking around to Quick survey
0:02:43 the rest of the group and when Britta
0:02:45 speaks
0:02:46 she starts taking a visual inventory of
0:02:49 who can walk and who's going to need
0:02:51 help she can see that Brett is up with
0:02:54 Ira Ira having used that magic to take
0:02:57 her away from the bless so the two of
0:02:59 them likely look like they can walk and
0:03:01 help people out Ira looks hurt from
0:03:05 earlier in the night with the flesh
0:03:08 crafters and the chainsaw he can walk
0:03:10 but he is staring at the fire and the
0:03:15 Carnage and everything just happened
0:03:16 with shell-shocked eyes and still has
0:03:19 that hint of some form of internal Panic
0:03:23 that win had caught earlier but gives a
0:03:26 nod and looks around
0:03:28 we need to leave
0:03:31 Johnny is a smoking ruin of how he
0:03:36 walked into this fight his genes are a
0:03:41 tattered mess having been splattered
0:03:43 with acid and burned off a good portion
0:03:46 of him is just a knotted mess of of
0:03:49 burned flesh is the remaining hair on
0:03:53 his head is hanging in scraggly mess his
0:03:56 uh whole upper body is just spattered
0:04:00 with bits of acid and and laced with
0:04:03 burn marks and he kind of just looks up
0:04:05 at you guys through lidded eyes and kind
0:04:09 of just nods his chainsaw has sputtered
0:04:13 out since the explosion and he kind of
0:04:16 just looks at it and the the acid is
0:04:19 even starting to kind of eat away at
0:04:21 that and it looks like the actual chain
0:04:23 is starting to fall off the the blade of
0:04:26 of the of the thing so he just kind of
0:04:27 tosses it aside and starts kind of
0:04:30 limping over to get somebody's shoulder
0:04:32 to help him start moving out of here
0:04:34 miles had been fairly close to the
0:04:36 explosion at the time and been moving to
0:04:38 help Britta with the the Escape for win
0:04:41 so he had ended up on his back away from
0:04:44 the explosion just also smoking but
0:04:47 getting up he's not terrible in terms of
0:04:49 overall like his clothes are ruined his
0:04:52 glasses are gone the hair is a mess but
0:04:54 for the most part he seems fine he just
0:04:56 Haggard tired just slow to move getting
0:05:00 up utilizing the katana to like lever
0:05:03 himself up and start moving towards the
0:05:05 rest of everyone else kind of quickly
0:05:07 scanning the area but just getting away
0:05:09 from the fire is like number one concern
0:05:11 and then two is seeing where everybody
0:05:13 else is at when when she sees Johnny
0:05:17 beaten down and Haggard and Miles
0:05:20 knocked about in his glasses missing she
0:05:24 goes over and she doesn't she doesn't
0:05:27 firemen carry Johnny but she definitely
0:05:29 takes the The Lion's Share of his his
0:05:33 weight onto her shoulders and then she
0:05:36 helps him over towards Miles because she
0:05:39 knows he's not going to be able to see
0:05:40 super well without his glasses and just
0:05:43 kind of like puts his hand on her
0:05:45 shoulder so he can follow and lean if he
0:05:47 needs to but then she kind of looks at
0:05:49 Britta and Ira okay the fastest way out
0:05:53 of here Britta is just keeping his
0:05:55 Stranglehold on the idea of getting out
0:05:56 that's the thing that's making her
0:05:58 functional right now and she's
0:06:00 heightening her vision to see if she can
0:06:02 spot miles's glasses Lex if I no no
0:06:07 absolutely not
0:06:16 the heat alone of this root no it's gone
0:06:19 there's something glinting in all the
0:06:22 viscera and Britta thinks it might be
0:06:24 some of the Glass glasses she's not
0:06:28 with a shutter she's not willing to
0:06:30 further investigate and realizes that
0:06:32 they're lost Ira can you lead us out of
0:06:34 here Ira looks at when then does one
0:06:38 last check over his shoulder to make
0:06:40 sure that the thing he promised to do
0:06:42 got done and Eden is actually okay when
0:06:46 again there's that look specifically
0:06:47 when he looks at Eden that something is
0:06:49 wrong not in the same way where he was
0:06:51 looking like oh my God she's a demon but
0:06:53 yeah he see she's okay pulls his coat
0:06:57 off
0:06:58 the tattered remains of his coat but
0:07:00 still mostly functional and as the nude
0:07:04 sheriff is helping the mostly nude Santa
0:07:06 shawl just kind of whips it around her
0:07:08 shoulders as of some form of protection
0:07:11 against the Heat
0:07:12 let's let's go this way yep and the
0:07:17 expression on Wynn's face she's sort of
0:07:20 like Mom has come home from work and
0:07:22 found that the kid she left in charge
0:07:24 has had a breakdown and we have to pick
0:07:26 up a lot of pieces all at once but she's
0:07:28 not willing to let any one of those drop
0:07:30 so she's taking care of the physical
0:07:31 needs of uh Johnny and miles but she is
0:07:35 not forgetting to give looks of
0:07:38 compassion to Britta for understanding
0:07:41 that this is likely the end question
0:07:44 mark of a very very traumatic night when
0:07:49 we'll find that when she tries to shift
0:07:51 those looks of compassion over to Bretta
0:07:53 that Bretta is dodging them and it seems
0:07:56 either subconscious or purposeful but
0:07:59 for whatever reason something in Beretta
0:08:02 doesn't want to let that in she is
0:08:04 looking to Ira to see the way out and
0:08:07 she's going over to Eden to make sure
0:08:10 that someone's with the kid someone's
0:08:12 guarding her she's actually kind of
0:08:15 specifically also trying to not look at
0:08:17 either one of you but she does kind of
0:08:19 like eye contact away ask
0:08:24 um I don't know if one of you could fit
0:08:26 in the trench coat or something if you
0:08:28 want close the only reason I would want
0:08:30 to stop for them would be so we can
0:08:32 avoid making an incident when we get out
0:08:34 to the road but honestly let's get out
0:08:36 of here first and she also has spared a
0:08:39 look for Ira like she sees he has also
0:08:42 been through something though it's
0:08:45 decidedly different from British Johnny
0:08:47 kind of cracks his best at a smile and
0:08:50 it becomes obvious as he kind of lazily
0:08:53 looks at you that one of his eyes looks
0:08:55 like it's not working at this point no
0:08:58 these These are Levi's 501s they'll
0:09:00 survive anything
0:09:02 Predator tries to laugh it comes out a
0:09:04 little strangled but she's she'd makes
0:09:06 an attempt it's not really working his
0:09:09 gaze slowly kind of swings over to Ira
0:09:11 did you do something to me let's get
0:09:13 outside
0:09:15 and with because whatever it is I think
0:09:17 is wearing off and I feel like [ __ ] Ira
0:09:20 uh nods and as Johnny says that Ira
0:09:23 starts taking some steps to get out of
0:09:25 here and away from the fire and whatever
0:09:27 magic or the trauma just the trauma of
0:09:31 this event just like breaking through
0:09:33 his demeanor or what like he's yeah
0:09:35 because wound penalties are starting to
0:09:36 kick they are kicking back in for Ira as
0:09:38 well yeah when we'll also do a quick
0:09:41 look around and see if Romeo is still
0:09:43 here Romeo is not present wind doesn't
0:09:45 like that but also doesn't think that
0:09:47 mentioning it is going to be helpful to
0:09:49 anyone at this moment and so just
0:09:52 follows Ira this way I don't know if the
0:09:56 uh I don't know if the wards will still
0:09:59 try and keep you down here but stay
0:10:02 close I'll try and help put out the way
0:10:04 where I can follow me and Ira uh
0:10:07 remembering that this place as described
0:10:09 by Reiss is intended more to keep things
0:10:12 in than keep them out uh is going to try
0:10:15 Ai and Lead everyone as quickly as
0:10:18 possible to the surface without letting
0:10:20 any of the remaining Wards if any of
0:10:22 them are even still in place lead anyone
0:10:25 astray so the damage to the property
0:10:27 whether it be in the form of the fungus
0:10:29 flesh acidic monsters or fire as largely
0:10:33 left the wards and shambles so make the
0:10:38 way out is actually pretty easy the only
0:10:40 thing that really kind of does seem
0:10:42 problematic is when you guys get far
0:10:44 enough you come to the initial entrance
0:10:47 or the door had been broken that door
0:10:50 has sustained enough damage being torn
0:10:54 off a change that you can't simply just
0:10:55 close it Ira is this brute strength or
0:10:58 finesse Hyrule looks at it nods this is
0:11:01 more of a brute strength if we can shove
0:11:04 it into place I can help she helps she
0:11:07 leads miles to the wall for him to lean
0:11:10 on does the same for Johnny she will
0:11:13 spend blood
0:11:15 to bring it back up to six okay and when
0:11:18 we'll just start pushing this is going
0:11:20 to wear off soon anyways do you want a
0:11:24 hand
0:11:25 yes I do Ira seeing wind I mean this is
0:11:28 a massive vault door and seeing wind
0:11:31 trying to help Ira will use the very
0:11:34 last of the excess blood before it all
0:11:37 goes away anyways to pump himself up to
0:11:40 an 18 strength Jesus to just help her
0:11:44 lift with like you can see it like his
0:11:47 strength is starting to give out
0:11:48 whatever magic allowed him to pull off
0:11:51 these like Feats of blood potency is
0:11:54 faltering but with the last of it we'll
0:11:56 try and help win get things into place
0:11:58 Johnny can you please help oh oh Britta
0:12:02 was not expecting Ira to be the guy
0:12:05 stepping up to help with issues of
0:12:07 strength between IRA and win spending
0:12:10 the last of their reserves here can we
0:12:12 sort of put this big stupid vault door
0:12:14 into place you guys have sufficient
0:12:17 strength and you can press it up to the
0:12:18 doorway but again nothing's holding it
0:12:20 in place okay
0:12:22 um I could try and see if I could relock
0:12:25 it but
0:12:28 thank you while they're messing around
0:12:31 the door Johnny has kind of slumped down
0:12:34 next to Miles he kind of looks over and
0:12:36 trying to put out a brave face and smile
0:12:40 is this how every night of uh your new
0:12:43 domain is going to be your your grace
0:12:45 miles takes a minute and kind of comes
0:12:48 back from wherever his mind had been
0:12:50 just kind of refocus his back and
0:12:53 acknowledging his words and takes a deep
0:12:55 breath I'd rather hope not this this
0:12:58 sucked I'd rather not never do that
0:13:01 again yeah
0:13:08 that was a [ __ ] Dragon right I I have
0:13:11 no idea it is beyond anything I've ever
0:13:15 seen or heard of it was
0:13:18 a terrible thing and I hope this is not
0:13:21 how the nights keep going maybe maybe
0:13:24 it's the last of the Terrible Things No
0:13:26 this this was just a fragment right yeah
0:13:30 like these [ __ ] Premier bastards
0:13:33 found a fragment and brought it down
0:13:34 here put it into veto or I don't know
0:13:39 how this works but I think the fragment
0:13:41 found Vito what the [ __ ] is in New York
0:13:43 miles
0:13:45 worse
0:13:51 when it takes a minute once she doesn't
0:13:53 have the guys on either side and slips
0:13:55 her arms into Ira's coat and buttons it
0:13:57 real quick just we're gonna be going out
0:13:59 in public I really don't want to get
0:14:01 pulled over for public nudity right now
0:14:02 so let's just keep it going Ira looks
0:14:05 over at win as they're like holding the
0:14:07 door in place Sheriff you've survived a
0:14:11 lot tonight I think I know of a way to
0:14:15 seal this door so no one goes in or out
0:14:19 but I hate to ask it of you because I'm
0:14:21 going to need help bracing it she kind
0:14:24 of grunts as she's putting her shoulder
0:14:26 into the door to try and keep it from
0:14:28 falling keep it in a in a like an
0:14:31 equilibrium I guess would be the word
0:14:33 Britta following the queue just leans
0:14:36 trying to add what little she can for
0:14:39 weight and strength to win's hold Ira
0:14:41 looks at Britta and then looks back at
0:14:43 when
0:14:44 I'm gonna light this door up oh and
0:14:47 Freda kind of separates a little bit
0:14:48 from the door looking at Ira for
0:14:52 um
0:14:52 so we need to ground ourselves if we
0:14:54 brace it if you can ground her and he he
0:14:57 gives sort of like a like an
0:14:58 appreciative nod of like look it pains
0:15:01 me to say this maybe but you're a gang
0:15:03 girl if I can't ground properly can you
0:15:06 still help me hold the door well Beretta
0:15:09 has a good understanding of science is
0:15:13 there something that in this room I
0:15:15 could use to help when be grounded
0:15:17 against electricity the area that you're
0:15:19 in is predominantly Stone kind of Mason
0:15:24 work there really isn't anything even
0:15:27 loose around the save for the door
0:15:29 itself it's a very cleared out area as
0:15:31 far as bracing yourself there really
0:15:34 isn't a ton of options in that case
0:15:36 spreta will shed her trench coat and
0:15:40 hand it to win indicating that she could
0:15:42 put it between her hands and the door
0:15:44 use it as a bit of a shield a bit of a
0:15:47 glove that kind of idea when Britta
0:15:49 offers her coat a win just like nah I I
0:15:52 think I got this
0:15:54 you sure it's not like you're gonna yell
0:15:56 at me if I get it wrong
0:15:57 Britta doesn't even try to get a laugh
0:16:00 for when her eyes are just big and she's
0:16:03 surveying the damage that the Gangrel
0:16:05 has gone through there's none you do
0:16:07 seem to be all right so she will step
0:16:10 back and try to hand the trench coat off
0:16:13 to Johnny as he is lacking in close too
0:16:17 Johnny Takes the Train the trench coat
0:16:19 kind of looks at it with a with an
0:16:21 eyebrow raise and sets it down next to
0:16:22 him I know you said your Levi's are fine
0:16:24 but I don't know offering coats is a is
0:16:27 a proud tradition in this codery anyway
0:16:29 let's go light me up well I'm gonna try
0:16:32 not to and Lex I believe in you I am
0:16:35 going to use Zeus's Fury through path 11
0:16:39 bolt to try and Arc weld this door in
0:16:41 place give me Dex crafts I am going to
0:16:43 spend one of Ira's willpower on this he
0:16:46 really is trying not to hurt the sheriff
0:16:49 three successes alright with three
0:16:51 successes you're able to steal the door
0:16:53 and it looks like it looks like this is
0:16:57 the end at this point it's just the walk
0:17:00 to wherever it is that you're going
0:17:02 before the sun comes to claim you how
0:17:04 soon does that look like it's gonna be
0:17:06 you're already starting to feel it
0:17:08 Bretta picks her trench coat back up
0:17:10 after Johnny just kind of gives it a
0:17:12 sour look and she shot fills back into
0:17:14 it and says
0:17:17 um miles can I
0:17:20 um actually never mind well
0:17:23 um where are we going guys we can well
0:17:26 that's sort of part of it I was gonna
0:17:28 ask if you were okay with me and Eden
0:17:31 being in a spare room or something but I
0:17:34 also guess
0:17:35 um and her eyes are like pointed
0:17:37 completely towards the ground when she
0:17:39 says
0:17:40 I think I need to ask for Hospitality
0:17:44 right we can handle that later I guess
0:17:48 this is a good time of hunting I have a
0:17:52 new place prepared I'm just gonna do a
0:17:55 little ceremony and a kind of a party
0:17:57 thing but I guess this is as good as any
0:18:00 time
0:18:01 I think we're running out of other
0:18:02 places to stay we're rapidly running out
0:18:04 of other options yeah my Haven's a
0:18:07 little bit complicated at the moment oh
0:18:09 Jesus Christ it is
0:18:10 okay um how are we getting there is it
0:18:12 close enough to walk or do we need to
0:18:14 call a car we have a car here we arrived
0:18:16 in the car
0:18:17 it's been a long night okay it's fine
0:18:19 Ira is standing kind of off to the side
0:18:21 now that the Coterie is talking about
0:18:23 like hey let's go to our like miles's
0:18:25 new place and the last of the excess
0:18:27 blood now that his magic is wearing off
0:18:29 is just leaking out of his body and he
0:18:31 looks at the prince you Grace is there
0:18:37 place
0:18:38 if I could beg your hospitality
0:18:41 for me to stay that is not under the
0:18:45 direct control of the region and
0:18:48 clantromere
0:18:50 wind kind of gives him a look and that
0:18:55 look she caught him making earlier makes
0:18:58 a little more sense bread is wide-eyed
0:19:01 as well it doesn't seem to quite match
0:19:03 up with what she was expecting miles
0:19:05 looks him over sees like the strength
0:19:08 essentially just leaking out of him at
0:19:10 this point physically
0:19:12 we've done a lot tonight for us for the
0:19:15 domain and I'm sure there's more to tell
0:19:18 so
0:19:20 do not make me regret trusting you the
0:19:23 rules of hospitality are old your grace
0:19:27 and yours to rescind at any time
0:19:31 so long as it is offered to me I will
0:19:33 abide by the rules of a guest
0:19:36 you also need to swear to me to now
0:19:38 reveal the location
0:19:40 after tonight
0:19:42 I had assumed that you may want to
0:19:46 engage in some quid pro quo what an easy
0:19:49 price to pay excellent for safety this
0:19:53 for that
0:19:54 when so I was looking at Bretta who
0:19:56 seemed a little lost no it wasn't the
0:19:59 expression it was something else I just
0:20:01 well start being a good guess by giving
0:20:03 me a hand up here power company Ira
0:20:05 extends a hand to Johnny Johnny grabs it
0:20:07 lifts himself up he could feel that that
0:20:10 Johnny strength is still very much with
0:20:12 him iris is not Ira actually like has to
0:20:15 brace a little bit to help Johnny up
0:20:16 from the ground he levels his one good
0:20:18 eye at Ira Osama
0:20:21 pretty neat trick there you holding up
0:20:23 the door he kind of like looks down in
0:20:25 his arms I'm gonna let this one slide
0:20:27 because I'm in such rough shape but
0:20:29 don't forget I'm the strong guy around
0:20:31 here okay let's go I he saw you in the
0:20:36 basement
0:20:37 I don't think any of us could forget
0:20:39 Johnny is kind of looks towards where
0:20:43 win is not really being able to locate
0:20:45 where she is being that he's he can't
0:20:47 see out of that one eye and kind of
0:20:49 smiles back at her and nods along and
0:20:52 then puts his weight onto iron goes all
0:20:54 right help get me out of here and Ira
0:20:57 tries his best to follow at this point
0:21:00 Miles because he seems to know where
0:21:02 we're going
0:21:03 um miles can you see well enough yeah
0:21:05 it's not great but I'm not blind all
0:21:09 right give me a vague Direction what's
0:21:10 your prescription
0:21:12 your grace
0:21:13 and Ira kind of adjusts his own glasses
0:21:15 on his face it's fine I just can't do
0:21:18 this for long periods of time I just
0:21:20 well I mean I think the question is can
0:21:22 you drive yes I can drive all right
0:21:25 let's go the group of you leave miles
0:21:27 can I have a DEX plus drive plus some
0:21:29 difficulty what kind of car did he bring
0:21:31 this one's just an SUV okay we showed up
0:21:33 in the in the Chevy right actually I
0:21:35 think we're in an ugly black straight
0:21:37 SUV because I didn't want us to be
0:21:38 noticed coming such growth from season
0:21:40 one when we get to the the car when
0:21:43 we'll kind of discreetly go on the
0:21:45 driver's side passenger door but look
0:21:48 look over at Miles and be like do you
0:21:50 want to drive or do you want me to drive
0:21:52 I'm gonna try a backseat drive and I'm
0:21:55 not sure if that should be a penalty or
0:21:56 a bonus
0:22:00 that'll be three successes wind will
0:22:02 actually climb in the trunk space of the
0:22:03 SUV so Britta and Ira and Eden can all
0:22:06 have seatbelts when that doesn't really
0:22:08 seem like you have to do that I can just
0:22:10 float miles tell them where you they go
0:22:17 so we start driving towards the nicer
0:22:20 area of New Haven and we start getting
0:22:23 into a place with large-scale mansions
0:22:25 and there's a bunch of shrubs and
0:22:28 whatnot and we come up on a gate and he
0:22:31 ends up putting in a code and driving
0:22:33 them down along into a a house that's
0:22:36 set back but seems to look onto East
0:22:38 Rock Park it seems to be secluded and
0:22:42 away from the street and in the pack you
0:22:45 can see partially as we drive in a pool
0:22:47 back there and it seems to be like a
0:22:49 long one-story house and it's kind of a
0:22:52 little bit eccentric in some ways versus
0:22:54 miles previous house it's very warm in
0:22:58 here there's wood flooring all over the
0:23:01 place that's polished really well and
0:23:02 it's just there's long odd shaped rooms
0:23:05 wait a minute it's one story it's
0:23:08 essentially one is it like a weird
0:23:09 mid-century modern kind of place yeah oh
0:23:12 man there is a like a second floor that
0:23:15 goes under ground that's almost as large
0:23:16 as the first floor please tell me
0:23:19 there's like a Tory gate somewhere on
0:23:20 the property
0:23:22 I hadn't thought about it I don't think
0:23:24 originally you might have but it's it's
0:23:26 possibility or maybe not that
0:23:28 ostentatious yeah but there's definitely
0:23:29 a sand garden like yeah a standard Rock
0:23:31 Garden somewhere yeah
0:23:33 and like there's just there's a number
0:23:35 of rooms that kind of come off there's a
0:23:37 huge living room that kind of overlooks
0:23:39 into the downstairs a little bit from
0:23:41 there that seems to be like another rec
0:23:43 room and it's like a weird combination
0:23:46 of kind of an open floor plan but like
0:23:48 with all the weird curves and stuff like
0:23:49 that no like no long sight lines exist
0:23:52 um before we touch anything I think we
0:23:54 really need to get out of our clothes
0:23:56 and get rid of them and yeah there's a
0:23:58 pool house that's probably best for all
0:24:00 of that if we can burn them later or
0:24:02 just we can take turns and uh get
0:24:06 situated but sun's coming up soon so
0:24:08 might be better to
0:24:10 I can just get rid of them that also
0:24:13 works do you have your pick of rooms but
0:24:14 I think some will be more calling to you
0:24:17 to others than some I've been working on
0:24:19 this for a little while thank you miles
0:24:20 you've been working on this this isn't
0:24:22 like some place that you uh lifted off
0:24:24 the previous Prince oh no no I didn't
0:24:26 want anything attached to him pretty
0:24:28 Sarah set her feet and her posture goes
0:24:31 a little more tight at that Mansion I uh
0:24:34 I found a pretty good property made a
0:24:36 reasonable offer and since then I've
0:24:38 been slowly but surely moving some
0:24:40 Ghouls and stuff that live on the
0:24:42 property and
0:24:43 this is completely disconnected from
0:24:45 anything else that we have after
0:24:46 everybody's essentially changed and
0:24:48 whatnot it's like going through and
0:24:49 demonstrating rooms and there's
0:24:51 accoutrements and stuff that you guys
0:24:53 particularly fit you and then he's just
0:24:55 he's trouble he's like Marcus can you
0:24:57 can you bring me another pair of glasses
0:24:58 I just this is getting Troublesome just
0:25:01 like out of hand without even thinking
0:25:02 about it and kind of waits for a few
0:25:07 and just stops
0:25:09 and just kind of goes on after a few
0:25:12 seconds when
0:25:14 she when she hears him say it she jars a
0:25:20 little bit Johnny gives her a look like
0:25:23 don't say anything just let
0:25:26 it pass I can go get them I'm heading
0:25:32 towards my room anyways it'll be fine if
0:25:34 there's a guest bedroom here I run I
0:25:36 don't have anything set up for you in
0:25:38 particular so
0:25:39 but
0:25:41 I think we have a lot to digest and
0:25:44 we can talk about the tomorrow night do
0:25:47 you have a room or maybe food for Eden
0:25:52 there is some food and he looks over at
0:25:55 Eden and just pulls out a credit card
0:25:57 order some pizza or whatnot try to keep
0:26:00 it discreet
0:26:01 gives like a quick nod all right do you
0:26:03 want do you want anything I can't eat
0:26:06 food who's Marcos
0:26:10 an old friend
0:26:12 okay she kind of looks among the group
0:26:16 and Lynn kind of gives a look like don't
0:26:18 worry about it yeah she quietly excuses
0:26:21 herself Ira looks at Miles when he
0:26:25 offers the room after the exchange with
0:26:27 Eden just nods and there's just like
0:26:30 deep weariness and genuine gratitude and
0:26:34 he just size and goes thank you
0:26:38 your grace all of you for your
0:26:42 age almost says a different word and
0:26:44 then says
0:26:46 hospitality and goes to go into the room
0:26:49 that Miles showed to him wait a second
0:26:52 yes Central you got any smokes left he
0:26:55 passed his pockets pulls out his pack of
0:26:57 Morales Johnny snatches it pulls out a
0:27:00 morally hands it to Ira and then walks
0:27:02 off to his room with the rest of the
0:27:04 pack Ira just stares at Johnny for a
0:27:06 second and then talks the [ __ ]
0:27:08 cigarette behind his ear walks into the
0:27:11 room and just closes the door when will
0:27:14 take off Iris coat and hang it on his
0:27:16 doorknob and look to miles
0:27:20 I'm assuming I'm downstairs yeah I
0:27:22 thought you and Neil might be more
0:27:23 comfortable below ground level good
0:27:25 Instinct do you need anything before I
0:27:27 go no I'm going to go
0:27:30 visit our little Oblivion for a while I
0:27:32 think you earned it see you tomorrow see
0:27:35 you guys
0:27:36 Britta do you want to come down to my
0:27:38 room no I I just I just wanna
0:27:41 there's so much that we have to do
0:27:43 tomorrow I just wanna I just want to go
0:27:45 to bed okay good night I'm glad you're
0:27:48 safe thanks for coming to get me you
0:27:51 know it and wind kind of pads down the
0:27:54 stairs on her bare feet
0:27:56 as you each go your ways it isn't long
0:27:58 before the sun takes you
0:28:00 and you sleep
0:28:06 [Music]
0:28:07 Neil
0:28:10 you come to
0:28:12 it is night but there is something wrong
0:28:15 you can smell and hear the crashing
0:28:19 waves
0:28:20 the clouds overhead are this distorted
0:28:24 shape
0:28:25 shades of green gray and dark Blues Hue
0:28:31 and alter this this massive storm that
0:28:35 hangs overhead
0:28:37 the downpour is deafening
0:28:40 arcs of lightning streak across the sky
0:28:45 and it is through the illumination
0:28:47 of this lightning
0:28:49 that you see it
0:28:51 the blood and your body recoils with
0:28:54 frighten the Beast Within You is aroused
0:29:00 recognizing this canine of unspeakable
0:29:04 power
0:29:05 feeling its hunger
0:29:08 bearing Witness
0:29:10 to the way that reality bends to its
0:29:13 will
0:29:15 a name
0:29:17 Echoes through you
0:29:19 ravana
0:29:22 the edges of your vision bleed like
0:29:24 watercolors
0:29:26 you know you are not here
0:29:30 but it doesn't make you feel much safer
0:29:33 and you can feel all
0:29:36 every Oracle
0:29:38 every person whose mind is open to the
0:29:42 impending suffering of what await
0:29:45 suffering of what awaits
0:29:47 you feel them all
0:29:49 hopelessly watching on
0:29:52 as ravana brings forth the beginning of
0:29:55 the end
0:29:57 but he does not go unchallenged
0:30:02 you know
0:30:03 that there are people there
0:30:05 people who understand the stakes
0:30:08 and have come to challenge this would-be
0:30:10 demon emperor
0:30:13 battling him in the skies
0:30:15 you see three figures
0:30:17 it is hard to comprehend their forms
0:30:19 because while they are like Kindred
0:30:22 they're something else
0:30:24 and they fight ravana to the best of
0:30:27 their ability
0:30:28 and on the ground
0:30:31 you see
0:30:33 desperate lupines struggling against
0:30:36 what feels inevitable
0:30:39 and for a moment
0:30:41 you swear that this Mad God
0:30:44 this was sailed monster lost to the
0:30:48 power of its own insatiable Beast
0:30:52 for a moment it seems as though it turns
0:30:55 its attention to you
0:30:59 and then there is the flash of sons
0:31:02 burning in the sky
0:31:04 [Music]
0:31:08 and you wake up
0:31:11 you wake up with firm meaty muscular
0:31:15 hands holding you and pinning you down
0:31:19 as your frenzy subsides
0:31:23 and when you look up when you open your
0:31:26 eyes and they adjust just enough for you
0:31:28 to see your surroundings
0:31:30 you see the familiar face of weathers
0:31:33 stoically holding you in place stay
0:31:37 still
0:31:38 Neil can feel his body and his muscles
0:31:42 like
0:31:42 sort of tense and and angry uh but when
0:31:46 weathers yells at him he just
0:31:49 instinctively stays still goes quiet and
0:31:52 just looks up with subsiding panic and
0:31:56 Rising confusion
0:31:59 weathers where what's going on where am
0:32:02 I where did you
0:32:04 who where is he is he well this I think
0:32:07 it's okay you can let him go you hear
0:32:09 Amara's voice I am the leader of the
0:32:12 anarchs you haven't heard from in quite
0:32:13 some time did you
0:32:16 um
0:32:16 who's what's what's going on where
0:32:20 what happened did you did you see it and
0:32:23 Neil uh looks away from them and then
0:32:26 immediately straight up at the sky or
0:32:28 tries to so as weathers backs off Amara
0:32:33 moves to actually help you up and you
0:32:35 see around you that you are in a
0:32:39 gorgeous Penthouse and there is a vast
0:32:43 Library here a lot of the books are old
0:32:46 well well cared for they are worn and
0:32:50 well read
0:32:51 and as you look out you see the balcony
0:32:55 and staked on the balcony crumpled to
0:32:58 the ground probably by weathers you seek
0:33:01 a beer
0:33:03 and when you look past Kabir
0:33:05 out to the sky you can see the New York
0:33:10 skyline
0:33:11 and you find yourself as you rise to
0:33:13 your feet drawn to that balcony
0:33:17 and along the New York skyline down
0:33:19 below your incredible senses make you
0:33:23 keenly aware that so many people are
0:33:25 looking up at the night sky
0:33:27 and there it is you find it without any
0:33:30 need for heightened senses
0:33:33 bear and invisible to even the naked eye
0:33:36 is a baleful red star
0:33:41 the last thing that Neil remembers
0:33:45 is running from his sire running from
0:33:49 the a future in which he is forced to
0:33:53 become a diablarist to walk the path of
0:33:55 blood and the last time he was in a New
0:33:58 York Penthouse looking out over the
0:34:00 skyline was when a member of the web of
0:34:03 knives
0:34:04 who he later found out was his sire
0:34:07 assaulted him and so that initial
0:34:09 instinct is just to look around to
0:34:11 heighten his senses to make sure that
0:34:13 they are alone that they are safe even
0:34:15 knowing that against desire looking is
0:34:18 almost futile but as soon as he becomes
0:34:22 aware of that Collective awareness of
0:34:25 the sky and looks up to see with the
0:34:29 naked eye the
0:34:31 red star that he saw with NYX and Britta
0:34:35 on the rooftop not really that long ago
0:34:38 he freezes
0:34:40 and then looks back over her shoulder at
0:34:42 weathers and Amara sparing a quick
0:34:45 glance for Kabir and just says
0:34:48 what the hell's going on where
0:34:51 what's
0:34:53 can you see that you can see that Amara
0:34:55 gives a solemn nod
0:34:57 I see it new it's it's been there for a
0:35:00 while but how come everyone can see it
0:35:02 who is ravana
0:35:04 the
0:35:06 storm in the East the The would-be Demon
0:35:11 King the
0:35:12 power on social level that I can barely
0:35:16 comprehend it just ravening hunger there
0:35:20 is a voice you don't recognize that
0:35:22 speaks up as someone enters the space
0:35:25 behind some of the very tall bookshelves
0:35:28 that block a line of sight in the area
0:35:30 and you see a woman that is actually
0:35:34 right around British like heightened
0:35:37 build the thing that really catches your
0:35:39 attention though is that she wears this
0:35:43 scarf this fabric around her mouth
0:35:46 covering the lower half of her face
0:35:50 she has Chestnut long hair green eyes
0:35:54 and when she walks
0:35:58 and speaks it is with purpose
0:36:02 whoever she is she is powerful and she
0:36:05 says to you
0:36:07 among the Sabbath it is called an
0:36:10 Antideluvian
0:36:11 a monster from before the deluge
0:36:14 before the wrath of God
0:36:17 and she simply strides into the sitting
0:36:21 space and has herself a seat
0:36:24 what did you see
0:36:26 I saw the storm
0:36:28 uh the colors reality itself bleeding at
0:36:32 the edges and
0:36:34 I saw this
0:36:36 this thing this
0:36:39 I saw ravana
0:36:41 I saw the bodhisattva in the sky that
0:36:46 uh
0:36:47 tried to oppose it I saw the lupines on
0:36:49 the ground
0:36:50 fighting against the end of all hope
0:36:54 and
0:36:55 I saw it see me
0:36:59 and then I saw the sun suns in the sky
0:37:04 turning their wrath directly towards the
0:37:07 Earth upon which it Strode
0:37:10 hmm
0:37:11 she hides it well
0:37:15 but you can sense at what you're
0:37:17 describing gives her unease
0:37:21 well
0:37:22 at any rate I have the tone
0:37:25 Amara and weathers kind of both give you
0:37:28 quick sideways glance
0:37:30 Neil kind of shrinks back into himself
0:37:32 under you know questioning and or
0:37:35 judgmental gazes
0:37:37 Amara kind of takes that as a little bit
0:37:38 of a cue that you might be forgetting
0:37:41 something
0:37:41 and rather than draw too much attention
0:37:45 to it she
0:37:47 stands next to you and says uh Neil
0:37:52 we are here
0:37:54 for a bit of a trade
0:37:56 there's a buyer who is willing to fund
0:38:00 defenses against the coming Sabbat
0:38:03 Invasion help the anarchs give us a
0:38:05 chance at survival in exchange for at
0:38:09 home okay all we're doing here is we're
0:38:12 just picking up a book we head Bank Who
0:38:15 provided to the buyer and that's it now
0:38:19 Catherine she gestures to the woman she
0:38:23 has been kind enough to host us for a
0:38:25 few more nights and it has been
0:38:27 suggested by Weathers
0:38:30 then you help us gather some information
0:38:33 on what's going on here among the Sabbat
0:38:36 uh
0:38:38 what
0:38:39 I know it's dangerous
0:38:41 but you have a skill set that makes you
0:38:45 perhaps uniquely capable of getting
0:38:48 information that we will need in order
0:38:50 to survive
0:38:51 um okay better than it can't be worse
0:38:55 than the last couple of times I picked
0:38:57 up a book you don't have to pick up the
0:38:59 book
0:38:59 you know uh yeah okay but I do need you
0:39:04 to get information on the packs that are
0:39:08 mobilizing I need you to find out
0:39:10 whatever it is that's got them stalled
0:39:11 at the moment and for Catherine I need
0:39:15 to you to find whatever you can about a
0:39:19 man named Cardinal Polonia
0:39:23 um
0:39:24 sure I uh
0:39:26 okay we're in New York right we are
0:39:29 we're in New York lucky very clearly
0:39:32 looked out the window but he's still
0:39:33 like double checking weathers and I are
0:39:36 gonna keep an eye on your body
0:39:38 oh okay yeah that makes a lot more sense
0:39:40 yeah sure okay that's probably between
0:39:43 three bruja she points to herself
0:39:46 weathers and Catherine
0:39:48 your body's safe okay I can whatever's
0:39:52 going on outside this this star that
0:39:55 appeared it's a Herald while it's a lot
0:39:58 of Buzz people are going to be paying
0:40:00 attention to it good Hannah okay you
0:40:01 sure you know what I mean yep it's your
0:40:04 chance yep that's yeah okay Neil very
0:40:07 clearly like he's not even trying to
0:40:09 hide the fact that he looks wildly
0:40:11 confused as to everything that's going
0:40:13 on does not understand where he is how
0:40:15 he got here how he even found Weathers
0:40:18 in Amara or how they found him like at
0:40:21 least to Amara it is would be wildly
0:40:24 obvious that Neil is deeply confused but
0:40:28 he doesn't want to say it out loud at
0:40:30 least not in front of the person who
0:40:31 doesn't know so he just nods okay I can

0:44:16 all right well if I'm gonna do this I'm
0:44:17 gonna do this let's just make sure it is
0:44:19 the auspicious night shall we Neil
0:44:21 you're not doing this because of it's
0:44:23 lucky that's not what I'm you're doing
0:44:25 this fate is not a because you're I'm
0:44:28 trying to do this is me trying to be
0:44:30 okay I got it I let me tell me you're
0:44:33 confident did you say confident
0:44:34 competent yes I'm competent do you mean
0:44:37 it when you say it
0:44:40 you asked what I needed I needed a
0:44:42 minute alone out here and then I'm gonna
0:44:43 come inside and I need a place to to lay
0:44:46 down right now I need my question
0:44:47 answered do you believe you can do this
0:44:50 I have to right she nods so I guess
0:44:54 there you go
0:44:55 all right
0:44:56 take your time she heads inside Neil
0:44:59 will lean against like the balcony
0:45:01 railing and look up at the stars instead
0:45:04 of enacting any form of will immediately
0:45:07 we'll just take a huge kind of
0:45:09 shuddering but steadying breath in and
0:45:12 let the cold night air hit him to try
0:45:15 and Center himself and then he will ask
0:45:18 the question he may have already
0:45:20 answered and forgotten about to the sky
0:45:22 and see if this is an auspicious night
0:45:25 to discover information about the Sabbat
0:45:27 okay go for it two successes
0:45:30 it is indeed auspicious I'll look back
0:45:34 down and he'll look at the street and
0:45:35 look at everybody sort of looking up I
0:45:37 presumably from this height like there's
0:45:39 roof access and stuff in a lot of places
0:45:40 in New York presumably looking down
0:45:42 there's like a lot of people up on roofs
0:45:43 just oh yeah and staring and no time
0:45:47 like the present even if I don't know
0:45:49 why I'm doing this
0:45:50 and he turns around and we'll go back
0:45:53 inside do you um I really knew New York
0:45:57 very well do you have like a map
0:45:59 just like a like a street map let's read
0:46:01 it let's read it just a where's Grand
0:46:03 Central from here I don't know anyone
0:46:05 there and I don't know the place size
0:46:08 come here
0:46:10 and he points out he had two blocks that
0:46:13 way oh is that it okay that's good
0:46:15 enough that's it all right I just
0:46:17 usually I go to a person or like a thing
0:46:19 or a place that I know so it I got it
0:46:21 it's I'll is there a place I can like
0:46:23 lay down or sit down or just catch
0:46:25 inside okay
0:46:27 um thank you uh is I'm stalling and then
0:46:30 he just goes in and lays down on the
0:46:32 couch
0:46:33 oh this is kind of nuts he's familiar
0:46:36 with Neil's work
0:46:37 Lex I'm gonna lay down on the couch kind
0:46:41 of close my eyes and then nervously
0:46:43 reflexively open them once again to just
0:46:45 look at everybody in the room and then
0:46:47 close them like make myself close my
0:46:49 eyes again and then I'm going to attempt
0:46:51 to project my psychic self out into the
0:46:54 city let's do it
0:46:57 five successes with five successes you
0:47:00 project into the astral realm with I
0:47:04 believe the full Suite of your mental
0:47:06 abilities the red star shines even
0:47:09 brighter here Neil because he doesn't
0:47:12 know the place well he has to follow
0:47:15 where there's his instructions so he
0:47:16 can't just sort of manifest his
0:47:18 Consciousness there if anyone can see
0:47:20 into the astral kneel's like psychic
0:47:24 form which does not quite look like him
0:47:26 sits up from his now totally unconscious
0:47:30 body steps into the room and then floats
0:47:33 out through the glass and out the window
0:47:35 he will not be he's a student of the
0:47:38 Stars so he cannot quite help but to
0:47:40 look up at the red star
0:47:42 and then we'll kind of shutter and pull
0:47:45 his gaze away from it and start
0:47:47 immaterially floating down following
0:47:49 weather's directions kind of looking out
0:47:51 for Grand Central he doesn't really know
0:47:53 what he's looking for he doesn't spend a
0:47:54 lot of time in New York City but it's
0:47:55 Grand Central so it can't be that hard
0:47:57 to find you travel and hear the city is
0:48:01 alive with activity and you feel
0:48:04 something
0:48:06 deep within the earth below you
0:48:09 it gives the sensation of an
0:48:12 outstretched hand but something you
0:48:14 don't want touching you
0:48:15 and eventually you find a building that
0:48:18 is just surrounded and subsumed with a
0:48:22 throng of masses
0:48:24 a gorgeous building with a clock on its
0:48:28 front beneath it reads Grand Central
0:48:30 terminal and over the clock is a statue
0:48:33 of mercury you quickly realize that you
0:48:36 have made it to your destination
0:48:42 you head into the terminal and there as
0:48:45 all these spaces and corners and
0:48:48 hallways and areas that the populace
0:48:53 sort of overlooks while on their way to
0:48:56 wherever they're headed it's dirty and
0:48:59 even in your astral form there's this
0:49:02 pervasive scent that you can't ignore
0:49:05 and you start looking for signs of the
0:49:08 Sabbat the easy signs are readily
0:49:12 apparent you see the purple graffiti the
0:49:15 honks the little signs the signs that
0:49:19 Johnny would point out to you
0:49:21 signs that Johnny has pointed out to you
0:49:24 and then there's someone you find and
0:49:26 catches your eye it's gorgeous a real
0:49:29 cute girl or the white fur coat like
0:49:32 those all white go-go boots that were
0:49:35 popular right around your time and she
0:49:39 grins at people jokes at people makes a
0:49:42 lot of the a lot of what the Sabbat
0:49:45 would call Juice bags walking around a
0:49:47 smile back at her and there's fangs in
0:49:50 her mouth when she smiles at them I'm a
0:49:52 big muffin of it New York's a weird
0:49:53 place and she seems to Revel in how
0:49:58 obvious she gets to be without them
0:50:00 noticing the danger that they're in she
0:50:03 takes pictures of people kind of enjoys
0:50:05 all of the attention she gets and
0:50:07 there's something about her that
0:50:09 scratches at a distant memory you were
0:50:13 in torper at the time machine had a bit
0:50:16 of a run-in with Johnny not too long ago
0:50:19 and when she gets bored she gives an
0:50:23 extra wink to some young tough and a
0:50:25 hoodie and headphones and with just a
0:50:28 couple of words convinces him to come
0:50:31 along with her and she leads him deeper
0:50:35 into Grand Central heading into the
0:50:38 train tunnels uh into maintenance areas
0:50:40 okay having found a member of the Sabbat
0:50:45 a lot of people in sort of Astral forms
0:50:48 are projecting their Consciousness would
0:50:50 just sort of float around content
0:50:52 knowing that they are invisible to the
0:50:54 naked eye no one can see them Neil is a
0:50:58 mulcavian he is paranoid he is
0:51:01 extraordinarily cautious and so will
0:51:04 obfuscate himself even well in this
0:51:07 other plane of existence and instead of
0:51:10 just floating through the air will I
0:51:13 mean he doesn't really touch down on the
0:51:14 ground because he's astral but like
0:51:16 we'll start using Quiet Little Steps
0:51:19 hiding and peeking behind like going
0:51:22 through the steps of mundane stealth
0:51:24 while obfuscated while psychically
0:51:27 projecting because he is so I mean if he
0:51:31 could see himself why could not someone
0:51:33 else and that little tug from Deep
0:51:35 beneath the Earth that outstretched hand
0:51:37 is still unnerving him well stealth can
0:51:40 I apply my lurking spec yes you can
0:51:45 forgot about that and I use my wits in
0:51:48 place of dexterity right because I am an
0:51:49 astral indeed five successes I blew two
0:51:53 tens on that lurking spec you hope
0:51:55 that's enough as you tail the toroid or
0:51:59 Antitribute into this space that
0:52:03 probably goes ignored by the Mortal
0:52:05 masses
0:52:06 and as you get deeper in you can hear
0:52:09 the thrum of bass there's music playing
0:52:14 loud obnoxious and irreverent
0:52:19 and as you enter the first thing you see
0:52:22 are what appears to be triplets
0:52:23 bald-headed Bland faces all three of
0:52:27 them wearing goggles and trench coats
0:52:29 and the trio stands watching this large
0:52:33 gated doorway and there's the Tori are
0:52:36 going to trivia approaches them she kind
0:52:37 of jumps up the high five one of them
0:52:39 and with kind of this like blank Goomba
0:52:43 like stare yeah I have five sir bank
0:52:46 they open the way she leads the guy and
0:52:48 the guy is so lost to how horny he is
0:52:54 and the chance to get laid he doesn't
0:52:56 really notice these three like six and a
0:52:59 half foot tall weirdos watching the
0:53:03 entrance
0:53:04 the walls are covered in graffiti the
0:53:06 graffiti you see is like like Bible
0:53:10 stories
0:53:11 but not a human Bible
0:53:13 I've been spending some time reading
0:53:16 fragments of the book of Nod
0:53:18 is it that kind of Bible
0:53:21 well you do see something of a Christ
0:53:23 figure raising a stone up high to the
0:53:26 heavens as he holds a man who looks just
0:53:29 like him down on the ground
0:53:31 you hear a crowd call praise Cain as she
0:53:35 pumps her Fists in the air and is met by
0:53:39 a crew of girls who look a lot like her
0:53:41 addressed in similar Fashions tons of
0:53:43 makeup bright colors Beyond them it's
0:53:47 just a sea of black in terms of the
0:53:51 attire of the gathered canines but they
0:53:53 seem to have uh fun with it all and the
0:53:58 girls
0:53:59 kind of join in on the fun each taking
0:54:03 turns seducing this this poor lost young
0:54:07 man to the point where he doesn't know
0:54:09 up from down and is lost to his
0:54:13 attraction
0:54:15 they guide him further in and there as a
0:54:18 woman seated bent over on her elbows
0:54:21 kind of on like a like a table that's
0:54:24 set up and her back is exposed and
0:54:27 there's someone sitting behind her
0:54:30 fiddling with her spine you see her back
0:54:33 is exposed and in that her skin and
0:54:36 muscle has been peeled away to reveal
0:54:39 her spine in the backs of her ribs and
0:54:41 her shoulder plates and they
0:54:44 are inserting piercings into her
0:54:48 shoulder blades and connecting them with
0:54:50 thin silver chains
0:54:53 young man
0:54:54 looks at this and gives an ah and is
0:54:57 tugged along before his brain can really
0:55:00 process what he just saw and they lead
0:55:03 him
0:55:04 to a room that looks like kind of like a
0:55:08 big group shower room except there are
0:55:10 no showers running and instead hanging
0:55:14 from the ceiling or hooks
0:55:16 and on some of these hooks there are
0:55:18 people kept alive
0:55:20 groaning in pain
0:55:23 and laughing these girls dog pile the
0:55:27 young man like piranha and after they
0:55:30 subdue him which is mere moments
0:55:32 they quickly hoist him up and point him
0:55:35 onto the edge of a hook and finally in
0:55:39 that moment his mind and body I've had
0:55:42 enough time to react and scream
0:55:45 and they shush him and giggle and they
0:55:49 start to kind of kiss him fondle him and
0:55:52 kind of take pleasure in his
0:55:54 helplessness
0:55:56 one of them says something about the
0:55:58 Blood Feast
0:55:59 neol has seen a little bit of the
0:56:04 savagery of the Sabbat in the last few
0:56:06 nights at least the last few nights
0:56:08 according to his memory he is
0:56:11 he's not a brave man but he thought he
0:56:13 saw in like the horror and Terror at the
0:56:16 gala but that was running and fighting
0:56:18 and this is just sitting and being
0:56:20 witness to Cruelty and brutality
0:56:25 even someone like his sire who devours
0:56:30 The Souls of other Kindred and is brutal
0:56:33 and terrifying in his own right doesn't
0:56:35 seem to take pleasure like this in the
0:56:38 pain of others and there is a moment
0:56:41 where he forgets to hide forgets to like
0:56:46 follow and look around and just watches
0:56:49 in Terror and I don't think it's
0:56:51 probably until someone like physically
0:56:54 walks through him that it pulls him out
0:56:57 of that just Terror burgeoning on panic
0:57:01 there's a moment when all he wants to do
0:57:04 is scream or
0:57:07 kill this man before he can continue to
0:57:10 suffer and realizes he can't
0:57:13 not without
0:57:14 causing suffering himself not without
0:57:17 giving himself away
0:57:19 and he'll start to look
0:57:22 not even muttering under his breath but
0:57:24 muttering in his mind the things that he
0:57:26 needs to find to help protect people so
0:57:29 that this
0:57:31 all of this around him doesn't come to
