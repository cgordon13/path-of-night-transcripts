0:00:37 last time on path of
0:00:40 night the quartery held a meeting with
0:00:42 Roman pen
0:00:44 Dragon Johnny prevented BR from falling
0:00:47 into a Feeding
0:00:49 Frenzy Neo l a conversation regarding
0:00:52 the signs of gehenna and the meaning
0:00:54 behind these
0:00:56 Omens Roman pen Dragon unveiled a
0:00:58 powerful weapon from his Clan's ancient
0:01:01 past along with the news of yan
0:01:03 Peterson's murder
0:01:10 [Music]
0:01:32 once you arrive to the first floor the
0:01:35 doors open he does not the the your
0:01:37 guide does not get off the elevator with
0:01:39 sort of gestures for the group of you to
0:01:42 step off the
0:01:43 elevator does anyone stay on or does
0:01:45 everyone get off Neil steps off when
0:01:48 gets off Johnny takes a a hard look at
0:01:51 the guy in the elevator kind of like
0:01:54 looks him up and down what's your
0:01:57 name what's it to you
0:02:00 just
0:02:01 curious
0:02:04 Kyle thank you Kyle Johny kind of nods
0:02:08 and steps off the elevator BR seems a
0:02:10 little Frozen in the elevator like she's
0:02:12 not quite ready to take the step out but
0:02:14 she doesn't want to St either when holds
0:02:17 the door open for her just sticks a foot
0:02:19 in doesn't urge her out just keeps the
0:02:22 door open for when she's ready ma'am K
0:02:25 says chest ring to get off yeah and she
0:02:28 does my out of the elevator but lets him
0:02:32 close the elevator and go miles turns to
0:02:35 look at
0:02:36 BR if there
0:02:38 was any
0:02:41 time to figure out how to mend this
0:02:44 Rift between us and Pen
0:02:47 dragon and any
0:02:49 person that's
0:02:52 you but if pen Dragon doesn't see us as
0:02:56 people just as tools
0:03:00 this will never
0:03:03 work can we talk about this somewhere
0:03:08 else no probably not you're going to
0:03:10 have to do it now
0:03:11 is Miles I'm sorry I I knew that pen
0:03:16 Dragon had killed someone but I didn't
0:03:17 know it
0:03:19 was your sire but looking around who
0:03:23 else is
0:03:25 present it was the orders of hardest set
0:03:29 that Lind was making that deal with
0:03:31 pendraken about I got that
0:03:35 sense you're not mad at me why would I
0:03:38 be mad at
0:03:39 you did you kill Yan were you there BR
0:03:44 actually looks guilty when you say did
0:03:46 you kill
0:03:49 Yan the bribee that Luc sind was using
0:03:53 was my
0:03:55 exemption because lucd intends on all of
0:03:58 us
0:04:00 dying in the battle New Haven and Pen
0:04:05 dragon that my exemption was the price
0:04:09 for Pendragon to take out Yan Peter soon
0:04:12 when her face twists I I didn't I didn't
0:04:16 ask for that I I I get that he's being
0:04:21 played in the same way cuz if you he
0:04:25 really thinks that you're exempt after
0:04:26 all that
0:04:28 I he does doesn't get it it was
0:04:31 surprising that he didn't know he was
0:04:34 getting played when he said that earlier
0:04:38 he was generally surprised I think he
0:04:40 believed in the camarilla and to some
0:04:43 degree or another until he retrieved the
0:04:45 information my sire was holding he knows
0:04:48 based
0:04:50 on I mean how he even started off that
0:04:53 meeting he's taken the steps
0:04:56 but we the tools that are NE necessary
0:05:00 to do what he wants that we
0:05:02 have are too precious to hand over a
0:05:06 person that sees us as
0:05:09 such we need to be actual
0:05:13 allies and as much as I would love his
0:05:15 strength going into these fights and
0:05:18 possibly holding up some of these signs
0:05:21 or changing them
0:05:23 somehow the way he currently sees us and
0:05:27 everything
0:05:28 else makes me think that he will I
0:05:31 begged him to do the right
0:05:34 thing and stand up and be a leader in
0:05:37 this
0:05:38 time instead he took it as a chance to
0:05:41 call down open diabl on New York but
0:05:45 that was the only way that he was going
0:05:47 to get an army that was
0:05:50 no
0:05:52 no I gave him an opportunity to be a
0:05:55 hero and he proved
0:05:58 otherwise that that was how he was going
0:06:00 to get the people together to be able to
0:06:03 do what you my clan would have followed
0:06:06 him if he asked for our loyalty but
0:06:11 instead he has demanded
0:06:14 subjugation it is a fine line but he is
0:06:19 solidly on one side of that shame on me
0:06:23 for letting him do it I will not be
0:06:26 shamed Again by trusting him with
0:06:31 this but there is still time we don't
0:06:34 have a lot of it but there is
0:06:37 time
0:06:39 he he wants to protect me
0:06:44 and and he has protected
0:06:48 me and I see something in him but I I
0:06:53 can't lie to you and tell you that I
0:06:56 think that he
0:06:58 sees you
0:07:00 as
0:07:02 people then you must convince
0:07:04 him
0:07:06 otherwise we go our separate ways and we
0:07:09 don't know where that will end up for
0:07:11 either of us it leaves us
0:07:14 separated without our combined
0:07:17 strengths convince him to see you as
0:07:20 people I don't need a full thing we just
0:07:23 need
0:07:24 him to be sort
0:07:27 of a person
0:07:30 you need you're asking to convince him
0:07:34 to not
0:07:35 be kindred in his
0:07:38 mentality and and that's not a judgment
0:07:41 miles it's I I'm weirdly agreeing with
0:07:44 you and I think at the end of the
0:07:47 day that's kind of what I was saying
0:07:49 that's what we're all saying right we
0:07:51 need to put away the Jihad as much as we
0:07:53 can I think we need to look at this a
0:07:55 different way if we're just tools to him
0:07:57 then we don't look at him as a person
0:07:59 either either how do we use him you see
0:08:02 BR blanch I'm not willing to do that
0:08:05 right
0:08:06 now all of these people that keep dying
0:08:09 around us is because we keep utilizing
0:08:12 each other as tools I know
0:08:15 that and wind just walks
0:08:20 away I'll
0:08:22 um I'll catch you up with her nope you
0:08:26 either see me with you or you don't like
0:08:29 keep off Neil yeah uh yeah we're going
0:08:31 to need that
0:08:34 fix the two of you yep look
0:08:38 I I I I know that he's a lot of things
0:08:41 but
0:08:42 he's
0:08:44 also Brave and capable and out of the I
0:08:49 know I know he does terrible things I I
0:08:51 get it I've been there but he you're
0:08:54 drunk on in brda when calls from down
0:08:56 the hall and brda goes was quiet and
0:09:01 smaller again if we're not going to have
0:09:04 time it takes time what the proposed fix
0:09:08 here that that we're talking about how
0:09:09 long hours it's not something we've ever
0:09:13 done we're going to need privacy unless
0:09:14 you're okay with the locals seeing us
0:09:18 bathe naked in the blood of a bowl and
0:09:20 get really high great but figure it out
0:09:25 if you can figure it out or we can make
0:09:27 use to that courtyard and Dragon doesn't
0:09:30 matter either way um we'll work on the
0:09:32 permission I'm going to go to do uh but
0:09:35 uh BR one of the things I think it's
0:09:37 important to know
0:09:39 um yeah pen Dragon did that because of
0:09:42 you with Peter zoon but I don't want you
0:09:45 to take that to heart because if it
0:09:47 wasn't that it was going to be something
0:09:49 else or someone else with different
0:09:52 leverage it's not you you didn't do it
0:09:55 okay he was doing it so that I could
0:09:58 survive
0:10:00 mhm and we know we know that what we
0:10:03 have to do to protect the people that we
0:10:05 love in New Haven is is a death sentence
0:10:09 for us and I I want to protect New Haven
0:10:11 I want to protect our friends but one of
0:10:14 he was doing it to protect me sure but
0:10:17 what I'm saying is Yan Peterson is is
0:10:20 dead not because of you though not
0:10:21 because of that that's just one act and
0:10:23 if it wasn't that act it was another act
0:10:25 it would have been something different
0:10:26 that led to his death because hardest is
0:10:28 the one who did it had a lot of prophecy
0:10:30 a lot of Prophecy and a lot of
0:10:31 prognostication is just realizing that
0:10:33 Things become
0:10:35 self-fulfilling all the things on the
0:10:38 check mark of gehenna you know the the
0:10:41 the rampant diablerie and and all of
0:10:44 that is being
0:10:45 Unleashed you know because of pen dragon
0:10:48 is trying to fight against the end and
0:10:49 maybe he's responsible for it same with
0:10:51 all of us we can't stop ourselves from
0:10:54 going where we're going we just have to
0:10:55 try but you need to not take it to heart
0:10:58 in this moment not that act okay I don't
0:11:01 know what that even matters because I
0:11:04 and no no it's you keep saying it's the
0:11:08 end times you keep saying that
0:11:09 everything that we do has to be the last
0:11:12 final moments yeah and you don't want me
0:11:15 to take it to heart you don't want to
0:11:17 take to heart that this is the only time
0:11:19 that I have that my memories start
0:11:21 trying aenna not that no I'm talking
0:11:25 about that one specific act to summarize
0:11:28 they would have found something
0:11:29 something else to use for pen Dragon
0:11:32 yeah exactly that that's what I'm saying
0:11:34 to commit the
0:11:35 murder he just or they would have used
0:11:37 used a lot of different words and went
0:11:39 back and forth
0:11:41 and but yeah
0:11:45 that can you go after her now yeah I'm
0:11:47 going to I'm I'm going to I just wanted
0:11:49 to an Neil hustles
0:11:54 off when you stepped away from the gy
0:11:58 you're looking for for grass grass grass
0:12:02 on dirt something I can sink into
0:12:04 heading out back there is a very
0:12:08 well-kept
0:12:09 Courtyard
0:12:11 and as the space expands beyond the
0:12:14 courtyard there is this very large well
0:12:17 cared Ford um field it's it's too early
0:12:21 in spring for it to be as like well
0:12:24 trimmed Etc as it it will likely appear
0:12:27 during the summer but it is an open
0:12:31 field she makes her way into the field
0:12:35 takes off her shoes just kind of tosses
0:12:38 them over her
0:12:39 shoulder there are so many thoughts and
0:12:43 feelings and impulses and ideas and
0:12:48 instincts and needs that most of which
0:12:51 she doesn't want and she doesn't they're
0:12:54 not her own they are driven by
0:12:57 this this crazy of double blood bonding
0:13:02 and dominate and just kind of
0:13:05 existential
0:13:07 [ __ ] and if she doesn't get a dirt
0:13:09 hug she's going to explode and so she
0:13:13 spends a point of blood and starts
0:13:15 sinking into the
0:13:16 Earth there is peace there for a
0:13:21 Time silence and in this state you only
0:13:24 vaguely aware of your
0:13:26 surroundings you'd be able to feel some
0:13:29 want to step on the grass above you kind
0:13:31 of here if they were to shout
0:13:35 enough but for now you're
0:13:41 alone
0:13:42 when
0:13:45 when when I know I mean I I saw I saw
0:13:48 you go down there I
0:13:51 when you can't you can't just walk off
0:13:54 like like that you just you
0:13:58 need you need to talk to everybody you
0:14:00 can't
0:14:01 win I assume you can hear me I don't
0:14:03 know if you can actually hear me no you
0:14:04 can hear me
0:14:06 we've do I need to do I need to do I
0:14:08 need to be L
0:14:10 when can you talk to me
0:14:14 please wi Neil does like a light
0:14:17 thumping on the like he's knocking on a
0:14:19 door but down into the dirt you cannot
0:14:22 move and Earth meld correct you cannot
0:14:26 yep as a gang roll you do have the
0:14:27 ability to sink into the Earth
0:14:30 but without being an elder you would you
0:14:33 you remain in that spot that you sink
0:14:36 into I meant like could I get an arm
0:14:38 above my head no then she adds annoyance
0:14:42 to the list of things and
0:14:46 oddly
0:14:48 gratitude but she's not ready to come
0:14:50 out yet hey so okay you're upset I get
0:14:55 that so if you don't want to talk I
0:14:57 guess I guess I'll talk for both both of
0:14:59 us
0:15:01 um I what am I supposed to say here
0:15:05 I I know if you're set everything that
0:15:08 happened down there
0:15:10 is my God how we going to deal with that
0:15:13 I don't know how miles is dealing with
0:15:15 that
0:15:17 um I guess we should have seen something
0:15:19 like this coming but this one
0:15:22 seems
0:15:24 H how am I going to supposed to get yon
0:15:27 Peterson and the Vios to talk to each
0:15:29 other and that's going to be way harder
0:15:33 now um I guess miles has to be the vios
0:15:37 no miles will be soon oh god
0:15:41 um and yeah I I
0:15:44 know it seems so stupid to say that like
0:15:47 you're not okay cuz obviously you're not
0:15:50 okay for like a million reasons but is
0:15:54 unlike you to like I don't know snap at
0:15:57 brto like that like you're not
0:16:00 wrong she is drunk on him but
0:16:05 like I don't know I don't feel like
0:16:07 yellen's going to
0:16:09 be I don't know if this is even working
0:16:11 can you I if you can you hear
0:16:15 me I'm going to assume you can hear me
0:16:17 when rolls her eyes secretly admiring
0:16:21 his
0:16:21 persistence and will start to come up
0:16:24 and her eyes kind of reach the surface
0:16:26 of the dirt and glare at him him like a
0:16:29 shark breaching the water or an
0:16:31 alligator how physically does somebody
0:16:34 come up from the ground like that
0:16:36 because as she comes up Neil is lying in
0:16:39 the dirt like directly over where her
0:16:42 body sank in like eyes where her eyes
0:16:44 are feet where her feet are
0:16:46 unconsciously maybe in the exact same
0:16:49 position that she is with his face
0:16:51 directly in the grass like nose pressed
0:16:53 into the dirt like he followed her out
0:16:56 here laid down on the ground and started
0:16:58 talking directly into the mud well there
0:17:00 is no partially rising from Earth melt
0:17:03 so she comes up just as she went down
0:17:05 and finds you on top of her as she comes
0:17:08 up she will grab you by the collar of
0:17:10 your shirt not angrily but to make sure
0:17:12 she doesn't just like knock you over and
0:17:16 pull you to standing with her could you
0:17:18 hear me down there or do I have to
0:17:20 repeat my
0:17:23 okay I understand you probably want some
0:17:25 alone time I don't think you do I no I
0:17:28 do I just don't think you should have it
0:17:30 right now why don't you think I deserve
0:17:32 that because we have a lot to do tonight
0:17:35 and what is it you think I can do right
0:17:37 now in this
0:17:38 state
0:17:40 be there and ready for this Council
0:17:43 that's supposed to be happening so that
0:17:45 as soon as it's over we can get the [ __ ]
0:17:46 out of here and what do you think I was
0:17:48 getting ready for
0:17:50 Neil
0:17:52 being unreachable cuz if I didn't follow
0:17:54 you out here no one would have known
0:17:56 where you were amongst the Cod presuma
0:18:00 others could pull you do you want to
0:18:02 look in my head right now Neil I don't
0:18:05 think you want me to I don't then I
0:18:09 won't
0:18:10 but I know there's things you can't
0:18:14 say cuz I don't need you to say them but
0:18:17 you feel
0:18:19 even more different this morning than
0:18:22 you
0:18:22 did when we talked yesterday and I know
0:18:25 she probably bound you again
0:18:30 but
0:18:32 look you're right maybe we have limited
0:18:34 maybe this is being selfish maybe we
0:18:35 have limited time together and I I don't
0:18:38 want you to spend it in a hole avoiding
0:18:41 us because the only people you're
0:18:42 avoiding down here are us so the
0:18:44 question becomes why are you avoiding us
0:18:46 me and BR and Johnny and miles it's not
0:18:50 you guys but we're the only ones you're
0:18:52 avoiding down here who else am I
0:18:54 avoiding Neil Lucin but she can come get
0:18:57 you anyways
0:18:59 then make
0:19:00 her I guess if I am locked in one place
0:19:04 Neil I don't find myself wandering to
0:19:07 places where they
0:19:11 are so you need a
0:19:13 buddy
0:19:15 because how do how do how do I how do I
0:19:17 put this um I feel like a lot of a lot
0:19:20 of us do this do this thing where where
0:19:22 we're relying entirely on our own
0:19:24 willpower to just go well if I'm going
0:19:26 to put myself over here um and put on
0:19:29 put on the sacrifice hat put on the
0:19:30 Martyr hat I I I know I do it all the
0:19:32 time um then no one else will have to
0:19:35 see me
0:19:37 suffering um I don't think I'm subtle
0:19:40 when I'm suffering
0:19:42 Neil
0:19:44 no I don't think I'm big about hiding my
0:19:47 emotions Neil no which is why I'm saying
0:19:51 you shouldn't take yourself
0:19:53 away because there's this thing then
0:19:55 what else when you I
0:19:59 so I'm going to ask you a question I I
0:20:02 want as as as honest of an answer as I
0:20:04 think you're capable of giving are you
0:20:07 removing yourself from
0:20:10 everyone
0:20:12 because you want to have your feelings
0:20:14 alone for a bit or are you removing
0:20:16 yourself from everyone so we don't have
0:20:18 to see your
0:20:20 feelings because those are two very
0:20:22 different things I don't even know I
0:20:24 know but I I I Neil my thoughts aren't
0:20:26 mine anymore yes they are no they're
0:20:30 not they stop where they twist around
0:20:34 what they want where I might find them
0:20:38 where I might make them happy with
0:20:41 me there are
0:20:45 ways out of I was working on I was
0:20:48 thinking about
0:20:50 ways to stop this kind of
0:20:53 thing I did it
0:20:57 obliquely but before you take yourself
0:20:59 away from everybody else or before
0:21:00 you're taken away from everybody else I
0:21:02 I want you to
0:21:03 know
0:21:06 um
0:21:08 we even if you feel like a shadow of
0:21:10 yourself even if you are a Shadow of
0:21:12 Yourself we all
0:21:14 still want and need you around not like
0:21:17 this yes no I like when yeah you have to
0:21:22 trust me on this
0:21:23 one and maybe you don't want me to speak
0:21:25 for everybody else maybe I won't speak
0:21:26 for everybody else but I'll speak for me
0:21:27 and what about what I want Neil what you
0:21:30 want is to be with us what I want is to
0:21:32 have my own thoughts
0:21:35 again you what I want is for someone
0:21:37 else to not have to tell me what I
0:21:40 want can have
0:21:43 them I got um I'm going to explain the
0:21:47 whole thing because it's long and it's
0:21:49 TR and it's tr's the wrong word what
0:21:51 word am I thinking it doesn't
0:21:54 matter I had um I had some visitors last
0:21:57 night
0:21:59 and they asked
0:22:01 me if they could give me anything moving
0:22:04 into the final nights in a world with no
0:22:07 masquerade no camaria no anything in a
0:22:10 future that might be crushing all of us
0:22:15 within weeks months
0:22:19 years what do I
0:22:21 need what do I
0:22:25 want like a like a genie you find asking
0:22:29 you
0:22:30 to reshape the malleable nature of
0:22:34 reality and I couldn't think of anything
0:22:37 I
0:22:37 froze
0:22:40 panicked and
0:22:43 then all I could think about was
0:22:47 you I so I don't know if the genie is
0:22:50 actually going to do anything or if it's
0:22:51 a monkey's paw or if they can do
0:22:53 anything
0:22:56 but I asked for your strings
0:22:59 cut to what all of
0:23:03 them she looks
0:23:07 horrified all you have ever said all
0:23:10 you've ever told me at least that you
0:23:13 ever
0:23:13 wanted was to just be able to do the
0:23:16 things that were important to you and
0:23:19 choose the people who were important to
0:23:21 you and but if all my strings are cut
0:23:25 Neil then nothing
0:23:27 is no then you're
0:23:30 Pinocchio you're a puppet with no
0:23:33 strengths I mean I don't think there's
0:23:34 any escaping the Jihad I don't think
0:23:36 there is so long as the Jihad exists I
0:23:39 I've been having a lot of thoughts about
0:23:40 that too
0:23:44 but there are ways around
0:23:49 things but sometimes it requires
0:23:54 us to take on burdens and sacrifice
0:23:58 deves that
0:24:00 destroy
0:24:02 us and I told you yesterday and I'm
0:24:04 going to keep telling you every day and
0:24:06 I'm not going to let you walk away to
0:24:07 not hear
0:24:09 it
0:24:10 that if you can't remember who you are
0:24:13 I'll remember for you until you can
0:24:15 remember again and if you can't make
0:24:18 decisions for yourself and what if this
0:24:20 chin has changed me it's not a real Jin
0:24:24 this is metaphorical I know it's a
0:24:25 metaphor
0:24:26 Neil what if this Magic Smoke you let
0:24:29 out of the
0:24:30 box it's not actual magic either it's
0:24:34 NE people are playing games on me I know
0:24:39 and you're one of them now I'm trying to
0:24:41 wipe the board that's all so is everyone
0:24:44 else no no no no no everyone's trying to
0:24:47 play a little game and I'm in the center
0:24:49 of it I'm just trying to put the pieces
0:24:51 in your
0:24:52 hands that's
0:24:55 all because when I really did I've had
0:24:58 this impending sense of Doom for a long
0:25:00 time
0:25:02 and it's getting worse and worse every
0:25:05 day like a train that's coming I can't
0:25:08 stop but all I can do is try and make
0:25:10 sure that nobody else is on the tracks
0:25:12 as best as I can none of us know what
0:25:14 we're doing and to be totally honest I
0:25:17 mean I I I understand what you're saying
0:25:19 but you're talking to a guy who is not
0:25:21 even sure half the time if his thoughts
0:25:22 are
0:25:23 his I get it when
0:25:29 but that means I also get that when
0:25:32 there's a million voices in your head
0:25:33 telling you a million different things
0:25:36 and you're not sure which one's you
0:25:38 there is still a core that is you and I
0:25:43 have to believe
0:25:44 that and if you can't believe it right
0:25:46 now then I'm going to believe it for
0:25:47 both of us until you can I hate seeing
0:25:50 you give up like this I'm not giving up
0:25:53 it feels like you
0:25:55 are I'm cocooning
0:26:00 okay because the things broiling inside
0:26:03 me right now aren't me and I don't know
0:26:06 what they're going to become and I don't
0:26:08 know what's going to come out and I just
0:26:10 need to be something strong enough to
0:26:12 get through the few nights that we have
0:26:15 you are that though not right
0:26:18 now right now I just want to I want to
0:26:21 make them happy and that's all I want I
0:26:24 want to make them happy and I want to
0:26:26 tear them apart but
0:26:28 and I haven't thought about
0:26:30 Joey and I know I should be sad about
0:26:33 that and it's just so not important to
0:26:36 me and I know that's
0:26:38 wrong I haven't thought about
0:26:41 Kabir and that should break my
0:26:44 heart and it doesn't because I keep
0:26:47 wandering this house trying to end up
0:26:50 closer to the people who seem to matter
0:26:55 more I can't speak to Kabir
0:26:59 but and I'll I'll put that on the list
0:27:02 that's an oversight on my
0:27:04 part but I have thought about
0:27:07 Joey because I know it's important to
0:27:11 you so what I'm asking you right now I
0:27:13 guess is to trust me for a little bit to
0:27:15 keep caring about the things that are
0:27:16 important to you until you can care
0:27:18 about them again and I know that you're
0:27:20 going to okay and I'll put Kabir on the
0:27:23 list I'm sorry I didn't I will get over
0:27:26 my person dislike of Kabir to care about
0:27:30 him because you
0:27:32 do and chaps I need he's going have
0:27:35 gotten into so much trouble we can ask
0:27:37 miles to do that Miles seems to have
0:27:40 more of a relationship it's chaps I
0:27:43 don't want to put that on Miles he has
0:27:45 so much else going
0:27:47 on then I I mean I don't know chaps but
0:27:51 I'll do that one too make a list you
0:27:53 want to make a list make a list of the
0:27:55 things that are important you know how
0:27:57 much I love list
0:27:59 yeah put them on separate pieces of
0:28:01 paper no put them on one I I won't be
0:28:03 able put them on one piece of paper you
0:28:06 don't want Multiple List bullet points
0:28:08 no I need one piece of paper that says
0:28:10 things that are important to win you
0:28:11 love bullet points you can bullet point
0:28:13 the paper but I'm going to lose but win
0:28:16 like this is important like don't put it
0:28:18 like I'm serious
0:28:20 don't but
0:28:24 look you're still early on finding the
0:28:27 part parts that are you and the parts
0:28:29 that
0:28:29 aren't
0:28:31 and do you know how to break a bond time
0:28:35 away
0:28:37 yeah kill them okay that one too that's
0:28:41 the more traumatic way to go she kind of
0:28:43 like Pats her chest and just like what's
0:28:45 a little more a lot it's it's a
0:28:49 lot time away is one way there's oh
0:28:52 there's and I didn't mean to yell at
0:28:54 Brit I just wanted her to wanted her to
0:28:56 remember that while she's having she
0:28:58 needs to keep her head on straight I
0:29:00 think she knows that the problem is I
0:29:03 don't like that she's being put in the
0:29:06 position of being our hooker to pen
0:29:09 Dragon I don't think that's what's
0:29:10 happening I think she actually
0:29:11 legitimately wants to be there which is
0:29:14 she does but now it's being
0:29:16 capitalized she's 19 the world's going
0:29:18 to end let her [ __ ] the guy she likes
0:29:20 okay I think that's what happened though
0:29:22 I know it's what happened and I want to
0:29:24 talk to her about it okay but you can't
0:29:26 lead that conversation with yelling at
0:29:28 her in a hallway and storming off was
0:29:30 kind of I didn't I was already storming
0:29:32 off I called back okay but see that
0:29:36 exactly maybe she wanted to storm off
0:29:39 she's allowed I wasn't going to stop her
0:29:41 okay but if you do it I was starting it
0:29:43 so she would feel comfortable no that's
0:29:45 not how that works exactly trumatic
0:29:46 moment it's hot girl [ __ ] you don't
0:29:49 understand okay well write it down for
0:29:51 me all right it'll be on wi's important
0:29:53 stuff hot girl [ __ ] I'll try my best
0:29:55 okay
0:29:58 just sit with me next time okay I was no
0:30:01 you were yelling at me through the dirt
0:30:03 well cuz I didn't know if you could hear
0:30:04 me or not I don't need to hear you I can
0:30:06 feel you I don't think that was true it
0:30:09 I knew it was
0:30:14 you you guys are my family and I don't
0:30:17 know how to help you still
0:30:21 see you see p dragon as more than he's
0:30:25 presented to us and I see some of it too
0:30:27 I've seen
0:30:29 where some of these choices
0:30:30 lead I don't know how
0:30:34 to
0:30:36 it's
0:30:37 confusing being here again reminds me of
0:30:41 how I felt when he took me here and when
0:30:44 I felt trapped and then there's moments
0:30:47 like like seeing the ash under his
0:30:49 fingernails and
0:30:50 knowing I know that he kills people I I
0:30:53 know that but it seems hypocritical in
0:30:56 the moment to pretend like
0:30:58 like I don't know that
0:31:01 any like like that makes it
0:31:04 real but then he'll do other things like
0:31:09 stand up to dark Selena for me a fight
0:31:13 that that's that fight I don't know how
0:31:17 anyone could
0:31:19 survive
0:31:21 so you don't know how what is it worth
0:31:25 trying you want me to
0:31:29 what do you need me to
0:31:31 do didn't answer the question just
0:31:33 skipped right by I'm sorry I don't
0:31:35 understand the question you don't know
0:31:37 how is it worth
0:31:40 trying do make him see us as
0:31:44 people
0:31:46 essentially to see people
0:31:50 again he and there's a thought very
0:31:55 clearly there is an inspiration that
0:31:59 brda is not sure of that walks across
0:32:03 her face in real
0:32:05 time
0:32:06 um he wanted to um he wanted to bond
0:32:13 further and the first time that we did
0:32:16 it was Mutual
0:32:19 um
0:32:21 if if I kept going with
0:32:25 that maybe that would make it harder for
0:32:28 him not to care about how I feel about
0:32:30 you
0:32:32 guys that's an option but that's your
0:32:37 choice there are many other
0:32:39 ways that you might go about it but it
0:32:42 is the way you have to
0:32:43 choose this
0:32:46 is we don't have more
0:32:49 time he
0:32:51 doesn't asking him for more
0:32:55 Humanity I don't know that that's
0:32:57 something that I
0:32:59 can provoke in him that quickly I I've
0:33:03 seen
0:33:04 flashes
0:33:06 like like the empathy of a soldier
0:33:09 looking at a
0:33:11 soldier it's the sort of thing that made
0:33:14 me look at him
0:33:16 differently
0:33:19 but it feels gross to suggest the blood
0:33:24 Bond as a way forward to that whenever
0:33:27 one is so scared of that for win right
0:33:30 now and I remember how it felt with
0:33:34 Roland because neither of those were a
0:33:36 choice for
0:33:37 them for you and for her there's a
0:33:41 difference when you can
0:33:44 choose I think
0:33:47 he is going to feel rejected by what
0:33:52 just
0:33:53 happened and I think I need to if if I
0:33:58 if I had a chance to do what you're
0:34:00 asking to convince him
0:34:03 that he shouldn't feel that
0:34:07 way these are some of our last hours
0:34:11 before the battles are on you should
0:34:13 talk to him regardless I'm just telling
0:34:16 you what I
0:34:18 think may lead to some sort of
0:34:20 resolution to all of
0:34:23 this and
0:34:25 that I know sometimes these
0:34:28 moments are hard to
0:34:31 grasp I don't want wi to be mad at me
0:34:33 either wi's mad at everyone right
0:34:36 now mostly because when's mad at her own
0:34:39 situation too which is not of her
0:34:44 fault it's for sticking
0:34:47 bias so she's allowed to be mad at
0:34:49 everyone especially
0:34:53 me
0:34:56 when um
0:34:58 last night he had wanted me
0:35:01 to not fight in New Haven that you guys
0:35:05 would go on to
0:35:07 fight now he's suggest say that we all
0:35:11 don't fight in New Haven and I don't
0:35:13 know that I find that to be an option
0:35:15 but it does mean there's an expansion of
0:35:17 scope it seems like a good
0:35:21 sign
0:35:23 look out of all of us to one degree
0:35:26 another
0:35:28 you can
0:35:29 see something there and I think you have
0:35:32 the best chance of helping
0:35:37 Roman out of the pit that he's climbed
0:35:41 into because I also think you don't want
0:35:43 him to be
0:35:46 there I can
0:35:48 try
0:35:51 I I feel like I've been climbing out of
0:35:55 pits ever since I've been awake
0:36:00 there are
0:36:02 Ledges there is light
0:36:05 above we do what we
0:36:07 can we make the choices we have
0:36:14 to okay we need to go back in and find
0:36:16 everybody soon but I will sit
0:36:20 here for a bit I'm not I'm not going to
0:36:23 spend the blood to go back in I'm
0:36:24 already out but I know
0:36:28 what do you know about bronze
0:36:30 thermoses what do you mean bronze
0:36:33 thermoses you touch and blood bonded to
0:36:36 people oh vessel of
0:36:39 transference I have
0:36:41 one it's not bronze mine's um mine's
0:36:46 plastic came in a lunch box you're not a
0:36:49 justic car well that's not a justic
0:36:52 carot thing that's that's just blood
0:36:53 sourcer I know that's why I'm saying
0:36:55 hers probably is nicer than a Ninja
0:36:58 Turtles lunchbox one I don't think so
0:36:59 Ninja Turtles is arguably cooler like on
0:37:03 a binary level they are cooler exactly
0:37:06 either way also what do they do fun
0:37:09 hints by the way you can't quite feel
0:37:11 the cold through the plastic in the same
0:37:12 way that makes
0:37:14 sense what do they do they do anything
0:37:17 other than there is blood inside you
0:37:20 touch it and the The Vessel of
0:37:22 transference it transfers the blood
0:37:23 that's inside into you and it transfers
0:37:26 your blood into it
0:37:28 so can she read my blood that way I mean
0:37:30 she has your blood now can it be
0:37:34 digitized di what do you mean digitized
0:37:37 she was looking at computers what do you
0:37:39 mean digit like Tron what are you
0:37:41 talking about like can the
0:37:44 information God damn it Neil you're
0:37:47 making me explain stuff when I don't
0:37:50 have I still have dirt in my lungs is it
0:37:54 possible are there paradigms of magic
0:37:56 that deal with like computerss and [ __ ]
0:38:00 there the I mean well so
0:38:04 there's a thical path more common in in
0:38:08 trir and stuff that has to do with the
0:38:10 manipulation of Technology you can sort
0:38:12 of do Stu I don't know a lot about it um
0:38:16 there's uh an ancient asite sorcerer
0:38:19 who's bound to a series of CD
0:38:22 ROMs um oh don't we'll stop there um so
0:38:27 is it possible she could take my blood
0:38:29 from the thermos and read it on her
0:38:32 computer like instantly yeah or not my
0:38:37 knowled okay you it's been a while since
0:38:40 I've put the like it's it's been a while
0:38:43 since I've said caveat anything is
0:38:45 technically possible so anything's
0:38:47 technically possible I don't want to say
0:38:48 no but unless you saw her like I don't
0:38:51 know performing an ult ritual
0:38:53 immediately with the blood that you had
0:38:55 while that you gave her in the computer
0:38:58 which would presumably involve her
0:38:59 taking it out of the bronze thermos as
0:39:03 you put it well I lost five minutes of
0:39:05 time when I was looking at her fingers
0:39:07 and looked at the screen so I don't
0:39:08 [ __ ] know what I saw unless she's
0:39:11 an even if she was going double time I
0:39:13 feel like a ritual like that would take
0:39:15 more than 10 minutes 5 minutes so I
0:39:20 would say it's not likely why why
0:39:25 why just adding it to the list
0:39:28 of things being done and known about me
0:39:31 without so with blood here's things that
0:39:33 I know you can do you can look at
0:39:34 somebody's generation you can figure out
0:39:35 what their sire is you can see if they
0:39:37 blood bonded to anybody you could see if
0:39:38 they have any sickness in their blood
0:39:40 you can learn about what their Clan is
0:39:42 um you learn a lot of stuff blood bonds
0:39:44 to or from
0:39:47 uh both in theor it depends there are
0:39:50 different ways to learn about blood
0:39:52 bonds the trir can do it pretty easily I
0:39:54 actually can kind of do it now but I
0:39:56 don't do it publicly cuz I have to quote
0:39:59 from a book to do it and I'm not
0:40:01 supposed to read that
0:40:03 book she seems unnerved at this why you
0:40:08 worried about them finding out I'm blood
0:40:11 bonded to
0:40:12 you they probably know that already not
0:40:15 you
0:40:16 specifically
0:40:18 Kabir not him specifically who else is
0:40:21 blood bonded to you other
0:40:24 people to you or are you bound to them
0:40:28 um actually you know what if you're
0:40:30 worried about people finding out about
0:40:32 it shut up you like she gives a thumbs
0:40:34 up looks around the courtyard I'm sorry
0:40:37 there was a red shut up um that was no
0:40:41 talk dirty to me yeah let me be me while
0:40:45 I can
0:40:46 be I feel like you're going to be you no
0:40:48 matter what I break out every now and
0:40:51 then there's these here's what I'll
0:40:54 say it's my estimation that it was not
0:40:57 the blood bond to Lucin that put the
0:40:59 stick in the asses of the other
0:41:02 archons that we've met even Glenn was a
0:41:07 little bit of a sass when we met him I
0:41:11 don't think that was a blood Bond either
0:41:13 I think that was just
0:41:15 Glenn just because somebody takes up a
0:41:17 place in your heart doesn't mean they
0:41:18 take up your whole heart no they just
0:41:20 drive your
0:41:21 motivations you got more motivations
0:41:23 than one you can have competing
0:41:26 motivations it's honestly more the
0:41:28 Dominate you've been
0:41:29 dominated which dominate are you
0:41:32 referring to that's the only dominate I
0:41:34 can remember that off as one instance of
0:41:37 absolutely horrific
0:41:40 pain before the words when innocently
0:41:44 meant to say can make it past her
0:41:47 lips it's like Athena is being birthed
0:41:50 from her skull and she grabs her
0:41:55 head and
0:41:58 gives this absolutely gut-wrenching to
0:42:01 hear for Neil scream a scream that he
0:42:04 has probably never heard in person
0:42:07 before he may have heard one similar in
0:42:09 her memories may have seen a similar
0:42:13 pain in her
0:42:14 memories but she drops to her knees
0:42:18 holding her head and dropping to her
0:42:21 side and writhes and screams until he
0:42:24 she has no voice left to scream with
0:42:27 and even then continues to rrie and
0:42:31 shake and shiver and Nash her teeth
0:42:35 together until they crack at the first
0:42:39 moment of the scream Neil jolts out of
0:42:42 his skin is instantly scanning the
0:42:45 darkness around them for signs of threat
0:42:47 of whatever what is doing this to win
0:42:50 and then seeing
0:42:52 nothing hovers over her helpless and
0:42:55 Afraid
0:42:57 for just a couple seconds before
0:43:00 crouching down and just putting a hand
0:43:04 on her back like knowing he can't do
0:43:08 anything like he needs to be as close to
0:43:10 her as possible maybe there's some point
0:43:14 of connection or wi is a very tactile
0:43:19 person she always Comforts others
0:43:21 through touch and so Neil is tentatively
0:43:25 trying to do the same until it
0:43:30 passes when it starts to
0:43:33 e she's aware of a single warm
0:43:37 spot and
0:43:40 after what to her feels like a
0:43:44 lifetime she finds herself curled
0:43:48 up and without
0:43:51 thought
0:43:53 and grabs onto Neil's shirt and just
0:43:56 holds
0:43:57 on too spent to cry but the instinct is
0:44:03 there as she's lying there in his lap
0:44:06 just sort of curled up against Neil he's
0:44:09 like petting her hair like running his
0:44:12 fingers along the hairline between where
0:44:15 her actual like hair hair is and where
0:44:17 the sides of her head are shaved and
0:44:19 eventually just goes as she starts to
0:44:24 calm a million questions
0:44:28 but I feel like asking those questions
0:44:31 could prompt another one of
0:44:33 those so I'm not going to ask you and I
0:44:36 don't want you to try and tell
0:44:38 me she kind of gives a tight nod that
0:44:42 was not a
0:44:43 particularly Pleasant piece of the
0:44:45 puzzle to give me
0:44:46 win for
0:44:49 you not for me I I mean for but
0:44:54 um a message received
0:44:58 so we'll
0:45:01 um we're going to stay here for a
0:45:03 minute and we're going
0:45:06 inside I'm going to need you to get the
0:45:08 baby
0:45:09 pjorn I don't think I'm strong enough to
0:45:11 put you in it so you're going to have to
0:45:13 help me out I think we'll
0:45:17 manage and then just sit
0:45:23 there
0:45:25 miles the quarter is a assembling one at
0:45:28 a time they come to the meeting room to
0:45:31 speak with you before you head off and
0:45:34 engage in what will be the plan to
0:45:37 defend New Haven they file in one at a
0:45:41 time and are ready to hear what you have
0:45:44 to say miles is standing there in his
0:45:47 one of his better suits uh covered in a
0:45:50 series of pins very fancy Platinum sword
0:45:54 cufflinks a roaring lion pin on that
0:45:58 holds his tie together an iron circlet
0:46:00 that makes up his belt buckle on his
0:46:02 collar he has a pin of a quill in a
0:46:05 scroll and then across his breast he has
0:46:08 a white cross a sword through the Zumi
0:46:11 symbol and a silver crescent moon and on
0:46:15 the other side of his collar he has
0:46:16 wings with a Halo made out of gold this
0:46:20 is the most adornment you've ever seen
0:46:22 on
0:46:23 him as BR approaches her eyes fall on to
0:46:28 all the pretty pins and sort of a reflex
0:46:32 she pulls one of her hands closer to
0:46:35 herself and tries to offer half a smile
0:46:38 tell Miles hey um we
0:46:42 match this one comes from the death of a
0:46:46 Lupine oh
0:46:49 um Venture stuff Venture stuff yes yes
0:46:54 anyways I've been called to the meeting
0:46:56 Johnny you'll be going with me that's
0:46:59 fun I thought we were all going to be
0:47:01 going it seems that we have upset her
0:47:04 power by not going to her summons first
0:47:07 I went we all didn't go they got they
0:47:10 got into a pissing contest and we went
0:47:13 you went pen Dragon that's yes yeah yeah
0:47:17 so a couple pieces of news first let us
0:47:20 all start with good news I was able to
0:47:23 get in contact with New Haven Court
0:47:25 specifically Nara and a couple okay
0:47:28 couple of ghouls yeah she's fine that
0:47:30 that's not the we were able to recover
0:47:33 Fuster
0:47:34 he Neil just like blue screens
0:47:38 completely blanks out how he's alive yes
0:47:42 it seems that Marcus Vel didn't burn his
0:47:44 own house down much like any other
0:47:46 Venture I would have figured so that's
0:47:48 why I sent people to go check Neil walks
0:47:50 across the room and hugs miles he when
0:47:52 walks across the room and hugs miles he
0:47:54 grimaces and then Returns the hug Johnny
0:47:57 shoots you a finger gun and goes uh the
0:48:00 thought's there but I'll let you uh we
0:48:02 I'll let you enjoy those okay going to
0:48:05 mess up my pins with that seg Neil
0:48:07 pushes back and then just like really
0:48:10 fastidiously like okay just like levels
0:48:13 them all off do you actually think all
0:48:15 those uh vent Boy Scout badges are going
0:48:17 to be a good move In This Crowd well
0:48:20 being that it's partially run by vent I
0:48:23 yes when let's go number two Neil for to
0:48:28 possibly win we need to do that ritual
0:48:31 yeah I
0:48:33 um I can try and gather or send people
0:48:36 to to gather some stuff that we need it
0:48:38 would be easier with the bow but if we
0:48:41 can't get it I I can try and at least do
0:48:44 something um as long as we have some
0:48:46 khif and um does it need to be a bll for
0:48:50 the rual I want to do yes but since this
0:48:52 is all untested anyways because neither
0:48:54 of them can actually approach a ladder
0:48:57 I'm sorry what ritual are we talking
0:48:59 about here un [ __ ] their brains
0:49:01 undoing the damage that the dragon did
0:49:04 trying to guide them both to a place of
0:49:07 re self-actualization I can get a bull
0:49:11 but I need you to get it cleared um or
0:49:13 at least inform him politely you know
0:49:16 he's not after that meeting going to be
0:49:19 in a good mood for that kind of requests
0:49:22 are we going to have to stay the meeting
0:49:24 honestly I would prefer to do this not
0:49:26 at pen Ragan's house well it seems like
0:49:28 we'll be going from here to The Siege so
0:49:30 we're not going to have a lot of in
0:49:32 between time if we can have everything
0:49:34 set up or if you can get permission for
0:49:35 me to go back to the house we could do
0:49:37 it there [ __ ] permission ask for
0:49:39 forgiveness Johnny I'm going to be
0:49:41 sacrificing a bull and doing a blood
0:49:42 Magic
0:49:45 Ritual Johnny takes a long drag on his
0:49:48 morly Johnny that might be the reason
0:49:50 why only you're going to this meeting
0:49:52 yeah and I don't really care [ __ ] cut
0:49:55 a bowl open is home thanks bud thanks
0:49:58 for not caring that we're all getting
0:49:59 cut out of this cuz of your [ __ ] my
0:50:01 [ __ ] yes your [ __ ] no I I was I
0:50:04 was so it's not just messing up his
0:50:06 house we're going to be in a trans-like
0:50:08 state for several hours and I don't
0:50:11 necessarily want to be here when miles
0:50:14 BR and I are intensely vulnerable and
0:50:17 tell you what if you're so mad about
0:50:18 missing the meeting you go our power may
0:50:21 take me okay I'm mad that we can't all
0:50:24 go together it
0:50:27 it didn't have anything to do with
0:50:28 Johnny we we weren't joh Johnny Bren and
0:50:30 I weren't weren't presented a choice
0:50:33 none of us were well miles kind of was
0:50:36 it sounds like yeah and then Johnny
0:50:38 mouthed off to pen Dragon during that
0:50:40 meeting and Miles chose against her
0:50:41 power nobody [ __ ] knows anyways a you
0:50:45 in a mood today huh don't start Johnny
0:50:50 okay we're we're all on the same page
0:50:55 let's focus here it doesn't matter who
0:50:58 goes to the meeting um so long as we
0:51:01 talk about it when we get
0:51:03 back great yes we're not going to have
0:51:06 time so we're going to have to do it
0:51:08 here so it might be best to inform him
0:51:10 that you're getting healing from Neil
0:51:13 and to look out for you SL me Neil I
0:51:17 know I know you don't like when people
0:51:18 talk about your blood magic but being
0:51:20 able to say what we're
0:51:23 doing that would be helpful in him not
0:51:26 getting offended and he probably kind of
0:51:30 already knows everything after the tri
0:51:32 my intention to take the two of you on a
0:51:35 spiritual psychic journey to find the
0:51:38 broken cores of yourselves and attempt
0:51:40 to rebuild them okay but you need a bowl
0:51:44 and a couple hours and we need a few
0:51:46 hours so that we can
0:51:50 functionally trip out kind of and go on
0:51:54 a psychic Journey
0:51:56 and part of the ritual is sacrificing it
0:51:59 and doing a lot of forbidden drugs what
0:52:02 do you mean forbidden drugs it's khif oh
0:52:06 okay um all this is not just like a tri
0:52:09 ritual this is a a a spiritual journey
0:52:12 um with a lot of
0:52:15 undertones um that
0:52:17 is I guess technically what I'm going to
0:52:20 be attempting is a perversion of a
0:52:22 sacred right I'm not going to put it
0:52:25 that way um but yeah maybe we don't tell
0:52:30 the children of hakee I'm doing it this
0:52:32 way either great I won't mention it to
0:52:34 them oh thank God more secrets I can try
0:52:38 and ask after the meeting but I I just
0:52:40 don't know if it's going to go well
0:52:42 considering how I want to help it's my
0:52:44 only idea well considering how
0:52:46 downstairs when I don't know but I can
0:52:49 try that's all I'm asking otherwise the
0:52:52 Bulls are going to show up and then
0:52:53 we're going to have a great time all
0:52:54 right do you need me to run interference
0:52:56 or buy you time while you're getting
0:52:58 high what the hell's going on while it's
0:52:59 happening we are going to be totally
0:53:01 we're going to be presumably if things
0:53:03 go the way I think they're going to be
0:53:04 having outof body experiences in the
0:53:06 middle of functionally enemy territory
0:53:09 so if the two of you could make sure
0:53:11 that we don't get I don't know
0:53:14 slaughtered while we're doing it Johnny
0:53:17 looks at the uh he opens up the pack of
0:53:19 mores looks at how many he has remaining
0:53:21 and goes H you better get another pack
0:53:23 of cigarettes along with that bull and
0:53:24 whatever else you're getting sounds like
0:53:26 a
0:53:27 wi has snapped from functionally Angry
0:53:29 to functionally dissociating and is just
0:53:31 kind of sitting on the bed holding a
0:53:32 pillow and nominally listening but she
0:53:36 kind of
0:53:37 nods I don't know what this meeting is
0:53:39 going to entail
0:53:41 probably the details of the battles are
0:53:44 going to go
0:53:46 on it could just be them [ __ ] on me
0:53:48 for the next hour I'm not entirely sure
0:53:50 it's very probably discussing positions
0:53:53 of strategic importance I'm hoping
0:53:55 that's that's the top level the
0:53:57 underneath level is probably they're
0:53:58 going to be showing you the Noose
0:53:59 they're going to hang you with that's
0:54:01 fine I mean we're all on the same page
0:54:03 right BR you sort of mentioned some of
0:54:05 that we've been talking about it what's
0:54:07 going to happen here yeah
0:54:10 um I think maybe they'll show you a plan
0:54:15 that seems like you could
0:54:18 win and you know what that means we're
0:54:22 going to see what's presented we're
0:54:24 going to try our best from there
0:54:29 um
0:54:32 I P Dragon had made a deal to exclude me
0:54:37 from that but he was trying to have me
0:54:41 not
0:54:43 fight I I told him no I told him I
0:54:45 wanted to be with you guys you had
0:54:48 mentioned okay I'm glad to have you
0:54:50 there when looks like there's more she
0:54:52 wants to say on that but kind of just
0:54:55 shakes her head and
0:54:56 drops her eyes like she knows what'll
0:54:58 happen if she
0:54:59 tries sorry I just I don't know it feels
0:55:03 like we haven't had a chance to talk to
0:55:05 each other there's nothing I can
0:55:08 say I'll say it then
0:55:11 uh BR are you sure you don't want to
0:55:13 take that
0:55:15 deal because anybody who goes into New
0:55:17 Haven is probably going to
0:55:20 die and all of us here care about
0:55:23 you so if there's an exit ramp
0:55:28 I'm not saying I don't want you there I
0:55:29 would much rather have you there I'm
0:55:31 very scared to go die but um if you're
0:55:35 being offered an opportunity I I think
0:55:38 the there's something to be said for
0:55:40 considering it at
0:55:42 least it's not just you guys that I
0:55:45 abandon if I don't
0:55:48 go yeah everyone that we care about in
0:55:51 New
0:55:52 Haven even the todor that I've been
0:55:56 running combat practice with The Mortals
0:56:00 that we know and I can't help protect
0:56:03 you guys if I'm not there and and you're
0:56:06 my family I I get that it's probably a
0:56:09 death sentence and I don't even know
0:56:12 what that
0:56:13 means but wind's face is screaming and
0:56:17 there's nothing coming out but there is
0:56:21 clear desperation Neil looks at win and
0:56:25 then looks back at br
0:56:26 and
0:56:28 goes yeah I'm not I'm not saying that
0:56:31 you're choosing wrong because I mean for
0:56:35 me I I would I am making the same choice
0:56:40 I just I think it's worth discussing
0:56:43 that's all you guys ran into near
0:56:45 certain death for me at the Chantry Neil
0:56:47 looks guilty Neil okay um you get it it
0:56:51 it doesn't have to be the Shane any
0:56:53 example works I get it I get it and
0:56:56 we're going to do our best to avoid the
0:56:59 whole everyone dying
0:57:01 outcome we're not going in there to lose
0:57:04 when gets up and goes in the bathroom
0:57:06 and shuts the door she carries a pillow
0:57:08 in with her okay it's Neil looks at
0:57:11 Miles and shrugs anything else guys
0:57:13 before I head off to this meeting here
0:57:15 Neil yeah do we go in there or do we
0:57:19 give her a moment she did the outside
0:57:21 version of this earlier and I got a
0:57:23 mouth full of dirt um I will so
0:57:26 before I leave
0:57:27 sh okay when is down a part of the
0:57:31 Spiral that some of us have been down
0:57:33 before and it's a hard part of the
0:57:34 Spiral and that's and in a in a in a
0:57:38 less hopeful place than usual anything
0:57:40 else anyone Els to add before we get off
0:57:43 to do what we need to do no I'll um I'm
0:57:47 going to
0:57:48 call fester and Nora and everybody just
0:57:51 to talk to them if uh if we manage to
0:57:55 survive all this [ __ ] um I'm
0:57:57 officially resigning from my post of
0:57:59 cesa probably from the camaria assuming
0:58:03 we survive but I figure you you ought to
0:58:05 ought to have a heads up I mean we're
0:58:07 planning for a non- camaria future
0:58:08 anyways so maybe if we need help in this
0:58:14 battle maybe we keep that in
0:58:17 mind with who we choose to call how we
0:58:22 try to survive oh I I didn't mean
0:58:24 personally non- Camara I mean globally
0:58:26 but I I yes I see what you're saying
0:58:29 just just something to keep in mind
0:58:32 throughout the meeting
0:58:36 yeah all right let's get to it guys mil
0:58:42 yes can I have a hug
0:58:44 too
0:58:46 yes he he hugs her in such a way to try
0:58:49 to not mess up his pins again BR is
0:58:51 actually like way more
0:58:53 careful cuddling on in miles will
0:58:56 disengage himself and go into the
0:58:59 bathroom and close the door behind
0:59:04 him when is sitting leaning against the
0:59:10 bathtub hugging onto his pillow kind of
0:59:13 like chewing on the corner of it and she
0:59:16 looks up at him what do you
0:59:21 need everyone's making me their toy
0:59:24 man that's not the Point
0:59:27 here she kind of holds out her arm
0:59:30 please let me know that I'm not just a
0:59:31 toy to you too is that what you need yes
0:59:36 miles takes his glasses off straightens
0:59:39 out his uh suit and tie goes down to one
0:59:43 KNE and grabs her arm when the look on
0:59:47 her face is
0:59:49 like desperate and embarrassed that
0:59:53 maybe for the first time in her life she
0:59:56 has never been shy about ensuring that
1:00:00 her physical intimacy needs are
1:00:04 met but maybe for the first time she has
1:00:07 had to Advocate that her emotional
1:00:09 intimacy needs be met and she didn't
1:00:12 want to put that on
1:00:14 Miles and there is this unbearable
1:00:19 relief that it wasn't even an argument
1:00:23 he just was Miles
1:00:27 miles is looking
1:00:28 for Ascension she kind of nods she
1:00:32 doesn't stop chewing on the
1:00:33 pillow he kind of frowns at the pillow
1:00:36 thing and then puts the arm in his mouth
1:00:38 and proceeds to
1:00:40 drink and when
1:00:43 she feels he's had enough she pinches
1:00:47 his nose and starts pulling his face
1:00:50 away this is very undignified I know
1:00:53 believe me there's a lot of indignity
1:00:55 happening inside me right now I won't
1:00:58 tell anyone about yours I was like this
1:01:00 is about me right now oh
1:01:05 [ __ ] and she does actually laugh
1:01:07 he put his glasses back on check himself
1:01:10 in the mirror to make sure nothing he
1:01:12 has just the smallest spot of red on his
1:01:15 lips he will clear that off with his
1:01:18 thumb she does not lick his thumb but
1:01:22 the instinct is clearly there see if you
1:01:25 can help out Neil them get what we need
1:01:27 we need to be at full strength do you
1:01:28 just want me to go out and make cow
1:01:30 sounds on the front lawn no we we can
1:01:32 just purchase cows we don't need to
1:01:34 summon them cuz honestly if we're going
1:01:37 with the whole [ __ ] these people then
1:01:38 I'm happy to go I I don't need an
1:01:41 incident I'm fine with [ __ ] them a
1:01:43 little more subtly
1:01:44 than a bull Stampede was going to be a
1:01:47 stampede it was going to be very subtle
1:01:49 just me making cow noises on the front
1:01:52 yard and getting police reports written
1:01:54 yeah let's not let's let's try to avoid
1:01:56 that for now okay let's call that plan Z
1:01:59 so you're telling me there's a chance 25
1:02:02 other plans fail you're
1:02:03 up all right wish me luck she kind of
1:02:07 like realizes she'd been holding on to
1:02:09 his shoulder and let's go good luck
1:02:13 miles will come out of the bathroom you
