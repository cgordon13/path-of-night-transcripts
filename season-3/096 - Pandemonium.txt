0:00:23 you to feel the same so listener
0:00:25 discretion is advised now let's walk the
0:00:28 path of night
0:00:30 [Music]
0:00:37 last time on path of night the Cordy
0:00:41 reunited discussed the circumstances of
0:00:43 wind's return and the aftermath of the
0:00:45 fight with the
0:00:46 sabat they sced for
0:00:49 supplies the Coterie was divided until
0:00:52 miles asserted his majesty after
0:00:55 radioing info over for Luc sind they
0:00:57 went to find Weathers
0:01:02 [Music]
0:01:26 Johnny is going to summon weathers with
0:01:28 the hope that he will will not be able
0:01:30 to leave when he feels the PLL to come
0:01:33 to me maybe he will reflexively summon
0:01:36 me to him does that make sense yeah
0:01:39 you're aware that you getting summoned
0:01:40 means we can't we're going to have to
0:01:42 bust in there there'll be no
0:01:44 Recon I can try and track him if we have
0:01:48 anything of his I can help find him too
0:01:50 I can track him by his Beast if he was
0:01:52 here I can try and track him is it his
0:01:54 specific Beast or is it cuz there's
0:01:56 vampires all over the city I know it's
0:01:58 it's his specific Beast I was say we we
0:02:01 should go to where the last was so she
0:02:02 knows where his Beast was and if we
0:02:05 can't track it from there then we can
0:02:06 try the summon plan got up Miles because
0:02:09 then we actually get a chance to
0:02:10 possibly Recon and hit them instead of
0:02:13 Kool-Aid Manning our way in you say so
0:02:15 I'm just understood where is the last
0:02:17 place you thought he was we know where
0:02:19 he was last stationed right you are on
0:02:21 the street that he was stationed at I'm
0:02:23 spending a
0:02:26 willpower what's the difficulty seven
0:02:28 only two successes with two successes
0:02:31 he's too far away no he's too far are we
0:02:34 taking the police car miles I think we
0:02:36 might be best to walk from here and have
0:02:37 Neil conceal us okay are we bringing the
0:02:40 radios yes turn them at least off for
0:02:42 now I'll I got it and Lex on miles's say
0:02:45 so I will cloak the Gathering for the
0:02:47 five of us
0:02:48 okay if we knew exactly if we knew
0:02:52 exactly where he had been but I like
0:02:55 exactly exactly I could follow him from
0:02:57 there but I we don't have that so I
0:03:00 guess we we don't have like an exact
0:03:01 building he was just on Dixwell
0:03:03 somewhere how did you find me when when
0:03:05 Pendragon took me go through the steps
0:03:08 I had um so what I went the first time
0:03:12 went Pendragon I followed you uh with
0:03:16 that trail um cuz I knew exactly where
0:03:19 you had been and where you started and
0:03:21 then I illuminated the trail of prey and
0:03:23 followed you to a puddle where I saw you
0:03:26 through the water get into the car from
0:03:30 the past and then I just track the car
0:03:32 okay can we try that when how badly do
0:03:35 you want to find
0:03:41 him I mean
0:03:42 very like that's what we're here to do
0:03:45 right the Earth shakes make a will power
0:03:47 roll at difficulty
0:03:51 9 two successes you may choose any of
0:03:55 your
0:03:57 disciplines and raise it by two two for
0:04:00 the scene Beyond
0:04:03 maximum
0:04:05 okay the [ __ ] is happening my in Clans
0:04:08 you may choose any of your
0:04:11 disciplines and raise it by two for the
0:04:14 scene as you experience a sudden and
0:04:19 disconcerting surge of kite
0:04:23 [Music]
0:04:26 power rodean
0:04:30 when groans in pain and you see her
0:04:35 flesh split apart from herself as her
0:04:39 body
0:04:41 twists and
0:04:43 collapses into how many traits of blood
0:04:45 you have three you're done to three
0:04:47 blood yeah okay as she collapses into
0:04:50 three
0:04:52 Ravens when when you have turned into a
0:04:55 number of animals equal to your blood
0:04:58 pool you cannot be destroyed unless all
0:05:02 three of them are destroyed but have
0:05:05 very abruptly gained the ability to
0:05:07 scout over a large area very very easily
0:05:12 but now I'm going to get to the bad news
0:05:14 as this surge of power courses through
0:05:17 you you feel something far far away but
0:05:22 not far enough Rouse from its
0:05:27 Slumber and this ancient
0:05:31 power attains Consciousness from its
0:05:34 sleep deep within the Earth and without
0:05:38 a doubt you come to
0:05:41 realize that this ancient vampire
0:05:45 whatever it is that you are descended
0:05:47 from knows exactly where you
0:05:50 are and consumed by its infinite
0:05:55 hunger it moves to draw you in and I
0:05:59 need you to make a role or be
0:06:06 diabled what
0:06:08 Jesus when could you always do that
0:06:12 I here's how this works you are at
0:06:15 difficulty 12 and will enjoy a minus one
0:06:20 difficulty for every Merit or power you
0:06:25 have that is meant to represent some
0:06:28 sort of for force of will code of honor
0:06:31 true love Iron Will um loyalty Iron
0:06:36 Heart uh Focus mind five any of those
0:06:40 abilities each one you have will reduce
0:06:42 the difficulty of this role by
0:06:44 one if you fail this role you are gone
0:06:48 forever the merits I have and you tell
0:06:50 me if they will apply are inoffensive to
0:06:53 animals doesn't feel right medium
0:06:56 oracular ability uh for who it is in
0:06:58 offensive to animals will why um okay it
0:07:01 sounds like you are rolling at
0:07:02 difficulty 10 and need two successes I
0:07:05 will spend that
0:07:07 [Music]
0:07:08 willpower with the willpower two
0:07:10 successes Jesus Christ okay I rolled I
0:07:13 rolled two1 [ __ ] high five
0:07:17 up yeah I'm glad it was you rolling and
0:07:20 not
0:07:22 [Music]
0:07:25 me when you know she's hungry
0:07:30 and she will attempt to lure you to her
0:07:33 and she will make you impossibly strong
0:07:36 before snuffing you out if you ever give
0:07:39 her the chance
0:07:42 again Neil is looking at these three
0:07:45 birds with complete
0:07:48 bafflement one of the birds looks to
0:07:51 Miles cuz she knows one of them looks to
0:07:53 Neil the one that looks at Neil tries to
0:07:56 speak in words
0:07:59 some bird noises are made your way Wynn I
0:08:02 don't I don't know what you're saying
0:08:03 runs up and perches on your shoulder
0:08:05 kind of giving comforting it's all right
0:08:07 it's all right um she not working at all
0:08:09 it's it shouldn't be she's very bad at
0:08:11 it the other one hops over towards miles
0:08:14 doesn't get in have no idea how diseases
0:08:17 cross bird thresholds at this point and
0:08:20 starts to talk
0:08:31 I mine's
0:08:35 awake what is my old one my the oldest
0:08:40 of my
0:08:41 line all right take a minute
0:08:45 she's she is making me powerful I need
0:08:50 to
0:08:51 feed and she's trying to eat me and
0:08:55 she's going to try and pull me
0:08:57 away and
0:09:00 I if any if all of these three birds die
0:09:04 I die but I can't die unless all of the
0:09:07 birds die isn't that the same thing
0:09:09 Raven does I don't [ __ ] know what
0:09:11 Raven does okay Raven imprisons Med in
0:09:15 bird
0:09:16 form that's news to me
0:09:21 also miles say she care what is
0:09:24 happening
0:09:25 her uh progenitor of her line is w up
0:09:29 and tried to eat
0:09:30 her Neil he's a vampire he doesn't but
0:09:35 play that back and she knows where I am
0:09:38 Gangrel the clan gangrels anti deluvian
0:09:42 has woken up yes she says yes and that's
0:09:46 why Wynn can what is she even doing
0:09:49 channeling the powers of her Elder it
0:09:52 seems like it's made her more powerful I
0:09:54 don't think she's channeling anything if
0:09:56 if the anti Delian is woken up it's
0:09:58 forcing this change I don't know if I
0:10:00 can change back but I don't know that I
0:10:01 have enough
0:10:03 blood well to try we still have to move
0:10:07 forward so gather yourself I can
0:10:10 probably track a little better okay take
0:10:13 a couple of your birds and and do so but
0:10:15 I don't see us having a solution to this
0:10:17 otherwise tell them the rest of them yep
0:10:22 that I can't die unless all the birds
0:10:24 die okay she would like you to know that
0:10:27 she can't die unless all the birds die
0:10:29 so have one of those birds fly all the
0:10:31 [ __ ] away from here I can she just be
0:10:34 win again is it or are we does she want
0:10:36 to use this what what miles what's
0:10:38 happening tell don't yell at Miles I
0:10:41 just Neil looks cow yeah she's she's a
0:10:44 bird I she's going to look around while
0:10:46 she can do it she's been empowered she
0:10:49 has resisted being debled debled by her
0:10:54 progenitor everyone calmed down miles
0:10:58 yes never in the history of saying the
0:11:00 phrase calm down has anyone ever calmed
0:11:02 down I tried it three times tonight and
0:11:03 it didn't work I know but I got a little
0:11:06 backup so I understand it's a big deal
0:11:11 but we still have things to do and
0:11:12 there's nothing we can do about any of
0:11:14 the rest of that right now once you're
0:11:16 ready I would suggest taking a look
0:11:19 around let's take this Boon for what it
0:11:21 is and see and try to save the people we
0:11:24 can when kind of like looks around as
0:11:27 all the birds all right I will try to
0:11:30 get a bird's eye view go for it uh when
0:11:34 the one that was talking to miles takes
0:11:37 off into the sky and surveys and she
0:11:41 starts kind of circling outward like
0:11:44 further down Dixwell looking listening
0:11:48 Scouting For The Sight and Sounds of
0:11:52 either a fight happening or the Sight
0:11:56 and Sounds of a fight that had has
0:11:59 happened you head uh a bit of a distance
0:12:02 down the street and come to the corner
0:12:06 of Dixwell and Bristol AV and there
0:12:09 there is this old kind of very much on
0:12:13 its way out Radio
0:12:15 Shack and the Radio Shack's windows are
0:12:18 smashed in there's a fire that's going
0:12:22 has the place hasn't completely engulfed
0:12:24 but there is a
0:12:26 fire outside of it you see
0:12:29 two lumps of men that were once
0:12:34 vampires there Fang skulls
0:12:39 incinerated uh clothes and as you follow
0:12:43 along you see another two another one
0:12:46 another three and all in all you find
0:12:52 over a dozen of these dead vampires and
0:12:55 you know they're vampires because
0:12:57 they're much deeper into state of Decay
0:13:00 than humans would be had they been the
0:13:02 ones butchered in this scenario the bird
0:13:07 on Neil's shoulder will squawk at Miles
0:13:11 and give these updates so that the crew
0:13:14 can keep moving in the direction that
0:13:16 she's headed or making different choices
0:13:19 there are a lot of bodies down here a
0:13:22 lot of Kindred bodies there are
0:13:25 definitely signs weathers has been here
0:13:27 um there's some people beaten to pulps
0:13:30 we're moving as the bird watches you do
0:13:34 see that there is you know those like
0:13:38 those storm doors that open and Lead
0:13:40 down into basements yeah where there is
0:13:43 a small apartment building that has
0:13:46 storm doors just like that okay that
0:13:48 lead down into kind of a large basement
0:13:50 area okay and you can see those storm
0:13:52 doors are open kind of heading up from
0:13:56 inside to close the storm doors you see
0:13:59 this man who's got this like little
0:14:02 goatee he's got this like greasy mop
0:14:06 hair trench coat he has a purple armband
0:14:10 on and perhaps most unusual about him is
0:14:14 that his eyes are just these empty
0:14:17 translucent orbs and he sort of doesn't
0:14:21 need to see where he's going his eyes
0:14:24 his head doesn't really like turn to
0:14:26 keep track of Direction uh as though
0:14:27 he's just aware of his surroundings and
0:14:31 he just closes up the storm door did he
0:14:33 seem like Kindred or did he seem like
0:14:36 just a dude uh he is very much a vampire
0:14:39 there fangs in his mouth uh he's got
0:14:42 that kind of gaunt path dead expression
0:14:45 okay is there any sense of Clan or give
0:14:49 me an aote rule difficulty
0:14:51 eight two successes with two successes
0:14:55 you are reminded of uh stories of
0:15:00 vampires possessing a myriad of types of
0:15:03 blood magic but there is one in
0:15:05 particular where its power manifests in
0:15:09 the eyes of its Sorcerer And that is the
0:15:13 power of the zimit cun they're wielding
0:15:17 Elemental Magics what it means when the
0:15:20 eyes don't glow at all and are instead
0:15:22 translucent you're not clear on uh as a
0:15:25 heads up there is an apartment building
0:15:27 near the radio sh back I think there's
0:15:32 zitti cun holding up in the basement
0:15:35 that sounds terrible I have this is a
0:15:38 sliding scale of worse and getting worse
0:15:42 uh team we're heading towards zitti cun
0:15:45 not entirely sure what that entails but
0:15:47 go ahead and give me a saat l
0:15:49 Johnny two successes with two successes
0:15:53 you know that zc cun wield The Elements
0:15:58 by by essentially brutalizing spirits
0:16:02 and forcing them to bend to their will
0:16:05 and what is particularly concerning is
0:16:08 that they possess something called the
0:16:11 way of spirit and through the way of
0:16:13 spirit they become aware of their
0:16:16 surroundings sometimes over large
0:16:18 distances and through that space May
0:16:22 perform their Magics whether that's
0:16:24 Conjuring fires or storms or swallowing
0:16:29 uh vessels in the ocean this is bad news
0:16:32 guys cunes practice a magic where they
0:16:35 are attuned with the spirits of an area
0:16:39 I don't pretend to understand what that
0:16:41 means but they are aware of everything
0:16:45 around them in an intimate way they can
0:16:48 summon
0:16:49 storms
0:16:51 fires Waters to drowned their foes this
0:16:54 is bad what does the spiritual landscape
0:16:57 look like in this place
0:16:59 shadowlands and shadowlands is being
0:17:02 consumed by a horrific storm in the
0:17:04 spirit world there is just this sickly
0:17:09 presence that is feasting on the essence
0:17:12 of the city itself uh it's been that way
0:17:15 for a while right now you're not seeing
0:17:17 anything distinct indicative of the
0:17:19 coldon Magics okay it seems subtle
0:17:22 enough that just looking around isn't
0:17:24 going to reveal anything Johnny that
0:17:26 awareness does that Pierce obfuscation
0:17:30 does it see into the psychic realm do I
0:17:32 don't know if you Johnny gives you a
0:17:34 look like you're asking questions far
0:17:36 above his pay grade okay I don't know
0:17:39 about any of that Neil but if I had to
0:17:41 go after a cun I would be as fast and
0:17:44 Swift as possible awareness in the
0:17:46 spirit realm or not I think speed is our
0:17:49 Ally here just wondering if I should
0:17:52 physically stay behind to go check it
0:17:53 out now that we know we should keep
0:17:55 moving off you SK us again if you can
0:17:58 well yes yeah
0:17:59 well we talked a bunch and everything
0:18:00 like that before Oh yes no I have been
0:18:02 since we've been moving if nobody's
0:18:04 suggesting we break it off let's go
0:18:06 we're already here so you said let's go
0:18:09 can I Spirit track yeah roll for it is
0:18:12 my perception or survival any different
0:18:15 it's the same rle as before
0:18:17 okay I had a success but the one took it
0:18:20 away so no successes based on the trail
0:18:22 of bodies and your Clues you think this
0:18:25 is the way but feel pretty good so we're
0:18:26 going to move as quickly as we can while
0:18:28 staying under his cloak crossing fingers
0:18:31 and praying that that's going to be
0:18:33 enough to get us within close range of
0:18:35 this guy well you guys are able to
0:18:38 arrive to the storm door while I am
0:18:41 waiting for them to catch up is it
0:18:44 possible to scout any locations where
0:18:47 there might be some snacks to find
0:18:50 snacks blood like you want to go hunting
0:18:53 don't want to go hunting want to see if
0:18:54 there's a convenient place to top up a
0:18:56 little bit there isn't really going to
0:18:57 be anything convenient the area you're
0:18:59 in it's like a war zone no one is no one
0:19:02 is uh allowing themselves to be in such
0:19:05 vulnerable positions if they can help it
0:19:07 I wasn't sure if there was like an
0:19:08 overturn to ambulance or a blood bank or
0:19:10 something like that do you want me to
0:19:11 take a peek inside before we do anything
0:19:14 be circumspect and quick but yes he's
0:19:17 going to need someone to watch his body
0:19:18 well staying with his body Lex I will
0:19:21 try and visable or not project my
0:19:24 Consciousness out of my body to go face
0:19:26 through the walls and take a look
0:19:32 you go through the wall and you see more
0:19:37 dead saat once you Ventrue deep enough
0:19:41 there is the man that was described he
0:19:44 seems very much aware now of where the
0:19:47 Coterie is and he is struggling with
0:19:49 his phone trying to call for help but is
0:19:54 definitely in possession of a tarded
0:19:57 Weathers and it doesn't look like
0:19:59 weathers was torper from someone
0:20:02 successfully managing to survive his
0:20:05 Onslaught but more he seems to have
0:20:08 suffered from lethal heat exhaustion
0:20:11 related wounds like his flesh was baked
0:20:16 not burned with fire but with like raw
0:20:18 heat but you definitely get the
0:20:20 impression that with this guy who's got
0:20:23 like a hunting knife in his hand is
0:20:26 watching the direction of where the quar
0:20:28 is and is intent on attempting to saw
0:20:31 weathers his head off if he feels he
0:20:33 can't make it out with him Neil's body
0:20:36 stays limp but a like bizarr looking
0:20:40 psychic version of Neil appears in front
0:20:43 of everyone and in the moment that he is
0:20:45 visible just goes he has total awareness
0:20:49 he knows exactly where we are he's going
0:20:51 to cut he's alone but he's going to cut
0:20:53 weathers his head off if he thinks we
0:20:56 can't make it out so this is either a
0:21:00 negotiation or if somebody's got ideas I
0:21:03 can hear you Rob I hate to point this
0:21:05 out but I think in the past you've
0:21:07 described Neil's astral form is not
0:21:09 being Neil in the past I have described
0:21:11 it that way and that has changed he uh
0:21:13 he still looks blonde he still looks
0:21:15 soaked in blood but his features are
0:21:19 like a distorted version of Neil not the
0:21:23 identical features of someone who hasn't
0:21:24 existed in the domain for like 10 years
0:21:26 does this look like the Neil that showed
0:21:28 up last time it looks like a distortion
0:21:31 of him I mean we could try a negotiation
0:21:35 but on the form disappears cuz I I only
0:21:38 manifest for a short time Neil Sho the
0:21:42 last words before as he's like fading
0:21:44 out of sight is I can still see and hear
0:21:45 you one of the birds looks to Johnny one
0:21:48 of the birds looks to Miles Johnny
0:21:51 options we got to move quick here hold
0:21:53 on one second
0:21:55 after Neil explains
0:21:59 you feel an intense heat wash over you I
0:22:02 need you to roll you don't get to add
0:22:04 your armor to this but stamina plus
0:22:06 4titude against five levels of lethal
0:22:09 damage in addition to this the sudden
0:22:12 wave of heat also causes a blood loss of
0:22:16 five traits of blood all right we'll get
0:22:18 to that after I think uh I only have
0:22:20 four y so um first things first you said
0:22:24 stamina and fortitude that's right I
0:22:27 have no for fortitude so I am rolling
0:22:30 stamina am I allowed to spend willpower
0:22:33 uh not on soak no one success okay you
0:22:36 will take four levels of lethal damage
0:22:38 and you will lose five traits of blood I
0:22:40 have only lost four traits of blood
0:22:43 because I only have four traits of blood
0:22:45 you're reduced to zero blood describe
0:22:48 the intense pain you see you feel as you
0:22:51 guys can actually feel like suddenly the
0:22:53 heat of a bonfire radiates from her that
0:22:57 transient shimmering of the air that
0:22:59 happens when there's a horrible horrible
0:23:02 heat radiates off of BR and she screams
0:23:05 out in agony as it rips at her skin and
0:23:10 it clearly goes beneath the armor the
0:23:13 jacket it's almost like it's containing
0:23:15 the heat to help cook her but soon that
0:23:19 Agony turns to hunger and you see that
0:23:22 be look return to her eyes like you just
0:23:25 seen earlier but it's worse it's dark
0:23:28 it's like the pupil in those wide eyes
0:23:30 is blown like there's only one Soul
0:23:33 focus in the world and she's hurting and
0:23:36 she's driven and though there's no fire
0:23:39 a vampire doesn't much like heat Johny
0:23:41 Whit go seeing the cun's attack outside
0:23:45 of of this location Johnny throws aside
0:23:48 all pretense of planning and just
0:23:50 smashes through the entrance to try and
0:23:52 go directly to the coldon let's roll an
0:23:53 is
0:23:56 [Music]
0:23:58 13 the coldon will be going on 12 I'm
0:24:02 spending two for extra actions I'm going
0:24:04 on a 13 I'm going on a 24 activating the
0:24:08 third level of path of blood is that
0:24:10 obvious in any way to people around me
0:24:12 yeah
0:24:13 so no light show okay yeah but because
0:24:17 of the Paradigm it is you are invoking
0:24:21 dark powers and are audibly doing so so
0:24:24 I'm not doing that right now 16 18 all
0:24:27 right Britta first has Johnny
0:24:29 successfully busted down the door yet
0:24:31 yes I'm actually going to say at the
0:24:33 breaking of the storm Dy rule how far is
0:24:37 the SMY coldon from the
0:24:40 entrance he's actually pretty deep uh it
0:24:43 it's going to take multiple actions to
0:24:45 get to him what about shoting him he's
0:24:47 not in that there's multiple rooms got
0:24:50 it so you're going to have to
0:24:51 unfortunately close to the room he's in
0:24:53 in order to do that BR has already
0:24:55 reloaded on the trip there then I'll
0:24:58 switch the assault rifle and head on in
0:25:00 as quickly as I can without using
0:25:01 Celerity I don't have the blood for it
0:25:04 you see BR she hasn't taken on the same
0:25:07 berserker's rage that you saw in her
0:25:09 earlier not just yet the focus that she
0:25:12 has that's of brda that's of who she is
0:25:15 but there a battle between her and the
0:25:17 Beast I'll move as far in as I can okay
0:25:20 you take a full move who's next I
0:25:21 believe it's when one bird will perch up
0:25:24 with Neil the other two will Dart into
0:25:27 the house okay and begin searching miles
0:25:32 I am drawing my sword and moving through
0:25:35 the busted down door and moving in the
0:25:38 general direction that uh the Neil ghost
0:25:41 pointed I will spend a blood for Rod
0:25:45 rending understood and make a full move
0:25:48 as much as I can Johnny Johnny will leap
0:25:50 down into the into the uh Sellar space
0:25:53 does he see any clues to where the zitti
0:25:58 is
0:25:58 uh you see more broken canite strung
0:26:03 about scorched from whatever burning
0:26:06 Implement was being used to beat them to
0:26:09 death probably fists but that does
0:26:12 create a bit of a trail Johnny will use
0:26:15 his action to as the crow flies make a
0:26:19 path on this Trail you start smashing
0:26:22 through and you are uh on that path we
0:26:24 go to Neil because I know where this guy
0:26:27 is and can move with the speed of
0:26:29 thought Neil's spirit will begin
0:26:32 speaking audibly in front of where he is
0:26:36 just appearing in front of where he is
0:26:38 and say honestly considering everything
0:26:40 that was going on right now we would
0:26:42 have just talked to you we would have
0:26:43 said something we we would have
0:26:45 advocated you didn't have to do this you
0:26:47 didn't have to and you certainly didn't
0:26:48 have to with your will or your blood we
0:26:51 could have just made this work all we
0:26:53 wanted was to walk away and I will
0:26:55 through my words use total in sanity
0:26:59 okay let's pull up the rooll it is
0:27:00 intimidation plus manipulation does my
0:27:04 spec in fast talking work yes uh and I
0:27:06 have a seven die pool I will spend a
0:27:08 willpower love this uh what is his
0:27:11 current willpower that's my difficulty
0:27:13 seven four with the willpower so that is
0:27:15 four successes to fracture the
0:27:18 spellcaster Mind One Part Terror one
0:27:22 part tantrum the coldon lets out a mad
0:27:27 scream
0:27:29 not like a gutal roar or a Bellow like a
0:27:34 shrieking scream Neil doesn't disappear
0:27:37 because he's not there all right
0:27:39 celarity who spent for extra actions
0:27:42 miles I will head towards the screen
0:27:44 very easy to follow now and as you burst
0:27:48 into the room you find a tored weathers
0:27:53 which is kind of hard to see because
0:27:55 normally he's just so vital strong
0:27:58 sturdy that it's just not really
0:28:00 something you had ever really imagined
0:28:03 to see him in uh and kind of hovering
0:28:06 over him with a knife to his own neck is
0:28:11 this wide eyed emaciated figure with
0:28:14 fangs Beed and these translucent eyes
0:28:18 that flicker with red heat am I able to
0:28:21 attack I'll do it am I able to attack
0:28:23 this round the full move gets you into
0:28:25 the room okay I'm sorry he's holding a
0:28:27 knife to his own own throat and said
0:28:29 I'll do it yes cool Johnny Johnny will
0:28:32 use his Celerity to get into the room
0:28:34 you uh find yourself standing shoulder
0:28:37 toh shoulder with
0:28:38 Miles and uh do you have any other
0:28:41 actions miles I do I have one more okay
0:28:43 you're up I will strike him I don't know
0:28:47 what he's going on so I'm just gonna
0:28:48 give the man the old C the old slice and
0:28:51 dice the old slice and
0:28:54 dice one success roll damage I'll spend
0:28:58 for
0:28:59 potent one
0:29:01 damage oh you spend for pot spend for
0:29:03 pot oh five damage okay I forgot it's
0:29:06 not used to that uh he will suffer two
0:29:08 levels of lethal damage and kind of
0:29:12 drops a knife puts his hands up and
0:29:15 squeals I Surrender I give myself to you
0:29:19 yes yes you can have me the spot was
0:29:22 wrong it's
0:29:24 mistaken I give myself to you so seeing
0:29:28 Weathers in the state that he's in I
0:29:32 think Johnny is going to put this guy
0:29:34 through the [ __ ] wall hopefully a
0:29:37 concrete
0:29:41 one nine successes do what you will with
0:29:44 me I ask only that you spare my
0:29:47 pmes wait their dead Clash boom like you
0:29:51 just at that as he realizes your uh
0:29:54 strike connects strength plus eight
0:29:57 successes
0:29:59 I will spend for
0:30:01 potent uh 15 bashing he will roll soak
0:30:05 he will soak one and will take 14 levels
0:30:08 of bashing damage uh your fist connects
0:30:12 he is driven through the like cement
0:30:16 wall and his body goes very still as
0:30:22 with a single blow you reduce him to
0:30:23 torper anything else moving down here
0:30:27 besides my
0:30:29 Coterie
0:30:33 yes with that tward
0:30:36 zi you slowly come to realize that he
0:30:39 wasn't talking to the group of you and
0:30:42 the body jerks and kind of
0:30:45 twists and its veins start to bulge and
0:30:50 take on this orange spongy sort of
0:30:54 texture Johnny's head lowers and he
0:30:58 adopts a wide
0:31:00 stance as his fists curl and begin to
0:31:04 smoke Dad Dad I'm all
0:31:08 alone I'm all alone with the
0:31:12 monster and you left me with her and it
0:31:15 starts to kind of sit up as it speaks
0:31:17 with your daughter's voice get weather's
0:31:19 out of
0:31:24 here we go to the next round BR I
0:31:27 believe you're first
0:31:28 are there more of uh these fungal
0:31:32 voices I'll get to it on its turn yeah y
0:31:35 right now I you so I Ed a full move
0:31:37 action last round this round can I
0:31:40 visually see the body jerking up the
0:31:42 doors open from miles and Johnny
0:31:44 bursting into the situation so you can
0:31:46 see this thing is like sitting up all
0:31:49 right I'm going to aim for the head and
0:31:51 Sho uh I will say this orange spongy
0:31:55 vicissitude Monster uh your training
0:31:57 kicks in as my training kicks in and I
0:31:59 lose control of myself does my new
0:32:02 Berserker Merit kick on that's what I'm
0:32:04 referring to oh that okay you're
0:32:07 effectively uh making an attack roll at
0:32:09 difficulty five with the damage that's
0:32:11 on me I four lethal that's wounded take
0:32:13 away
0:32:15 two 16 successes
0:32:22 hit 13 damage rolls zero successes and
0:32:27 the round round you fire enters its eye
0:32:30 and explodes out the back of its head
0:32:32 there is this orangey blood pasted all
0:32:35 across the little concaved area that
0:32:38 Johnny's fist created and despite being
0:32:42 animated by this waking godling the cun
0:32:47 go still turns out his brown
0:32:51 eyes you see baa turn into what you've
0:32:56 watched her slip into before Canary the
0:32:59 one who shot veto all the times that
0:33:01 she's lost control this time at least a
0:33:04 little more directed her gaining access
0:33:07 to this part of herself this bizarre
0:33:10 King maybe it's a thin line Johnny kind
0:33:13 of loses himself a little bit steps past
0:33:18 and kind of almost rushes to the corpse
0:33:19 that has just been blasted out in front
0:33:22 of him Jessica wait that was Jessica's
0:33:25 voice he kind of looks back to the
0:33:27 Coterie with like bleeding eyes what the
0:33:30 [ __ ] was that more tricks tricks the
0:33:33 [ __ ] kind of trick was that do you
0:33:35 remember in the Chantry that same fungus
0:33:38 it senses you it knows things about you
0:33:41 I don't know how to explain it I don't
0:33:43 he looks unconvinced but doesn't say
0:33:45 anything Neil returns to his body and
0:33:50 then you can hear his voice sort of
0:33:52 calling down from the street level like
0:33:54 he had heard all of that Johnny
0:33:58 Suarez was with your daughter right yes
0:34:01 and he was a cop yes if we're in an
0:34:04 outage he might be using the radios too
0:34:06 do you want to
0:34:07 try I I don't know if bring weathers up
0:34:11 and and we can we can think of something
0:34:12 we need to regroup we're starting to get
0:34:14 empty here yeah I really need blood yeah
0:34:17 looking at the downed Kites and
0:34:19 weather's path are there toror kites who
0:34:22 look to be unaffected by zitti blight
0:34:26 unfortunately even though there's was
0:34:27 easily over a dozen canites the burning
0:34:32 fists of weathers did not reduce them to
0:34:35 torper he killed them all please don't
0:34:38 get too near me I I'm really thirsty I
0:34:43 maybe just put me in the trunk for now
0:34:45 Johnny grab weathers he Scoops weathers
0:34:47 up and heads outside I will as we're
0:34:49 going out pull out the shotgun with the
0:34:52 dragon's breath round and shoot that
0:34:53 corpse it sizzles and rides but finally
0:34:57 stop s hate those things Mo moves to
0:35:01 follow afterwards one bird stays perched
0:35:03 on Neil's shoulder the other two follow
0:35:05 the
0:35:10 group after a hard night struggling
0:35:13 against the enemies of the camria and
0:35:16 direct threats to the Cordy the group of
0:35:19 you are
0:35:21 exhausted
0:35:22 hungry and many cases wounded there is a
0:35:26 place that has been prepared by his
0:35:28 grace Prince miles Davenport to be a
0:35:31 Fallout fallback point and that is
0:35:34 located right off of New Haven green at
0:35:36 the courthouse beneath it there is a
0:35:38 bomb shelter that non-combatant Kindred
0:35:43 those who might be hungry wounded Etc
0:35:46 have been instructed to go to in times
0:35:48 just like this as the group of you
0:35:52 arrive it is quiet here there's little
0:35:56 activity no light lights side from the
0:35:58 red star that shines overhead and the
0:36:02 police lights of the various positions
0:36:06 that uh New Haven PD has taken up along
0:36:10 the street around the New Haven green
0:36:12 and at various points
0:36:14 intersections where the saat might Ru
0:36:17 through knowing at least vaguely who you
0:36:21 are and aware that you are individuals
0:36:25 welcomed to the courthouse the police do
0:36:27 not
0:36:28 give you a hard time you allowed through
0:36:31 the roadblocks they have in they have
0:36:33 set up and the group of you will walk up
0:36:38 the stone steps to the courthouse you
0:36:42 enter and from there you're ushered down
0:36:46 below where the camar is holding out as
0:36:50 best it can against this Onslaught
0:36:53 greeting you there's a handful of the
0:36:56 asites who are welcome into the domain
0:36:59 some time ago who are very discreetly
0:37:03 watching access points and doing their
0:37:06 part to make sure that it isn't
0:37:08 infiltrated by assassins sent by the
0:37:10 sabat I give them a nod and be inform
0:37:14 them that I need to be quarantined for
0:37:16 now as the rest of my C Coterie goes
0:37:19 inside well miles I don't know what to
0:37:21 do either I I don't think I have enough
0:37:24 blood to wake up I'm don't even know if
0:37:26 I should be here before she goes in one
0:37:29 of the birds that is Win will do a
0:37:33 circle above the location and kind of
0:37:36 get an idea of anything nearby anything
0:37:39 that might be encroaching looking out
0:37:42 there are fires and city lights are out
0:37:49 you can hear distant screams and because
0:37:52 you have the ability to see into the
0:37:55 underworld you can see a roaring
0:37:58 Maelstrom swallowing up the underworld
0:38:01 as far out as the eye can see that
0:38:04 across the Realms it's as though law
0:38:09 whether it is the law of a civilization
0:38:12 the law of physics the rules of reality
0:38:16 all of it is crumbling to dust before
0:38:19 your very eyes
0:38:22 pandemonium is has become the rule of
0:38:26 the land
0:38:27 taking a minute to just take that in
0:38:30 when will fly back down and through the
0:38:34 door and as the Coterie is ushered in the
0:38:39 three birds will gather together and
0:38:42 wind will reform as her humanoid self
0:38:46 you okay as okay as we can be
0:38:50 considering are you no no I'm not okay I
0:38:54 need blood okay we'll get you some
0:38:57 Johnny looks around um at the reception
0:39:00 in the headquarters uh does he see Aisha
0:39:03 anywhere yes she's uh kind of on this um
0:39:07 I don't to say like bureaucratic she's
0:39:09 basically performing uh a bit of an
0:39:11 organization Rule and it seems that she
0:39:15 is very very flustered and has been
0:39:18 having some disagreements with uh the
0:39:22 local Court when she sees you there's a
0:39:26 bit of a sigh of belief and she
0:39:28 approaches and lowers her head just a
0:39:31 little bit respectfully towards Johnny
0:39:33 and says um I apologize for any conflict
0:39:40 that I have caused among the court of
0:39:43 New Haven it is not my intention but
0:39:46 there are some things even in the face
0:39:49 of this this chaos perhaps even
0:39:54 especially in the face of this chaos
0:39:58 uh I cannot bend on and I believe I may
0:40:02 have uh
0:40:04 upset the citizens of this Fair domain
0:40:08 I'm going to need to know more about
0:40:10 what you're talking about and I will be
0:40:12 at your full disposal but before that my
0:40:15 Cod needs a little bit of assistance we
0:40:18 came we just came from some pretty rough
0:40:21 encounters with sabat how can we help I
0:40:24 need I need blood for all of us and
0:40:29 something happened to miles that I have
0:40:31 it's beyond me clearly having heard this
0:40:35 uh you notice that uh one of the Kindred
0:40:37 that Aisha was having some trouble with
0:40:40 a Vicki Summers of the toror the one who
0:40:42 painted the soul painting of Miles
0:40:44 previously gives this mirthful smile and
0:40:48 [ __ ] laughs when she hears this and
0:40:53 says oh Aisha you're going to have to
0:40:55 tell them there's no blood to be have
0:40:56 here had ear isn't there there's nothing
0:41:00 nothing because you turned it away and
0:41:03 Aisha looks flustered and embarrassed
0:41:07 and says to you uh it is
0:41:12 true uh a one of the nosu I haven't met
0:41:18 him it seems he was gone for a time uh
0:41:21 and Mr
0:41:22 Fester uh you perks up arrived with um
0:41:28 a U-Haul truck meant to supply the
0:41:32 Kindred but he did so in a in a frankly
0:41:36 detestable way and I refused his
0:41:41 admittance uh I'm I'm very sorry can you
0:41:45 expand on that what did you do that was
0:41:48 detestable as Mr Fester decid it Vicki
0:41:52 walks over the NOS Fatu Fester went
0:41:54 about New Haven and collected people
0:41:56 tied them up put back BS over the head
0:41:57 so that we wouldn't have to look them in
0:41:59 the face and feel bad about anything but
0:42:00 collected them so that we can feed
0:42:02 ourselves survive and maybe make it out
0:42:06 of this intact but because of the laws
0:42:11 of hakeim and weird assamite drama wi
0:42:15 grabs her by the face she squeals you're
0:42:18 going to wait your turn to talk this is
0:42:20 a conversation between the senal and his
0:42:22 atache and she pushes her away by the
0:42:24 face I do not have the patience for
0:42:27 pettiness right now she kind of turns
0:42:29 and storms off Johnny gives Wynn a look
0:42:33 and then kind of just gives her a very
0:42:35 subtle nod and then looks back to Asia
0:42:39 what she says is true yeah but she
0:42:41 didn't have to be a [ __ ] about it if
0:42:44 feasting upon
0:42:46 hostages is our only means of
0:42:49 survival I do not feel we should survive
0:42:53 she says very
0:42:54 apologetically I think I would have made
0:42:56 a different call but I think I'm
0:43:00 glad I hired you as my second he gives
0:43:05 her a hard look but puts a hand on her
0:43:08 shoulder thank you for making the right
0:43:10 call that I might not have there is the
0:43:13 slightest kind of like winse as you
0:43:17 reach out to touch her but she doesn't
0:43:19 like make a show of it if that makes
0:43:22 sense it's just something you pick up
0:43:24 about her body language he pulls his
0:43:27 hand back after he notices that she kind
0:43:29 of winces at that he just give he fixes
0:43:32 her with a look that is
0:43:37 thankful I still need some kind of blood
0:43:42 for Brea she is about to snap seems like
0:43:47 there's plenty of Toreador blood do we
0:43:49 not have any Mortals some of the asites
0:43:52 that are present they don't like say
0:43:53 anything but when you're like H we can
0:43:55 eat that [ __ ] douchy vampire
0:43:57 they the like the Warriors that are
0:43:59 watching the entrance just kind of give
0:44:00 each other a look we're definitely not
0:44:04 offering up other vampires as blood
0:44:07 unless somebody offers it
0:44:11 themselves I am not sending orders
0:44:14 out we're still holding together Johnny
0:44:18 at this point I I don't I don't even
0:44:21 know if I could wake up I'm wounded and
0:44:23 I'm starving F there is someone outside
0:44:27 if how recently was he here Aisha 10
0:44:30 minutes ago 10 minutes ago when do you
0:44:32 think you and Neil can find him uh maybe
0:44:35 I was going to suggest that we try since
0:44:37 we've walked in Neil has been also
0:44:40 looking around uh he looks beat to [ __ ]
0:44:42 and also hungry but he's been looking
0:44:44 around for any other familiar faces that
0:44:48 are here at like fallback HQ so I mean a
0:44:52 lot of the people that are here are the
0:44:54 people that were always kind of of the
0:44:57 passive audience in the past these are
0:44:59 the these are the Kindred that was show
0:45:01 up to Le because they wanted to see
0:45:02 drama not because they were particularly
0:45:04 relevant focal point of it none of the
0:45:06 other primagen council is here um right
0:45:09 none of the Mover and shakers are
0:45:11 present no Nara or no Peter no Nara no
0:45:15 Peter at Johnny's suggestion Neil looks
0:45:18 at win uh and just sort of nods his head
0:45:21 yeah I'll we can step back outside and
0:45:23 I'll do you need a piggyback ride no no
0:45:26 um I just I'll look for him we'll find
0:45:29 him I'll try calling him if he'll take
0:45:31 us if he well [ __ ] don't work do you
0:45:34 want to try sending a walkie message
0:45:37 truck I might all right let's try that
0:45:39 worse comes to worse and he's sort of
0:45:41 like worse comes to worse I'll summon
0:45:43 him yeah we worse comes to worse I'll
0:45:45 make sure you get fed but try and be
0:45:47 quick about it let's go uh take take
0:45:50 only what we need release the rest yeah
0:45:54 Asia more important than blood the
0:45:57 prince has been stricken with some kind
0:45:59 of plague I I don't even know how that's
0:46:03 possible do you have any healers amongst
0:46:06 your band or someone that might have
0:46:08 insight into that what can you tell me
0:46:11 what he was stricking with it's the
0:46:12 bonic plague I know that sounds dumb but
0:46:15 it is that that doesn't sound dumb if it
0:46:19 is if he is been Afflicted with a virus
0:46:22 disease or what have you there is one
0:46:27 one of my clan that I believe would be
0:46:30 able to assist through a a an old magic
0:46:36 referred to as the Covenant of
0:46:37 naral he can be healed of his
0:46:41 Affliction I I will attempt to find the
0:46:46 woman capable and lastly I have weathers
0:46:50 with me he's been put into torper do you
0:46:54 have any means aside from a Elder's
0:46:58 blood to wake someone from torper yes
0:47:01 but I do not have a means of ensuring he
0:47:06 doesn't go into a
0:47:08 rampage if he's
0:47:10 hungry we don't have Solutions at the
0:47:14 moment Johnny kind of frowns knowing
0:47:18 that weathers was fighting someone that
0:47:20 probably could have extracted all of the
0:47:22 blood from weathers and that mo more
0:47:24 than likely waking him up might send him
0:47:26 into blood frenzy well until we get some
0:47:29 better idea of how much blood we can get
0:47:31 from Fester we'll just keep him safe for
0:47:34 the time being of course when Aisha
0:47:38 mentions the Covenant of Nal and as
0:47:41 Johnny's talking about basically what
0:47:43 would be the path of life's water Neil
0:47:46 as he and winter are just about to leave
0:47:48 uh to go find Fester looks at her and
0:47:50 goes where is Nara where's the last
0:47:53 place you saw her I am told
0:47:57 that there is um someone that she was
0:48:01 looking for a bit of business business
0:48:06 with do do you know anything else she
0:48:09 kind of gives you this look like she's
0:48:11 not sure she's not sure if your
0:48:15 cery might take offense to the topics
0:48:20 she might bring up as she explains it's
0:48:23 a very subtle like Neil Neil nods his
0:48:26 head he has tons of perception and
0:48:27 empathy uh and uh goes um maybe after we
0:48:33 talk to Fester which is the most
0:48:35 immediate pressing concern uh Aisha with
0:48:38 the sena's permission maybe you and I
0:48:40 could have a
0:48:42 conversation yes well we could summon
0:48:44 her too if we need to that might be
0:48:47 depending on what she's doing that might
0:48:49 not be advisable BR do you want to come
0:48:52 with us so that you're right with us
0:48:53 when we find Fester probably best all
0:48:56 right then come with us um I'll talk to
0:48:59 fester and you maybe keep R from seeing
0:49:03 what's in the back of the truck before
0:49:04 we can do things carefully mhm I'm going
0:49:07 to stay here with make sure miles is
0:49:09 good I'm going to get more updated on
0:49:11 the situation you'll come back quickly
0:49:13 okay do our best man if we're not back
0:49:16 in 5 to 10 then then stay safe and Neil
0:49:20 nods to win and R and heads back out the
0:49:23 door Wynn weirdly lingers a minute looking
0:49:27 at Miles like she needs to be able to do
0:49:30 something about this and can't I'm
0:49:32 probably not in the HQ at all like
0:49:35 because I've been told that I am
0:49:38 possibly virent so I'm probably in some
0:49:39 sort of courtroom that is abandoned
0:49:41 upstairs or something like that it is
0:49:43 more likely they brought you to like a
0:49:45 space that they've arranged as a holding
0:49:47 cell okay because unfortunately while
0:49:50 they need to keep you away from the
0:49:52 community at large you're also the
0:49:54 prince which means if they leave you
0:49:57 exposed that risks a different disaster
0:50:00 okay so I'm off to the side essentially
0:50:02 right got it then she kind of looks at
0:50:04 him through maybe like the pane of glass
0:50:07 in the door that separates them and just
0:50:10 kind of lingers for a minute and then
0:50:13 makes her way outside you got to look at
0:50:15 him through like the the small window
0:50:18 like too small for an arm that's got
0:50:20 like the metal mesh in glass window it's
0:50:24 got the same feelings as like those
0:50:27 older like middle schools where the
0:50:29 walls are brick the windows are small if
0:50:32 they exist at all in this case not not
0:50:34 really existing very much at all and the
0:50:36 big heavy steel doors that separate uh
0:50:39 the various rooms it's it's very much
0:50:42 that feeling I'm so hungry and Ne Neil I
0:50:46 don't know if this makes me a bad person
0:50:48 but but if I don't feed to heal as well
0:50:52 then I'm just going to be hungrier later
0:50:54 and I'm also um not working at my
0:50:57 best we'll talk to Fester
0:51:02 maybe and as they're talking like that
0:51:06 that lowered Humanity in Neil kind of
0:51:08 crystallizes a little bit maybe we just
0:51:11 take a little bit from everyone and then
0:51:13 send them on their way it's selfish I
0:51:16 know there's others that are hungry but
0:51:20 between the three of us he sort of nods
0:51:23 back over shoulder towards where wind
0:51:24 had been lingering and is now catching
0:51:26 up we can do a little bit and
0:51:29 then I mean so long as these people
0:51:32 aren't
0:51:35 unconscious yeah they might not survive
0:51:38 the night but we don't have to be the
0:51:39 people to kill them what's the plan are
0:51:41 you looking for them first am I looking
0:51:43 for them first or are we looking at the
0:51:45 same time I don't think we should split
0:51:47 up no no I'm just talking about right
0:51:49 here I don't think Neil and I need to go
0:51:52 far to start our searching I don't need
0:51:54 to the only complication is that Fester
0:51:58 last I heard was terrified of me and
0:52:01 didn't want to see me so I can find him
0:52:07 but maybe I mean I've got a bullhorn if
0:52:10 you just want to yell for him that'll
0:52:12 draw attention from everything else yeah
0:52:14 I think we should probably narrow our
0:52:16 focus and BR I can go talk to
0:52:21 him yeah this but but finding him is
0:52:25 step one BR just summon him then if he's
0:52:27 just driving around it's not as
0:52:29 dangerous as summoning someone who we
0:52:33 don't know their situation so if you can
0:52:37 he'll hate you for it but that might
0:52:41 just be a consequence of the time well
0:52:43 he's the one who wanted to get me
0:52:44 bloodbound to uptin Rolland right that's
0:52:48 what the paperwork said it was his
0:52:50 suggestion call it even I guess try to
0:52:54 summon him never mind I can't summon sh
0:52:56 I don't have a blood Point BR focuses
0:53:00 for a moment and then realizes and the
0:53:03 frustration boils
0:53:05 over I I I can't do it it takes blood I
0:53:09 it's okay it's okay it's okay we'll
0:53:11 we'll do we'll do it the other way we'll
0:53:12 do it just to um that's okay thank you
0:53:16 for trying uh well we'll we'll we'll
0:53:18 we'll do it the other way so Neil pulls
0:53:20 out a ribbon lights the end of it on
0:53:23 fire and starts chanting under his
0:53:25 breath cuz I know he was just here okay
0:53:28 and I will start following An Invisible
0:53:32 Thread to where Fester is go ahead and
0:53:34 give me a ritual role I'm going to be
0:53:36 doing this but that means I'm going to
0:53:37 be focused here so just make sure
0:53:38 somebody just like snatches me into the
0:53:40 sewers or kills me from the sky do my
0:53:42 best just a day that ends in y I guess a
0:53:46 nine di pool for
0:53:48 this two fives okay uh but that succeeds
0:53:53 and you follow the trail normally this
0:53:56 would dissipate if you hit any byus
0:53:59 water there's some complications oh yeah
0:54:01 to the method you using however it
0:54:03 literally just leads outside and a bit
0:54:06 down the road towards where there are
0:54:07 some squad cars right over there there's
0:54:10 this innocuous U-Haul truck that's just
0:54:14 kind of parked up on the curb and out of
0:54:16 the way after not that long Neil just
0:54:20 looks up and goes oh yeah he's over
0:54:23 there um or at least well no it's him
0:54:25 not just truck he's in that truck it's
0:54:27 it's that one over there when did did
0:54:30 you ever really interact with Fester do
0:54:32 you have much of a relationship with
0:54:33 Fester I know him if I see him at a lum
0:54:37 okay well I'm the sheriff he probably
0:54:40 knows me he knows he definitely knows
0:54:42 you okay then I'm going to if he's
0:54:44 afraid of you I'm going to go and smooth
0:54:47 things over first I have
0:54:50 to okay I'm going to tell him that
0:54:53 you're there and that you don't want to
0:54:55 hurt him okay May don't just lead with
0:54:57 don't want to hurt him maybe
0:54:59 just I never got a chance to say I'm
0:55:01 sorry and just let him know we're here
0:55:04 and I'm glad he's okay I'll do my best
0:55:07 Neil does not linger in Obfuscate but
0:55:11 does stay in a visible spot in the
0:55:13 street when jogs up to the uh U-Haul how
0:55:17 close are the squad cars to the U-Haul
0:55:19 like 20 ft okay are they do they look
0:55:22 like they are involved with the U-haul
0:55:25 no they're just kind of of hanging out
0:55:27 exchanging like kind of really toxic War
0:55:30 Stories great so she will jog up trying
0:55:33 to be fairly innocuous presumably pulls
0:55:36 her Hood up before with your appearance
0:55:38 rating two okay yeah they ignore you
0:55:41 you're fine she will kind of stand
0:55:43 outside the U-Haul and wave at the
0:55:44 driver's side window Neil you get a
0:55:48 really bad
0:55:50 feeling like sending win may have been a
0:55:54 mistake as soon that feeling hits win
0:55:58 win wait she will run back abort Mission
0:56:02 jog back hold on wait wait wait wait
0:56:05 what's wrong I don't know I don't know I
0:56:08 don't know I don't have a better
0:56:09 explanation I
0:56:13 just do you ever just get feelings
0:56:16 premonitions just just just Neil I'm
0:56:18 going to need something way more
0:56:20 specific eat
0:56:22 faster I'm what's going I don't know I
0:56:25 don't know I'm going to go I'm going to
0:56:26 do it I'm going to I need you not to go
0:56:28 I need you to I got it let me let me do
0:56:31 this okay but you have to trust that
0:56:32 instinct if it's you too mm I'll if you
0:56:35 lose track of me that means I'm running
0:56:39 away okay okay I promise I just I don't
0:56:41 know I don't know I Neil looks really
0:56:45 nervous like not in the same way like
0:56:48 very similar energy to when he's like
0:56:50 transed out in the past but he's still
0:56:53 very much in the moment she will kind of
0:56:54 grab his hands I'm here here I'm good
0:56:57 all right I got I got I got to hold on
0:56:59 give me a second unless Neil will tag
0:57:02 out and start walking forward but he's
0:57:06 also like he's going to try and feel if
0:57:09 this is also giving him that same bad
0:57:11 idea with the knowledge that he's
0:57:15 extremely paranoid right now so he could
0:57:17 be getting a million false positives
0:57:19 which are just blanking out any sense of
0:57:23 rationality or danger as you head over
0:57:25 to the U-Haul the the front door of it
0:57:27 actually opens and climbing out kind of
0:57:32 dressed in these very nice like bright
0:57:37 shoes with kind of like raised
0:57:40 heels and like a very nice pair of like
0:57:45 tight acid washed like designer jeans
0:57:49 and this just very kind of honestly put
0:57:52 very well put together outfit Fest her
0:57:54 hops out and
0:57:56 has his chin up kind of defiantly but
0:58:00 you can see very clearly that there is
0:58:03 something that has Fester mortified In
0:58:06 This
0:58:07 Moment hey uh hey buddy are
0:58:13 you is everything
0:58:15 okay it looks like Fester starts to talk
0:58:19 and you realize that there's no sound
0:58:22 that comes from him Neil's eyes
0:58:24 immediately go wide and panicky and sort
0:58:27 of tipping his head out the open U-Haul
0:58:33 door is a man you know
0:58:36 well and he
0:58:40 says because of your unfounded sense of
0:58:47 Mercy this get of
0:58:51 Cen has prayed upon Mortals again
0:58:56 because of your
0:58:58 hesitation because of your unwillingness
0:59:01 to kill what must
0:59:04 die you must fix
0:59:08 this how much attention are you guys uh
0:59:11 paying to this [ __ ] riveted okay so
0:59:16 what you
0:59:17 hear is Fester
0:59:21 say Neil I just don't know why you
0:59:23 turned on me like that we were supposed
0:59:26 to be
0:59:28 friends and and then you tried to kill
0:59:31 me and every chance you get you try to
0:59:33 kill me why are you doing this and you
0:59:35 just kind of see Neil's head tilt to the
0:59:39 side when he hears that and then Neil
0:59:43 says everything I just said to Neil as
