0:00:29 [Music]
0:00:36 last time on path of night justic car
0:00:39 luin summoned archon Wynn to her base of
0:00:42 operations they planed to take out a
0:00:44 dangerous harbinger of
0:00:46 skulls the rest of the Cordy crashed
0:00:48 into the war party of that very same
0:00:50 Harbinger later Neil wished when was
0:00:53 there and mysteriously when and her
0:00:55 support appeared granting His
0:00:57 Wish reunited the Cy took out steak and
0:01:01 bake and the rest of the saat
0:01:03 presence the Cy sought to heal
0:01:06 especially miles who had been stricken
0:01:08 with a strange
0:01:10 [Music]
0:01:25 illness for a
0:01:26 moment the Carnage has settled
0:01:31 what gunshots you still hear are distant
0:01:35 and an
0:01:36 echo traffic is
0:01:38 stopped the lights are out almost all of
0:01:41 the light that provides any illumination
0:01:46 at all comes from the red star that
0:01:48 hangs low over the
0:01:51 sky around you most of what you fought
0:01:56 is very
0:01:57 dead there are a couple of TW cor
0:02:00 canites that remain and a pair of
0:02:03 archons that approach with bewildered
0:02:08 Expressions Red Death speaks up to
0:02:10 archon cabit how the hell did we get
0:02:13 here I I have no [ __ ] glue does your
0:02:17 head hurt yeah yeah mine too when kind
0:02:21 of looks around at the
0:02:24 scene okay so
0:02:26 it still looks like we got the job done
0:02:30 checking with the rest of the team I'm
0:02:32 going to check in with the
0:02:33 Coterie what she kind of sees miles and
0:02:37 it looks like she wants to go to him and
0:02:41 she sees how awful and sick and how
0:02:46 distressed his body seems even if he's
0:02:49 not wearing it on its face do we have
0:02:51 intelligence that this is something the
0:02:54 harbingers can do we don't know a lot
0:02:57 about what the harbingers can do only
0:02:59 that
0:03:00 according
0:03:01 to what we do have they vampires who are
0:03:05 locked away for a long long time and
0:03:08 another he like waves his hands time
0:03:11 another uh like Realm and when they came
0:03:14 back they brought a lot of strange
0:03:16 forgotten Magics with them do we have a
0:03:20 way to reverse this reverse disease I'll
0:03:25 make some calls I mean these they come
0:03:28 from the underworld but I'll see what I
0:03:30 can find I'm going to head back to check
0:03:32 in I we'll be in touch yeah I suspect
0:03:37 she'll call me yeah she will the two of
0:03:41 them hop back in the car that they
0:03:42 arrived in and they take off back to the
0:03:45 school where uh the archons are
0:03:48 operating out of um
0:03:52 yeah when kind of looks like she's still
0:03:54 getting her
0:03:56 bearings and she looks to the rest of
0:03:58 the Coterie
0:04:00 and she sees Neil approaching the group
0:04:05 looking particularly [ __ ] up having
0:04:07 been on fire and looking like he's been
0:04:10 in a car accident and she goes up to him
0:04:13 and looks like she wants to give him a
0:04:15 hug and isn't sure if that's going to
0:04:17 hurt him or not she doesn't get a choice
0:04:19 in the matter okay and he hugs her
0:04:21 immediately as soon as she's within Arms
0:04:23 Reach okay then she will Wynn hug him back
0:04:26 he she can feel him Flinch he's
0:04:29 absolutely pain he's [ __ ] up but it
0:04:33 it's like it doesn't matter you're
0:04:36 you're here I I I wanted you to be here
0:04:39 I I didn't want you apart from us and
0:04:41 I'm so glad you're here I I don't know
0:04:43 how it I don't know how either buddy um
0:04:48 we were arming up we were actually going
0:04:50 after the The Harbinger the and then all
0:04:54 of a sudden we were in a car here and I
0:04:55 saw you guys
0:04:57 flip and my head is killing me Neil like
0:05:01 his face against her like shoulder like
0:05:03 he's hunched down when can probably feel
0:05:06 him frown and like his brow Furrow and
0:05:09 Neil just goes BR asked if you if we
0:05:13 were
0:05:14 ready the the war flipped the truck and
0:05:18 then BR asked she had a plan and and and
0:05:21 then asked if we were ready to go and I
0:05:22 was so nervous I wasn't ready and I
0:05:25 didn't want you I just said I wish wi
0:05:27 was here and here you are
0:05:31 when kind of shakes her head like she
0:05:32 doesn't isn't going to pretend to
0:05:35 understand any of this final night's
0:05:37 [ __ ] wait so you telling me Luc sind
0:05:39 didn't send you here no she kind of
0:05:42 pulls back from the hug with Neil and
0:05:45 kind of grabs onto Johnny's shoulder are
0:05:47 you okay are are you are you I I have a
0:05:51 headache but no but sorry are are you
0:05:55 are you fully bound to her I
0:05:57 left she hadn't
0:06:00 called me to her today and I hadn't gone
0:06:04 looking for her
0:06:06 today um so I no
0:06:09 I'm I'm not all hers yet Johnny kind of
0:06:12 squeezes you on the shoulder back well
0:06:14 I'm glad you're here with us now um all
0:06:18 right everybody we're still in a really
0:06:20 bad spot so Marshall up what you can for
0:06:23 resources Let's uh let's get moving to
0:06:25 somewhere a little bit safer we need to
0:06:28 find weathers and and make sure we can
0:06:30 get a a good briefing on what this area
0:06:33 is going through so like I said Marshall
0:06:35 everything up you can and let's let's
0:06:37 start looking for him all right can we
0:06:38 look for a blood on the way we're pretty
0:06:41 wounded that's what I mean by Marshall
0:06:42 things up all right miles miles is taken
0:06:46 a knee Somewhere Over By a dog and also
0:06:49 sort of supporting himself on the sword
0:06:51 and is not looking particularly good
0:06:55 when kind of breaks out of the hug
0:06:57 Circle and goes over to him she doesn't
0:07:01 look like she knows whether she should
0:07:03 get close or not but the instinct is
0:07:05 right
0:07:06 there do you feel okay no not at all she
0:07:12 hit me with I may have been poetic but
0:07:15 she said something about Mercy or
0:07:16 something I feel uh in some ways More
0:07:20 Alive than I have in a long time but in
0:07:22 the worst way possible like you're sick
0:07:25 sick very sick correct sick could I roll
0:07:29 some science to see what's going on with
0:07:31 him I would be medicine all right I can
0:07:33 roll one
0:07:36 medicine two successes with two
0:07:39 successes he looks to be showing signs
0:07:43 of an advanced case of the Bubonic
0:07:47 plague he is extremely virulent he is in
0:07:51 a very very bad condition but what is
0:07:53 odd about it is he is clearly
0:07:56 experiencing a sickness that the kind
0:07:59 State Should render someone immune
0:08:02 to um all right I I think I understand
0:08:06 what's happening it's not good miles you
0:08:10 you can't be near people you are really
0:08:12 infectious and when I say people I mean
0:08:15 Kindred too um somehow you I I I know I
0:08:20 know I just recognize it from textbooks
0:08:22 but that those are the symptoms of the
0:08:25 bonic plague and you look like you're
0:08:27 having it for real the what [ __ ] hell
0:08:30 how's that even possible I don't know
0:08:32 but um somehow look I don't know why I
0:08:36 remember things about science or
0:08:37 medicine but that's that's what that is
0:08:40 I mean you can recognize the near the
0:08:42 lymph notes I'm going to guess magic is
0:08:44 the answer the harbingers brought back a
0:08:46 whole kind of magic that's been
0:08:49 forgotten I I know that there are Paths
0:08:52 of duranki that can inflict um the
0:08:55 symptoms at least of disease but on even
0:08:58 Kindred but I haven't seen seen do you
0:09:01 feel weak or do you just feel I mean I
0:09:02 don't feel good but I can keep going it
0:09:05 seems capable of affecting you like it
0:09:08 would affect a mortal so does that mean
0:09:10 that this can kill him and other people
0:09:13 including Kindred Johnny takes a step
0:09:15 back reflexively I don't I don't mean to
0:09:18 be negative it's just that that's that's
0:09:20 what I'm assessing here I'm sorry miles
0:09:22 I don't mean to talk about you like a
0:09:23 test subject it's perfectly okay I am
0:09:26 have been tested upon Neil you said that
0:09:28 there was magic that could inflict it is
0:09:30 there magic that can remove it not that
0:09:31 I know of but I'm not an expert we could
0:09:34 we could reach out to some of the
0:09:36 Sorcerers of the children of hem here in
0:09:37 the city they might know more than we do
0:09:40 why don't you reach out to them black
0:09:43 Alister and red death are looking into
0:09:46 the
0:09:47 archon I don't know [ __ ] files
0:09:50 whatever I'm going to call lend okay how
0:09:54 about this you say not well you know
0:09:58 with miles
0:10:00 Neil you make that phone call Johnny as
0:10:03 we're moving you and I we use our Arts
0:10:06 of the blood to see if we can get any
0:10:08 Mortals over that seem okay enough to
0:10:11 feed on Johnny kind of looks around the
0:10:13 streets and the devastation that's
0:10:15 probably caused all Mortals to scatter I
0:10:17 mean as we're going sure um it might be
0:10:22 worth noting the her
0:10:25 power um mentioned that
0:10:30 the
0:10:30 Mal um of the sabat are doing something
0:10:35 to the Mortal populace yeah they're
0:10:37 probably using the voice of Madness uh
0:10:41 speaking I'll Neil looks around like
0:10:44 stops mid-sentence again and Lex Neil
0:10:46 looks around the street is there a like
0:10:49 either a cop car ambulance or like a
0:10:52 pharmacy nearby there is a pharmacy with
0:10:56 smashed in Windows and there is a a
0:10:59 squad car that is parked the front doors
0:11:02 of it are open there are no sign of
0:11:05 police actually hold that thought Ju
0:11:08 Just for a second what you need to fit a
0:11:10 [ __ ]
0:11:12 um I'm going to steal police bullhorn uh
0:11:14 but I was also going to go get uh for
0:11:16 the in the meantime until we can figure
0:11:18 out what to do about miles um I know
0:11:20 this sounds really stupid maybe but if
0:11:22 we get some face masks and gloves for
0:11:25 him so that just reducing the chance is
0:11:29 going to spread Neil I like the idea I
0:11:31 would like to build on it what if we
0:11:33 take the whole cop car uh what is it
0:11:38 working there's lights on if we can take
0:11:40 the whole cop car maybe we can get
0:11:42 around the city a little easier cuz
0:11:43 people will get out of the way of it and
0:11:46 maybe we can put miles in the back and
0:11:48 kind of isolate him a little bit and
0:11:50 still have him with us that would only
0:11:51 be room for two of us in the front seat
0:11:53 even better let's build on that some
0:11:54 more how about you just grab a whole
0:11:56 bunch of like drugs whatever you find in
0:11:59 that Pharmacy and make him take him cuz
0:12:01 I don't I don't think drugs will kill a
0:12:03 vampire but maybe it'll kill whatever
0:12:05 this [ __ ] Bubonic plague [ __ ] is okay
0:12:07 we should take specific drugs why not
0:12:10 okay okay here I'm gonna go to BR you
0:12:13 seem to know you recognize what it was
0:12:15 do you want to go look in the pharmacy
0:12:16 and see if anything this might be a
0:12:18 stupid idea but none of us know what
0:12:20 we're doing so let try it do you want to
0:12:22 go grab whatever you think might work on
0:12:23 the pl is plague a virus or bacteria I
0:12:26 don't even know I I don't know medicine
0:12:29 I mean I can try we can see if there's
0:12:31 um serious antibiotics well so here's
0:12:34 the day like this the way that you
0:12:37 generally have to take drugs outside of
0:12:39 khif which is blood-based is you have to
0:12:41 take it through blood that's the only
0:12:42 way that we can take it so I don't know
0:12:43 if there's but while you're doing that
0:12:45 to that point we were talking about the
0:12:46 mavian and what the mavian antire were
0:12:48 doing uh they are probably going around
0:12:50 the city using the voice of Madness
0:12:52 which is Amplified through things so I'm
0:12:53 going to steal a bullhorn from the
0:12:55 police so okay so that we have it too
0:12:59 all right go steal the bullhorn you're
0:13:01 saying that like that's a revelation
0:13:02 this is the least weird thing to happen
0:13:04 tonight go get a bullhorn and watch my
0:13:06 back home in there yeah okay Neil looks
0:13:08 a little cowed at Johnny and then being
0:13:10 given a task by brda is like okay and if
0:13:13 you see any musicians let's [ __ ] Give
0:13:15 Them Enough penicillin to kill him let's
0:13:17 not shout that around as that is shouted
0:13:21 around a distressed pigeon lands on the
0:13:27 squad car that Neil is a approaching and
0:13:30 the pigeon makes nervous noises and
0:13:34 shifts and is unsteady on its feet uh
0:13:39 when is this the pigeon I threw crackers
0:13:42 to no when wanders over to the squad car
0:13:47 with Neil and the pigeon can I help you
0:13:50 it is it is Kabir hi hi you shouldn't be
0:13:55 here what's going on I am in the body of
0:13:58 a pige

0:14:30 withstand the torture I cannot you have
0:14:33 to get me I will come get you okay the
0:14:38 pigeon flies
0:14:42 off Lex before we get into other
0:14:45 conversations that are is very heavy
0:14:49 um uh I need to solve nine points of
0:14:54 blood on my sheet uh how close am I able
0:14:56 to solving that and what are the what
0:14:58 are the consequences of doing doing so
0:14:59 that depends on what you're willing to
0:15:01 do to the torped saat vampires on the
0:15:03 ground if I'm willing to drain them and
0:15:04 kill them can I solve that nine blood
0:15:07 there is a total of 12 Blood on the
0:15:10 ground between those sabat vampires you
0:15:13 and miles will need to work out who's
0:15:15 taking what miles how much do you need
0:15:17 not a lot but availability becomes a
0:15:19 problem for me Kindred or so how what's
0:15:22 not a lot I'm down
0:15:24 seven seven of what 20
0:15:30 yeah okay so uh yeah I I understand uh
0:15:34 Lex related I will be spending five as
0:15:38 we're walking around to heal my body
0:15:41 from incap bashing understood how much
0:15:44 blood do you need to spend to resolve
0:15:46 the four levels of bashing it's one
0:15:49 blood per thank you so then I'm going to
0:15:52 spend that four all right who needs what
0:15:54 how much blood do we all need a lot
0:15:56 right I am at half pool five out of 10
0:15:59 okay for now I am at quarter pool I have
0:16:02 four blood remaining I have three blood
0:16:04 remaining yeah we're all in a bad spot
0:16:06 okay so uh how many do you have
0:16:08 remaining I have five how many do you
0:16:10 have remaining I have oh no I'm sorry I
0:16:12 have four because I had to spend one to
0:16:14 do magic I have three remaining how many
0:16:16 do you have remaining 13 however buddy
0:16:18 you're not getting any blows I'm sorry
0:16:19 to say but I saw the my numbers coming
0:16:22 and I I will I will move away from the
0:16:25 body so people can feed I'm blood poor
0:16:28 PO with my 20 blood pool I've spent so
0:16:32 much of it look you guys are used
0:16:34 [ __ ] Rich y you guys are used to
0:16:36 being poor get away oh
0:16:40 God all right I'm suddenly less worried
0:16:42 about plaguey MC plager s over here that
0:16:46 worked out pretty well I'm assuming that
0:16:48 if we were taking this 12 blood we're
0:16:49 probably making Humanity chops
0:16:53 right that depends on whether or not you
0:16:55 then kill them because they can go to
0:16:56 zero blood and not die but your blood
0:16:59 bound to
0:17:01 them um of the of the the saat that we
0:17:05 are draining from what
0:17:07 uh is that including the harbinger
0:17:10 Harbinger is [ __ ] dead The Harbinger
0:17:13 does not have any blood that is
0:17:14 available okay okay okay okay so so
0:17:16 we're talking about ad dog SE dog Rufio
0:17:18 possibly Rufio also dead and then random
0:17:22 ass saot it looks like it's the zami and
0:17:26 AD dog so let me know if you feed from
0:17:28 the Zi BR would be unwilling to feed
0:17:30 from the SEI she could just not feed if
0:17:32 you really want the blood I'm probably
0:17:35 all set I BR is very hungry but you go
0:17:38 through blood a whole lot faster than
0:17:40 she does so I probably have some
0:17:43 resources I can draw on so take what you
0:17:46 guys need Lex as part of this
0:17:48 conversation I have written on my sheet
0:17:49 two blood coins but I can't remember
0:17:52 when I had those from so you let me know
0:17:54 whether I have them or not yeah you have
0:17:56 them it's fine okay then I will eat two
0:17:58 blood coins and that will be the
0:18:00 remainder of my blood coins including
0:18:02 anything I've gotten in the last little
0:18:04 bit I'm going to actually drain uh SE is
0:18:08 it C-Dog ad dog ad dog I'm going to
0:18:10 drain ad dog down to nothing actually
0:18:12 how much blood does he have he has six
0:18:16 I'm going to drain him down to one so in
0:18:19 theory he can wake up without frenzy and
0:18:22 ain't going to touch the zitti br's very
0:18:25 hungry but she is going to rest on the
0:18:27 hope that she can
0:18:29 um use her pow as of presence maybe to
0:18:32 nab someone as we're going how hungry is
0:18:34 very hungry three okay can I get a
0:18:36 selfcontrol r okay your self-control is
0:18:39 capped at your blood
0:18:41 pool fail
0:18:44 BR logically you know exactly what
0:18:48 horror exists within the veins of that
0:18:52 zissi but there is a side of you a
0:18:55 darker side a self-destructive side
0:18:59 that is driven by endless hunger and in
0:19:03 your state and your current condition it
0:19:06 wields great power over you and as you
0:19:11 stare at the zisi recalling all of the
0:19:14 reasons to have such vital for its
0:19:18 existence the Beast takes
0:19:20 hold and you enter a hunger
0:19:23 [Music]
0:19:27 frenzy the rest of the Cy sees Bria
0:19:32 stare at the zitti and there's this
0:19:36 moment where looks like she's going to
0:19:37 turn and say something to you guys but
0:19:39 her eyes fail to leave the vulnerable
0:19:43 vampire and very suddenly she's closing
0:19:47 the distance between herself and the
0:19:49 zamii with a hungry hiss Johnny will uh
0:19:53 drop ad dog and himself feeding to uh
0:19:57 intercept her so that somebody else can
0:20:00 do something worthwhile sounds good why
0:20:03 don't we have a quick initiative roll
0:20:05 yeah I'll roll it and see what happens
0:20:07 uh Neil is frozen I would realistically
0:20:09 go at the end of the round if I go at
0:20:10 all Johnny has a 17
0:20:13 13 16 Johnny Johnny will NAB her up in a
0:20:18 grapple and just pick her up in a bear
0:20:19 hug if I can get behind her for that all
0:20:22 the better I'd rather her not be
0:20:24 snapping to try and feed from
0:20:27 me just three successes grappled Rebecca
0:20:31 I presume my next action is sit to
0:20:32 escape the grapple no use a DEX plus
0:20:36 brawl to reverse the grapple and have
0:20:38 your dice pull because you intend on
0:20:40 feeding from Johnny if you reverse
0:20:41 successfully post yep
0:20:45 understood one
0:20:47 success six successes to maintain BR is
0:20:51 quick and slippery but Johnny is strong
0:20:55 and his big arms are perfectly suited to
0:20:57 the task Johnny maintains his grip we go
0:21:00 to uh miles and Wynn uh seeing Johnny has
0:21:04 it in hand I'm going to just not do
0:21:06 anything okay when uh when we'll get in
0:21:10 ey line with BR and look at her BR we've
0:21:14 got you you don't need to do this we
0:21:16 will find food for you calm down you
0:21:20 will be rolling manipulation plus
0:21:22 empathy your difficulty is
0:21:24 seven you are looking for at least three
0:21:27 successes
0:21:31 well that would be two
0:21:33 successes that is not enough to calm the
0:21:37 Raging Brea Neil are you doing anything
0:21:40 this round it doesn't feel honest to say
0:21:42 yes okay uh we arrive to the next round
0:21:45 BR and Johnny will make a contested
0:21:47 grappling rooll on my action can I help
0:21:49 lock in the grapple uh you can attempt
0:21:52 to clinch for damage but uh essentially
0:21:54 you've got her lock this perfect okay
0:21:56 this is dexterity UNS spens solity and
0:21:58 hold my action then on my action does
0:22:01 graceful count uh no this is you are not
0:22:04 graceful In This Moment yep six
0:22:07 successes uh you break free uh Johnny
0:22:10 you may take your action I will
0:22:12 reestablish the grapple uh it is a
0:22:14 reversal uh SOA will roll her deck plus
0:22:18 ball uh seven uh successes to reverse
0:22:22 the
0:22:24 grapple four
0:22:26 successes I believe that's reversed
0:22:29 when Bri we are not going to let you
0:22:31 hurt yourself by drinking from that
0:22:33 thing calm down get your head back
0:22:39 on one success next round now I'm going
0:22:44 to spent my turn moving around and
0:22:47 trying to get a place where I can see
0:22:49 her eyes okay and if I can do that I
0:22:52 will C uh I will use command on her to
0:22:54 be still sounds good roll it you're at
0:22:58 Plus to difficulty because she is in
0:23:00 frenzy yeah this a stupidly hard check
0:23:02 right now I think yes cuz she has [ __ ]
0:23:04 tons of extra willpower yep what's your
0:23:07 current willpower do we have the
0:23:09 willpower from at last all night
0:23:12 13s better thought and it's plus two
0:23:14 diff right now so that's diff it's still
0:23:17 13 okay so diff 10 you need three
0:23:20 successes y
0:23:25 yeah keep going
0:23:29 proceed okay
0:23:32 uh this is the second round of this
0:23:34 happening right yes okay at the end of
0:23:36 the round Neil seeing everyone
0:23:38 desperately trying to do stuff and hold
0:23:41 a like impossible to hold brda
0:23:44 still just will go okay R just calm down
0:23:50 just just please get a hold of yourself
0:23:54 you know it's not you're not that hungry
0:23:56 you're not that hungry and he starts
0:23:58 like saying that in like a hypnotically
0:24:01 sort of rhythmic tone and Lex I'm just
0:24:03 going to try and pass her down to
0:24:05 support wind basically roll it up BR
0:24:08 what's your Humanity right now all right
0:24:10 I'm rolling Charisma empathy Lex does my
0:24:12 spec in emotions count for this
0:24:15 yes three successes uh as I try and calm
0:24:21 her raging emotions so three successes
0:24:24 it'll last for the night yep and you
0:24:26 manipulate the difficulty of her self
0:24:27 control rules yes so basically for the
0:24:30 rest of the night
0:24:32 you're if we manage to get you into a
0:24:34 self-control role you'll be a little
0:24:35 calmer BR and Johnny uh make contested
0:24:39 grappling rules Johnny uh after having
0:24:42 reestablished the hold on brida is
0:24:45 really trying to just focus on on
0:24:47 keeping her wrists held tight she's
0:24:51 smaller than him and as long as he can
0:24:54 kind of keep her facing away and uh m
0:24:58 main the grip on on on her wrists he
0:25:00 figures that there's not a lot she can
0:25:03 do to to twist around and get to him
0:25:06 Johnny's using his strength in his size
0:25:09 Brett is using her strength in her size
0:25:11 she has almost a similar strategy but
0:25:13 she is uh using her less her
0:25:17 slipperiness the grace that she has to
0:25:20 try to evade that strong
0:25:23 grasp two
0:25:27 successes two two successes as well the
0:25:30 state between the two of you Remains the
0:25:32 Same when FR listen to Neil listen to me
0:25:35 we are going to get you out of this get
0:25:37 your head on straight you are in control
0:25:40 of this you can get yourself back do not
0:25:43 let the Beast tell you what to do I did
0:25:45 spend a willpower on this
0:25:47 one three successes with the willpower
0:25:50 hey BR Quast has allowed you to make a
0:25:53 self-control rule to regain control of
0:25:55 yourself because of the dementation that
0:25:59 has also been used on you the difficulty
0:26:02 of your self-control rules has been
0:26:04 reduced am I permitted to spend a
0:26:06 willpower yes you
0:26:09 may you're going to roll like difficulty
0:26:11 five three successes including the
0:26:13 willpower okay R calms herself the wide
0:26:18 eyes of an
0:26:20 animal go back to something more Humane
0:26:26 at least as Humane as BR remains in this
0:26:28 moment you see control awareness start
0:26:33 to come back to BR in ways that feel
0:26:37 maybe comforting it's no Comfort to BR
0:26:39 though regardless of whatever it does
0:26:41 mean to you br starts at first to
0:26:44 realize with confusion that she's being
0:26:47 held and then why and then she feels the
0:26:52 extension of her fangs and her mouth
0:26:54 that Primal hunger and what she was
0:26:57 directing it towards and and there's
0:26:59 that moment of confusion was she trying
0:27:01 to buy Johnny was she trying to
0:27:05 buy then the memory goes back and it's
0:27:08 the original Target being that samitzi
0:27:10 and you can see the disgust the horror
0:27:13 the fear registering on her face it's
0:27:15 okay you didn't do it you got yourself
0:27:19 back thank thanks for catching me I'm
0:27:21 sorry I you don't need to be sorry these
0:27:24 things happen girl don't you worry about
0:27:26 it it's a night it's it's okay we're
0:27:31 okay you're okay I don't want to do that
0:27:33 again um is there anything left in a dog
0:27:38 didn't leave him with much but I think
0:27:40 he might have a little bit juice left in
0:27:41 him Johnny can you keep hold of me and I
0:27:44 take that one so that this doesn't
0:27:46 happen again maybe all right just uh
0:27:49 just a little bit cuz he's uh he's about
0:27:51 empty just like hold like my jaw he
0:27:56 looks at you skeptic
0:27:59 I don't know however you would do it I
0:28:01 think I trust you more than you trust
0:28:04 yourself you got this it's kind of hard
0:28:07 right now but don't worry I'm not far
0:28:09 off she'll take that remaining blood
0:28:11 from a dog all right while Johnny
0:28:15 escorts BR to a dog when will approach
0:28:19 Neil and pull a wrinkled and battered
0:28:23 piece of paper from her back pocket and
0:28:26 pass it to him you ask asked me to make
0:28:28 a list
0:28:30 oh okay yeah it should also help you
0:28:33 find me yeah he Pats the like messenger
0:28:37 bag he's holding I wasn't I wasn't ever
0:28:41 going to let any of you disappear again
0:28:43 well you're the one we worry about
0:28:45 disappearing Neil he takes the paper
0:28:48 folds it up and doesn't actually put it
0:28:51 in the messenger bag puts it in like the
0:28:52 breast pocket of his shirt right over
0:28:54 where his heart is and goes as long as
0:28:58 as I'm still here I'll help you remember
0:28:59 it
0:29:01 okay counting on
0:29:03 it Rob I'm sending you a the list it is
0:29:08 written on the letter head from the
0:29:10 school where the archons are set up um
0:29:15 okay um BR finishes taking that one
0:29:19 blood and she backs away she turns her
0:29:22 attention towards the
0:29:23 drugstore I'm going to go in and see
0:29:26 what kind of antibiotics or anything
0:29:27 that I can grab someone just keep that
0:29:30 eye out I'll keep an eye out for you
0:29:32 I'll I'll be by the police car looking
0:29:34 for stuff while we're I need to make a
0:29:36 phone call um but I'm here yeah you may
0:29:40 make the call I I'll make a call too and
0:29:41 then we got to get going we got to find
0:29:44 weathers so jod is going to head into
0:29:46 the pharmacy with brda uh with the
0:29:49 intent of pillaging their cigarettes
0:29:52 from behind the counter um cuz this is
0:29:55 uh the late '90s and you got to better
0:29:58 believe that a Pharmacy's going to be
0:30:00 selling cigarettes um and get a few
0:30:03 packs of Morley for the long night ahead
0:30:05 and while doing so is going to use his
0:30:08 new fangled technology of his cell phone
0:30:11 to call weathers to figure out where the
0:30:13 hell he is in
0:30:19 Dixwell as Johnny and BR walk into the
0:30:22 pharmacy Neil is keeping a very paranoid
0:30:25 eye out on the street but runs over to
0:30:26 the police car Lex I'm just looking for
0:30:29 like a like a police walkie-talkie or a
0:30:32 megaphone or something that I can just
0:30:34 use to amplify my voice in the there's a
0:30:36 walkie-talkie there's the radio in the
0:30:40 uh actual squad car that's going and
0:30:42 it's bluring all kinds of weird news
0:30:53 even and of course you find the tools
0:30:56 you're looking for for your voice of
0:30:58 Madness now on the police
0:31:01 radio officers are relaying uh
0:31:04 information that power there's a power
0:31:06 outage that seems to spread across the
0:31:09 entirety of the east coast and officers
0:31:12 are reporting seeing strange things and
0:31:17 you kind of very much get the impression
0:31:19 that right now the Masquerade is
0:31:22 paperin Neil frowns but then looks up at
0:31:25 the moon like he's not crazy surp
0:31:27 surprised that things are going along
0:31:29 although the news that the outage is
0:31:32 Coastal uh it definitely seems to take
0:31:34 him back but he grabs those are there
0:31:36 also like some road flares in the back
0:31:37 of this car there are okay he shoves
0:31:40 those in his messageer back as well and
0:31:42 then uh looking around while they're
0:31:44 inside fumbles for his cell phone and
0:31:47 pulls it out and then hesitates for just
0:31:49 a second before dialing the number sort
0:31:53 of like the redirect number that he and
0:31:57 Naro would like leave messages to each
0:31:59 other on like across the Atlantic no
0:32:03 signal he hits the phone a couple times
0:32:05 like it didn't
0:32:07 react oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] okay
0:32:12 um and then calls back across the street
0:32:16 miles yeah uh there so pow's out all
0:32:20 over the East Coast apparently the cell
0:32:22 phone towers are down too do do you have
0:32:26 uh was there like a radio
0:32:28 like relay system that was in plan for
0:32:30 the for this battle or or we were we
0:32:32 doing cell phones I'm sure that we have
0:32:34 a radio station or should we just go
0:32:37 where was everybody supposed to be how
0:32:39 far are we from everyone cuz I I know we
0:32:41 came looking for weathers but I can't
0:32:43 get through to anybody right now and
0:32:46 Police radios are jammed with with
0:32:48 chatter the central headquarters where
0:32:50 we're at is located not too far from
0:32:53 here should we make our way there then
0:32:55 next do you think or it might be best we
0:32:57 can get at least updated information
0:33:00 from there especially with cell phones
0:33:01 being down I wanted to try and call Nara
0:33:05 the children
0:33:06 of but there's nothing so they should be
0:33:09 there okay most of them are stationed
0:33:11 there since many of them are um
0:33:14 non-combatants yes yeah as much as you
0:33:16 can be during this
0:33:23 okay meanwhile Brea secures the best
0:33:28 container she can find if she can find a
0:33:30 backpack then she would stuff it full of
0:33:33 antibiotics anything that she would find
0:33:35 that's relevant to miles's condition
0:33:38 Johnny is going to call Kabir on his
0:33:41 cell phone we have no signal Johnny
0:33:45 scowls at his phone resists the urge to
0:33:48 break it and shoves it in his jacket as
0:33:51 he's looting packs of Morley's he'll uh
0:33:54 pop one open pop one in his mouth and
0:33:57 Light It Up
0:33:58 Johnny can we make sure and get some a
0:34:01 bunch of flashlights maybe more lighters
0:34:03 yeah yeah yeah give one second um he
0:34:06 grabs the phone from behind the the
0:34:08 counter dials nine for an outside line
0:34:11 and tries to call whether it's via a
0:34:14 landline there's no sound coming from
0:34:16 the phone at all you said you wanted
0:34:18 lighters and flashlights just if the
0:34:21 power is out and everything's going to
0:34:22 be really dark right yeah lanterns
0:34:25 anything like that you think this place
0:34:27 place as lanterns I don't know sometimes
0:34:30 drug stores have camping
0:34:36 stuff okay so I am presenting the Cordy
0:34:39 with a choice you may head back to
0:34:41 regroup you may look for weather or you
0:34:44 may look for Kabir whoever you do not
0:34:47 choose is lost to
0:34:49 you if you guys split up none of you are
0:34:53 succeeding here this is unfortunately a
0:34:57 set of horrific
0:35:01 choices when when Neil starts talking
0:35:04 about the phones being down when checks
0:35:08 the signal on her own [ __ ] she slips it
0:35:13 back in her pocket and grabs the police
0:35:15 radio the walkie-talkie and starts
0:35:18 flipping through the different channels
0:35:19 to see if she can hear one that sounds
0:35:22 like it might be kindred you hear what
0:35:24 sounds on a few instances what might be
0:35:28 Morse
0:35:31 code Neil yeah do you happen to know
0:35:35 Morse
0:35:36 code not um implicitly but I I can why
0:35:43 this Channel's getting Morse code do you
0:35:45 think maybe you can do your patterns
0:35:46 thing I don't know I haven't really
0:35:48 tried it with noises I Lex I will try an
0:35:52 eyes of chaos on the radio stations roll
0:35:54 it it's a n die pool and I will heighten
0:35:58 my senses for
0:36:00 it four successes it is an
0:36:04 SOS Someone is calling for Aid and you
0:36:09 listen for the deeper meaning behind the
0:36:14 SOS and it occurs to
0:36:17 you that the Stites have
0:36:20 betrayed the anars are being put to the
0:36:23 sword they need help
0:36:25 too it it's um
0:36:28 it's a it's a Maya it's a Maya and and
0:36:32 the the remainder of the anarchs and and
0:36:34 the anarchs she brought into the city
0:36:36 they the Stites are moving now they're
0:36:39 using the cover of the sabat to kill all
0:36:41 of the anarchs and it's happening now
0:36:43 she's she's asking for help she's crying
0:36:44 out for help do you know where I could
0:36:47 figure it out now that I know that it's
0:36:48 her but we okay we need to get to her we
0:36:50 need to get to others we need to get to
0:36:53 Kabir we need to get to Kabir what do
0:36:55 you mean The Killing Spree has him
0:36:58 at the elf storage place he was the
0:37:00 pigeon then wouldn't they not have him
0:37:03 then if he was the pigeon he ravos can
0:37:06 also do animalism he it was him so that
0:37:09 he's he was in the pigeon but his body
0:37:11 is still with the killing spray yeah oh
0:37:12 it's not like you being an owl it's more
0:37:14 like when you talk to the Ravens yeah
0:37:17 okay
0:37:18 okay we're not splitting up then we're
0:37:21 letting two groups die in the meantime
0:37:24 baa has started crushing antibiotics
0:37:27 into um a large cup that she has gotten
0:37:31 from the drugstore and when she's
0:37:33 through she'll pass it over to Miles
0:37:36 look I think maybe maybe they're right
0:37:39 that someone needs to drink this I don't
0:37:40 know if you can drink your own blood I'm
0:37:42 going to wait on that okay I'll get this
0:37:45 ready then at least I promised Kabir I'm
0:37:47 going to him so I'm going to him I don't
0:37:49 know where the rest of you are going
0:37:50 when we have to stay together look what
0:37:52 then come with me because I know where
0:37:54 I'm
0:37:55 going so we're letting
0:37:58 yes I am letting weathers die I am
0:38:01 letting Amaya and the anarchs die
0:38:04 because the Killing Spree took him
0:38:06 because I killed their
0:38:08 abot and he is not going to be punished
0:38:11 for my
0:38:13 crimes and I will go alone and die alone
0:38:16 if I have to Neil puts a hand over his
0:38:20 own heart and sort of like rubs the
0:38:22 crumpled paper that's in there looking
0:38:24 at Wynn but then looks at Johnny because
0:38:27 they're also talking about basically
0:38:29 every brewha Ally they've worked to get
0:38:32 I wouldn't be here with you guys without
0:38:35 weathers right at the beginning of
0:38:37 things I I'm sorry I don't know what's
0:38:39 right either but there's no right answer
0:38:43 there is then make your right answer
0:38:45 Johnny we're talking about the city okay
0:38:49 then you want to save Kabir or the city
0:38:52 I want to save Kabir [ __ ] the city then
0:38:55 where are you and Kabir going to go
0:38:57 after after after you get him anywhere
0:38:59 anywhere anywhere all right away from
0:39:02 the camaria you're going to get away
0:39:04 from the sabat cuz once they take this
0:39:06 city they're going to flood up all the
0:39:07 way up this Coast [ __ ] it I will not
0:39:10 lose one more thing to this goddamn City
0:39:14 I will not lose one more thing there's
0:39:17 no way that the two of you are going to
0:39:18 run bye and Wynn turns
0:39:23 win don't leave me then make me stay
0:39:28 hey take that last little bit from
0:39:32 me
0:39:36 let's take it can we just talk for I
0:39:40 don't was there
0:39:42 talking when they took
0:39:45 me was their
0:39:47 consideration of
0:39:49 anything I have given I'm taking
0:39:56 now it's the wrong
0:39:59 choice let me be the sinner for once
0:40:03 no no I will not then take I'm not going
0:40:06 to I'm not going to let you be selfish
0:40:09 here we need you the city needs to stay
0:40:12 then stop me we're not doing that Lex I
0:40:15 will uh activate Majesty okay and I will
0:40:18 move closer to where everyone is
0:40:19 shouting since I've been keeping myself
0:40:21 somewhat separate what is the Majestic
0:40:23 Aura you are creating for yourself
0:40:25 unfurling the Majesty of comes over in a
0:40:28 wave and he gets taller and stands
0:40:30 straighter which he hasn't been since he
0:40:33 got hit and looks put together and the
0:40:36 prince that you expect him to be we're
0:40:40 going to take a moment here we're all
0:40:42 going to go to the same place and we're
0:40:45 going to save that
0:40:47 person okay miles sure yeah understood
0:40:52 when gives a tight nod we are not going
0:40:55 to be able to do anything on our own
0:40:57 and if we're going to affect any kind of
0:40:59 change we're doing it
0:41:01 together I understand that we want to
0:41:05 save everyone and we still may have a
0:41:08 chance but we have to choose
0:41:11 something and to be successful we have
0:41:13 to choose it
0:41:15 together in this instance I don't even
0:41:19 necessarily know if we're going to save
0:41:21 the
0:41:22 person if we remove Killing Spree we may
0:41:26 be able destabilize some of the
0:41:29 leadership of this
0:41:31 Crusade feel free to present your
0:41:36 arguments is that the goal miles is you
0:41:39 want us to go after killing spree or
0:41:41 would we try and save Kabir in that the
0:41:44 goal is
0:41:46 both but I imagine when we get there
0:41:49 things are going to get messy miles
0:41:52 Kabir is one of my best friends I've
0:41:54 known him
0:41:57 as long as I've been
0:42:00 Kindred but either Amaya or
0:42:05 weathers they are leaders of the
0:42:09 bruha saving one Kindred is admirable
0:42:13 even if it's my even if it's
0:42:15 Kabir maybe the loss of weathers or
0:42:18 Amaya is going to shatter the resolve of
0:42:20 the Defenders I hear you let wind
0:42:24 speak I might be able to get back
0:42:27 to the
0:42:28 archons and tell them that there's an
0:42:31 opportunity to take out the Killing
0:42:35 Spree who our
0:42:38 leadership that would free us
0:42:41 up can I speak yes I don't think we have
0:42:45 time to go to the archons I think we
0:42:47 have to pick one target now it wouldn't
0:42:49 be all of you it would just be me and I
0:42:52 would meet you there no when we're not
0:42:54 separating I I won't let us separate
0:42:58 I
0:42:58 I we have a radio I have a police radio
0:43:01 I'll keep the radio so we can hear them
0:43:04 die no you were you were with them right
0:43:08 you have to know what channel they were
0:43:09 on the
0:43:11 archons Lucin has to be monitoring
0:43:14 police radio frequencies she's
0:43:15 monitoring everything so if we
0:43:17 broadcast we could let them know it's
0:43:20 not a guarantee but I I
0:43:25 just I feel like like we owe so much to
0:43:29 wethers but when you're um I'm sorry to
0:43:34 ask this so personally but you were
0:43:36 aren't you in love with Kabir
0:43:39 yeah when Wynn confirms the that she's in
0:43:43 love with Kabir uh Neil goes stock still
0:43:47 and I mean I don't know what that means
0:43:50 what the value of having given our word
0:43:52 to help someone but you gave your word
0:43:53 to help
0:43:54 Kabir yep
0:43:58 I am good with sending a strike force
0:43:59 Against The Killing
0:44:02 Spree if that's what we can do and
0:44:05 saving
0:44:06 weathers he doesn't mean the most to me
0:44:09 but I am in love with him when um and he
0:44:12 puts his hands over like the paper in
0:44:14 his pocket again like over his
0:44:17 heart
0:44:21 I'll if if this is if this
0:44:25 is if this this is a moment where
0:44:27 there's a line in the sand about us
0:44:30 staying
0:44:31 together
0:44:33 I'll you know I'll follow you to go die
0:44:37 but I
0:44:39 just I just want us to stay together
0:44:41 whatever we're doing I gave you that
0:44:43 list so you would prioritize yourself
0:44:46 not dying
0:44:49 well there's no guarantees but if we
0:44:53 split up whatever happens that's I I
0:44:57 agree with
0:44:58 Miles whatever we do we we do it
0:45:01 together anyone who chose to fight here
0:45:04 knew that they would fight with the
0:45:05 chance of dying with and and with it it
0:45:09 not being a low
0:45:10 one we have to know that too for the
0:45:13 people that we care about but we have a
0:45:15 chance either to help someone who's
0:45:18 helped us time and time again Johnny I
0:45:22 know how much weathers means to you and
0:45:24 he it's been a big part of us even being
0:45:27 who we are and
0:45:30 when I don't know that I'm sorry to
0:45:34 sound so selfish but I don't I don't
0:45:37 know that Kabir can make the impact that
0:45:39 weathers can in this fight but if you
0:45:41 love him Kabir is fighting this fight
0:45:44 because Johnny and I are
0:45:46 here he would have left a long time
0:45:49 ago he is in this city in danger because
0:45:52 of Johnny and
0:45:54 me all right
0:45:57 before we make any final moves here Neil
0:46:01 win see if you can reach the archons
0:46:03 you've got two minutes if you can't do
0:46:05 it we'll go after The Killing Spree if
0:46:09 you can we'll send the archons after
0:46:11 them and go after weathers miles we
0:46:14 might not know if the message got
0:46:16 through see if you can confirm it we can
0:46:19 give it a try Neil goes back over to the
0:46:22 police car real quick Lex and just takes
0:46:26 the police radio understood and then
0:46:29 holds it up to win and says as much
0:46:33 detail as you can but and he looks
0:46:36 around almost resignedly but shrugs and
0:46:39 goes try and remember the
0:46:41 Masquerade and then depresses the talk
0:46:44 button Mama Bear a power suit Red
0:46:47 Balloons or black jack there's a shadow
0:46:48 over elf storage something to be
0:46:50 recovered there Handle With Care
0:46:53 repeating Mama Bear to power suit Red
0:46:55 Balloons or black jack there's a Shadow
0:46:57 over elf storage something to be
0:46:58 recovered there Handle With
0:47:01 Care and she will motion for him to take
0:47:03 his thumb off the
0:47:05 button and almost without thinking just
0:47:08 goes I know it's a punishment but you're
0:47:12 pretty good at
0:47:15 that
0:47:17 satisfactory message is out haven't
0:47:20 heard anything yet we may not especially
0:47:24 if they decide to act on it they're not
0:47:26 going to Broad cast yeah we we won't
0:47:29 they won't be the only ones monitoring
0:47:31 police channels no Neil keep an eye out
0:47:33 everybody gather your gear we're getting
0:47:36 ready to move where are we going miles
0:47:38 I'll go grab that the masks the gloves
0:47:41 all that sure I don't have gear it's in
0:47:46 the back of the car we brought yours
0:47:48 wind kind of looks little Gob smacked at
0:47:51 that yeah picked it up Johnny starts
0:47:54 seeing if he can find another shoe or
0:47:56 boot his size amongst some of the bodies
0:47:59 it takes a little looking but you do
0:48:01 find a pair of boots some like kind of
0:48:04 old oily work boots uh he will swap out
0:48:08 to wear those boots instead BR dips in
0:48:11 to the drugstore once more just making
0:48:13 sure that she has actually she just
0:48:17 takes the whole box of gloves she's a
0:48:18 little worried that miles's big hands
0:48:20 might overwhelm them she does in fact
0:48:23 get the extra large gloves and uh some
0:48:26 masks for Miles she comes back out
0:48:30 readying her own stuff and grab the
0:48:32 extra gear out of the back of the car
0:48:34 that thing is not going anywhere else
0:48:36 we'll do and immediately as miles gives
0:48:39 an order BR shifts to the next task um
0:48:43 it's worth reminding you guys she might
0:48:46 call me away at any point don't count on
0:48:50 me well even if you're not with
0:48:55 us which we'll try and make happen as
0:48:57 long as possible um I'm always going to
0:49:00 count on you it's going to be dangerous
0:49:01 to summon you from here on out she
0:49:03 probably won't unless she gets contact
0:49:05 with
0:49:06 you it never stopped her
0:49:08 before no wasn't a war zone last time
0:49:12 correct maybe the cell phone outage
0:49:14 you'll have an unintended positive
0:49:17 consequence how bonded are the two of
0:49:20 you
0:49:22 two um miles I I would need more blood
0:49:26 for it but well we could use your blood
0:49:29 right I don't know I don't know how that
0:49:30 works with the medicine I wouldn't touch
0:49:32 miles as oh for himself yeah yeah okay I
0:49:35 I probably can't ingest my own blood I
0:49:39 guess that's where I was going with it
0:49:40 is that I'm a musician I don't we're
0:49:44 going to have to wait cuz you can't
0:49:45 ingest the medicine either I also just
0:49:48 as a general rule um not that I think
0:49:50 any of us were planning on it but for
0:49:53 now until we figure out what's wrong
0:49:55 with Miles I wouldn't touch just blood
0:49:57 at all so where are we going miles we're
0:49:59 going to the last place we knew weathers
