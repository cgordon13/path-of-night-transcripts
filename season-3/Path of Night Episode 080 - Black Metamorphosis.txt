0:00:27 advised now let's walk the path of
0:00:32 [Music]
0:00:38 night last time on path of
0:00:41 night the Coterie discussed the night
0:00:43 of the
0:00:44 Rave when told everyone about Zachariah
0:00:47 slain and his objective to retrieve
0:00:49 pages of the ER
0:00:51 codex Neil shared information from his
0:00:54 interaction with Renwick that Marcus
0:00:56 vitel was the traitor to The Domain and
0:00:59 that he had kidnapped
0:01:02 Fester at Sunset the next night the
0:01:04 Coterie sped across town towards the
0:01:06 confrontation and hopefully a
0:01:09 [Music]
0:01:28 rescue
0:01:31 the group of you make your trip as you
0:01:34 get to the location there's a few things
0:01:36 that are obvious to even a casual
0:01:39 Observer one is that despite this being
0:01:44 a very uh very clean very well put
0:01:47 together section of the
0:01:49 city there is this
0:01:52 shitty black Honda Civic that looks old
0:01:57 and tired parked outside across the
0:02:00 street and even as you pull up in your
0:02:05 car you can hear the loud obnoxious
0:02:09 music coming from inside of that car
0:02:13 there are Mortals that seem to be
0:02:17 Milling around the area minding their
0:02:19 business by and large keeping an eye on
0:02:22 the house and then when you return your
0:02:24 attention back to the car
0:02:27 inside you recognize
0:02:30 the members of the steak and bake pack
0:02:32 keeping an eye on the
0:02:34 situation miles put your phone on silent
0:02:38 how has been should I too everyone
0:02:40 probably should because but I suspect
0:02:43 yeah thank you when yeah no I'm guessing
0:02:45 miles is going to get texts from those
0:02:47 jackasses updating him people are going
0:02:50 into the house well if we do this right
0:02:52 they won't see yeah BR flips her phone
0:02:54 and just double checks that it's on
0:02:56 silent Johnny will also just turn his
0:02:58 phone off yeah
0:03:00 actually yeah that's better
0:03:03 okay park around the
0:03:05 corner and then we'll get out and
0:03:08 walk I can't hide the van Johnny Parks a
0:03:12 safe distance away from the location so
0:03:15 that the uh escalates well out of sight
0:03:18 Lex out of curiosity what do the
0:03:20 shadowlands and the spiritual worlds
0:03:23 look like here there is a Maelstrom that
0:03:26 is rending this place in the Underworld
0:03:29 uh however beyond that nothing seems out
0:03:31 of the ordinary when kind of like
0:03:34 squeezes her eyes shut for a minute and
0:03:37 just tries to unsee things you okay
0:03:42 when yeah
0:03:45 just storms here in the shadowlands
0:03:48 and I can't help but worry
0:03:51 understandable but for all intense and
0:03:53 purposes otherwise the area looks fairly
0:03:57 normal are we good to keep whispering
0:04:00 in the Shroud once we get close it's
0:04:03 better if you don't okay you can but it
0:04:07 it risks drawing attention unless you're
0:04:09 practiced at it Renwick knows to meet us
0:04:11 here you should I look around for to see
0:04:15 I mean it's Renwick he could be easily
0:04:17 hiding like in the [ __ ] sewer great
0:04:18 and I wouldn't even know but you do not
0:04:21 yet see any signs of Renwick you should
0:04:24 but I I don't know if he's here or not
0:04:27 and if he's doing his job I I I I
0:04:29 wouldn't no unless I took enough time to
0:04:31 to
0:04:32 look so are you leading Us in yeah oh
0:04:37 although I can't I can walk through the
0:04:40 doors I can
0:04:41 look uh to see if anything's on the
0:04:43 other side but I'm going to need you
0:04:45 guys to open them okay I can take point
0:04:48 on that since Neil you taught me how to
0:04:51 hide myself anyway you should still be
0:04:54 uh protected okay by the Shroud by the
0:04:57 by the cloak uh but
0:05:00 um you might have to pick the locks kind
0:05:02 of deal this time all right same deal
0:05:06 let's yeah everybody ready mhm as ready
0:05:09 as I'm going to be and Lex I will use
0:05:13 upcap 5 uh cloak the Gathering to make
0:05:16 us all disappear I imagine once we
0:05:18 disembark from the vehicle yes once
0:05:20 we're outside okay ordinarily doesn't
0:05:22 take a blood but to extend it to all of
0:05:24 you it does I believe the group of you
0:05:28 experiences sensation akin to the world
0:05:30 simply forgetting your presence anyone
0:05:33 that was looking your way very suddenly
0:05:35 looks the other way not minding your
0:05:37 existence at all okay this way let's go
0:05:42 he's under the first floor by in case we
0:05:46 get
0:05:47 separated near the near the mantle near
0:05:49 the
0:05:50 fireplace as they start to approach brto
0:05:53 will heighten her vision and her hearing
0:05:55 to keep a lookout Neil does the same as
0:05:59 we walk walk past brto will Peak at the
0:06:04 shitty black condo Civic and the
0:06:06 occupants inside just curious what their
0:06:09 deal actually is if they're like holding
0:06:13 a phone as if they might actually be
0:06:15 trying to do
0:06:17 reconnaissance or
0:06:20 what looks like they're just talking
0:06:22 they don't really seem like the type
0:06:24 that are to be disciplined enough to be
0:06:27 obviously doing any one thing except
0:06:28 maybe smoking they would be doing that
0:06:31 along with something else even then
0:06:33 that's and if I recall correctly they're
0:06:35 a saat pack right yeah yeah so what are
0:06:38 you guys uh doing next well we need to
0:06:42 get inside Neil is going to lead the
0:06:44 invisible Coterie around I know where he
0:06:47 is in there but I don't super know like
0:06:49 the layout of this place so I'm going to
0:06:51 look for like is there like a side
0:06:53 entrance a door that we could go in so
0:06:55 we're not just standing on the front
0:06:56 step trying to pick our way in yeah
0:06:59 there's side inuries yeah is there a
0:07:01 basement access uh not direct no okay
0:07:03 and then once we get to one that looks
0:07:05 like it'll take us reasonably directly
0:07:07 to I mean it's by the fireplace you can
0:07:09 kind of track where that would be based
0:07:10 on the chimney probably in the center of
0:07:12 the house yeah the one that looks like
0:07:15 it might in this style of home give us
0:07:17 the most direct access to there not any
0:07:20 of them very well but you find it that
0:07:23 and I'm just going to hold up a finger
0:07:25 to everybody in a like wait 1 second
0:07:27 motion and then like poke my head
0:07:29 through the door as you go to p through
0:07:30 the door can of get a will power roll
0:07:32 difficulty eight I currently have 14
0:07:35 willower remember that you have an extra
0:07:37 dice for tactics right does this count
0:07:41 as an effect that is coming from marus
0:07:44 vitel that is way too vague a question
0:07:47 well I gain bonus defensive dice against
0:07:51 Marcus Vitel specifically this is not an
0:07:53 action he's taking against okay that is
0:07:54 my
0:07:56 question that is six successes okay uh
0:07:59 that is not enough you Jesus Christ tens
0:08:02 don't blow on Willpower do they no you
0:08:04 need a spec what you can't get for no
0:08:07 which just which your question no yeah
0:08:09 you're right that's too bad I just had a
0:08:11 lot of T yeah I rolled like four tens
0:08:13 you take no
0:08:15 damage but you find yourself repelled by
0:08:17 the presence of a ward Neil goes to like
0:08:20 literally phase through the wall uh to
0:08:23 look inside and then just stops and
0:08:26 jerks backwards he looks frust
0:08:30 and looks at the four of you and just
0:08:34 goes very like quietly it's a wed we can
0:08:38 see him right not just the people with
0:08:40 aspects yeah you can see we can see each
0:08:42 other okay can wi kind of like look at
0:08:45 the house and see if she can spot like
0:08:48 any like occult signs that could be
0:08:50 contributing to a ward of some sort not
0:08:52 a thing out of the ordinary outside okay
0:08:55 I don't is it just the
0:08:57 door it's probably
0:09:00 I I don't know it might be it depends on
0:09:02 how we put it if it's a circle around
0:09:03 the house then then it's the whole
0:09:07 property but if you just warded the door
0:09:09 then it's the door I I don't know I can
0:09:13 try a wall I like lean around where the
0:09:17 boundaries of the door are and kind of
0:09:19 stick a hand we're against a at d n
0:09:24 yeah a bunch of ones two successes you
0:09:28 do not Pierce The
0:09:30 Ward it causes a stinging sensation and
0:09:35 uh you hit with two levels of bashing
0:09:36 damage you may will soak Wards bypass
0:09:38 armor right they do yeah I will soak
0:09:41 both shockingly you're good proud of you
0:09:43 buddy hell yeah Neil shakes his head no
0:09:47 I I can't it it looks seems like it's
0:09:50 the property so do we need to call him
0:09:52 out if the goal is Fester there's no
0:09:54 point in calling vital out I don't know
0:09:56 how to get through it I'm not a I don't
0:09:58 know how to unweave the ward or perhaps
0:10:02 I should knock on the door and see if
0:10:03 he'll just let us in can we take this
0:10:05 conversation a little further back from
0:10:07 the house yeah let's do that which one
0:10:11 you were POS two things let's move a
0:10:14 little bit away and keep talking this is
0:10:16 a wildly strong wart we will uh lead the
0:10:21 way we'll follow you do you get a sense
0:10:23 of like what Paradigm it's following
0:10:25 what what flavor of blood magic is it um
0:10:28 it's a Ward and I know okay I'm not an
0:10:31 expert I know how to do Wards but that
0:10:33 doesn't mean I can undo them you know I
0:10:36 don't know Wards are pretty basic
0:10:38 principles of thery so I feel stupid
0:10:44 right now but I'm kind of at a loss you
0:10:47 can't just undo it magic is is once
0:10:51 magic is in play it's basically
0:10:52 impossible to to make it on
0:10:54 Inplay oh so that guy really was saying
0:10:57 that that was it talking about doesn't
0:11:00 matter right once once a ward is up you
0:11:03 I don't know of a way to get rid of it
0:11:05 okay so let's look for a space on the
0:11:06 house that wouldn't be warded I couldn't
0:11:09 phase through a blank section of wall so
0:11:12 it looks like it's the whole property
0:11:14 would you be able to see it like is it
0:11:18 in the astral realm if I step in the
0:11:19 astral realm all of you are going to be
0:11:21 visible pretty quick what if we go
0:11:23 through the sewer I don't most sewer
0:11:26 access to a house is narrow pipes here's
0:11:29 a better question when you say a ward he
0:11:32 like literally put down a a circle ass
0:11:35 salt or something and what's the how
0:11:37 does how does this happen it depends
0:11:39 there's nothing outside to indicate if I
0:11:41 was him I would have done it on the
0:11:43 inside well he tries to be pretty budy
0:11:45 budy with Miles even if it's fake maybe
0:11:48 we can use that the problem is if
0:11:51 Fester's inside we I don't know how to
0:11:53 get in so so Miles knocks on the door
0:11:57 let's regroup we need a little bit bit
0:11:59 more reconnaissance let's get back to
0:12:01 the van give it a shot to see if you can
0:12:03 see anything from the astal realm if
0:12:05 that gives you a clear picture I mean we
0:12:07 haven't lost much time at this point and
0:12:09 we can't keep just trying to probe the
0:12:12 defenses if you can get a better sense
0:12:14 from the as realm then go for it no
0:12:16 every every time I'm probing the
0:12:18 defenses it hurts can you see getting
0:12:20 harder so you can't see them see what
0:12:24 whatever magic the no I don't I don't
0:12:26 know how to I can't like just see magic
0:12:28 like that even in out of body the the
0:12:30 astral the astral realm doesn't show
0:12:33 magic it's not the magic realm it's it's
0:12:35 the realm of it was my dumb question
0:12:37 okay so we can move past it I mean I can
0:12:40 look but I could you know if if the roof
0:12:43 isn't AED but if the whole property is
0:12:44 the circle sort of
0:12:46 extends and and some transcend Realms
0:12:49 piss or get off the pot either look or
0:12:51 don't and we find another option but
0:12:53 you're talking yourself into an action
0:12:54 question yeah if someone is able to open
0:12:58 this door
0:12:59 would that break the ward or would it
0:13:01 still be if the ward was on the doors
0:13:04 yes but if the ward is a circle if the
0:13:06 if the house is in a circle no so I'm
0:13:08 I'm guessing if someone were to enter
0:13:10 would that break the ward or would that
0:13:12 if they were let through they would be
0:13:13 let through but the ward would be intact
0:13:15 the W would be intact Neil is clearly
0:13:18 getting agitated like being this close
0:13:20 to fester and being completely impotent
0:13:22 once again Lex I'm going to look at the
0:13:25 house in sort of like a a frustrated
0:13:29 glare uh I'm actually going to use eyes
0:13:30 of chaos to see if there's any you know
0:13:33 I don't really get to pick what it tells
0:13:35 me but looking for faults weaknesses
0:13:39 Chao like a the universe giving me an
0:13:41 arrow just but I'm going to just look
0:13:44 for answers in the esoteric because
0:13:47 Neil's frustrated and angry and out of
0:13:49 his depth go ahead and
0:13:51 roll seven
0:13:53 successes just wait you see the house
0:13:57 the paint the grass the trees everything
0:14:01 decaying at various rates But ultimately
0:14:06 you
0:14:06 know this place will die the sun will
0:14:09 expand and consume it the sun itself
0:14:11 will die and eventually the universe
0:14:13 will simply burn out and the world won't
0:14:15 matter have a little
0:14:18 patience Brees
0:14:21 nihilism so when you uh botch eyes of
0:14:24 chaos you get lost in what you're
0:14:26 looking at and while I did not botch I
0:14:28 think I'm just going to stare at the
0:14:29 house for a little bit good luck guys
0:14:31 you wait a little and the door
0:14:37 opens and opening the door is a
0:14:41 gentleman that you recognize as Marcus
0:14:45 vitel instinctually BR goes still even
0:14:48 though she's covered in the Shroud and
0:14:51 he is wearing a bath he is ridiculously
0:14:56 handsome to the point of probably not
0:14:59 someone that can be around the Mortal
0:15:02 populace because of how unusually
0:15:04 attractive he is and this man who is
0:15:07 clearly visited to have an appearance
0:15:09 six Smiles at you a perfect winning
0:15:12 smile why are you on my
0:15:15 grass who is it does it seem that he's
0:15:17 looking at he is looking directly at
0:15:20 Neil who has interacted with his
0:15:22 environment and broken his OB skate yes
0:15:24 so does that mean it broke for all of us
0:15:25 yes he just
0:15:27 forgot
0:15:37 hey man my friend's in there and I'm
0:15:38 panicking uh yeah I forgot too if that
0:15:42 helps I didn't know it broke them yeah
0:15:46 um well I expected to just be able to
0:15:48 walk through the wall which is probably
0:15:51 dumb of me I just didn't expect him to
0:15:53 have [ __ ]
0:15:55 thury I see you don't quite have an
0:15:57 answer ready and he just takes a few
0:15:59 steps back I
0:16:01 um was looking for
0:16:05 someone and my
0:16:08 yard there's
0:16:10 um narrow Dell Grace is there some
0:16:15 custom of your domain that I'm
0:16:16 unfamiliar with yes we believe you have
0:16:18 fester in your house and we'd like him
0:16:20 oh for that matter I heard a dirty
0:16:23 little secret there not a [ __ ]
0:16:26 ventril he looks at you and he smiles
0:16:28 and all of a sudden you don't believe
0:16:29 that at all you're pretty sure he's a
0:16:31 vent and speak up and explain to the
0:16:33 rest of the party that he's definitely a
0:16:34 ventu as his unique Opus cas6
0:16:37 specifically says everyone thinks I'm a
0:16:38 Ventrue when I use
0:16:40 it straight up
0:16:43 on oh my God but upon seeing you here on
0:16:47 the front
0:16:49 step you're obviously a Ventrue room how
0:16:52 embarrassing for the rumor mongers yeah
0:16:56 Johnny kind of blinks a little bit like
0:16:58 not not really sure what just happened
0:17:00 to him oh I don't the group of you wait
0:17:02 here a moment and I will fetch your
0:17:04 friend and he shuts the door what do you
0:17:06 guys do I'm going through the sewer and
0:17:08 I'm going to punch my way up into the
0:17:10 house the circle we don't know where the
0:17:13 circle ends Neil I'm going to go find
0:17:15 out if you want to come safe Faster come
0:17:17 with me should I summon him which one I
0:17:21 don't know if that would work no [ __ ]
0:17:23 this I'm going to go back out to the uh
0:17:25 guys we are straying vastly from the
0:17:27 goal here the plan is broken continue on
0:17:30 we can always just burn them out
0:17:32 Fester's in there yeah in a cage Fester
0:17:34 will die I I'm pretty sure the fire will
0:17:36 break the ward it no no no I don't think
0:17:40 so if there's no wall left it's a Mystic
0:17:44 Ward the walls meant nothing to me it
0:17:46 was the ward that kept me out when finds
0:17:48 a sewer great when heads over looking
0:17:52 for a swer gr or a manhole cover y it's
0:17:56 a bit of a distance this is very like a
0:17:58 SE space so there's not really like a t
0:18:01 of obvious like City stuff like that
0:18:03 while you're looking around a car speeds
0:18:05 out of the garage and it takes off is it
0:18:08 a nice car it is a very nice car and
0:18:11 makes very like loud sports car noises
0:18:14 as it goes can I see who's in it the
0:18:16 windows are very tinted my friend BR
0:18:18 does not wait to look who's in it she
0:18:20 looks at Miles and repeats the same
0:18:22 facial expression she had when she said
0:18:23 should I summon him it's not going to
0:18:25 work let's go how close does the car get
0:18:27 to me not at all this is a very very
0:18:29 large property and somewhere like you
0:18:32 know 80 feet off in that direction car
0:18:35 peels out and goes I know they're so
0:18:37 ttin any way I could use Leaps and
0:18:40 Bounds to to land on the car give me a
0:18:43 deetic
0:18:46 difficulty should we get into initiative
0:18:49 uh I think so
0:18:51 [Music]
0:18:54 okay this car is rapidly accelerating uh
0:18:56 at the end of the round if no one's on
0:18:58 on that car keeping up with him or
0:18:59 chasing him in some efficient way he's
0:19:02 gone for now he holds his action we go
0:19:06 to 17 br br will Quick Draw her gun and
0:19:10 attempt to shoot out a tire go for it uh
0:19:12 difficulty on this shot is
0:19:15 nine eight successes to Quick
0:19:18 Draw
0:19:20 succeed for your notes that does mean a
0:19:23 plus 32 initiative okay and
0:19:26 then difficulty you said nine difficulty
0:19:29 nine two successes the round hits the
0:19:33 tire uh you find the uh durability of
0:19:37 the vehicle somehow supernaturally
0:19:40 enhanced three successes okay uh the
0:19:43 tire is hit does not break brda
0:19:46 instinctively almost pulls out the
0:19:48 assault rifle and takes
0:19:51 a she makes contact but it's not enough
0:19:54 I believe that takes us to Johnny Johnny
0:19:56 will attempt to Channel his uh Celerity
0:20:00 through his legs and make a leap and
0:20:02 bound to land on the vehicle actually I
0:20:06 think Leaps and Bounds actually caps the
0:20:08 difficulty I can give you for this at
0:20:10 four okay so deck plus uh Athletics yeah
0:20:14 it says the the combo basically says if
0:20:16 it's really really really hard they have
0:20:18 to roll into a stiff
0:20:20 four seven successes with seven
0:20:24 successes you leap onto the vehicle it
0:20:26 is this Chrome out overly pretty Porsche
0:20:30 tiny little
0:20:31 car inside the
0:20:35 windshield you see nothing but
0:20:38 Darkness as a sabat Survivor do I
0:20:42 recognize that Darkness yes it is not
0:20:44 merely an absence of light when you do
0:20:47 that he will act I will say uh Johnny
0:20:50 you will notice though the sounds are
0:20:51 muffled there's some sort of like
0:20:53 conversation or something happening in
0:20:54 the car okay Johnny you you are
0:20:59 telekinetically
0:21:01 grabbed shoved in front of the car moved
0:21:04 by his whim and then run
0:21:07 [Music]
0:21:10 over he runs you over the little Porsche
0:21:14 makes a horrible crouching noise as it
0:21:16 grinds against you can we make some kind
0:21:18 of contested roll to see if I can Stand
0:21:20 My Ground against the porsch can you
0:21:21 grapple the car uh you are your body is
0:21:23 telekinetically under someone else's
0:21:25 control gotcha uh roll so does my armor
0:21:29 give me sck here yep sure does and your
0:21:31 leather jacket so my leather jacket's
0:21:33 what one and my armor is two three for
0:21:35 the like FL jacket stuff miles gave us a
0:21:37 while ago and one for the leather jacket
0:21:39 mm
0:21:43 okay yikes I think it's just a single
0:21:46 soak he's only dealt one bashing to you
0:21:48 so you will soak all of it all right
0:21:50 thank God you're dragged under the car a
0:21:53 few meters before it releases you and he
0:21:56 is still speeding off uh next next we'll
0:21:58 go to Neil it looks like he's getting
0:21:59 away right uh it's looking like that
0:22:01 yeah I forgot to ask earlier what's the
0:22:03 weather like right now it's a pretty
0:22:04 clear night clear night okay Neil will
0:22:07 look around and just say somebody figure
0:22:10 out how to stop him uh I'll keep eyes on
0:22:13 him and he covers one of his eyes and I
0:22:15 will throw my vision up to the heavens
0:22:19 so I can just continue to watch the car
0:22:21 from space yes 16 you watch him and he
0:22:24 is uh you can see that he is concealed
0:22:26 in darkness when we don't know if Fester
0:22:30 is in the car or not do we you do not
0:22:32 you don't get any your vampire AA stuff
0:22:34 do I get it as you have to roll for
0:22:36 every time we checking it okay um I did
0:22:39 roll once yep um that was three
0:22:41 successes yep which tracked you to the
0:22:43 house okay uh then I'm going to do it
0:22:45 again yep no that's a botch a botch
0:22:49 you're not sure but you think that trail
0:22:51 is going with the car all right so when
0:22:54 will start chasing down the car miles
0:22:56 how far away is the car at this point
0:22:58 approximately like 60 yards that's a lot
0:23:02 sports cars now remind me was the Honda
0:23:06 on it the Honda was parked right it was
0:23:09 parked was the music was on was it
0:23:11 running oh I'll let youa die on six six
0:23:14 and up it's running a six it is running
0:23:17 I don't know if I can turn this into
0:23:18 anything I'm going to start booking it
0:23:21 for the car and I'm hoping that the
0:23:25 driver looks at me and then I will tell
0:23:27 him to
0:23:28 go
0:23:30 run they are looking at you I don't know
0:23:33 which one's in the drive actually you
0:23:35 can pick which one's in the
0:23:37 D I will uh spend a willpower and
0:23:42 hopefully it works for Majesty okay and
0:23:45 as I get there give me the car okay on
0:23:48 their action yep uh they are going to
0:23:50 proceed with the actions they were
0:23:51 intending on taking against you yep
0:23:53 driver side door opens uhhuh and the two
0:23:56 come piling out open fire on you so the
0:23:59 magesty has no effect I don't know yet
0:24:01 okay it's their intention I don't know
0:24:05 they rule courage so the first one rolls
0:24:09 okay okay A-Dog tosses you his gun and
0:24:14 gets out of the way so you can take the
0:24:15 driver's side seat C-Dog who is in the
0:24:18 passenger seat just opens up on you with
0:24:20 a Mac
0:24:21 10 all right he is declaring full
0:24:26 auto he has three successes to hit
0:24:30 you five bashing coming at
0:24:34 you nine you
0:24:37 soak after he uh attempts to damage me I
0:24:40 will use retaliatory Terror go for it
0:24:42 wits plus courage uh his wits is a two
0:24:45 his courage is a three he's stupid but
0:24:48 he's
0:24:49 Brave that'll be five successes I will
0:24:56 bail okay better what are your Celerity
0:24:58 actions BR has two Celerity actions and
0:25:01 she will be committing both to trying to
0:25:03 shoot out that same Tire sounds good she
0:25:06 will move up going for the backseat of
0:25:09 the car but she's more focused on
0:25:12 shooting difficulty nine with the
0:25:15 willpower that is three successes two
0:25:19 roll over into
0:25:22 damage six Speck and Sharpshooter count
0:25:25 yes it does then it is five
0:25:28 successes you hear an audible noise as
0:25:31 the tire
0:25:33 goes the car
0:25:36 swerves he regains control of the
0:25:39 vehicle and manages to not plow into
0:25:42 like a [ __ ] structure I will commit
0:25:46 my next action to trying to take out
0:25:48 another tire okay it's easier hit if
0:25:50 it's moving slower uh no it's moving
0:25:53 super
0:25:54 [Laughter]
0:25:56 erratically Force successes three roll
0:25:59 over into
0:26:01 damage five damage with five successes
0:26:04 you take a second tire
0:26:08 out BR
0:26:10 methodically commits to trying to
0:26:12 disable the vehicle the car makes a
0:26:15 horrible grinding noise and while he
0:26:16 seems to have control of it it is
0:26:18 slowing to a snail's pace and it's at
0:26:23 this point that he turns and smashes it
0:26:26 into another
0:26:30 [Music]
0:26:33 home the next round starts with vitel
0:26:37 whatever it is that vitel is doing in
0:26:38 that house he does not show himself but
0:26:41 something does happen a globe of
0:26:43 darkness fills the space and Smothers
0:26:47 the car after that we go to BR so I
0:26:50 Believe by this time that BR would have
0:26:52 been able to get into the car that miles
0:26:55 is driving and I would like to hold
0:26:58 until we are closer to the situation
0:27:01 okay after BR holds her action it goes
0:27:04 to Johnny Johnny stands up from having
0:27:07 been run over dusts himself off glares
0:27:10 at the car through a pair of broken
0:27:12 sunglasses that he discards looks down
0:27:15 at his chainsaw and [ __ ] pulls the
0:27:17 rip cord so it starts starts up you
0:27:20 taking any movement he will take a few
0:27:21 menacing steps towards the orb of
0:27:23 Darkness look considering I'm just
0:27:26 moving and starting a chain saw can I um
0:27:29 can I split that with some kind of held
0:27:31 Dodge or no yes you can okay seeing
0:27:33 Johnny approach I would like to having
0:27:37 seen that it's difficult to see through
0:27:40 lra's darkness before I'm going to use
0:27:43 this moment to try to test if I can
0:27:45 track where Vel would be within it with
0:27:48 aura perception with AA perception all
0:27:50 you see is ice cold does that take up my
0:27:52 action yes it does you can see miles
0:27:55 that BR strains to try to spot something
0:27:58 within that orb but she shakes her head
0:28:01 adjusting the gun to better hold it
0:28:03 within her grasp then it is to Neil Neil
0:28:07 will uh just start basically running
0:28:09 down the street to try and catch up with
0:28:10 everybody because I'm too far behind
0:28:13 Okay when how many actions will it take
0:28:16 of me full out running to get to the car
0:28:19 I'll say three okay so wi will spend
0:28:23 blood for our Celerity action and
0:28:27 dedication her primary action to running
0:28:29 okay so that would be two uh essentially
0:28:31 two of the three you'll be two-thirds of
0:28:33 the way yep to the house on that um
0:28:37 miles the car you're in uh you start
0:28:40 going uh yes uh and within a short
0:28:42 period of time you're getting pretty
0:28:43 close to the location all right I will
0:28:46 uh when I get there I will park the car
0:28:48 in some sort of like at an angle or
0:28:50 something like that and try to put the
0:28:51 lights on the house okay the headlights
0:28:55 trying to shine the headlights through
0:28:56 into the Darkness or sure I don't know
0:28:59 headlights shine on a wall of pitch
0:29:01 black I know so little about lras that
0:29:05 you you learn yep we learn now that when
0:29:08 you shine the headlights on onto that it
0:29:10 does not illuminate anything inside it
0:29:11 is just hitting this matte black wall of
0:29:15 Darkness I do appreciate the matte
0:29:17 Blackness of
0:29:20 it before solary action start a few
0:29:23 things happen one miles mhm you begin to
0:29:26 feel like the world is against you and
0:29:29 all of the confidence that you have felt
0:29:31 in the past begins to wither and die
0:29:36 until I say otherwise what is your
0:29:38 lowest virtue conscience what is it at
0:29:42 two that is your maximum dice pull on
0:29:44 any
0:29:48 roll then as the car is parked where the
0:29:52 headlights focus on the house there is
0:29:55 this whiff of sh shadow in the back seat
0:29:59 as vitel steps from one Shadow to
0:30:04 another and
0:30:06 Strikes at
0:30:09 brida he connects with 13 successes to
0:30:13 hit may I use my held cerity action to
0:30:16 attempt to dodge you may only Dodge
0:30:18 enemies you are aware of and you are not
0:30:22 aware of this until it is too late
0:30:24 gotcha you may roll soak that is stamina
0:30:28 yes may I spend a willpower you may not
0:30:32 we've got the armor that Miles gave us
0:30:34 on right it's three extra dice it's
0:30:36 three dice for armor and then how much
0:30:38 for a leather jacket one okay I did
0:30:43 recently buy up my stamina we're at
0:30:45 three stamina three for the armor and
0:30:47 one for the jacket okay give me is this
0:30:49 a can you hold this stra please okay
0:30:52 actually
0:30:54 uh no it says black metamorphosis uh
0:30:57 Celerity is coming after this
0:31:01 understood okay go ahead and roll so do1
0:31:05 explode if you have a stamina specialty
0:31:07 I do not so that is three successes you
0:31:09 will take a total of 10 levels of lethal
0:31:12 damage all right what does that bring me
0:31:14 to he is sending you to torper through
0:31:16 the back seat and through your torso
0:31:19 emerges a thick black tentacle that
0:31:23 comes to a razor sharp bladed Point as
0:31:26 this tentacle St strikes through BR it
0:31:29 strikes true and you see something
0:31:31 you've never seen before not in BR
0:31:34 you've seen in other Kindred the way
0:31:36 that her skin starts to mummify that the
0:31:40 life goes out of her eyes and she falls
0:31:43 directly and immediately into torper
0:31:46 despite the animation in her despite the
0:31:48 blood running through her veins at the
0:31:50 speed of Celerity she could not Dodge
0:31:52 she could not anticipate she just
0:31:54 immediately goes fully uncons ious Lex
0:31:58 followup question so the black
0:32:00 metamorphosis action was that to to step
0:32:03 through Shadow or was that to to puncher
0:32:06 it does not take him in action to step
0:32:07 through Shadow okay it is just part of
0:32:10 his movement perfect miles uh oh I
0:32:13 should actually clarify miles this does
0:32:15 not affect your soap pools okay well
0:32:17 that's good I was a bit worried yeah
0:32:20 you're
0:32:21 ably I was like well that's a that's a
0:32:24 hell of a hit miles to strike you who'll
0:32:26 expand upon
0:32:29 Power Nine successes to
0:32:32 hit 15
0:32:35 lethal I reduce it by four uh you will
0:32:38 suffer 11 levels of lethal damage uh so
0:32:41 four of that is going to roll into egg
0:32:43 yep and you are reduced to torper but do
0:32:46 not die from this strike at the end of
0:32:49 his Celerity action he stands up in the
0:32:52 car causing the roof of the vehicle the
0:32:55 glass the the metal to to bend and warp
0:32:58 out of his way what emerges from the
0:33:01 roof of the vehicle is a creature that
0:33:03 seems to only half exist it flickers in
0:33:08 and out of any visual recognition at all
0:33:12 but when it is there it is obscured and
0:33:16 whirling living shadows and has 6 foot
0:33:21 tentacles that seem to have erupted from
0:33:23 its torso and ren the car around it as
0:33:27 though were made of paper everyone who
0:33:31 has never seen a black
0:33:33 metamorphosis has to roll courage at
0:33:36 difficulty 8 if you fail this role you
0:33:38 are entering R Trek and fleeing the
0:33:40 scene did Johnny and I see it at the
0:33:43 Dunkin Donuts in season 2 no okay uh
0:33:46 Johnny did give everyone Iron Heart uh
0:33:49 this is not a supernatural source of
0:33:54 fear quote unquote it's not like
0:33:55 leveraging emotion advantage over you it
0:33:59 is it is genuinely that terrifying that
0:34:02 your own Beast is attempting to flee the
0:34:04 situation doesn't iron heart still give
0:34:06 you bonuses to this it only to presence
0:34:08 dominate mind affecting THB did I I
0:34:11 recognize it is a weird spot in the
0:34:13 system I have actually sort of seen it
0:34:15 before cuz Carmen was coming at me at
0:34:17 the gala Carmen came at you at the gala
0:34:18 that was black metamorphosis do thank
0:34:21 [ __ ] god um can I spend a willpower
0:34:24 on this yes you
0:34:25 may uh Kens explode uh they do not but I
0:34:29 can see that they don't need to uh based
0:34:31 on what I'm saying on your dice when how
0:34:34 you doing over there running away uh
0:34:36 what about your one willpower that you
0:34:37 spent oh no wait a minute I [ __ ] that
0:34:39 up none of these days succeeded so I got
0:34:41 one success heard I heard you declare
0:34:42 your will that is succeeding the willow
0:34:44 use was correct five successes Johnny
0:34:47 you don't feel afraid of this thing you
0:34:49 feel angry wi got the one by your will
0:34:53 you're there yep wi holds on mhm
0:34:57 [Music]
0:35:01 it is Johnny's turn Johnny whips around
0:35:04 to see this creature standing like
0:35:07 chernabog above the
0:35:09 car and he is going to take a
0:35:12 leap using his brewha filled power to
0:35:17 engage it in combat Lex with my normal
0:35:20 action cuz I am spending blood to take
0:35:23 all five of my
0:35:25 Celerity which actually put my
0:35:27 initiative down right uh yes it does but
0:35:29 I think we're still ballparking around
0:35:31 the same because of the torers um with
0:35:35 my normal considering I taking a leap
0:35:38 and bound at
0:35:40 vitel I can I I could conceivably split
0:35:44 that with an attack with the chainsaw
0:35:47 correct that movement plus a chainsaw
0:35:49 attack yes okay so let's do that so that
0:35:53 would split my dice Bol in half yes and
0:35:57 difficulty is 12 12 plus two difficulty
0:36:00 for a chainsaw plus two difficulty for
0:36:02 the use of vanish from The Mind's Eye
0:36:04 and plus two difficulty because it is in
0:36:07 Black metamorphosis so what does that
0:36:09 mean in terms of
0:36:11 dice you are rolling at difficulty 10
0:36:14 and we are going to ignore your first
0:36:16 two successes okay woof woof J chainsaws
0:36:21 increased difficulty does not give any
0:36:23 bonus dice to attack with it though
0:36:24 right it's just right right there are
0:36:26 hard to hit with but are explosive in
0:36:28 terms of damage right all right so my
0:36:30 dice pool is normally 10 um my deck is
0:36:34 Juiced up and I have a four for my
0:36:37 chainsaw all Celerity is going towards
0:36:39 extra actions um so I'm rolling five
0:36:42 dice and I will spend a willpower for an
0:36:44 automatic success
0:36:48 understood we ignore my first two yes so
0:36:51 that 10 is ignored a single success to
0:36:55 hit you [ __ ] hit dude
0:36:57 you I will expend a further blood for my
0:37:01 potent um before you do uh he will
0:37:04 sacrifice his City action and
0:37:08 Dodge three successes to dodge he says
0:37:12 to you oh Johnny I think you're about to
0:37:15 be
0:37:16 Prince his grace
0:37:19 seems indisposed along with his adopted
0:37:23 child who do I kill next and then it
0:37:28 is wind's turn so wi is going to run
0:37:31 again can I see into the car and can I
0:37:34 hear what Marcus just said yes and yes I
0:37:37 don't feel like I can get away with not
0:37:38 making a frenzy check go for it I will
0:37:41 spend a willpower because the urge to
0:37:43 murder is pretty strong I think Johnny
0:37:45 probably should also make a frenzy check
0:37:47 here now that you bring that up y see
0:37:49 now that he is closer and sees what's
0:37:51 happened to both miles and BR uh Johnny
0:37:55 he says to you pick which one I
0:38:00 kill two successes to not frenzy Johnny
0:38:03 how you doing
0:38:04 Johnny
0:38:07 botches and with a roar rips the chain
0:38:12 saw in half gasoline spills
0:38:17 everywhere and his fists start smoking
0:38:21 Johnny as you lose it you see Brea for
0:38:25 the first time in in torper and you
0:38:29 cannot visualize any difference between
0:38:32 her and your daughter and when he asks
0:38:35 you to pick which one dies you lose it
0:38:38 you're gone so wi will take a minute a
0:38:40 pause a beat more than anything take a
0:38:44 strangely necessary breath to focus her
0:38:48 awful claws will extend and she charges
0:38:52 okay uh it will take you this solar
0:38:55 action to reach him mhm but that is uh
0:38:58 your turn mhm next it goes to vitel he
0:39:03 reaches down grabs your prince by the
0:39:08 collar and pulls him into the back seat
0:39:12 and the two of them cross through that
0:39:15 shadow and disappear somewhere
0:39:18 else and then he will kneel yes um he
0:39:24 will take an action against you okay
0:39:27 from his globe of Darkness of course he
0:39:28 will your eyeballs are swallowed by
0:39:32 flapping flits of like moving physical
0:39:36 Darkness you gain the blind flaw okay uh
0:39:39 that is his turn great and I have no
0:39:41 idea where he went huh rule me a pering
0:39:45 yeah I know can I can I make a
0:39:47 perception test like that yeah you just
0:39:49 can't use Mental disciplines and stuff
0:39:51 but you can like sniff the air look
0:39:53 around be pharoh and be like he's that
0:39:54 way and just like go [ __ ] running at
0:39:56 him uh this difficulty is eight no
0:39:58 successes okay um so Johnny's first uh
0:40:01 Celerity action would be spent reaching
0:40:04 into that pit of Darkness that he went
0:40:06 went into and just basically tearing the
0:40:09 part the the car I need you to roll a
0:40:11 die a seven okay you do not roll damage
0:40:14 on bra this turn may I make another
0:40:16 perception test for my second slity
0:40:18 action no vital is going to take a sity
0:40:20 action
0:40:22 okay he moves deeper into the home your
0:40:27 action I'm sorry deeper into the into
0:40:29 where the house the home the house that
0:40:31 he crashed into is that is that where in
0:40:34 the one that he crashed into or yes okay
0:40:36 yep uh you're going to roll perception
0:40:38 plus alertness but it's against his deck
0:40:40 plus stealth uh you are at difficulty
0:40:42 I'll spend a
0:40:43 willpower four successes yeah actually
0:40:45 you have an idea as to where in the
0:40:47 house he's moved to God damn all right
0:40:50 damn all
0:40:51 right I did not expect that at all um so
0:40:55 seeing a flash of movement in the house
0:40:57 Johnny's head whips up and he will spend
0:41:01 this action to leap at Vel in the house
0:41:05 okay so that's my Celerity two okay on
0:41:10 Celerity three Vel turns and grabs at
0:41:13 you he grabs you with four successes I
0:41:16 think he's got me it goes to your turn I
0:41:19 will attempt with my Celerity three I
0:41:22 will attempt to break the grapple okay
0:41:24 uh you rolling at difficulty eat for
0:41:26 this his obious gay4 does not help him
0:41:28 but his the black metamorphosis makes
0:41:30 him very good at grappling by the way
0:41:32 while he is in contact with you you will
0:41:34 take a penalty to your stamina it is
0:41:36 reduced by one okay as a a chilling
0:41:39 effect seeps into your
0:41:41 flesh he has 14
0:41:45 successes I have 11 successes to break
0:41:48 okay he holds on he will hold his
0:41:51 remaining Celerity action to seize
0:41:54 control of you should you break free of
0:41:55 him in order to take any other actions
0:41:57 against him I have I have to break right
0:41:59 yes you do Celerity 4 will be used to
0:42:01 break this grapple with
0:42:04 [Music]
0:42:05 Vel nine successes he has 15 again with
0:42:09 his remaining Celerity action that he
0:42:11 was holding uh he is going to perform a
0:42:15 clinch maneuver and how's that work uh
0:42:17 actually no he's going to bite you he
0:42:20 has 13 successes to hit Jesus Christ yes
0:42:23 he does yeah that was 410 he will take
0:42:26 three traits of blood from you you have
0:42:28 one more Celerity action remaining let's
0:42:30 try and break the grapple
0:42:33 okay Johnny has 13 successes and he is
0:42:37 going to attempt to reverse the grapple
0:42:40 onto
0:42:41 vitel oo okay so Marcus vitel has 12
0:42:46 successes causing you to reverse the
0:42:48 grapple that's on
0:42:52 [Music]
0:42:55 him
0:42:56 with that said that's the end of that
0:42:58 round we go on to the next one his
0:43:00 initial action is very clear he's going
0:43:03 to attempt yeah he's going to attempt to
0:43:05 reverse the grapple and retain control
0:43:08 of you uh he really wants this so he's
0:43:10 going to spend a point of wpow uh Johnny
0:43:12 will match him on the
0:43:14 willpower so Johnny did not roll the
0:43:16 best he only got a single success but
0:43:19 with his potents of eight he will have
0:43:22 nine successes
0:43:24 altogether he will 20 successes Jesus
0:43:27 Christ to reverse the grapple and while
0:43:29 hoisting you up in the air he grips
0:43:32 Johnny by the neck and this creature
0:43:36 that is there not there this living
0:43:39 embodiment of monstrous Shadows
0:43:43 Whispers as if conveying his thoughts to
0:43:47 the Johnny that is currently in the back
0:43:49 seat of his own body and he says it is
0:43:53 such a shame that she wants you I'm not
0:43:56 allowed to kill you Johnny but the rest
0:43:59 of your quarter is fair game win with no
0:44:03 ceremony with no wity oneliner uh win
0:44:07 attempts to Grapple Marcus you still
0:44:10 have to spend one getting here so on
0:44:12 city you'll be able to attempt to grab
0:44:13 him but this one yeah you make a full
0:44:16 run and you will arrive just in time to
0:44:19 hear what Marcus Vitel was whispering to
0:44:22 Johnny so on my normal can try and
0:44:25 reverse it one more time let's [ __ ]
0:44:26 take this [ __ ] back do it up he will
0:44:29 spend a point of blood to modify his
0:44:33 [Music]
0:44:35 potent 10 successes and then plus five
0:44:37 automatic successes that's 19 successes
0:44:39 to how did you not roll any ones I just
0:44:42 set it down for everyone to look at I
0:44:44 roll three ones you have the most swingy
0:44:47 luck for a player I've ever witnessed in
0:44:49 the tired of my
0:44:50 life no I just have the most consistent
0:44:53 spread of dice if I if I wrote like like
0:44:56 I'm going to roll once you give me a
0:44:58 pile of
0:44:59 [ __ ] all right all right all right
0:45:02 though Johnny is technically the
0:45:05 stronger Kindred in this moment vitel
0:45:10 demonstrates Millennia of marshall
0:45:13 training and leverages Johnny to the
0:45:15 ground
0:45:18 Neil uh I am currently blind actually uh
0:45:22 as you move forward a bit more on start
0:45:26 of your turn and the Shadows are left
0:45:28 behind so they were still there
0:45:29 obscuring your vision uh for that moment
0:45:31 but as you move you kind of realize you
0:45:33 can actually stayed in place right I was
0:45:36 actually going to ask whether my eye in
0:45:37 the sky [ __ ] mattered they're like
0:45:39 Tethered to your eyes but because your
0:45:41 eyes were incore they couldn't hold on
0:45:43 they just oh I see okay they're like
0:45:45 grappling your eyeballs gotcha that's
0:45:47 cool the worst the wor the worst Shadow
0:45:50 parasites are we'll get there what's
0:45:52 your turn so Neil's running it's going
0:45:54 to take him way too long to get anywhere
0:45:58 BR there but there's no fire yet Alex
0:46:00 you said I could see them through the
0:46:02 window or like through the hole in the
0:46:04 [ __ ] house yes you can see the two of
0:46:07 them wrestling back and forth Johnny is
0:46:11 struggling against this person but so
0:46:14 far he's he's doing it he's he's keeping
0:46:17 up weird contextual question They smash
0:46:20 through the wall are there like [ __ ]
0:46:21 water pipes and [ __ ] going off like
0:46:24 water everywhere great
0:46:26 so Neil as he's running the hand that's
0:46:29 not holding the mirror is going to reach
0:46:31 out and point towards that water and
0:46:33 then I'm going to try and twist it into
0:46:35 chains to latch onto this [ __ ] Marcus
0:46:39 vital thing and if I can't pull them off
0:46:43 Johnny then at least hold them down go
0:46:45 ahead and give me a roll so because this
0:46:47 is freshwater I'm at D4 for this roll I
0:46:51 will spend a willpower
0:46:53 okay with a willpower that is is eight
0:46:56 successes on that role nice okay to
0:46:59 break out he has to get eight uh over
0:47:02 eight successes on a strength roll uh
0:47:04 Pott's going to add but he's rolling a
0:47:06 difficulty eight okay so the water
0:47:09 coalesces into like literal chains and
0:47:11 just lashes out of all these like broken
0:47:14 flowing pipes and the pools of water on
0:47:15 the ground and just wraps around his
0:47:17 neck and his arms and just holds him in
0:47:19 place uh and Neil's just panting like
0:47:22 hold on I'm coming I'm sorry I'm I'm
0:47:24 coming
0:47:26 with nine successes son [ __ ] Johnny is
0:47:30 grappled from behind wait what and
0:47:34 holding on to him for the briefest
0:47:36 moment Renwick utilizes his Mastery of
0:47:40 the abast to attempt to calm John oh my
0:47:43 god I've never been so happy to not see
0:47:46 someone all right fine you don't work
0:47:48 with the
0:47:49 sabat yeah buddy yeah buddy with seven
0:47:53 successes he holds on to the the bruha
0:47:56 and calms him Johnny you have your wits
0:48:00 about you again and things are not
0:48:02 looking great you're currently being
0:48:04 held by Renwick and Demarcus vitel who
0:48:07 is also being held by these strings of
0:48:11 water that are all around him and
0:48:13 holding on to him like like the like
0:48:16 threads of spider webbing okay I believe
0:48:20 we go to
0:48:21 Celerity sounds about right black
0:48:24 metamorphosis tentacles will attend to
0:48:27 rip free from the chains of
0:48:31 water he casually tears free um but that
0:48:35 is his first action uh while holding
0:48:38 Johnny grappled Johnny he will feed
0:48:41 three from you I will take three lethal
0:48:44 H it is egg oh I'll take three EG is
0:48:46 actually specifically un soakable egg
0:48:48 because this is the process of
0:48:50 diabl
0:48:53 Renwick will initiate a grapple
0:48:56 against Marcus
0:48:59 vitel with only his willpower he is able
0:49:01 to hold on win wind's going to attempt
0:49:05 to murder the dick off of Marcus
0:49:07 vitel you may make your attack roll it
0:49:09 is at difficulty nine for you is that
0:49:12 because I can see in the darkness a
0:49:13 little better
0:49:16 yes two and then the willpower is three
0:49:18 so you hit with three successes I'm
0:49:20 going to be spending a blood for my new
0:49:22 fun levels of potent just to add
0:49:24 directly to damage
0:49:30 nine levels of egg coming at him he will
0:49:33 suffer one level of aggravated
0:49:35 damage as you wound Marcus
0:49:39 vitel Marcus vitel does not frenzy on
0:49:42 you first time he's taking damage in
0:49:44 some years huh it's been a while yeah uh
0:49:47 and on Celerity 2 Marcus vitel will
0:49:51 reverse the grapple on
0:49:54 Renwick
0:49:56 vital has nine successes nine
0:49:59 successes uh okay so they maintain
0:50:02 status quo they push and can maintains
0:50:05 his grapple yes all
0:50:07 right oh that round for Renwick you'll
0:50:10 feed who's feeding uh Renwick is feeding
0:50:13 on vitel oh all right uh which by the
0:50:16 way uh portions of his jaw playay open
0:50:20 and a horrific feeding tongue seeps out
0:50:23 from the back of his throat and starts
0:50:26 to suck from vitel solity
0:50:30 three Vel gets 17 successes to reverse
0:50:34 the
0:50:35 grapple it is
0:50:37 reversed oh [ __ ] 13 successes from
0:50:40 Renwick trying to
0:50:41 reverse that is uh renwick's Last Action
0:50:45 for the
0:50:46 round he does not reverse the grapple
0:50:49 that Marcus vitel has on him on Celerity
0:50:52 4 Marcus vitel takes his final action
0:50:54 for the round
0:50:56 he has eight successes to bite him seven
0:50:58 carry over he is biting for damage on
0:51:01 who Renwick
0:51:02 okay he bites for 11 levels of
0:51:05 aggravated
0:51:07 damage Renwick soaks
0:51:10 four uh health chart that's incap he
0:51:14 goes to incap with aggravated damage and
0:51:16 survives the attack
0:51:19 [ __ ] that's kind of not what I
0:51:22 expected B us budy that's the round
0:51:27 [Music]
0:51:31 yes at the start of round four wrestling
0:51:34 these two proud Kindred vitel casts his
0:51:39 gaze towards wi when I need you to make
0:51:44 a
0:51:45 dexterity plus a CT rule I'm going to
0:51:48 spend a willpower on this I must warn
0:51:51 you now that you are in the house there
0:51:54 is a net plus plus one difficulty to
0:51:56 this roll you will be rolling a
0:51:58 difficulty eight
0:52:00 okay three successes he has no successes
0:52:04 on his
0:52:05 role oh
0:52:12 really all
0:52:13 right so what the [ __ ] happens what does
0:52:16 this look like nothing happens nothing
0:52:20 Jesus that is that is the best outcome
0:52:23 yep yep yep I what he doing but that bad
0:52:27 I rolled it I left the dice there I
0:52:29 there are there are a pile of ones they
0:52:31 finally caught up to
0:52:33 Alx I knew they would
0:52:35 eventually they always
0:52:38 do [ __ ] good
0:52:41 yeah
0:52:43 okay wasn't by a lot but it was by
0:52:46 enough but that takes his turn Johnny we
0:52:49 go to
0:52:51 you it should be noted that Renwick is
0:52:55 is making the decision to spend the
0:52:56 point of WP power and ignore wound
0:52:58 penalties for the round and remains on
0:53:01 his feet
0:53:03 oh boy Jesus buddy Johnny is going to uh
0:53:08 hold his action question for narrative
0:53:11 reasons are Johnny's hands still hot and
0:53:16 smoking there is steam coming off of his
0:53:20 hands but it does not appear that they
0:53:23 are glowing hot or an like that not like
0:53:27 we have seen weather's
0:53:29 hands okay running out of options her
0:53:34 Coterie in shambles around her allies
0:53:37 following left and right when winds up
0:53:41 her hand and punches through the roof of
0:53:44 the car soaking her hand in volatile
0:53:47 liquids takes a lighter from her pocket
0:53:50 and lights up her claws neither of them
0:53:52 are dice rolls but I would be having you
0:53:54 split your your dice pool in order to do
0:53:56 that but this is you uh give me a
0:53:59 courage roll to see if you're willing to
0:54:02 set your hand a
0:54:04 blaze three okay you are willing to do
0:54:07 that give me a soak roll this is
0:54:09 aggravated damage and so that's just
0:54:11 fortitude yes okay three successes okay
0:54:16 you do not take any damage as the oil on
0:54:20 your hand burns and she has her eyes
0:54:24 fixed on Marcus vitel eyes glowing red
0:54:28 hair probably a mess but shimmering in
0:54:31 the light of the fire from her hand Neil
0:54:34 Neil will continue to run forwards uh
0:54:36 little trying to get closer to everybody
0:54:39 uh towards the car wreck sees the fire
0:54:42 and it's just going to once again uh
0:54:45 throw an arm out and try and bind Marcus
0:54:49 vital in place roll it I spend another
0:54:51 willpower for this with a willpower I
0:54:54 have 8 excesses okay good [ __ ] roll M
0:54:58 diff four is rad once again that like
0:55:02 web of water just whips out and
0:55:05 entangles Marcus Vitel pulling at him uh
0:55:09 so he needs to get eight successes on a
0:55:11 defate strength roll to get out and Neil
0:55:13 just continues to run and like mutter
0:55:16 under his breath like I'm I'm coming
0:55:18 hold on I I'll be there soon Renwick
0:55:20 attempts to escape good okay uh no
0:55:24 Renwick fails to escape
0:55:25 okay that becomes the end of normal
0:55:29 actions Johnny still has an action as
0:55:30 well that he's held so he's going to try
0:55:33 to escape as
0:55:35 well I have 10
0:55:38 successes
0:55:46 eat Johnny tears free that's all he's
0:55:50 got currently at the top of round four
0:55:54 Celerity
0:55:55 black metamorphosis tentacles attempt to
0:55:58 tear down these shackles of
0:56:02 water he has seven
0:56:08 successes thank
0:56:10 God I think wi is up next oh boy wi no
0:56:14 pressure y it's time for the Wimberly uh
0:56:17 yeah
0:56:19 the Wimberly with the Flaming claws
0:56:23 um because I'm on fire is there either a
0:56:27 dice bonus or not to the attack room
0:56:30 okay I got to check and see if we can
0:56:32 dodge yeah it just says you're trapped
0:56:35 okay yeah it's not an actual grapple
0:56:37 though so he can dodge
0:56:41 yep difficulty nine one success he
0:56:50 Dodges he avoids the attack this thing
0:56:53 is incredibly difficult to keep track of
0:56:56 mhm and it kind of flickers in and out
0:57:00 and even with your abilities to see in
0:57:03 the dark because of the red glow in your
0:57:05 eyes he's just too
0:57:07 elusive vital attempts to break free of
0:57:09 the shackles
0:57:12 again held that is two more actions to
0:57:23 go held
0:57:27 God it's okay I'm so [ __ ] stressed
0:57:30 dude I think we can see we we are all
0:57:34 like but holes clenched like right up to
0:57:36 the honestly final action for the
0:57:41 round held oh God oh my
0:57:45 [Music]
0:57:48 God next round holy [ __ ] this is at the
0:57:53 start of the round I'm GNA throw
0:57:58 up he spends a point of
0:58:01 willpower he starts to cackle and from
0:58:05 the
0:58:06 recesses of the room and the shroud of
0:58:10 night tentacles begin to move in the
0:58:15 dark eight of them in all all of them
0:58:19 with strength dexterity and stamina
0:58:21 equal to his abration rating start to
0:58:24 move move and reach toward their
0:58:27 intended
0:58:28 victims you may well have a chance but
0:58:31 it will not save your
0:58:33 prince it seems clear that some of these
0:58:36 tentacles are emerging from Prince Daven
0:58:40 port's Shadows do we know that by the
0:58:43 shape of them or just the implication
0:58:45 that they would be near him they're
0:58:46 literally like he's lying on the ground
0:58:49 and they're some of them are coming out
0:58:51 from under him where is Miles cuz I
0:58:54 don't think we've seen him up until he's
0:58:55 next to vital on the ground he had been
0:58:56 taken when he Shadow stepped Johnny oh
0:59:00 no seeing the tentacles uh spring up
0:59:05 Johnny recognizes a very bad moment
0:59:10 having Tangled with the sabat and
0:59:13 abration and being outnumbered by these
0:59:16 things before this is the time when you
0:59:18 get the [ __ ] out he reaches down and
0:59:21 Scoops up miles and puts his other arm
0:59:25 around Renwick and using every ounce of
0:59:29 of the strength he has left launches
0:59:32 himself out of this porch in a leap and
0:59:36 bound roll me strength plus
0:59:41 Athletics against his brawl I will be
0:59:43 spending a willpower to do
0:59:46 so six successes Marcus
0:59:50 vitel has 13 successes you leap away
0:59:55 but Renwick stays when what's your decks
0:59:58 currently a five okay uh the tentacles
1:00:01 are actually faster than you uh but Neil
1:00:03 is actually on a 15 uh so technically
1:00:05 Neil you do go before the tentacles Neil
1:00:08 is running still like running towards
1:00:10 the car where he thinks you know like
1:00:12 brda went down so I see Johnny leap out
1:00:15 Neil runs to the car sees brda on the
1:00:18 ground in torper Lex is she under any is
1:00:21 she like pinned under stuff or can I
1:00:24 just like grab her you can just slide
1:00:25 her up okay he only hesitates for a
1:00:27 second and then throws the mirror Shard
1:00:30 that he's been holding onto the ground
1:00:32 and it breaks and then he reaches down
1:00:34 and physically grabs BR and pulls her
1:00:37 out of the car only strong enough now to
1:00:39 do it because of the potent given to him
1:00:41 by Johnny and is going to attempt to
1:00:43 like vanish and just get her the [ __ ]
1:00:44 out of here roll it uh because I had to
1:00:47 split for picking her up and going uh I
1:00:50 will spend a willpower on the vanish
1:00:51 roll
1:00:53 understood does my lurking spec count it
1:00:56 sure does all right what's his witz
1:00:59 alertness total is
1:01:01 11 so I need tens I had around I had two
1:01:06 tens so I ignore the first success so
1:01:10 that is five successes minus the one for
1:01:14 uh the thing so I do not have that many
1:01:17 I do still have four successes though
1:01:19 okay not enough probably to make him
1:01:21 forget that I was here but as far as
1:01:23 Neil is aware for now uh he will pick up
1:01:26 BR and just disappear
1:01:32 tentacles I need someone to do me the
1:01:35 quick favor of rolling what becomes
1:01:38 eight dice of silak for uh Renwick R
1:01:41 late dice yes please okay and then be
1:01:44 ready to do that a few times for me mhm
1:01:48 he has two
1:01:50 successes two of the tentacles grab hold
1:01:52 of Renwick one
1:01:55 pops his head from the body and his body
1:01:57 falls slump beginning to wither
1:02:02 away damn it that is the tentacles have
1:02:05 no more viable targets so that's them
1:02:08 when actually no when you're there
1:02:10 tentacle two I will attempt to Grapple
1:02:13 you okay first attack has three
1:02:15 successes against you five successes you
1:02:19 avoid the first tentacle second
1:02:21 tentacle second tentacle has seven
1:02:23 successes to grab
1:02:25 when spends a blood for shattered fog
1:02:27 and becomes
1:02:29 M okay uh when you're
1:02:33 misted you staying moving what are you
1:02:35 doing where Johnny's out right Johnny's
1:02:38 out renwick's dead renwick's dead miles
1:02:42 is with Johnny and BR is with Neil when
1:02:45 aims
1:02:47 for an exit okay so you start missing
1:02:50 out yep okay is it possible to get out
1:02:55 out of range of the tentacles but still
1:02:57 within range of the destroyed car no
1:03:00 okay then she will just boogie I'll take
1:03:03 five attempts to break free of the water
1:03:06 shackles seven successes not
1:03:09 enough next
1:03:12 attempt no this is
1:03:15 city2 City
1:03:18 3
1:03:21 nope he does not
1:03:23 Escape
1:03:28 top of the round it's him again win mhm
1:03:32 roll me deck plus a CT your difficulty
1:03:34 is
1:03:37 seven five successes five
1:03:41 successes beats his
1:03:46 four that's him Johnny are you
1:03:49 continuing to beat Feed or what yeah
1:03:51 Johnny Johnny's gonna fle uh flee to the
1:03:53 uh to the car
1:03:54 uh Johnny at this point you and anyone
1:03:57 you are carrying have exited combat Neil
1:04:00 as far as I know I'm in obate and I've
1:04:02 got BR so I'm I just got to run I don't
1:04:05 have fancy super speeds or anything um
1:04:08 are you leaving the fight yes yeah it is
1:04:10 my intention to um get the [ __ ] out of
1:04:13 here and start like stealthing my way
1:04:16 out of here as best I can okay you may
1:04:18 do so it's time to go I got to get I got
1:04:21 to get out of here I got to get them out
1:04:22 of here win what you doing staying
1:04:26 between Neil and the horrible house to
1:04:30 ensure that if something is coming
1:04:32 through I'm there but it's kind of a
1:04:35 pointless thing to do because I'm missed
1:04:37 and can't really do actions against
1:04:39 people you returned to your normal form
1:04:41 at the end of the run that you use M
1:04:43 form so you are you he's also vanished
1:04:45 yeah also I don't know if you know where
1:04:47 I am yeah you have lost track of uh
1:04:50 everyone else at this point I suspect I
1:04:52 saw Johnny scarper
1:04:54 yes when will trust that her people are
1:04:59 out and she will exit toine exit leave
1:05:05 the scene leave the fight how are you
1:05:08 doing it I don't think we've ever
1:05:09 actually seen win in missed form so this
1:05:12 cloud of red coalesces into win looking
1:05:16 angry and pissed and she turns and
1:05:23 runs
1:05:28 before the round is over vital breaks
1:05:32 [Music]
1:05:35 free top of the round win mhm he
1:05:40 spending for more Celerity you have your
1:05:42 means of Escape is not actually fast
1:05:45 enough to escape this
1:05:49 vampire when you start to feel you're a
1:05:54 emotions getting twisted and nodded and
1:05:59 [ __ ] with bad and every bad sensation
1:06:02 you've had for the past year losing
1:06:05 people rejection being condescended
1:06:08 everything comes rushing back to you but
1:06:12 because of the iron heart that was
1:06:14 instilled upon
1:06:16 you you do not submit to the spark of
1:06:20 Rage that he attempts to ignite in you
1:06:23 oh not enter frenzy thank you
1:06:27 Johnny he seems content to watch you and
1:06:32 hit you with it over and over and over
1:06:36 until you inevitably break
1:06:39 so I need to know what you will do to
1:06:43 get out of his line of sight am I hemmed
1:06:46 in at this point literally by the way
1:06:48 that was like because of the plus one
1:06:51 difficulty God damn what kind kind of
1:06:55 nature settings do we have here is this
1:06:57 just like Lawns or is there Lawns okay
1:07:00 how close is the nearest house you can
1:07:03 probably get to it with a full run all
1:07:05 right um wind still has the benefit of
1:07:08 potent four right sure does would that
1:07:10 help me jump further to get a head start
1:07:13 yes you would be making a strength
1:07:16 Athletics rule at difficulty 4 three
1:07:18 yards per success which arguably is
1:07:21 further than this like six steps around
1:07:24 yeah you've seen Johnny Hulk jump
1:07:26 strength Athletics plus four Dions all
1:07:31 right do I add those in or they just
1:07:32 count as four successes are you spending
1:07:34 the a point of blood I will then it's
1:07:36 four successes
1:07:38 okay it's the best role I've had all
1:07:40 night by the way nine successes plus
1:07:44 four so 13 successes God damn dude
1:07:47 you're in the house crash into the
1:07:49 window you have now broken his line of
1:07:52 sight she will not stop she will just
1:07:55 keep running and jump out the other
1:07:56 window and keep running you see behind
1:07:59 you where he's coming from and the room
1:08:01 you leap into just as you're going into
1:08:03 the next room and starting to make your
1:08:04 Escape was engulfed in flames and as
1:08:07 you're leaving out of the house you see
1:08:09 him simply go outside and gestures to
1:08:13 different homes and begins to burn the
1:08:15 neighborhood down hunting
1:08:18 you do you stay or go I'll

1:09:29 time
1:09:30 [Music]
1:09:35 Kindred you'll talk guys you're on
1:09:38 15 I don't think we have a chance of
1:09:40 taking vitel down
1:09:42 here I do think we have a chance of
1:09:44 escaping now but I'm willing to [ __ ]
1:09:48 double down if you guys are but I'm
1:09:50 thinking the best our our best bet of
1:09:54 getting out of this because I think it's
1:09:56 a long shot to take vitel down I don't
1:09:58 think I can do it in a single round and
1:10:00 the second those tentacles get to act
1:10:01 we're [ __ ] because I need to tank and
1:10:04 then I need to do stuff so I I am I am
1:10:07 at least probably two rounds away from
1:10:09 able to do anything and that's going to
1:10:10 require a lot of Lucky rolles now I
1:10:14 think I can probably grab Miles and
1:10:18 Renwick and I can jump the [ __ ] out of
1:10:20 here it may be a strength check to hold
1:10:23 on to with because I think vitel still
1:10:25 has him but I think I could jump the
1:10:28 hell out of here when I think you can
1:10:31 get out of here as well right I have
1:10:33 Celerity one they don't need to go far
1:10:36 so um because he's got no sality at this
1:10:38 point wi's also completely
1:10:41 uninjured and very willing to buy time
1:10:44 brida is in a car away from the house um
1:10:47 torper Neil you're near her and you
1:10:50 could probably maybe get her the hell
1:10:52 out I'm going to be soon soon so y'all
1:10:57 are we fighting or are we
1:11:02 running or Lex do you want to make us
1:11:05 [ __ ] choose with a werewolf
1:11:11 style
1:11:13 pole Erica if you get the [ __ ] out of
1:11:17 there I can wall him off I mean he can
1:11:20 [ __ ] teleport all right let's pause
1:11:22 on table talk for a moment I know
1:11:25 sometimes we need it to loosen the
1:11:27 stress and have a cohesive story yeah
1:11:29 but
1:11:30 now all of you have a means of texting
1:11:32 me or sending me a chat
1:11:35 message uh one word stay or
1:11:43 go I don't think we get
1:11:46 phones uh
1:11:48 no
1:11:52 awesome
1:11:56 is this our let me ask a clarifying
1:11:59 question if I can is this our general
1:12:02 Vibe of what we want to do or is this
1:12:04 like prescriptive to our
1:12:08 actions example what I mean by that is
1:12:13 like if I choose one thing and then I
1:12:16 see everyone else's not doing that thing
1:12:20 probably going to change my mind since
1:12:21 I'm out in the street you know what I
1:12:24 mean I can tell you what my vibe
1:12:27 is what give me your uh intended uh
1:12:31 course of
1:12:32 action uh again just the one word
1:12:38 and if everyone's is the same I think we
1:12:42 can actually pretty much go to narration
1:12:45 if it's different I want to resolve
1:12:48 those intended actions from people who
1:12:49 have different actions
1:12:51 intended I've sent you a
1:13:02 message why you got to respond like
1:13:05 that yeah that was awful he say noted to
1:13:08 you he said noted to me what a [ __ ]
1:13:10 Frick what a dick God damn it I [ __ ]
1:13:13 hate that change the [ __ ] mood of the
1:13:15 [Laughter]
1:13:21 table all right I have
1:13:23 have
1:13:25 four out of the three people I needed
1:13:28 just one more and we're good to
1:13:31 go wait what that is the correct math I
1:13:34 don't know what to tell
1:13:40 you I require more than one word to
1:13:43 explain what I want oh I said more than
1:13:45 one word too he said follow the [ __ ]
1:13:48 rules that's why you got noted I had
1:13:52 already that's [ __ ] I sent the word
1:13:54 go that's why you got to note it next
1:14:00 question I also wanted to explain it's
1:14:03 good to know that both me and Rebecca
1:14:05 also responded to no it doesn't
1:14:10 matter all right well while Eric is
1:14:13 writing the word go for the next 12
1:14:15 minutes I'm GNA go pee I'm done well
1:14:17 [ __ ] then go pee pee right here no we'll
1:14:21 make eye contact and I can
1:14:26 I probably could I really do have let
1:14:31 go Alex's got to think I'm ready thanks
1:14:35 Rob I guess we'll just be here go pee
1:14:38 Jesus Christ no what I'm [ __ ] with

1:14:43 capital noted I don't

1:15:16 record like that was not me like like
