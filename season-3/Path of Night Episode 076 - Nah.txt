0:00:30 now let's walk the path of
0:00:33 [Music]
0:00:39 night last time on path of
0:00:44 Night Neil and wind talked about the
0:00:46 horror of the negotiation with pen
0:00:48 dragon and wind's current Death
0:00:52 Wish miles thwarted a Stak and baked
0:00:55 plot to kidnap Eden and commanded one of
0:00:57 the pack to spy on the sabat for the
0:00:59 quarter
0:01:01 miles BR and Eden danced together
0:01:04 attempting to salvage some
0:01:09 [Music]
0:01:28 hope
0:01:33 Neil it's been an awkward night in some
0:01:38 ways intriguing in other ways deeply
0:01:43 frightening you slipped away from the
0:01:45 throng and find your way more towards
0:01:48 the entrance to the Rave what do you do
0:01:52 after everything that's happened tonight
0:01:54 and then going to chase down wind to
0:01:57 have that rooftop conversation
0:02:00 looking around seeing his other Cod
0:02:03 remates dancing on the dance floor
0:02:07 inside Neil's actually thinking about a
0:02:10 lot of that sort of awkward and place
0:02:12 his life and wants to call Nara but
0:02:16 because she's actually in the city now
0:02:19 he doesn't want to use the the like dead
0:02:22 drop line that they used to send little
0:02:24 messages to each other on he wants to
0:02:27 actually call her and so he's sort of
0:02:31 selfishly looking for Johnny because
0:02:34 he's been made aware that Johnny as the
0:02:36 sen all has uh one of the new asites in
0:02:39 the city is working for him or with him
0:02:43 and he knows that you know miles used to
0:02:44 have like a the contact information from
0:02:46 everybody so he's just looking for
0:02:47 Johnny and he also kind of wants to
0:02:49 check it in Johnny because there's been
0:02:51 a [ __ ] lot like if it's been a lot
0:02:53 for me it's probably been a lot for him
0:02:55 so I'm probably going to look around if
0:02:57 I don't see him inside probably going to
0:03:00 look outside where everybody goes to
0:03:02 gather to smoke just assuming he might
0:03:04 be out there when you go outside to
0:03:07 where people are smoking you are met
0:03:10 with this cloud of nicotine and actually
0:03:14 takes a moment to step through it the
0:03:16 haze and actually see what's going on
0:03:19 out there and in this sea of poorly
0:03:21 parked
0:03:22 cars you find two individuals who have
0:03:28 drawn the ATT attention of the crowd one
0:03:31 of them smoking a cigarette running his
0:03:34 fingers through greasy hair and pacing
0:03:38 back and forth and the other one is
0:03:42 Johnny Johnny you're
0:03:44 outside weathers SUV is not 10 ft away
0:03:48 from you your boy he's smoking
0:03:51 cigarettes my cigarettes your cigarettes

0:03:57 it and he's
0:04:00 rambling Johnny this [ __ ] he has no
0:04:04 respect bruart is supposed to be about

0:04:09 poets good men not [ __ ] Blue Blood
0:04:12 princes Johnny Johnny lifts up a hand
0:04:15 and then Jabs Kabir in the chest with
0:04:19 wies ever so
0:04:20 slightly bruha are about honor why the
0:04:24 [ __ ] do you think I'm here as he
0:04:27 emphasizes his point with a baseball bat
0:04:29 that Johnny has somehow procured imagine
0:04:33 it's not
0:04:34 hard he looks up at Johnny the MC with
0:04:39 genuine hope in his eyes forgive me
0:04:43 brother I was wrong and whatever you
0:04:47 have as far as Beef goes with
0:04:50 weathers he is an honorable man and he
0:04:53 is going to stomp us into the pavement
0:04:55 and put us into into uh torper I hope
0:04:58 you know that I think we have a chance
0:05:00 no Johnny kind of like gives him a like

0:07:21 of psycho just like memorizes all those
0:07:23 numbers like that Neil looks a little
0:07:25 crestfallen at the idea that if it was
0:07:28 her house number maybe but we don't have
0:07:30 house numbers anymore well that's
0:07:34 fair
0:07:35 uh you it's it's fine this this can I I
0:07:38 suppose this can wait can wait okay
0:07:42 so he just looks between the two of them
0:07:46 Neil are you in why would I be in grab
0:07:49 one of those spray cans Neil just
0:07:51 reflexively bends down and picks up a
0:07:53 spray can why I don't know where to
0:07:55 spray some [ __ ] on the car oh God uh I
0:07:59 don't I don't have beef with weathers
0:08:01 Kabir you're the artistic one help him
0:08:03 figure out something to put on the side
0:08:05 of this thing this is hey man it's dick
0:08:07 or something I don't know it's not
0:08:09 my throw a big headyy dick Johnny uh's
0:08:14 already mad at me Johnny puts out a fist
0:08:16 to a Kabir he [ __ ] bumps his
0:08:19 comparatively diminutive fist against
0:08:22 the fist goes over towards Neil Lex
0:08:26 before bumping the fist or doing
0:08:27 anything with Johnny Neil around are any
0:08:31 of the brewha who like within the last
0:08:33 hour thought I was kind of cool In This
0:08:35 Crowd well here cuz that's going to make
0:08:37 a big [ __ ] difference about my I need
0:08:40 a courage roll at
0:08:42 difficulty to leave Johnny hanging that
0:08:46 I was going to say [ __ ] the other the
0:08:47 other brewha you got you're going to
0:08:49 leave me hanging front of brewha oh God
0:08:51 CU I got a baseball bat in my hands my
0:08:54 man you better we're bumping one way or
0:08:58 another
0:09:02 you're right I rolled a one in a
0:09:04 two yeah that's a [ __ ] botch Neil
0:09:08 crumbles under the weight of peer
0:09:14 pressure the fist goes out and it's it's
0:09:17 so tentative but he can't help himself
0:09:20 from doing it and the fist with the
0:09:21 [ __ ] spray can goes out let's do this
0:09:25 and Johnny starts going to work on
0:09:27 weather's truck with a [ __ ] baseball
0:09:29 bat all right give me a strength plus
0:09:34 Athletics rule uh both of you help pad
0:09:37 do you want Rob to botch this session
0:09:39 man wait of strength plus Athletics to
0:09:42 spray paint the car I suppose it could
0:09:44 be crafts yeah Dex craft I'll take a DEX
0:09:46 crafts okay we'll do the same pool so it
0:09:48 doesn't matter do I uh do I get a bonus
0:09:50 from the baseball bat uh plus two dice
0:09:53 excellent it's going to shatter
0:09:54 immediately cuz I'm going to use a blood
0:09:55 a point of blood to get extra successes
0:09:57 from bons done uh hey Lex failing a
0:10:00 courage check that much uh I'm going to
0:10:03 mask him a thousand faces so I don't
0:10:04 look like me okay are you sure
0:10:08 difficulty here
0:10:09 Lex are you sure difficulty six your
0:10:13 difficulty is six cool I botched
0:10:16 again Neil like looks at Johnny as he
0:10:20 does his
0:10:21 thing all right man yeah and you see his
0:10:24 form start to Shimmer a little bit so he
0:10:26 just looks like one of the generic
0:10:27 brewha for like a half a second before
0:10:30 he nervously puts the spray paint up
0:10:34 holds it down in the wrong way so it
0:10:36 sprays directly into his own face
0:10:39 dropping the illusion immediately so now
0:10:41 it's just a paint covered [ __ ]
0:10:43 Neel but because that's a d that's two
0:10:46 [ __ ] botes in a row in for a penny I
0:10:48 like as he just goes oh God my eyes and
0:10:52 as he turns does spray across the car
0:10:56 Johnny gets 10 successes to mess this
0:10:58 car up
0:11:00 describe how you execute the vehicle
0:11:04 Street Fighter style the uh the first
0:11:06 swing pretty much takes off the front
0:11:09 end uh he Cleaves through the the uh One
0:11:13 Headlight through the grill into and out
0:11:16 the other headlight pretty much letting
0:11:19 the uh the bumper fall down to the
0:11:21 ground the whole chassis shakes in a way
0:11:24 reminiscent of a of a uh 16bit video
0:11:27 game the that does not survive the
0:11:30 initial swing and Johnny just balls up
0:11:33 his fists and just starts going to work
0:11:35 on the the whole thing as he basically
0:11:38 kind of does a whole tour around the
0:11:40 vehicle windows are smashed doors are
0:11:44 pulled off tires are punctured this
0:11:47 thing is just a pile of wreckage by the
0:11:50 time johnny makes a full
0:11:52 rotation Neil is like desperately trying
0:11:55 to rub like wipe red paint out of his
0:11:58 face
0:11:59 and then like leaning against the car so
0:12:01 even though he's not even trying to
0:12:02 spray pan anymore like accidentally
0:12:04 leaving [ __ ] red handprints with his
0:12:06 perfect [ __ ] handprint all over the
0:12:09 car Kabir will actually help and try to
0:12:12 wipe Neil's eyes before turning his
0:12:15 attention to the rims and Axle of what
0:12:19 remains of the SUV kicking it and
0:12:22 spitting on it and not really
0:12:26 accomplishing things in the way that
0:12:29 Johnny does but it is it is equally
0:12:32 demoralizing and the reason you know
0:12:35 this is because on a soft Breeze Neil
0:12:40 you catch a whiff of the scent of a
0:12:43 cigar Neil [ __ ] freezes
0:12:46 uh
0:12:48 guys uh Johnny spends blood to put in
0:12:53 stamina guys
0:12:56 um I think I think weather's is got the
0:12:59 message is getting the message yep as
0:13:03 you look around the three of you
0:13:08 Amigos see
0:13:10 weathers who has
0:13:13 a tense expression on his
0:13:17 face
0:13:18 he has his car keys in his hand and very
0:13:22 slowly as if beginning to understand the
0:13:26 circumstance he finds himself in
0:13:29 he begins to put the key back in his
0:13:34 pocket god I hope he rolls okay on
0:13:36 self-control kind of don't it's gonna be
0:13:39 way funnier yeah we know what you want
0:13:41 Johnny leans into Kabir grabs Kabir by
0:13:45 lapel and like Smiles at him and goes if
0:13:47 I got to die tonight I'm glad it's next
0:13:49 to my brother and like gives him like a
0:13:52 harsh pat on the on the shoulder and
0:13:55 we'll spend a point of willpower to
0:13:56 extend iron heart to uh Kabir he
0:13:59 unabashedly hugs Johnny as if this was
0:14:03 your final moments together Neil you
0:14:06 might want to get out of
0:14:07 here can should we all get out of here
0:14:14 nah there ain't nowhere to
0:14:16 [Laughter]
0:14:23 go
0:14:26 nah you stay right there now
0:14:35 he closes a hand into a fist and you can
0:14:40 hear the audible popping noise that it
0:14:43 makes it puts his cigar out he takes a
0:14:47 deep unnecessary
0:14:49 breath and flies into a rage oh no he
0:14:54 has failed his self-control
0:14:57 track
0:15:00 weathers will be going on a 26
0:15:02 initiative healthy 22 Neil how you doing
0:15:06 I go on
0:15:09 11 I don't like that face okay hold
0:15:13 on oh God a fight breaks out in an
0:15:18 instant weathers is leveraging one of
0:15:22 kabir's arms grasping in his hand
0:15:26 twisting him so he's bent down and
0:15:29 essentially in a tight perfectly
0:15:31 executed grapple and rather than holding
0:15:35 him in a simple chicken wing what have
0:15:37 you he shatters the arm completely
0:15:40 drives it into his rib cage and Kabir
0:15:43 lies on the ground as a torpid broken
0:15:47 husk weathers doesn't growl he doesn't
0:15:50 Roar he doesn't demonstrate any of the
0:15:53 usual signs of a vampire in frenzy boy
0:15:58 stands up up straight looking for his
0:16:00 next Target it is clear that he is in
0:16:04 the midst of a frenzy Kabir has taken 18
0:16:07 levels of lethal damage oh Jesus Christ
0:16:09 Jesus
0:16:11 Christ lethal well technically bashing
0:16:14 but then like had roll okay so okay okay
0:16:16 okay okay I was going to say cuz I think
0:16:18 that I'm pretty sure he's gone my man I
0:16:20 don't think we survive 18
0:16:22 levelset of bashing we can yeah that
0:16:24 he's a [ __ ] pink Mist at this
0:16:26 point that's still not good but no it's
0:16:29 no he does not have any Celerity actions
0:16:32 though I have noticed cuz he was going
0:16:34 on a 26 yeah neither why
0:16:38 Johnny is going to execute a uh time
0:16:42 honor tradition the good old fashion
0:16:45 Full Nelson that's what I like to hear a
0:16:48 healthy 15 dice
0:16:51 pool seven successes to grab weathers
0:16:54 and put him into a lock it feels like
0:16:58 like you were grappling a marble
0:17:00 statue but for the moment you have him
0:17:04 after he locks in Johnny cannot help
0:17:07 himself but give weathers a little peck
0:17:09 on the cheek The Crowd Goes oh it's it's
0:17:12 unclear as to who they're upset for or
0:17:14 panicking for but they know something
0:17:17 just
0:17:21 happened I suspect she's been trying to
0:17:25 get Bri to come outside for some fresh
0:17:27 air and about the time she's trying to
0:17:30 get her to come out is when the sounds
0:17:32 of utter war crimes being done to this
0:17:36 Escalade I kind of figure that at that
0:17:39 prompt fro would have looked over to
0:17:41 Miles and asked Sim do you want to come
0:17:44 out with us sir do you want to keep an
0:17:45 eye on Eden oh keeping an eye on Eden
0:17:49 I'll teach her a few more things she's
0:17:51 really enjoying dancing with you she's
0:17:54 you're kind of helping us all keep in
0:17:55 good spirits got to take the winds we
0:17:57 get BR offers a small smile to Miles um
0:18:03 I think I'm the win you've
0:18:05 got she kind of finger guns at the two
0:18:07 of them BR does give like the quiet kind
0:18:11 of GH laugh well let you know what's
0:18:13 going on outside he starts dancing with
0:18:16 Eden shoes them
0:18:17 off all right he's i'll text you and
0:18:22 when and brda make their way
0:18:27 outside
0:18:29 Neil first s courage Tech yeah no
0:18:34 [ __ ] what's the difficulty six I got one
0:18:38 success all
0:18:39 right my boy's in danger I can stick it
0:18:42 around your Beast has strong feelings
0:18:45 about you remaining here hey Johnny uh
0:18:48 great instincts but I really think we
0:18:49 should run and I'm going to uh vanish
0:18:52 from The Mind's Eye on myself Johnny and
0:18:55 Kabir cuz I am worried that if Johnny
0:18:57 lets him go go he'll just go and kill
0:19:00 Kabir so that's what I'm going to do go
0:19:03 for it you guys who are coming out
0:19:05 arrive just in time to see this pre them
0:19:08 Vanishing yeah you you see what what is
0:19:11 happening now and we'll see the vanish
0:19:13 if it goes off other blood is spent up
0:19:15 strength as br's walking out with wind
0:19:18 she's taking her cell phone off of her
0:19:20 thigh high and just using her chin to
0:19:22 flip it open she meant it when she said
0:19:24 she's going to text Miles but she kind
0:19:26 of looks up from her phone screen
0:19:28 and sees this and her big eyes go wide
0:19:32 and she looks over to win wi had
0:19:36 probably been kind of like holding br's
0:19:37 hand as they came out just to kind of
0:19:39 like lead her through the crowd yeah BR
0:19:41 would happily accept that help and upon
0:19:43 seeing this the hand is like abruptly
0:19:46 dropped what's weather's wits plus
0:19:48 Alerus uh nine oh
0:19:53 Jesus does my lurking spec count yes
0:19:57 absolutely okay away then I have five
0:20:01 successes uh technically that means we
0:20:05 completely disappear yep but I'm
0:20:07 assuming he's got more willpower than
0:20:08 five he does anybody who doesn't and
0:20:11 sees us disappear like that has to make
0:20:12 a courage check or freak out like
0:20:14 Mortals running away or whatever or like
0:20:16 people who got their willpower uh haved
0:20:20 right
0:20:23 yes if you succeed you're fine if you
0:20:26 fail you gawk for two turns trying to
0:20:29 comprehend what the [ __ ] just happened
0:20:32 three successes so you're good Neil just
0:20:35 says that to Johnny and then disappears
0:20:37 from sight Kabir disappears from sight
0:20:39 and Johnny may or may not I mean yeah I
0:20:42 [ __ ] do it but
0:20:44 like I ain't going nowhere at the end of
0:20:48 the round Rob's like [ __ ]
0:20:50 off I miss Ira a trio of three people
0:20:55 come walking towards this Ruckus
0:20:58 one of them has a [ __ ] Katana slung
0:21:03 over his shoulder and he goes who's
0:21:05 [ __ ] with my ride and you immediately
0:21:08 recognize Rufio and then kind of like
0:21:12 with with Johnny on his back where
0:21:15 there's turns and it just kind of jerks
0:21:17 Johnny along for the ride and the three
0:21:20 of
0:21:21 them turn around and continue walking as
0:21:25 though they had never begun to interact
0:21:27 with this
0:21:30 fight and head off to mind their own
0:21:35 [Music]
0:21:38 business new
0:21:40 round I believe there is a consisted
0:21:42 grapple check that needs to happen there
0:21:44 is I will spend blood to uh get
0:21:48 successes on my grapple uh my my
0:21:53 strength Johnny has 11 successes to lock
0:21:56 this grapple in wethers isign a 22 this
0:21:59 round oh uh
0:22:01 oh uh oh if I intend to use a DOT of
0:22:05 Celerity just to hold to dodge do I need
0:22:08 to spend blood for that yes you do all
0:22:10 right then I will be spending a blood uh
0:22:11 weathers and Johnny are going on the
0:22:12 same action I think right uh yes so he's
0:22:15 breaking try attempting to break with
0:22:17 his yep all right so yeah I've got 11
0:22:20 successes to hold that grapple in he has
0:22:22 13 to break free
0:22:25 and we go to
0:22:28 um Johnny it's your turn Johnny will re
0:22:32 will realize that he is not able to
0:22:34 overpower the old man so we'll try a
0:22:37 different type of uh of grappling
0:22:40 maneuver on him
0:22:42 so when he Maneuvers Johnny off the way
0:22:46 he does it is it is a hard step back and
0:22:49 he slams your back against a car not
0:22:52 enough it doesn't hurt you but it's
0:22:54 enough to loosen your grip and he slips
0:22:56 out going wild and now what type of
0:22:59 grapple maneuver do you use to try to
0:23:01 get a hold of
0:23:03 him how does Johnny stay on the bull
0:23:05 Johnny uh immediately gets popped off
0:23:08 and like lets his arms go wide and as uh
0:23:12 weathers takes a step forward Johnny
0:23:14 kind of crouches down and springs
0:23:16 forward just sweeping out to sweep out
0:23:19 Le uh weather's legs to hopefully bring
0:23:22 it to the ground and then and hopefully
0:23:25 he can he can establish a better grapple
0:23:26 there whether he goes to the ground or
0:23:28 not who
0:23:31 knows uh seven successes to establish a
0:23:34 grapple so Johnny gets a hold of his
0:23:38 legs and experiences a frightening
0:23:43 sensation as he realizes that weathers
0:23:46 is an immovable object that
0:23:48 [ __ ] King of the Hill is a king
0:23:51 of the hill this is not but you do have
0:23:53 them grappled all right we go to that's
0:23:56 an anarch com is an anarch comi he's
0:23:59 been hanging out with the Maya wi wi as
0:24:04 fast as she can go jumps into weather's
0:24:07 ey line this is probably a bad move on
0:24:10 her part but one bad moves are kind of
0:24:13 the only moves she's got and she says
0:24:16 stop I will make this right I'm sorry
0:24:19 you got involved in this [ __ ] I will fix
0:24:22 your car please stop killing people
0:24:24 sorry please stop hurting my guys my
0:24:28 precious boys oh no my sweet
0:24:31 Sons uh and she will attempt to quell
0:24:34 him or to give him the opportunity to
0:24:36 come out of his frenzy so when you look
0:24:38 into his eyes M you've quelled Mortals
0:24:41 animals even Kindred on numerous
0:24:43 occasions in the past M but it's kind of
0:24:46 like the past when you have worked to
0:24:50 subdue Johnny's Beast where when when
0:24:54 these bruha fly into a frenzy it's like
0:24:57 something took them them away M and
0:24:58 they're gone and all that's there is
0:25:01 this unnatural engine of violence mhm so
0:25:06 you have to steal yourself a little bit
0:25:08 you exert the willpower and you make the
0:25:10 attempt you may rule for quell the Beast
0:25:13 with three or more successes the frenzy
0:25:16 vampire May rule again to pull herself
0:25:18 out of frenzy using the same difficulty
0:25:20 as the stimulus that caused the frenzy
0:25:24 originally four successes woo okay
0:25:28 let's see if he exits
0:25:32 frenzy he remains in
0:25:38 frenzy did I get the sense that it was
0:25:41 just he's too far gone or I need to keep
0:25:44 trying that depends on how you wish to
0:25:47 interpret it as as IID said before when
0:25:49 trying to call the Beast bruha have a
0:25:52 very loose grip on their Beast to begin
0:25:55 with so regaining control is is that
0:25:58 much harder for them essentially what's
0:26:00 going on is you are causing him to make
0:26:04 the self-control check to not frenzy but
0:26:06 because he's a bruha it's at plus two
0:26:08 difficulty right so he's just he's
0:26:11 failing the role and he has a a great
0:26:13 self-control score he's just a [ __ ]
0:26:15 bruha yeah have I made myself his new
0:26:18 Target um no he just looks down at
0:26:23 Johnny and steam starts to rise from his
0:26:26 fists oh no oh
0:26:29 no at this point the crowd of bruha
0:26:32 starts moving in uh including tiny it's
0:26:35 gotten a little too serious you still
0:26:37 got to break a grapple yeah it's not his
0:26:39 turn though uh it is br's turn so I have
0:26:43 spent one point of Celerity so that
0:26:45 should drop me to 15 which worked out
0:26:48 regardless is texting an action or an
0:26:50 item
0:26:51 interaction how long is the message I'm
0:26:54 going to give you a if it is longer it
0:26:56 is an action I'm I'm not going to get it
0:26:58 in time for whatever's happening I I but
0:27:03 there is more that I have on my mind
0:27:05 good or bad um so I unfortunately I do
0:27:09 have to commit the action because then
0:27:12 I'll text Smiles as fast as I possibly
0:27:16 can weathers toring Johnny and Kabir and
0:27:21 the second line is Rufio and crew headed
0:27:25 back inside eating question mark I'm
0:27:29 going to just send that off and flip the
0:27:33 cell phone back close and get ready for
0:27:36 the next moves okay at this point tiny
0:27:40 in a handful of the Brew have burned for
0:27:41 Celerity and are rushing to get to
0:27:44 Johnny and weathers tiny calls out
0:27:47 Johnny Don't Let Go Don't Let Go
0:27:53 Johnny all right let's do this I do like
0:27:56 that you know for the longest time in
0:27:57 this [ __ ] City like everyone shits on
0:27:59 weathers and then the one time weathers
0:28:01 loses his temper everyone freaks the
0:28:04 [ __ ] out all of those bruha who thought
0:28:06 they were hot [ __ ] and MTH off to him
0:28:08 they're quiet as [ __ ] right now they are
0:28:11 desperately minding their own business
0:28:13 Johnny's going to spend a willpower to
0:28:14 hold
0:28:16 on weathers has nine successes to break
0:28:19 free well I had nine successes to hold
0:28:21 him and 10 with the
0:28:23 willpower you hold on are we in sity
0:28:26 actions right now yes okay cuz before
0:28:28 that oh uh it's fine I'm just invisibly
0:28:32 dragging Kabir into the nearest Alleyway
0:28:35 cuz there's a [ __ ] ton of bruha and he's
0:28:37 invisible and in torate I don't want his
0:28:39 ass to get like I don't know crushed
0:28:40 under boots so I will just be like
0:28:43 invisibly grunting and pulling him into
0:28:46 an Alleyway just to get him out of the
0:28:47 way okay he attempts to break free again
0:28:51 and this time the other bruha are now
0:28:53 arriving to back you up I will not be
0:28:55 spending willpower on this role or maybe
0:28:56 I should
0:28:59 hey man you might need those to not get
0:29:01 killed I think that's what's I'm using
0:29:03 I'm using willpower now just to maintain
0:29:05 this grapple cuz once the other bruha
0:29:07 show up I'll have back up but they're
0:29:08 not here yet so willpower being spent
0:29:12 once again I am at 10 successes to
0:29:14 maintain the grapple weathers has rolled
0:29:16 15
0:29:18 successes you wrestle back and forth and
0:29:21 he gets this grip on the back of your
0:29:23 neck and tosses you over a car as he
0:29:27 does
0:29:29 oh no what did you
0:29:31 do with one
0:29:34 success tiny gets a hold on him and the
0:29:38 other bruha start piling on they can't
0:29:40 seem to wrestle him to the
0:29:43 ground they can't seem to quite
0:29:46 overpower him with the kind of
0:29:47 confidence that You' expect a crew of
0:29:49 bruha to be able to do but we come to a
0:29:52 new round City action what you do action
0:29:55 I don't think BR has an adequate
0:29:56 physical follow up to this situation so
0:29:59 I think instead for this moment she was
0:30:02 keeping the Celerity ready in case she
0:30:04 would need to spend the blood to Dodge I
0:30:06 think she re-evaluates and sends another
0:30:09 text that says NVM maybe beat it has
0:30:13 come on in the
0:30:16 club round
0:30:18 three are his fists still on fire or
0:30:21 emiting steam his body is radiating heat
0:30:25 oh God that's not helping I think my
0:30:27 name don't give me that look you know
0:30:28 what I'm about I do that's why I gave
0:30:30 you the look I think my initiative goes
0:30:32 back up to 16 weather's initiative drops
0:30:35 to a 20 oh
0:30:37 no mine remains a hot
0:30:40 11 Johnny's thrown over the car right
0:30:43 yep yep he uh lands on his feet sees
0:30:47 that alley nearby will take a uh few
0:30:50 bounding steps over there followed up by
0:30:53 a bounding leap so he is out of view of
0:30:55 just the regular Street on top of the
0:30:58 building and when he lands up there arms
0:31:01 stretch out and says let's go Tim yeah
0:31:06 Erica Rob mhm yes roll me eight dice
0:31:11 each and then add three automatic
0:31:15 successes as the group of bruha fight to
0:31:19 maintain a hold on this
0:31:24 guy are they blowing tense no that's
0:31:27 disappointing eight successes six
0:31:29 successes three
0:31:32 successes what you
0:31:35 do Lex stop having him blow T so
0:31:39 much like he's shrugging off a
0:31:42 coat the bruha that we're piling onto
0:31:45 him are shoved off and when he's done he
0:31:49 leaps up onto the roof in pursuit of
0:31:51 Johnny oh
0:31:53 no uh that's him so we will go BR and
0:31:58 win BR and win wi kind of very motivated
0:32:02 to try and fix this [ __ ] looks to BR a
0:32:05 little wide-eyed and says can you call
0:32:08 them back down here Johnny or weathers
0:32:12 get weathers Johnny will'll follow I
0:32:14 hate you right now well which is easier
0:32:17 I mean Johnny's easier but then I don't
0:32:19 know if he'll have time to do his
0:32:21 stuffff I I suspect one will follow the
0:32:23 other use your discretion I'll try
0:32:26 Weathers okay and wi will kind of
0:32:29 position herself so that when weathers
0:32:32 if weathers gets down there she is kind
0:32:35 of a bul workk sounds good go ahead and
0:32:38 roll for summon I'll spend a
0:32:44 willpower said difficulty seven yes six
0:32:49 successes including
0:32:51 willpower at five successes subject
0:32:54 rushes to the vampire doing anything to
0:32:56 get to her
0:32:58 and you said you were holding to make
0:33:00 the qu attempt when he returns yep baa
0:33:03 closes her eyes just for one
0:33:05 crystallizing moment of Bravery before
0:33:08 they snap back open Neil you arriv to
0:33:11 the alley all right so I I've sort of
0:33:13 gotten him out of the way here did I
0:33:15 hear them BR and wi talking about what
0:33:18 they were doing yeah I think you're
0:33:19 perceptive all right then I am going to
0:33:23 have timun the wall turn back around and
0:33:25 then I'm going to wait this could risk
0:33:28 breaking my successes but I'm going to
0:33:30 wait to try and hide them in case this
0:33:32 [ __ ] up real bad okay for the moment
0:33:35 things go according to plan as weathers
0:33:38 turns and leaps from the roof crashing
0:33:41 down onto the ground in front of the two
0:33:45 of you uh when and brda and he
0:33:48 straightens his stature kind of looming
0:33:51 over the both of you and before he
0:33:54 starts
0:33:55 unleashing his Fury he gives the pause
0:34:00 to present himself as summon requires
0:34:04 and as he gives that pause and fulfills
0:34:07 that obligation when steps in I know it
0:34:12 was shitty I promise I'm going to make
0:34:14 this better I just need you to calm down
0:34:17 and I'm sorry calm down has never worked
0:34:19 in the history of being told to calm
0:34:21 down but I'm doing my best buddy please
0:34:23 help me meet me halfway roll
0:34:27 [Music]
0:34:29 three successes uh four with the
0:34:32 willpower is draw
0:34:36 tenses there's
0:34:39 this pause that emanates from him as he
0:34:44 examines his now ripped up
0:34:46 coat his chain that snaps somewhere
0:34:49 along the
0:34:51 way he bends down to pick it
0:34:55 up and
0:34:57 and without any Fanfare or clever
0:35:03 remarks he simply walks away it is
0:35:08 a menacing aura that surrounds him as he
0:35:13 does the other bruha that are present
0:35:17 seem reticent
0:35:19 to prevent Weathers from departing and
0:35:23 they simply let him
0:35:25 go
0:35:27 combat
0:35:32 ends wi isn't quite sure how to proceed
0:35:36 from here but she kind of lets out a
0:35:39 breath she didn't realize she'd been
0:35:41 holding BR next to her looks terrified
0:35:44 confused and a little guilty but she
0:35:47 looks over to win and tries to put a
0:35:50 calming hand on her she accepts it kind
0:35:54 of giving it a beat before she kind of
0:35:57 puts her hand on top of
0:35:59 br's okay Johnny's on the roof
0:36:01 where's where Neil and Kabir I have him
0:36:05 right here Jesus Christ how many times
0:36:07 am I going to end up punching you today
0:36:09 no BR actually does jolt and slap at
0:36:12 Neil she was just narrated as terrified
0:36:14 she jolts and slaps at Neil yeah I
0:36:18 probably deserve that I approach from
0:36:20 the front Bud it in my experience
0:36:24 doesn't really matter I I have Kabir
0:36:27 here he's you know okay you guys from
0:36:31 the alleyway hear a uh thud as Johnny
0:36:34 Comes Landing down in the alley another
0:36:37 jolt no slap this time she's been primed
0:36:40 and he kind of walked over to the group
0:36:42 and gives kind of like a sheepish look
0:36:44 to all of you you settled him down well
0:36:47 you riled it up I only feel like it was
0:36:49 right for me to settle him down and she
0:36:52 kind of walks off you could have let me
0:36:53 beat him you could you could have let
0:36:55 him beat me to death that probably would
0:36:57 have been the right thing to do yeah
0:36:59 since when do we do that and she walks
0:37:02 off to try and find kabir's like like no
0:37:05 come here she's she's going to the alley
0:37:07 where he said he's like right behind
0:37:09 Neil are you guys okay I'm fine he uh I
0:37:14 thought he was going to come after me
0:37:15 first but he uh he put Kabir on the
0:37:18 ground Kabir was the target the the
0:37:22 antagonist he was the one who was
0:37:23 spinning on his car and like I know you
0:37:24 were smashing it up but I mean that's
0:37:27 how you want to look at it well you got
0:37:30 some red on you by the way yeah I know I
0:37:32 got nervous and I [ __ ] up the spray
0:37:34 can which explains for those who have
0:37:37 arrived outside why half his face is red
0:37:41 and his teeth are
0:37:42 painted um I got nervous I didn't this
0:37:46 wasn't my Neil can you let me get that
0:37:48 off you do you have it's spray paint I
0:37:51 don't know how I mean yeah if you've got
0:37:53 a thing that would be great can can I
0:37:56 use your and BR just kind of trails off
0:37:59 not entirely sure what to call your
0:38:01 Poncho I mean I guess it's already
0:38:03 ruined that's kind of my line of thought
0:38:06 Neil looks pretty crestfall on at that
0:38:09 realization um Johnny you're not now
0:38:13 obviously but you're going to have to
0:38:14 come up I I think we're all going to
0:38:16 have to come up with some hell of an
0:38:18 apology oh for sure what I just did to
0:38:22 weathers uh I'm going to be repaying
0:38:24 that with my [ __ ] life at some point
0:38:27 am I able to fix up Neil
0:38:31 well in this moment or just like in
0:38:33 general there isn't really fixing quote
0:38:36 unquote
0:38:37 Neil but she meant the paint what if I
0:38:41 roll for style go ahead and give me a
0:38:43 style role oh my God yeah that's right
0:38:47 you're gonna beat David Bowie now watch
0:38:50 me fail please botch this is going to be
0:38:53 difficult to eat that sounds right
0:38:55 [ __ ] spray not helping you yeah
0:38:58 Neil's also probably a flincher when
0:39:00 people try to touch his face so what a
0:39:03 flincher end of sense is this give me a
0:39:06 manipulation
0:39:10 style yeah it's a
0:39:13 bch have two ones and a bunch of fours
0:39:15 and fives BR my eye I'm sorry I just you
0:39:20 definitely poke him in the eye
0:39:21 repeatedly okay I'm going to stop and it
0:39:23 gets to the point where his mouth is
0:39:26 like this vampiric equivalent of shiny
0:39:30 and
0:39:31 chrome and he just has this disgusting
0:39:34 dripping red Grill bruda like actually
0:39:37 gets into the kind of upset where she
0:39:39 like kind of can't stop trying after the
0:39:41 first time she pokes on the eye and then
0:39:43 like when she does it a couple more
0:39:44 times she like gets genuinely upset and
0:39:48 she kind of like backs away like
0:39:50 dropping the cloak and says no I I I'm
0:39:54 just making everything worse I I'm sorry
0:39:58 it's fine um it's fine is this um and he
0:40:03 looks over at
0:40:04 Johnny do I still need to be here Johnny
0:40:06 when Neil looks at you it is unsettling
0:40:08 his eye looks like it's in really bad
0:40:11 shape there are red little thumb prints
0:40:16 over his Iris oh he's got those like
0:40:18 [ __ ] corpse eye paint [ __ ] yeah what
0:40:21 the hell did you do to him I made it
0:40:23 worse I'm just making everything worse
0:40:25 I'm sorry I thought I could fix it but I
0:40:27 don't know if it's fixing you Neil you
0:40:29 better just go you I'll get you that

0:42:28 Jingle yeah when puts the thing in her
0:42:32 mouth and chws it up to a paste and then
0:42:36 she'll put her mouth to Kabir and spit
0:42:38 it in he would this is probably his goal
0:42:40 the whole time you slop this guck into
0:42:44 his mouth MH and slowly feel his hand
0:42:48 reach up his fingers thread into your
0:42:51 hair and the consumption of this nasty y
0:42:56 Browns what is now a like thick slime

0:43:30 are ready to go home BR doesn't seem
0:43:34 like she's convinced that's really the
0:43:36 next problem to handle but she kind of
0:43:39 looks despondently towards the ground
0:43:42 and heads back
0:43:43 into thank you yeah I'm pretty sure you
0:43:47 saved my life back there kid I don't I
0:43:50 don't know I you maybe you could have

0:43:56 I'm being serious he had me dead to
0:43:59 rights in that
0:44:00 roof thank you I can't deal with the
0:44:03 idea of losing you
0:44:06 guys when there's a flash of guilt on
0:44:10 her face but she tries to hide it so um
0:44:13 I I I guess I guess you're you're
0:44:15 welcome I I'm glad you're okay please
0:44:19 think about how to um I don't I don't
0:44:23 know there's too many problems and I'm
0:44:26 I'm GNA go
0:44:27 inside Brea just kind of ducks off Wi
0:44:31 may have cut the kiss off with Kabir but
0:44:33 she still takes his hand probably the
0:44:35 one that's still attached to him normal
0:44:38 way the other hand is inside him okay so
0:44:41 I wasn't sure if it was in shoulder
0:44:42 first or or hand first so yeah no he
0:44:46 plunged that thing into his rib cage
0:44:48 kind of like like a steak Yeah like like
0:44:51 he he broke his arm and then threw his
0:44:54 back smashed his like all the way down
0:44:57 to like his wrist into the guy's body
0:45:00 yeah going to assume you can't
0:45:05 walk I will just need a few minutes and
0:45:08 I will walk just check your phone next
0:45:11 time
0:45:12 dumbass
0:45:15 Princessa I have lost
0:45:18 much and I am not a man who likes to
0:45:22 lose it is um
0:45:27 it is in the nature of ravnos to behave
0:45:30 certain
0:45:31 ways aspects of themselves that they
0:45:33 cannot
0:45:35 escape to me it indicates you don't
0:45:37 trust
0:45:38 me my flaws existed before
0:45:42 you and I regret to
0:45:46 say nothing can change that part of
0:45:52 me risk competition
0:45:57 territorial
0:45:59 Behavior they are my
0:46:03 vice I am sorry I have dragged you into
0:46:06 this do you see me running
0:46:08 away I see your
0:46:11 frustration well I'm glad because I
0:46:13 didn't think I was being terribly subtle
0:46:15 about
0:46:16 it it is not an
0:46:20 excuse but I will not excuse who I am I
0:46:24 am sorry if this creates a rift
0:46:26 it creates a
0:46:29 discussion that's
0:46:31 all you guys the heavy conversation is
0:46:34 interrupted by the sound of a Zippo
0:46:37 clacking out and in as Johnny lights up
0:46:39 a morle why are you still here
0:46:43 Jesus cuz this is my
0:46:45 Rave so you're going to just peeping Tom
0:46:48 on us while we're having a couple's
0:46:50 moment you really have nothing better to
0:46:52 do with your Rave ah there's one of
0:46:54 those moments yeah get shut
0:46:57 up well I was standing here when you two
0:47:00 kids started getting googly out at each
0:47:02 other I'll let you beef for the time
0:47:04 going um go dance with Miles if you got
0:47:07 to take him somewhere please do uh Kabir
0:47:13 I love you to death my friend if I see
0:47:15 you anywhere near this [ __ ] Rave
0:47:17 after this I am personally going to rip
0:47:19 your fangs out of your skull after this
0:47:21 [ __ ] don't forget who's got your back
0:47:24 and then Johnny turns around it starts
0:47:26 heading back to the Rave there's this
0:47:27 nod of like a like a yep yep kind of
0:47:31 expression from him let me know when you
0:47:33 can stand and we'll find somewhere for
0:47:36 you to be there is a wet sucking popping
0:47:40 noise that starts to come from him as
0:47:43 the blood begins to mend Kabir it she's
0:47:47 probably heard him make worse noises
0:47:50 likely once he has two hands both
0:47:53 outside of his body he stands up she'll
0:47:56 help him stand up I'm not going to
0:47:59 apologize or excuse who I am either I
0:48:02 was going to [ __ ] him up with Illusions
0:48:04 yeah I know thank you for not doing that
0:48:07 cuz it [ __ ]
0:48:09 sucks he looks like he wants to say next
0:48:11 time but doesn't we're growing up what a
0:48:14 beautiful moment she doesn't say that
0:48:16 out loud she definitely thinks
0:48:17 [Laughter]
0:48:19 it where do you want to go you kind of
0:48:23 allegedly we're not allowed to leave the
0:48:25 Rave but I think we wherever we go we
0:48:27 take the Rave with us it kind of points
0:48:31 in One Direction and then kind of change
0:48:34 his mind and points in another Direction
0:48:36 and eventually he's like that way and he
0:48:39 just kind of [ __ ] points in a
0:48:40 direction what's in that direction
0:48:45 South
0:48:47 okay it's like is there a place I know
0:48:50 he likes in that direction is there like
0:48:53 a Woods in that direction pretty
0:48:56 randomly picked a direction okay he
0:48:58 seems more interested in the journey
0:49:00 than actually getting somewhere and
0:49:01 she'll start walking with him
0:49:07 okay Neil when you make it to the
0:49:10 bathroom you feel this bad feeling and
0:49:16 realize that you are the only person in
0:49:18 the meds room probably because the vast
0:49:20 majority of people here are vampires but
0:49:23 usually there's someone [ __ ] around
0:49:25 in the bathroom
0:49:26 and it's as you look in the mirror and
0:49:28 see how absolutely [ __ ] up your eye is
0:49:33 that you see him and with this like
0:49:39 chain clenched in his Undead fist a bald
0:49:44 man with pointed ears a trench coat and
0:49:47 those kind of buck tooth pointed fangs
0:49:52 in his
0:49:53 mouth the
0:49:56 Scourge lunges for you from nowhere
0:49:59 where's
0:50:00 [Music]
0:50:04 Fester all right Rob I'm going to need a
0:50:06 quick initiative roll I rolled a nine
0:50:09 for a total of 14 Renwick will be going
0:50:13 on a 22 Renwick takes this chain and
0:50:16 goes to wrap it around your neck and
0:50:18 drag you to the floor
0:50:21 okay he has eight successes to initiate
0:50:24 a grapple
0:50:26 Jesus yeah that what does Neil do Neil
0:50:30 strangles out a cry as the as the uh
0:50:34 chain wraps around his neck I don't know
0:50:36 I don't know where he is I I I'm trying
0:50:39 I I want to find him he turns and pulls
0:50:42 you over his hip dropping you to the
0:50:44 ground and with a knee to your back he
0:50:47 asks again Neil you're going to tell me
0:50:50 where he is I know who you're working
0:50:53 with I know what you did to him my
0:50:55 friend I don't I don't understand what
0:50:58 do you mean you burned him I I didn't
0:51:01 mean I didn't want to I I wasn't in
0:51:04 control of my actions [ __ ] Neil I
0:51:06 wasn't he's my friend I care about him I
0:51:09 would have found him already but I don't
0:51:10 have any of his things and I I didn't
0:51:12 want to I can't it's hard to talk then
0:51:17 struggle uh Neil just sort of flops
0:51:19 around struggling Renwick has [ __ ]
0:51:21 potent and [ __ ] right like he is sure
0:51:23 does yeah I'm not really going anywhere
0:51:26 but like Neil's legs are kicking and
0:51:28 just like trying to struggle out very uh
0:51:33 quick while moving hunched over and
0:51:35 dragging you the way that like a
0:51:36 tarantula does he pulls you into a
0:51:39 bathroom stall closes it locks it and
0:51:43 Jacks you against the wall what do you
0:51:46 mean you need something of his to find
0:51:47 him is the chain still romantic
0:51:51 yes Fester never really wanted me to
0:51:54 have like a pict picture or see his real
0:51:57 face and I never looked cuz it felt rude
0:51:59 but if I had a picture or like something
0:52:01 that really meant something to him I
0:52:03 could find him no matter where he is so
0:52:05 long as he's still
0:52:07 alive he kind of starts to loosen his
0:52:10 grip on you despite not needing to
0:52:12 breathe Neil sort of reflectively coughs
0:52:15 a little bit when the chain the pressure
0:52:18 from the chain is released even a little
0:52:19 bit off his
0:52:21 throat how could you betray him like
0:52:24 that my my sire got in my head he made
0:52:29 me do it he sire he he what does he have
0:52:34 to do with this he's somewhere here he
0:52:38 found me and he he put an idea in my
0:52:41 head he he I it wasn't until after it
0:52:44 happened I knew anything happened at all
0:52:46 your s is and gos with
0:52:48 vital what no no he's he wants me to
0:52:53 vital is the one who's gotten his hands
0:52:56 on our friend on my friend what what
0:52:59 does Marcus vitel have to do with
0:53:00 anything I don't know Neil you're the
0:53:03 one that's supposed to explain that I
0:53:06 have no idea I don't I've never even met
0:53:08 Marcus
0:53:09 vitel that seems
0:53:11 unlikely I everyone knows the Marcus
0:53:14 vital interacts with your own Coterie
0:53:16 frequently I just got back into town
0:53:19 like not that long ago like a few days
0:53:22 maybe how many nights would you need
0:53:24 well to meet someone technically
0:53:26 technically won how often have you
0:53:28 interacted with your own
0:53:30 Coterie I mean a bunch I yes frequently
0:53:34 haven't you miles all I know about
0:53:36 Marcus Vel is Miles wanted me to watch
0:53:38 him because he doesn't trust him and
0:53:40 what did you find out about him I
0:53:41 haven't had a chance yet we've been into
0:53:42 the rain tell me what you found out
0:53:44 about him I don't know anything yet I
0:53:45 haven't had a chance I was waiting until
0:53:48 we called court next so I could you know
0:53:50 look after him like watch him but we
0:53:53 haven't done that yet because this and
0:53:54 he's like his little arms flail around
0:53:57 kind of like gesturing towards the door
0:53:59 back out towards the thumping music
0:54:00 you're going to take this you're going
0:54:01 to find Fest and he's not going to
0:54:03 suffer anymore because of you I don't
0:54:05 want him to he's my friend well your
0:54:08 Molotov cocktail said
0:54:10 otherwise a thing that I wish more than
0:54:14 anything didn't happen perhaps not as
0:54:16 much as he does probably not no he takes
0:54:19 out a deep red lipstick
0:54:25 and more of like a punch than a shove he
0:54:29 presses the lipstick into your stomach
0:54:32 like shoving it into your possession I I
0:54:35 can track Festa I can do it right now uh
0:54:39 do it right now then do me a favor and
0:54:41 block the door I'm not doing [ __ ] for
0:54:42 you Neil so that we're not interrupted
0:54:44 cuz it's going to take me a couple of
0:54:47 minutes I want to find him as much as
0:54:49 you do okay then act
0:54:51 now fine fine just
0:54:55 give me a minute um Neil takes the
0:54:59 lipstick uh and this is very prot like I
0:55:03 know Fester very well this is his this
0:55:05 is very partic not just like an object
0:55:07 in his Haven this is very particular to
0:55:10 him right that is Fester's favorite
0:55:12 lipstick so Lex am I correct and this
0:55:15 would be enough of a sympathetic link to
0:55:19 use seeing with the sky's eyes to locate
0:55:22 him anywhere on Earth if I perform the
0:55:25 ritual it would work yes okay does he
0:55:29 let me go at all does uh Renwick let me
0:55:31 go or is he still like crammed into this
0:55:33 stall with me he's like he's let go of
0:55:35 you but is looming with the intentions
0:55:38 of like extreme violence and the event
0:55:41 you do anything surprising Neil now that
0:55:44 he's not being physically held sits on
0:55:47 the toilet seat and using the lipstick
0:55:51 starts actually using it to write
0:55:53 symbols and things on the wall walls and
0:55:56 over his
0:55:58 eyelids and will over the course of a
0:56:02 little bit of time here for like 20
0:56:04 minutes or more slowly and
0:56:07 ritualistically commune with the heavens
0:56:10 and gain the precise location of fester
0:56:14 you become aware of a townhouse in New
0:56:17 Haven old Victorian style and you know
0:56:22 that there is a contraption that was
0:56:25 designed like some sort of holding pen
0:56:29 you are stricken with a barrage of
0:56:34 insights and what you see is that set
0:56:38 into the floorboard right by the
0:56:40 fireplace is this metal container and
0:56:44 the floorboard has slots that can be
0:56:47 removed that reveals this like pitted
0:56:50 metal surface
0:56:53 Fester is caged in it and you can see
0:56:59 the footfalls of expensive
0:57:01 shoes walking over him like he is this
0:57:07 animal you know the
0:57:09 address you know the
0:57:11 contraption you even know which
0:57:14 floorboards conceal access to
0:57:17 it Neil comes back to his own present
0:57:21 awareness with a
0:57:23 gasp uh not 100% clear what the timeline
0:57:27 is and with like no gu on his face at
0:57:30 all looking directly up at uh at Renwick
0:57:34 desperately like like he's clawing his
0:57:36 way back to Consciousness almost and
0:57:38 goes he has him he's he's got he's got
0:57:42 Fester I I know where he is he's he's
0:57:45 got him in he's caged him in some sort
0:57:48 of contraption beneath his floorboards
0:57:49 he's he's I know the address I know
0:57:52 where he is he's got him we we have to
0:57:54 do something we we have to help him now
0:57:57 soon I don't even when Dawn is we have
0:58:00 to go we he needs he needs help he
0:58:03 frowns kind of trying to read whether or
0:58:07 not he can actually trust you or
0:58:08 anything you're saying and he seems to
0:58:11 settle on a
0:58:16 choice R
0:58:18 soak
0:58:20 botch I don't even know what happens if
0:58:22 you botch a soak I don't even know if
