0:00:20 to be here and we want you to feel the
0:00:22 same so listener discretion is advised
0:00:25 now let's walk the path of
0:00:28 night
0:00:36 last time on path of
0:00:38 night Johnny Neil and Wynn retreated with
0:00:41 brda and miles and
0:00:44 toe to Stave off his hunger Johnny fed
0:00:47 on Neil wind hunted like a
0:00:51 creep they met back up at the Haven
0:00:54 where Eden LED miles's ghouls against
0:00:57 him together the cery managed to break
0:01:00 the setite magic turning allies into
0:01:04 [Music]
0:01:24 enemies win has taken a moment
0:01:27 to she still has Neil holding her shirt
0:01:31 against his head probably pointlessly um
0:01:34 but she's sitting with in a tank top um
0:01:38 elbows on
0:01:39 knees contemplating before finally
0:01:42 speaking
0:01:43 up so I think there's a lot of damage
0:01:46 control we need to get on and from where
0:01:48 I'm sitting there's five things we need
0:01:50 to get done and just five it before we
0:01:54 can do anything
0:01:56 else uh we need to help miles employee
0:02:00 on the floor over there and she nods
0:02:03 kind of at the ghoul I'm already on it
0:02:06 uh Johnny's actually in the midst of
0:02:09 basically um having the other five
0:02:11 ghouls donate blood to him so that he
0:02:14 can uh feed blood back to the ghoul he
0:02:17 over drank from understood is it
0:02:19 possible for me to get nine blood from
0:02:21 these Five Guys yes then I will return
0:02:24 for blood to the ghoul that I that I
0:02:26 took and I will be full we need to get a
0:02:28 butt on the throne because I I think the
0:02:30 only way we can try and contain vitel
0:02:33 and the damage he's doing is to have
0:02:37 someone with some Authority blood hunt
0:02:39 this guy I mean e either either way um
0:02:43 miles needs to get up because the sabat
0:02:45 aren't just coming here now they're
0:02:47 coming here specifically to kill Prince
0:02:48 miles Davenport well if we need to buy
0:02:51 time we can make someone look like
0:02:53 Prince miles Davenport well hell let's
0:02:56 just get Eden out of here and we'll
0:02:58 we'll see if Ira can do it on the list
0:03:00 cuz one of the other ones on the list of
0:03:03 things we need to do is uh we need to
0:03:06 control vitel
0:03:08 which we've proven we're not up to the
0:03:10 task control him damage control him um
0:03:15 okay we've proven we're not up for that
0:03:18 task and I I think that's okay to know
0:03:22 where our limits
0:03:24 are um but I think we've got Theo Bell
0:03:27 and Xavier in town we've got an AR of
0:03:30 the camaria and a gang full of Gangrel
0:03:34 at the very least he he needs to be the
0:03:36 archons need to be informed that there's
0:03:39 a crazy saat mole with burning half the
0:03:44 city and and informing the sabat that
0:03:47 it's time to come they need to know
0:03:49 they're coming now yeah so um we need to
0:03:53 wake up miles and Brea because that
0:03:55 would be the easiest way is if miles is
0:03:57 the one making these calls but if if
0:03:59 he's not then we have other options for
0:04:02 that but I think there are people we
0:04:05 could call but we have a guy
0:04:07 sitting with a steak in his chest over
0:04:10 there do you trust that guy he's a
0:04:12 traere weirdly we didn't kill him I do
0:04:16 Neil looks extremely dubious but seems
0:04:20 unwilling to like argue the point like
0:04:22 they would know better but he looks
0:04:24 really suspicious he's somehow a tremier
0:04:27 that other tremier get that look in
0:04:30 their eye over that doesn't make me feel
0:04:32 any better I think he would help us okay
0:04:35 I trust is a nebulous thing these days
0:04:37 but I I think he would help us that's
0:04:40 true and if not do we have a number for
0:04:42 someone with the asites that we trust I
0:04:44 would call Nara uh I I don't know I'm
0:04:47 not familiar if she knows the path of
0:04:49 life's water but she has to at least
0:04:51 know somebody who does but you're right
0:04:53 until we get him up you know keeping the
0:04:55 word contained that anything has
0:04:57 happened to miles at all right well if
0:04:59 we're if we're gonna unstake Ira we got
0:05:02 to figure out something for
0:05:04 Eden um I could hide her what if we take
0:05:07 her to the hunters that was my thought
0:05:10 what Ramirez would be the one to call
0:05:13 would would she be safe with them
0:05:17 Ramirez is a little bit of a bleeding
0:05:20 heart I mean that's true who's the lady
0:05:23 who helped you she would probably also
0:05:25 be sympathetic to Eden that's Sheila I I
0:05:28 agree and honestly if they're going to
0:05:30 be looking into hell house and I know
0:05:33 that was part of their plan at some
0:05:34 point it maybe it wouldn't hurt to have
0:05:36 someone there who can undo damage that
0:05:38 vicissitude does
0:05:41 well that doesn't necessarily seem like
0:05:44 it's keeping Eden safe but also to that
0:05:47 point um you'd be honest with the
0:05:50 hunters right that oh yeah it's putting
0:05:52 a huge Target on their back to have this
0:05:54 girl with them I would 100% give them
0:05:57 all the information that they would need
0:06:00 okay okay and I'm still hungry so if if
0:06:03 we could I yes uh I don't know if
0:06:06 miles's people I mean these aren't all
0:06:08 of his ghouls he's got like a dozen or
0:06:10 something but I I not even necessarily
0:06:13 seeing feed off the ghouls but he's got
0:06:14 to have a her or something I I also
0:06:17 Johnny ever since you fed on me I I I've
0:06:19 been tell you what chopping at the bit
0:06:22 too um Neil why don't you see if you can
0:06:25 round up some more of miles's people for
0:06:28 uh for blood I'll go make a call to
0:06:30 Ramirez and see if he'll come for Eden
0:06:33 and when maybe you start uh talking to
0:06:37 Ira while he's uh
0:06:39 incapacitated and maybe kind of give him
0:06:42 a heads up on what we need from him so
0:06:43 when we unstake him it'll be a little
0:06:45 bit less of a weird conversation that's
0:06:48 a good idea miles gets a phone call my
0:06:51 phone is on
0:06:52 silent because of the stealth job mhm
0:06:55 guess no one hears
0:06:58 it
0:07:01 Wynn will take IRA and hoist him over her
0:07:05 shoulder and kind of take him to I don't
0:07:08 want to be in a bathroom so much but
0:07:11 just a room away from the main hallway
0:07:14 so it's probably a bathroom and she
0:07:15 dumps him in the bathtub she kind of
0:07:18 straddles the side of the bathtub one
0:07:20 leg pulled up in sort of a perch and she
0:07:24 kind of leans over and starts to speak
0:07:26 to Ira so I'm really hoping
0:07:30 that your message is what I interpreted
0:07:34 was
0:07:34 correct cuz if not I know you're going
0:07:36 to be pissed but if you're the person I
0:07:39 think you
0:07:41 are you're going to want to be here for
0:07:43 the rest of
0:07:44 this our people are down miles is Miles
0:07:49 needs you brida needs
0:07:51 you Eden is
0:07:54 safe but we're in a bad way and we've
0:07:57 got a [ __ ]
0:08:00 thusa ventr allegedly running around
0:08:03 with obten he's torching a residential
0:08:08 area looking for us Clan nasru has taken
0:08:12 a bad hit and I'm sorry that we've kept
0:08:17 you just freaking in this state for so
0:08:20 long and I it's a solid ioe you from me
0:08:25 but I'm going to take this stake out and
0:08:27 hopefully you're willing to talk
0:08:30 and she'll reach down she doesn't really
0:08:33 pray but she kind of sends an intent to
0:08:36 the universe and pulls the steak from
0:08:40 his
0:08:41 chest I take it Sheriff
0:08:47 that you didn't go and
0:08:50 investigate where I had been
0:08:53 staying based on the things you just
0:08:56 said I didn't want to draw any more
0:08:58 connections
0:09:00 between you and us he
0:09:02 size I sort of got that
0:09:05 from my continued presence here we're
0:09:09 not going to give you back to the people
0:09:10 who want to kill you that was the shakes
0:09:14 his head never mind it's water under the
0:09:18 bridge I guess I had a limited amount of
0:09:21 time to try and explain myself in a way
0:09:24 that wouldn't got all of us immediately
0:09:27 caught but I guess it's a bit late late
0:09:29 for that now isn't it it's a bit late
0:09:31 for almost anything when Iris says that
0:09:35 he
0:09:36 gets an uncomfortable chilling sensation
0:09:41 a feeling he's had
0:09:42 before when watched by a
0:09:47 counselor so
0:09:52 sheriff and his like demeanor gets a
0:09:55 little bit more rigid you didn't kill me
0:10:00 for assaulting
0:10:02 you and the prince in his own
0:10:05 Haven I assume there's some sort
0:10:09 of thing that you want from
0:10:12 me I'm willing to help in exchange for
0:10:16 my
0:10:19 life you got
0:10:21 it am I giving you your life by asking
0:10:24 you to do these
0:10:25 things the trir as always
0:10:30 are happy to help support and defend the
0:10:33 camaria the trir are never happy that's
0:10:36 [ __ ] you just need to get to know us
0:10:38 better he does not smile despite sort of
0:10:42 making a
0:10:43 joke is this weird for Ira you don't
0:10:48 really know him that well I don't think
0:10:49 we got pretty chummy I mean I don't know
0:10:52 is that like an empathy Ro or I have no
0:10:54 idea reception plus
0:10:56 empathy one success when you first
0:10:59 unstaked him he seemed like annoyed and
0:11:02 more of a person mhm in a very like damn
0:11:04 it I had plans and this just didn't
0:11:06 there was a miscommunication and things
0:11:08 did not go the way I thought they would
0:11:10 not in a you didn't get the message way
0:11:12 but in a like [ __ ] I was playing chess
0:11:14 and we stopped at move two and then all
0:11:16 of a sudden when he got a little bit
0:11:17 more rigid he feels very similar to
0:11:21 honestly the way he did in the
0:11:23 conversation before he passed you the
0:11:25 note not like a programming thing but
0:11:27 more of a like all of a sudden he's
0:11:29 acting a little bit more cautious
0:11:31 talking more about the tremier than
0:11:33 himself the camaria rather than you when
0:11:37 watches when Ira's demeanor
0:11:41 shifts and it signals her in some way to
0:11:44 be more guarded
0:11:46 herself you said you can wake people up
0:11:51 without making them drink Vite the path
0:11:54 of blood is the first thing that any
0:11:59 decent trir frankly any trir learns in
0:12:03 their study of theurgical
0:12:07 Mastery you give very long
0:12:09 yeses she will go and signal for him to
0:12:15 wait here it would be easier Sheriff as
0:12:19 she leaves if my things would be in
0:12:21 returned to
0:12:22 me my gloves
0:12:25 my
0:12:27 acutron are you going to attack us
0:12:31 again they would Aid
0:12:34 me
0:12:36 in efficiently performing the tasks I'm
0:12:40 being asked that's not answering my
0:12:44 question I suppose we're going to have
0:12:46 to have a little
0:12:47 trust
0:12:50 Sheriff when kind of considers
0:12:54 this and size a
0:12:57 little I will bring them
0:12:59 thank
0:13:00 you and she probably was the one who
0:13:03 stowed his stuff once they took it from
0:13:06 him um she probably put it back in the
0:13:08 bedroom he'd been using so she'll grab
0:13:11 probably like a a photo box sort of
0:13:13 thing uh with his stuff in it and she
0:13:18 will also grab
0:13:20 brda and bring her to the bathroom when
0:13:23 you go downstairs uh from the bathroom
0:13:27 uh you see Johnny hanging up his cell
0:13:29 phone at the tail end of a conversation
0:13:32 all right I'll see you soon he's got
0:13:35 Eden next to him he's kind of holding
0:13:37 her by the hand we'll have to do those
0:13:39 pancakes more time kid all right we're
0:13:41 heading out be safe uh contact me when
0:13:45 you're coming back I'll be fast and
0:13:47 Johnny will head out the front door with
0:13:49 Eden to go meet up with
0:13:50 Ramirez and when will do all of that
0:13:53 other stuff so you bring the gear over
0:13:55 to Ira Ira when you come back into the
0:13:57 bathroom IRA is using a toothbrush that
0:14:01 was in probably like a guest toothbrush
0:14:03 or whatever to like clean some of the
0:14:05 excess blood off of his shoes that has
0:14:08 dried there over the last you know few
0:14:10 weeks or however long it's been cold
0:14:12 water hydrogen peroxide I know the only
0:14:16 thing he said that sounds a little bit
0:14:17 like the normal Ira as a person Ira but
0:14:20 then when the stop his handed back he
0:14:22 pulls on the gloves that he used to have
0:14:25 on uh with the Arcane symbols takes the
0:14:29 coat one of the things is uh another one
0:14:33 of those Stakes like the one he' thrown
0:14:35 at brida when will'll take that before
0:14:38 she lets him put the code on I'd like my
0:14:40 things Sheriff yeah I'm not going to
0:14:43 give you the thing that'll incapacitate
0:14:46 me he looks at her for a minute
0:14:50 shrugs can I have it when I leave
0:14:52 they're hard to make
0:14:54 yes what do you need she will bring BR
0:15:00 in I think it's kind of
0:15:02 self-explanatory I suppose so and he
0:15:07 flexes his fingers slowly reaches down
0:15:10 and puts a hand over Bri's
0:15:15 heart and then Lex I'll use path of
0:15:17 blood roll for the blood
0:15:21 rage I will spend the three and her body
0:15:24 uh anything that's not EG just
0:15:26 automatically spends the blood and
0:15:28 begins to knit itself back together and
0:15:30 Rouse into the more human looking bre
0:15:36 out of torper BR becomes conscious as
0:15:39 the magic works the first thing is BR
0:15:43 curling up like she's trying to protect
0:15:45 herself from that blade coming up
0:15:48 through her stomach her hands go to it
0:15:51 just as they flush with life that
0:15:54 illusion that her blush of Health gives
0:15:57 her and slowly as fingertips Trace skin
0:16:00 there's still plenty of damage on her
0:16:04 but awake she looks up at the two of you
0:16:08 eyes going wide at the sight of Ira and
0:16:12 looking to win for Assurance looking
0:16:14 back to Ira trying to figure out what's
0:16:16 even going on when brda starts to stir
0:16:19 and grab for the wounds that she thinks
0:16:22 are coming but aren't uh Wynn will kind of
0:16:26 like put her hand over br's hands
0:16:28 knowing how cold they're going to be and
0:16:30 just kind of makes something of a
0:16:32 hushing noise and hey hey hey hey it's
0:16:35 okay it's not okay things are bad but
0:16:38 you're back did we get him is fer
0:16:43 okay who marus member of Clan
0:16:48 Nosferatu Marcus vitel seems to be a
0:16:51 sleeper agent for the sabat he seems to
0:16:54 have been a mole in the camaria and way
0:16:57 more powerful that he seemed interesting
0:17:00 BR uh if you can
0:17:02 walk we should have Neil should be
0:17:05 getting some stuff brought over so that
0:17:09 we can start getting patched up okay I
0:17:12 am I have a lot of damage to heal and I
0:17:14 don't think I can do it all tonight you
0:17:16 don't need to worry about that we just
0:17:17 need to get to just get us to limping
0:17:20 that's all we need and you br looks at
0:17:24 Ira you got me back up a favor to the
0:17:29 sheriff in exchange for my life correct
0:17:33 Sheriff one of the two yeah well thank
0:17:37 you he nods R of being one of the
0:17:40 members of the Cod he doesn't know as
0:17:41 well and is still suspicious of when
0:17:43 kind of like helps her stand everyone's
0:17:47 everyone else is okay right we're
0:17:49 getting
0:17:50 there I'll try and get an explanation
0:17:52 from Neil
0:17:56 godspeed um so when will kind of help
0:17:59 her out of the bathroom and hoist miles
0:18:02 up and bring him in miles's hair is a
0:18:05 mess his clothes are disheveled skin is
0:18:09 shriveled and tight against his flesh
0:18:11 he's very much in toror when will kind
0:18:15 of Nod to BR like trying to be
0:18:17 reassuring but she's not good at that
0:18:20 sort of thing honestly when she sees
0:18:23 miles come past her as she's trying to
0:18:26 go find Neil for an update she lingers
0:18:30 and stops to see if he'll be all right
0:18:32 she doesn't leave the bathroom when
0:18:34 doesn't make her she'll set him on the
0:18:36 floor as Wynn brings him in and Ira sees
0:18:40 that the prince is like totally
0:18:42 disheveled looks between BR and win and
0:18:45 just says would someone do his grace the
0:18:49 favor of preserving his dignity and
0:18:53 finding him a change of
0:18:56 clothes that's not my for Forte but she
0:18:59 sets him down and immediately starts
0:19:01 like raking her fingers through his hair
0:19:02 when um I'll go get something and and a
0:19:05 call okay probably better my hands are
0:19:08 pretty gross BR pauses like she was
0:19:11 going to say something like she was
0:19:12 going to agree she holds back the words
0:19:15 wind goods are a tiny Smur that seems to
0:19:18 kind of comfort BR but she's so confused
0:19:21 and this is such an emergency and she's
0:19:23 hurting that she goes to miles's closet
0:19:27 she picks out something suitable for
0:19:31 well she perceives that we're still in a
0:19:32 dangerous situation so she's looking for
0:19:34 the sort of thing he might fight in and
0:19:36 she brings back a comb as well before
0:19:38 she goes down BR or Wynn will call spare
0:19:42 glasses too okay and she goes to miles's
0:19:45 room to find these things anything
0:19:48 happen well you're going to need to make
0:19:49 a roll otherwise get lost in the
0:19:53 Jes need a self-control Ro difficulty
0:19:56 eat as you uh risk getting lost in
0:19:58 miles's stuff it's probably [ __ ]
0:20:02 Fair no that's a real ruling I know
0:20:08 yeah no oh
0:20:13 no that's a a one and a seven I'm
0:20:16 presuming six to be the difficulty that
0:20:19 is correct so this is a
0:20:26 wash when BR doesn't come back we'll
0:20:29 we'll deal with she like straightens out
0:20:32 miles's clothes so he doesn't look
0:20:34 terrible petting the
0:20:37 sus miles has a lot of well-crafted [ __ ]
0:20:41 in his closet Ira looks actually like
0:20:43 legitimately regretful that is going to
0:20:45 wake up and not look okay and then just
0:20:49 sigh and goes well then I suppose I
0:20:52 should do it
0:20:53 anyways and leans down fixes the collar
0:20:57 on his jacket despite the fact that
0:20:58 there was like a [ __ ] sword wound
0:21:00 through the back and then puts a hand
0:21:03 over his heart and we'll do the same
0:21:06 thing as he did to
0:21:07 BR and with the same amount of su well
0:21:11 one more but it rounds out to three
0:21:13 blood that I can spend Ira rests his
0:21:16 hand over miles's heart spends three of
0:21:20 his blood to heal three of his wounds
0:21:23 and bring him also out of torper miles
0:21:27 you become conscious how am I feeling
0:21:30 underdressed well a moment ago you were
0:21:33 in a fight and then you
0:21:36 saw a horrible fate befall Brea and then
0:21:39 everything went dark yes I'm also
0:21:41 talking about the effects of the curse
0:21:44 you're okay the said that no longer is
0:21:47 nope I uh open one eye look around
0:21:52 recognize where I'm at hey good evening
0:21:55 Your Grace I'm going to assume that
0:21:58 things didn't go well we're not dead and
0:22:02 that's about the best takeaway we've got
0:22:05 all right well that's good news to start
0:22:07 with also I heard him a little
0:22:09 bit from what your Sheriff has said it's
0:22:12 been a harrowing evening for all of you
0:22:16 are we
0:22:18 feeling okay IA just looks over a win I
0:22:22 don't know how to answer that got it so
0:22:25 what do we owe IRA
0:22:28 for his help we let him walk out the
0:22:32 front door is there anything else we can
0:22:35 offer you that would make things easier
0:22:38 he like gets kind a little bit of a
0:22:40 smile on his face if you're looking to
0:22:43 award me Boons for my actions your grace
0:22:46 who would I be to say no he's got kind
0:22:48 of like a half smile on his face like
0:22:50 he's not 100% serious but also if you
0:22:52 gave him Boons he would not say no I
0:22:54 would offer up some Boons but you'd have
0:22:56 to be around to collect them
0:22:59 well as always as I expressed to the
0:23:03 sheriff despite how there may have been
0:23:06 some
0:23:08 miscommunications in the
0:23:10 past Clan Shir is always willing to
0:23:14 support and defend the
0:23:16 camaria of
0:23:19 course well we do have an imminent Siege
0:23:23 coming
0:23:25 up then perhaps I should speak to the
0:23:28 members of my clan
0:23:31 about what will be done most of them
0:23:33 have left the city at this point you
0:23:35 might be the only one left in the
0:23:38 city well
0:23:40 then perhaps I will have to rectify that
0:23:44 very unclear whether he means go get
0:23:45 more trir or
0:23:47 leave I may need a representative from
0:23:50 Clan trir here and since there's no one
0:23:52 else I can quite find be poor business
0:23:58 to let you just go before especially
0:24:01 since we are very much surrounded by
0:24:04 danger you were also here to help to
0:24:07 gain my assistance in a task weren't
0:24:10 you I was and if I could complete that
0:24:15 task
0:24:18 and return at least not in complete
0:24:23 shame to the trir for my
0:24:26 failure I would not be Aver to that
0:24:30 either again Sheriff Your
0:24:33 Grace it might be time for a little
0:24:36 trust either way fair enough Wynn will not
0:24:42 say anything but she will hold out the
0:24:43 Splinter servants to him uh there's just
0:24:47 the one that's left because the other
0:24:48 one got used on BR yep and he'll just
0:24:51 reach out and take it oh also
0:24:54 technically I guess Wynn would be like
0:24:56 taking damage for touching it but you
0:24:58 have so much fortitude that you're
0:24:59 probably
0:25:00 fine but it definitely Burns to touch uh
0:25:03 and he takes it and ties it off inside
0:25:05 of his
0:25:06 coat for now I've
0:25:11 been stuck here for a bit if I
0:25:15 might take my leave for the moment you
0:25:18 seem busy that was the
0:25:21 deal my
0:25:23 phone he Pats his pockets and pulls it
0:25:26 out you have my number I believe yep yes
0:25:30 well then go get to work then I wish you
0:25:33 both good luck you too let us know if
0:25:36 you need anything and he sort of stiffly
0:25:38 starts walking out looks down at like
0:25:39 the pile of unconscious Ghouls and [ __ ]
0:25:41 and was like what the [ __ ] like cannot
0:25:43 quite keep the like what the [ __ ] did I
0:25:46 miss and he was aware for that but still
0:25:51 cuz he was there but like he was he was
0:25:53 staked and his eyes were closed so just
0:25:55 it was a series of thuds so sir seeing
0:25:58 the consequence of the series of thuds
0:26:00 and be like what the [ __ ] and Ira steps
0:26:04 outside and then pulls his phone out of
0:26:06 his pocket uh to make a call it's
0:26:10 actually a compact he was actually GNA
0:26:12 powder his his phone is super
0:26:14 dead but [ __ ] definitely pulls it out so
0:26:18 you see him walk out the front door pull
0:26:20 out his phone to like make a call look
0:26:23 at it like do that thing where your
0:26:25 phone's dead and you you refuse to
0:26:26 accept that your phone is dead so like
0:26:28 you hit the buttons a couple times
0:26:30 [ __ ] um and then there is like a
0:26:33 slight glow and static around his hands
0:26:36 and a audible snap and then he presses
0:26:40 the button the phone turns on and kind
0:26:43 of shuts the door behind him
0:26:46 turns looks at miles for a second and
0:26:49 then gives him a really big hug that
0:26:51 good huh you get a fair chance to
0:26:56 strangle me when I tell you I broke your
0:26:58 present from the snake people son of a
0:27:00 [ __ ] but that was so much magic
0:27:04 swordsman ability yeah but it was also
0:27:07 way more turning your Ghouls and Eden
0:27:09 against us than we needed of
0:27:12 course yeah what did you think would
0:27:14 happen I don't know okay just hug me for
0:27:17 a minute and we we have business to get
0:27:20 to okay I mean I can't blame them for
0:27:23 trying you'd be disappointed if they
0:27:26 didn't it's it's very true
0:27:28 okay so I will bring you up to speed but
0:27:30 I think we first need to go get BR out
0:27:32 of your closet I sent her there for a
0:27:33 change of clothes and I'm guessing you
0:27:35 have really nice stuff that makes sense
0:27:37 I'll go get
0:27:42 her as iro is waiting for pickup he does
0:27:45 hear the sound of a vehicle pulling up
0:27:47 to him a black SUV rolls into the
0:27:50 driveway and when the door opens it's
0:27:53 Johnny Saxon stepping out he unwraps a
0:27:56 fresh pack of morle
0:27:58 pops one in his mouth and takes a second
0:28:01 one out and offers it to you Ira reaches
0:28:04 out takes the morally a little wary of
0:28:07 what this interaction might be but pops
0:28:10 into his mouth a little snap and light
0:28:12 them both for them and takes a long drag
0:28:16 first before just
0:28:17 going
0:28:21 Cal Johnny nervously glances towards the
0:28:25 Haven am I going to like what I find in
0:28:27 there or am I going to come back out
0:28:29 here and beat you to death well I
0:28:31 suppose you would have to ask the
0:28:35 sheriff and his
0:28:37 grace but they're both up and could tell
0:28:41 you and Brea did not return from his
0:28:45 Grace's wardrobe but as far as I am
0:28:49 aware could also tell you the same
0:28:52 Johnny Smiles a little bit that's good
0:28:54 to hear I'd hate to have to ruin the
0:28:58 Friendship we have so would I senal Lex
0:29:02 do I still feel like I'm being watched
0:29:04 uh no just for that conversation as Ira
0:29:07 is smoking with Johnny and having this
0:29:09 like kind of weird tense talk he
0:29:12 actually seems to relax a little
0:29:14 bit I'm Sorry by the
0:29:17 way I had a limited amount of time to
0:29:21 express myself and I may not have done
0:29:24 it in a manner that was helpful but I
0:29:27 was trying my best
0:29:29 to do what needed to be
0:29:32 done and doesn't answer all the
0:29:34 questions I have but I don't think
0:29:36 you're able to answer all the questions
0:29:39 I have you get a chance to meet Neil in
0:29:42 there not while I
0:29:45 was conscious that's a shame I think two
0:29:48 of you would like each other I doubt it
0:29:50 you sticking around in the city at
0:29:52 all I'm not sure
0:29:54 yet I guess that's going to have to
0:29:56 depend and I am aware and he gives him
0:30:00 kind of a pointed look that the girl is
0:30:03 still in the
0:30:05 city
0:30:06 so to my regret probably but I think
0:30:10 there might be bigger things happening
0:30:13 like vitel and the sabat so I've heard
0:30:17 and my business with the sheriff is
0:30:19 not concluded
0:30:22 yet it depends I think on how
0:30:25 much my superiors think think that I
0:30:27 have
0:30:29 failed or whether they think I have
0:30:31 betrayed them in which case you probably
0:30:33 won't see me again I don't suppose you
0:30:36 uh you want to share any of your
0:30:39 insights into how you're able to get
0:30:41 around
0:30:44 thury I do
0:30:47 not Johnny kind of frowns at that is
0:30:52 there thury you need to get around
0:30:55 Marcus
0:30:56 vit so the sheriff said he is in
0:31:00 possession of theurgical ability and of
0:31:03 ten
0:31:04 abration he's pretty Wy for a
0:31:06 Ventrue something to look into then
0:31:09 there's records what about a ward how do
0:31:13 you break that how do you break it or
0:31:16 how do I break it either I would simply
0:31:20 make it
0:31:20 mine turn it against whoever built it
0:31:23 make it my own Ward well how do you just
0:31:26 break it
0:31:28 find the ritual Circle the things that
0:31:31 are inlaid you have to get past the ward
0:31:34 unfortunately that's how they're
0:31:35 designed but if you can find someone who
0:31:38 can get past that Ward Wards are
0:31:43 individual a ward against a ghoul won't
0:31:46 keep out a kindred a ward against a
0:31:48 kindred won't keep out a mortal find
0:31:52 someone who can get past have them smash
0:31:53 it it's the simple dirty way the fastest
0:31:58 way if you're not so theurgical
0:32:02 inclined destroy the ward have someone
0:32:06 who is capable of getting past it who is
0:32:09 not affected by it go in and do
0:32:12 it depending on where it is could be
0:32:15 simple or difficult some places have
0:32:17 inset Wards of silver copper metal could
0:32:23 be difficult to break especially subtly
0:32:26 but
0:32:27 if it was Hasty salt
0:32:30 chalk easy to
0:32:33 stop find out who the war doesn't impact
0:32:37 have them go do it trir
0:32:41 Chantry most everyone will be warded so
0:32:44 the person you would have to find is the
0:32:45 person allowed inside but for a hasty
0:32:48 Ward on a
0:32:49 Haven he
0:32:52 shrugs well if you ever want to teach me
0:32:55 more about how to undo
0:32:57 any
0:32:58 thury I understand that's the magician
0:33:01 giving away his Secrets but I'm getting
0:33:03 sick and tired of running into this
0:33:06 [ __ ] I know to put it bluntly s
0:33:11 AA Clans like the bruha getting sick and
0:33:15 tired of not being able to deal with the
0:33:18 potency of thury is exactly why Clan
0:33:21 trir doesn't want those outside of it to
0:33:24 know well let's hope these final nights
0:33:27 last long enough long enough that
0:33:30 long-term thinking does you good Ira
0:33:33 takes a big drag on the cigarette looks
0:33:35 up at the sky where Lex presumably that
0:33:38 big ass red star is still shining
0:33:41 probably way worse than way worse I
0:33:43 assume and then looks back at Johnny and
0:33:46 shrugs probably not but if I wasn't any
0:33:52 use it just kind of leaves the thought
0:33:54 unsaid oh and Ira
0:33:57 s don't you dare [ __ ] tell anyone
0:34:02 that I asked you to teach me
0:34:05 anything I got a bad reputation to hold
0:34:07 up actually gets a like a laugh like a
0:34:10 chuckle out of ir like a genuine sort of
0:34:14 like well if you're interested in
0:34:17 learning that kind of thing not that I
0:34:20 could teach it to you but the first step
0:34:23 is Latin it's about then that IR is ride
0:34:27 pulls up taxi
0:34:29 cab good night
0:34:31 santaa good Ira can't say whether or not
0:34:34 I hope to see you again and he gets into
0:34:37 the cab cab takes off and Johnny heads
0:34:45 in joining after your conversation with
0:34:48 Ira you head on inside and find both
0:34:53 miles and BR mobile oh thank God it's

0:37:15 sire was not

0:37:22 yes you don't think he's maybe mad about
0:37:25 what was set on the roof at the no idea
0:37:27 but I'm getting the sense of urgency
0:37:30 here okay so I I mean I know you're
0:37:34 being summoned but if if it's at the
0:37:36 elesium I I don't want us to not be

0:37:41 me deeply uncomfortable okay then let's
0:37:43 then let's all go to alium Miles yes you
0:37:46 feel the pull of a
0:37:48 summons I I don't think there's much I
0:37:50 can do about that no there's not can I
0:37:52 communicate at all nope well he tucks
0:37:55 his phone in
0:37:57 uh and just heads out towards the cars

0:38:17 in there and uh Johnny goes out with
0:38:20 miles to drive him to the elisium Neil
0:38:23 on winds say so hurries out after Johnny
0:38:25 and miles brda is spending a blood to
0:38:29 get things together quickly for people
0:38:32 and is careful with the warning that the
0:38:34 closet had already gotten her to avert
0:38:36 her eyes and only grab what's necessary
0:38:38 when will go with her so she doesn't get
0:38:40 stuck in the closet Will Miles go with
0:38:43 Johnny in the car yeah it's the most
0:38:45 expedient way to get there Johnny will
0:38:48 make the trip slower than he usually
0:38:51 would to buy uh the girl some time okay
0:38:54 when once they have the bundles of
0:38:57 people's clothes and brushes and
0:38:59 whatever else they need to grab she will
0:39:01 pick one of the other cars probably a
0:39:04 less showy one miles describe the less
0:39:07 showy car okay I mean there is R's car
0:39:11 which you could take the bronze BMW yep
0:39:15 all right do you want me to drive or do
0:39:16 you want to drive um I'll do it okay
0:39:19 well aside from a bit of traffic
0:39:22 everyone makes it to the
0:39:25 alium
0:39:30 outside there's a number of Kindred are
0:39:32 hanging out smoking in circles
0:39:35 whispering to each other about whatever
0:39:36 the hell is going on and why justicars
0:39:38 arrived to New Haven and then inside is
0:39:42 this perfect Paradox of a crowd of
0:39:46 Kindred who do not want to be here but
0:39:50 are too curious to
0:39:53 flee and seated in miles of Throne is a
0:39:57 woman and a power suit she's dark brown
0:40:01 bob resting across her lap is a long
0:40:04 sword of Exquisite make on her right
0:40:07 side are three archons who are dressed
0:40:11 in a fashion similar to hers to her left
0:40:15 is Yan
0:40:16 petersun who has a pin indicating uh St
0:40:21 Michael on his lapel and on his left are
0:40:26 three josian AR three josian archons who
0:40:31 also bear the mark of St Michael on
0:40:34 their Lael they all look studious
0:40:37 perfectly chemed everything in proper
0:40:41 order Luc send though she does not speak
0:40:45 her presence holds the room both
0:40:48 captivated and as a hostage to her
0:40:52 will I go forward and present myself as
0:40:55 required by the summoning you approach
0:40:57 your Sire oh The Sire was very good I
0:41:00 will still looks like he's all business
0:41:02 so I'll give him the uh bow and whatnot
0:41:05 cuz archon is still he's a pretty good
0:41:07 rating in terms of all the political
0:41:09 standing to be correct oh yes oh yes
0:41:11 especially since you know who he is
0:41:13 archon 2 archon Peterson child and then
0:41:17 I will even deeper bow power well he
0:41:21 presents himself Johnny I'm assuming the
0:41:23 rest of the Cod will file in and take
0:41:26 positions not far off from Miles Wynn has
0:41:31 likely done a car change where she got
0:41:33 changed in the car while br's driving
0:41:36 she put on her button-down shirt her
0:41:39 vest that she likely stole from Kabir uh
0:41:42 her black slacks [ __ ] kickers it's not
0:41:45 likely that BR was able to do much help
0:41:48 fashion wise to the Cod but she might
0:41:49 have been able to pass out a couple suit
0:41:51 jackets Johnny comes in battle [ __ ] up
0:41:55 and covered in blood as you guys are
0:41:56 making your way in uh to catch up to
0:41:59 Miles when you were stopped by a wildl
0:42:03 looking man with a like kind of tattered
0:42:07 old trench coat that was probably once
0:42:10 very nice and these big thick [ __ ]
0:42:12 kicker boots and you know it to be the
0:42:16 gang R Xavier holy

0:43:03 along you put your tail between your
0:43:05 legs and you make it clear that you are
0:43:06 not a risk to his secrets and you make
0:43:09 sure the people you care about do the
0:43:11 same
0:43:12 thing because if you
0:43:14 don't he will just seed this entire
0:43:17 region to the sabat and let them burn
0:43:20 down everything that represents a threat
0:43:22 to his power when is kind of looking up
0:43:25 at him
0:43:26 from the borderline headlock um uh and
0:43:30 maybe for the first time in a long time
0:43:33 she is looking up at someone almost like
0:43:36 a child like I am in so far over my head
0:43:40 and she is like soaking up what he is
0:43:43 saying okay
0:43:45 what have you been to the house I saw it
0:43:50 and it looks an awful lot like what I
0:43:52 saw yeah so he like licks this like got
0:43:56 this huge meaty clawed hairy hands and
0:44:00 he just like he licks his hand and just
0:44:02 starts pawing the side of your face like
0:44:05 adjusting your hair and making sure
0:44:06 you're presentable to the justic
0:44:09 car okay
0:44:12 okay thank you for being here the gengle
0:44:16 are here to back you up just like we
0:44:17 said we would if you got to be gone for
0:44:20 a while we'll be watching over New Haven
0:44:22 just don't be gone too
0:44:24 long I don't want to
0:44:26 leave I know he kind of slinks off and
0:44:30 he just he's got he he looks like a
0:44:34 [ __ ] monster in a trench coat and has
0:44:36 like just this really sturdy stature to
0:44:40 him when now probably with a cow lick
0:44:43 from his adjustments will try and make
0:44:47 her way to each of the coder members I
0:44:50 guess she'll start with Brena okay
0:44:53 here's how we survive this according to
0:44:56 Xavier make sure that hard estet knows
0:44:59 that we're not a threat to his secrets
0:45:01 and that's kind of all she
0:45:04 says BR says to when you tell Johnny
0:45:07 I'll tell Neil okay BR goes and does so
0:45:12 uh as does win she walks up seemingly
0:45:14 under the guise of she like licks a
0:45:17 tissue and starts like trying to wipe
0:45:18 the blood off of Johnny's neck Johnny
0:45:22 looks back annoyed at you and kind of
0:45:24 shakes you off like he yet he is
0:45:26 perfectly happy looking the way he is
0:45:29 it's a ruse just look at me for a second
0:45:32 he glances back we get out of this by
0:45:35 making sure hard estet knows that we
0:45:37 don't we're not going to surrender his
0:45:39 Secrets he will not hesitate to seed us
0:45:43 to the sabat Johnny gives you a look
0:45:48 that you think is reassuring at first
0:45:51 but you also see a little bit of
0:45:52 Johnny's [ __ ] attitude behind
0:45:55 simmering behind the eyes and he kind of
0:45:58 slowly nods at you when kind of makes
0:46:02 sure to lock eyes says I don't like it
0:46:05 either and does like an affectionate
0:46:07 head Bop forehead to forehead before
0:46:11 walking away she Pockets the tissue she
0:46:14 does not leave the ca's blood lying
0:46:16 around anywhere and baa goes to approach
0:46:19 Neil playing much the same game she
0:46:22 leans in like she's trying to fix his
0:46:25 lapel trying to get a tie on him and
0:46:29 brushing past his ear she says we have
0:46:32 to make sure that we don't look like a
0:46:34 threat to hard to set his Secrets play
0:46:38 it that way Neil nods and just sort of
0:46:41 quietly Whispers to
0:46:43 Brea I
0:46:45 mean that's what I've been saying all
0:46:47 along right we're nobody our victories
0:46:51 are his victories our abilities are
0:46:55 useful to him not to us that's that's
0:46:58 how you keep your head down and no one
0:46:59 pays attention to you and nobody snuffs
0:47:01 you out um the Trick's going to be
0:47:04 getting miles to do that and Brea backs
0:47:07 off because to speak any longer would be
0:47:10 to draw more attention mhm I'm going to
0:47:12 assume that there is no way to speak to
0:47:14 Miles without eyes all over that well as
0:47:19 you head towards that main area there's
0:47:21 a number of Kindred gathered seated in
0:47:23 his throne is Jus car send over her head
0:47:27 is a painting of miles's diabl streaks
0:47:31 it's no longer in my office it is no
0:47:33 longer in your office all right Yan
0:47:36 Peter zun is present there are also six
0:47:39 unnamed archons that are present Bell is
0:47:42 nowhere to be
0:47:43 seen essentially after uh making the Two
0:47:46 bows I'm currently
0:47:48 probably she's high enough level that
0:47:50 I'm probably kneeling waiting for
0:47:52 whatever next part of acknowledgement is
0:47:54 coming which may take five 10 I don't
0:47:57 know a long period of time who knows
0:48:00 Prince Davenport as she finally says
0:48:04 your power an important note over her
0:48:07 hands is a pair of red gloves like red
0:48:11 like very soft leather driving
0:48:13 gloves within the next hour you are to
0:48:16 be transported to Hartford there the war
0:48:19 counil will
0:48:20 begin very good you may select an
0:48:24 Entourage of up to 7 Kindred who will
0:48:26 join
0:48:27 you select them
0:48:30 now Neil Foster Johnny Saxon Wynn cabit BR
0:48:36 ashra are these four Kindred your
0:48:40 choice
0:48:42 yes she very subtly tilts her head and
0:48:46 one of these archons steps away from the
0:48:49 group and calls
0:48:52 out come forward if you are these four
0:48:54 kindred seems like we do so Wynn steps
0:48:58 forward putting on a pair of aviators
0:49:01 Neil steps forward with some panicky
0:49:03 hesitation as does Johnny BR tries to
0:49:07 take the hesitation of the group and
0:49:11 wear it with Grace if she can in her
0:49:13 countenance make that hesitation seem
0:49:16 like submission kind of walk forwards
0:49:20 exactly in the proper way that she has
0:49:22 seen Miles demonstrate so well and hope
0:49:24 to make
0:49:26 the littlest
0:49:28 difference Your
0:49:31 Grace you are to Proclaim Your
0:49:33 Allegiance to the
0:49:36 Camara I Proclaim my allegiance to the
0:49:39 Camara as you do that you feel the
0:49:41 sudden urge to confess any
0:49:53 sins the destruction of Roland
0:49:57 and the way that it came
0:49:59 about was not the way I wanted to
0:50:04 the not following of my instinct that
0:50:09 did not allow me to persecute the sabat
0:50:11 Spy here quick
0:50:14 enough the dragging of my best friend
0:50:18 into a life that ultimately cost him his
0:50:22 own I think Miles looks a little bit
0:50:25 less tall a little bit more shrunken in
0:50:28 after that but he still keeps his head
0:50:32 still kneel still bowed very well King
0:50:35 Slayer
0:50:37 choose who among your group shall come
0:50:40 forward
0:50:45 next
0:50:47 br br Subs
0:50:50 forward declare your loyalty to the
0:50:53 camaria I declare my loyalty to the
0:50:56 CA and you find yourself overcome with
0:51:00 the urge to confess your sins against
0:51:01 the
0:51:04 cha I was embraced without right of
0:51:07 progyny I was involved in deaths that
0:51:09 were not given right of
0:51:11 Destruction I was a member of a g cult
0:51:15 and as those words leave her mouth
0:51:18 there's the clear instinct to defend
0:51:21 herself and to say more but she holds it
0:51:24 back
0:51:25 eyes wide uncertain of what to do Yan
0:51:29 Peterson and his companions seem
0:51:32 to make deliberate effort towards not
0:51:37 reacting with any facial expressions
0:51:39 when Britta says her
0:51:40 peace King Slayer choose who of your
0:51:44 companions will come forward
0:51:46 next Johnny Saxon so Johnny Saxon steps
0:51:51 forward before the Council of justicar
0:51:53 and
0:51:54 archons
0:51:56 you Johnny Saxon of the
0:51:59 brah declare your loyalty to the
0:52:02 camria I declare my loyalty to the
0:52:05 camaria and then you are compelled to
0:52:08 confess your sins against the
0:52:13 camaria I was complicit in the
0:52:15 destruction of Shaw of Klein
0:52:20 naratu I was complicit in the Ambush and
0:52:23 destruction of Prince rolands
0:52:27 I obstructed the
0:52:28 investigation of the scourge
0:52:31 Renwick and I provided audience to
0:52:34 Prince pen
0:52:36 Dragon to allow him to make provision
0:52:40 for diabl in New
0:52:43 York King Slayer choose who among your
0:52:47 companions will come forward next Neil
0:52:51 Foster Neil walks forward shaking just
0:52:54 completely shaking and kneels and
0:52:57 presents himself before the justic car
0:53:00 Neil Foster of the
0:53:01 mcavans declare your loyal to the
0:53:04 Camara I am loyal to the
0:53:10 Camara
0:53:12 I obtained and read passages of the book
0:53:17 of
0:53:18 Nod I hid my personal ties and continued
0:53:24 communication with the children of
0:53:29 hakeim and I am responsible for the
0:53:32 death of
0:53:35 Marcos one
0:53:36 of a member of the camaria ghouls miles
0:53:41 at difficulty 9 I'm going to need you to
0:53:43 make a self-control check
0:53:50 Christ two successes with two successes
0:53:53 you maintain control of of yourself but
0:53:56 whatever you were feeling anyone can
0:53:59 read on your face what do they
0:54:02 see I think mostly that I've continued
0:54:06 to look at the ground clenched my fist
0:54:08 that is on the ground as I'm kneeling
0:54:11 harder and my fangs have extended past
0:54:14 the point of my mouth but I have not
0:54:16 moved much
0:54:18 else Neil is not looking anywhere near
0:54:22 miles cannot bring himself to do it
0:54:25 doesn't even occur to him after his turn
0:54:28 almost needs to be reminded to move
0:54:30 Johnny whose jaw is almost on the floor
0:54:33 just kind of staring in like
0:54:36 confusion slowly reaches out puts a hand
0:54:39 on your shoulder and kind of guides you
0:54:41 back away from
0:54:44 Miles he's pliable and easy to move BR
0:54:48 is sneaking looks at Miles trying to
0:54:50 figure out what she could possibly do to
0:54:52 help him seeing that he has kept kep
0:54:55 control of himself she tries to make her
0:54:58 presence quiet doesn't want to interrupt
0:55:01 proceedings but keeps on checking on him
0:55:05 King
0:55:06 Slayer present your final
0:55:09 companion wi
0:55:12 CIT when if she had been nervous about
0:55:15 speaking before this Council of folks uh
0:55:19 has had her attention sufficiently
0:55:22 deterred by Neil's confession she knows
0:55:26 there's more to the story because she
0:55:28 and Neil were alone in the bathroom with
0:55:32 Marcos and he had asked for privacy
0:55:36 afterwards but that's not a thing we're
0:55:38 going to be able to talk about right now
0:55:40 and
0:55:41 when makes it a point to kneel beside
0:55:46 miles in a show of
0:55:49 support Wynn capit of the
0:55:52 Gangrel declare your loyalty to the
0:55:55 Camara I'm loyal to the
0:55:57 Camara you feel the urge to confess your
0:56:00 sins against the
0:56:02 Camara and there is
0:56:08 silence and in that space Wynn puts her
0:56:11 hand on mil's shoulder and gives a brief
0:56:14 squeeze before returning to herself
0:56:18 justicar gives a nod as if coming to a
0:56:22 decision miles Davenport child of yan
0:56:26 Peterson child of hardat the
0:56:29 Elder above me is a portrait is it an
0:56:34 accurate portrait of
0:56:38 you there is some truth to that
0:56:43 painting how
0:56:46 much enough
0:56:49 it's complicated it is not
0:56:53 fine you Office of The Ventrue justic
0:56:57 caran received a detailed dossier
0:57:01 regarding your history miles Davenport
0:57:04 and the shenanigans you have engaged in
0:57:06 within this
0:57:08 domain you have taken from the
0:57:12 Camara and so it must take from
0:57:17 you do you
0:57:20 understand yes do you accept this
0:57:24 judgment
0:57:27 am I allowed to say
0:57:29 anything she seems like she doesn't want
0:57:32 to but then decides to give a
0:57:37 nod you have the floor for one
0:57:39 minute thank you you
0:57:49 power everything I've
0:57:52 done has been to fortify and secure this
0:57:57 domain as instructed by my
0:58:00 sire not the specific
0:58:03 details but the overall goal he told me
0:58:07 it was important to the path to Breaking
0:58:11 the
0:58:13 Sabbat I was informed that New Haven
0:58:17 needed to be strong with the coming of
0:58:19 the other displaced
0:58:22 princes and the eventual saat seed
0:58:27 and I used my best judgment to do
0:58:30 so if the camarella wills
0:58:33 it then I
0:58:37 obey and this holds true for your
0:58:40 companions as well we fought long and
0:58:43 hard for this city even tonight we are
0:58:46 hunting the mole for the sabat Marcus
0:58:50 vitel then no judgment is

1:01:33 see you next time
1:01:34 [Music]
1:01:39 Kindred def fine sins that I should be
1:01:42 confessing to Tim's like I've never done
1:01:45 anything wrong not done a single thing
1:01:46 wrong any bad things you think Miles has
1:01:51 done miles saved by his own ego and
1:01:54 morality I've never done a thing wrong
1:01:56 in my
1:02:05 life need a minute
1:02:09 Tim a hard time with
1:02:12 this nothing's really coming to
1:02:18 me
1:02:20 ah how question for you how much
1:02:23 Humanity did you lose from the diablerie
1:02:27 two one he made a check which means you
1:02:30 felt bad
1:02:33 yeah so things that you have if you're
1:02:36 just looking at it that way things that
1:02:37 you have felt bad about doing uh
1:02:40 chopping the dude's arm off in season
1:02:42 one you failed that or you I understand
1:02:45 but feeling bad isn't the same as doing
1:02:53 wrong got a point talk
1:02:56 motherucker committing committing the
1:02:59 diablerie yeah but I committed to it so
1:03:01 like I don't like it wasn't a wish-wash
1:03:03 about it no no no that's you committing
1:03:06 to the an act of sin knowing that it's
1:03:10 wrong if anything you have confirmed
1:03:12 that you think that's a sin by saying
1:03:14 that I think that might I the dude's arm
1:03:16 he's he got another one he's fine AR I
1:03:18 totally agree on that's fine yeah any of
1:03:21 the stuff having to do with like being
1:03:23 chill with the demon and you might not
1:03:25 feel bad about any of that you might
1:03:27 think you you actually came on top of
1:03:28 the demon you honestly if it's going by
1:03:31 what you feel bad about and Ergo were
1:03:34 interpreting that as guilt do you feel
1:03:36 guilt about letting marcos's killer get
1:03:39 away or or just CU she it was sins right
1:03:43 so like anything you think you've done
1:03:45 like anything that you think your sire
1:03:49 or yourself probably at least would
1:03:52 think is like not okay would you mind
1:03:54 giving some more uh feedback on terms of
1:03:57 like what you are considering sins here
1:04:02 because let's
1:04:05 say regrets and or things you wish you
1:04:09 didn't have to
1:04:11 do do I get to pick the wording on
1:04:13 this uh you may not intentionally word
1:04:16 it in a way meant to be deceptive
1:04:18 no it's
1:04:21 unfortunate kind of how this works I
1:04:23 don't know works I don't have this power
1:04:26 I don't know what it is what is this
1:04:28 power
1:04:30 gloves it is technically the Ora of
1:04:32 inescapable truth oh okay y I do know
1:04:34 this one with some Buffs oh with some
1:04:37 extra Buffs on top oh boy
