0:00:29 [Music]
0:00:36 last time on path of night Neil's ritual
0:00:40 concluded and he brda and Miles
0:00:43 woke Neil Johnny and Wynn questioned
0:00:47 whether miles took the Demon's
0:00:50 bargain lucita Aisha and Nick stopped by
0:00:53 the Haven Aisha gave Johnny A Warrior's
0:00:56 weapon and armor and nicks bolstered
0:00:58 Neil's mind
0:01:01 the red star loomed brighter over New
0:01:03 Haven as wind was summoned
0:01:06 [Music]
0:01:25 away when you feel the urge to travel
0:01:28 and Obey it
0:01:30 and this takes
0:01:32 you a short distance and you find
0:01:35 yourself traveling to the town hamton
0:01:38 which lies just outside of New
0:01:40 Haven you fly over Dixwell Street you
0:01:44 take a right onto wooden and when you
0:01:47 travel far enough there is a middle
0:01:51 school there's tons of vans that are
0:01:54 parked outside you can immediately see
0:01:57 that there is an armed Patrol that is
0:01:59 moving around the
0:02:01 school as you land some of the guards
0:02:05 are running the main door which is this
0:02:07 pair of big heavy steel doors and it
0:02:11 kind of occurs to you that this place by
0:02:14 Design is actually rather difficult to
0:02:16 access from the outside it's pretty well
0:02:19 enforced as I'm flying there is it
0:02:22 possible to get kind of a sense for
0:02:24 what's going on in the streets yes you
0:02:28 tri or time exam in with a bird's eyee
0:02:31 View and you can see that as though The
0:02:36 Mortals of New Haven were an agitated
0:02:40 flock of
0:02:41 animals this Panic has washed over the
0:02:50 people there is rioting there are small
0:02:52 fires that are
0:02:54 starting people are getting Defender
0:02:57 Benders all across the city
0:03:02 people are scrambling to get out people
0:03:03 are scrambling to loot and steal people
0:03:07 are turning on each other this place is
0:03:10 consuming
0:03:14 itself when
0:03:16 just she understands that it's
0:03:20 not it may not fully be in their power
0:03:23 to
0:03:25 control their actions there's this
0:03:27 blazing red thing in the sky and who
0:03:30 knows what effect it's having on
0:03:33 Mortals but you do sense one
0:03:38 thing on the underworld there is
0:03:42 this raging
0:03:46 storm that whips out lightning like
0:03:50 chains that grasp and feel about as
0:03:53 though this weather condition is this
0:03:57 thinking hunting thing
0:04:01 when she is continuing on her
0:04:03 destination she is not stopping to
0:04:06 investigate if she feels she
0:04:08 can't but she does watch it is this
0:04:11 something she's ever seen before I have
0:04:14 to assume the answer is no but with
0:04:16 arrival of the Maelstrom you have seen
0:04:20 this growing intensity In This Storm of
0:04:24 souls but now more than ever you can see
0:04:28 that the storm itself isn't
0:04:31 just
0:04:32 particles being uh shaken and tossed
0:04:36 about this is a storm of Souls of pain
0:04:41 of
0:04:41 suffering it is this outer shell of what
0:04:47 is oblivion
0:04:50 incarnate you can see that as far as the
0:04:52 shadow Lan is concerned the world is
0:04:55 being devoured by as though consumed by
0:04:59 this massive endless
0:05:02 m is there any evidence of the souls
0:05:06 being flung out back to dead bodies the
0:05:09 only Souls you see occasionally are the
0:05:13 spirits of specters Riding the Storm and
0:05:18 using it to prow and expand ever further
0:05:21 out in search of
0:05:23 prey we are not at all ready when just
0:05:28 kind of thinks to yourself as you land
0:05:31 at the school you feel the Shroud crack
0:05:36 as some of it is chewed and worn Away by
0:05:39 the storm you sense the Shroud rating of
0:05:41 this area reduced by one and it occurs
0:05:45 to you that this violence and Madness
0:05:48 that has exploded across the city of New
0:05:51 Haven is feeding
0:05:54 something something that is dormant but
0:05:56 does not sleep as when watches is the
0:06:00 Maelstrom reaching what she hopes is as
0:06:04 bad as it's going to get but she knows
0:06:06 it's not because if something is
0:06:07 sleeping then that means something is
0:06:09 going to wake up she
0:06:14 remembers hearing that something was
0:06:16 sleeping in Boston
0:06:18 Harbor and why it took her till now to
0:06:21 remember it she doesn't know but the
0:06:23 name capid
0:06:24 docious comes to
0:06:26 mind and she remembers that that had
0:06:30 something to do with the forebears of
0:06:32 the
0:06:33 Giovani something ancient something
0:06:36 perhaps not
0:06:37 unlike Rana or the
0:06:41 eldest may be behind this
0:06:45 Maelstrom and when knows for a fact
0:06:47 they're
0:06:48 unprepared and she may be one of the
0:06:50 only ones in the city who knows how to
0:06:52 fight
0:06:54 this and involuntarily she shakes out
0:06:58 her feathers
0:07:01 and shifts back into her human form her
0:07:04 owl feathers now interspersed with dark
0:07:07 Raven feathers she'll find a spot away
0:07:10 from prying eyes to shift back into her
0:07:14 two-legged
0:07:15 form and she will approach the door one
0:07:18 of the Armed uh men kind of standing
0:07:21 before you they got body armor they got
0:07:23 this like MP5 that they're strapped with
0:07:25 they turn and they tap this buzzer
0:07:28 archon when cab has arrived ma'am and
0:07:31 you hear a familiar voice of a woman and
0:07:35 she says send her in Wynn gives like a
0:07:38 little mock salute to the guys at the
0:07:39 door he gives a courteous nod and he
0:07:42 will actually open the door for you she
0:07:44 will give a nod like she wasn't
0:07:46 expecting him to be polite like that and
0:07:49 walks in sound of her boots kind of
0:07:51 giving a soft tap on the floor as you go
0:07:54 through a lot of the Command Staff
0:07:56 that's present they also give you cardia
0:07:59 nods kind of getting out of your way and
0:08:01 deferring to you as an archon this is
0:08:03 deeply
0:08:04 discomforting but she just kind of bears
0:08:07 with it a lot of the past few days have
0:08:09 been deeply discomforting you are
0:08:11 brought to the
0:08:13 auditorium where on the stage there's a
0:08:17 collection of televisions that are all
0:08:18 kind of set up there's radio equipment
0:08:21 there's all kinds of stuff that's all
0:08:24 unpacked and in an organized fashion
0:08:27 spread around and you see
0:08:30 just
0:08:31 aind standing with this like leather
0:08:34 trench coat on and these like red
0:08:37 leather gloves and her hands are behind
0:08:40 her back and she's sort of directing
0:08:43 this battle and when you enter a group
0:08:49 of the archons that are present
0:08:51 immediately approach you you actually
0:08:52 recognize them as black Alistair and red
0:08:55 death and they approach you and kind of
0:08:59 give you a nod uh Aron Gabby we've got a
0:09:01 situation yeah no [ __ ] um we've lost
0:09:05 contact with the team that was headed to
0:09:07 Hell House who was headed to Hell House
0:09:10 Josie and fire
0:09:11 team okay um you've also
0:09:15 got probably capid docious waking up in
0:09:19 like right above
0:09:21 you what kind of gives you a look J
0:09:25 Carin raises a hand Aron gabit come when
0:09:28 kind of goes past and she pops herself
0:09:31 up on the stage like a dorky theater kid
0:09:33 you know pushing herself up so that her
0:09:35 butt's on the stage and popping up onto
0:09:37 her feet and walks over to loose
0:09:40 end the Maelstrom in the shadowlands
0:09:43 that's been coming for the better part
0:09:45 of this year is probably in all
0:09:48 likelihood capid docious who was
0:09:50 sleeping in the Boston Harbor FW Lo on
0:09:53 by your assessment how much time do we
0:09:55 have uh you don't it's lashing out
0:09:59 chains of lightning looking to capture
0:10:01 more wths and it's feeding into it it's
0:10:03 in the process of waking up set your
0:10:06 stress for the matter aside and
0:10:09 mathematically
0:10:10 speaking before it is an direct threat
0:10:13 to us how much time do you believe we
0:10:17 have when
0:10:19 will try and follow the directions
0:10:22 involuntarily which kind of causes a
0:10:25 knot of anger to broil up but she can't
0:10:27 help but comply lacks about how much
0:10:30 time do I think we have give me an
0:10:32 intelligence plus a cult roll at
0:10:34 difficulty uh would wraith FL be better
0:10:37 uh whichever I you know you may add your
0:10:39 R floor as bonus dice does my necromancy
0:10:41 spec
0:10:44 sure one one success I rolled with three
0:10:48 ones with one success you'd give it
0:10:51 about three nights to a week at
0:10:53 most I would say you've got an average
0:10:57 about five nights three nights if
0:11:00 they're going quick seven nights if
0:11:02 they're giving
0:11:04 hurdles I'm sending you to the field
0:11:07 okay which
0:11:08 one you are an experienced
0:11:11 Necromancer so I will send you to where
0:11:14 you are needed most she holds out her
0:11:17 wrist and gives you a look expecting you
0:11:19 to
0:11:22 drink I [ __ ] hate
0:11:27 this I would have just worked for you
0:11:30 she
0:11:32 seems unbothered by this looks at you
0:11:36 plainly and says lamaria has existed for
0:11:41 centuries and it has not done so without
0:11:45 sacrifice as I have had to make
0:11:48 sacrifices in service to the Camara so
0:11:51 too shall you be
0:11:53 grateful that the Camara has called upon
0:11:56 you to do something Noble and take on
0:11:58 work that you yourself say you would
0:12:00 have done
0:12:01 anyway there are worse
0:12:03 outcomes I'm here to punish miles that's
0:12:06 why I'm here let's not
0:12:08 pretend one step on your journey as an
0:12:11 archon no
0:12:13 drink she like takes her wrist with one
0:12:16 hand and extends the middle finger with
0:12:18 her other hand and drinks you feel
0:12:20 invigorated by the blood uh it does not
0:12:23 however change your blood Bond you've
0:12:25 already drank from earlier in the night
0:12:28 uh you will benefit from from uh the
0:12:30 power personal armor until dawn what
0:12:33 does that do uh weapons are liable to
0:12:36 break when swung against her she makes
0:12:38 sure to clean her lips so there's
0:12:40 nothing left no evidence she'll lick the
0:12:43 wound to make sure it closes she's not
0:12:45 sure if you have to do that with Kindred
0:12:46 but she'll take pains to do that anyway
0:12:49 take a Detachment seek out and destroy
0:12:53 the harbinger of skulls that has arrived
0:12:55 to New Haven now now
0:12:59 all right check back in when your search
0:13:02 is complete am I just finding them or am
0:13:04 I killing them find
0:13:06 them okay when will jump off the
0:13:10 stage Red Balloons Paint It Black you're
0:13:12 with
0:13:13 me one of them kind of gives us look
0:13:16 like that's not my name the other one
0:13:18 just kind of punches his arm all right
0:13:20 let's go you two each pick someone you
0:13:24 trust someone good at hiding the two
0:13:27 reach out and pick up two who have been
0:13:28 working at this whole Center that's been
0:13:30 set up as they're doing that you get an
0:13:33 opportunity to sort of listen to some of
0:13:35 the chatter that's going on on the radio
0:13:37 and it seems that things are worse than
0:13:43 Luc send has described to you they're
0:13:45 reporting in loss of contact at Hell
0:13:48 House due to some encounter with a group
0:13:51 of infernals and in New York Roman pen
0:13:56 Dragon strategy has been a success a
0:14:00 large number of Kindred have arrived to
0:14:02 New York with intentions on Waging War
0:14:05 with sabat in exchange for the
0:14:07 opportunity at diabl however this has
0:14:11 caused some degree of Anarchy as there
0:14:15 are Kindred fening all over the place
0:14:17 and the Masquerade has become paper thin
0:14:21 in New York to make matters worse two
0:14:25 major issues have happened one is that
0:14:30 Roman Pendragon has become
0:14:32 non-communicative uh there are reports
0:14:35 that he has become extremely agitated
0:14:37 and aggressive toward any Kindred that
0:14:39 comes near him at
0:14:41 all the other is that the team that was
0:14:47 working on uh infiltration and securing
0:14:50 the New York
0:14:51 warrants has gone
0:14:55 quiet as this fighting kind of spreads
0:14:59 uh from like around Grand Central St
0:15:01 station to various areas of the city
0:15:04 people are just disappearing and losing
0:15:07 contact uh the initial Haven raids that
0:15:10 took place during the day before this
0:15:12 assault were very very successful but
0:15:16 now that they are directly engaging the
0:15:18 saat there is a massive death toll yeah
0:15:22 who could have seen any of that coming
0:15:23 when just kind of spits the words as she
0:15:26 hears them she will look to one of the
0:15:30 communications guys who seems to be
0:15:32 staying behind and she will jot down the
0:15:35 phone number of everyone in the coder
0:15:38 and she will hand the phone numbers to
0:15:40 him I need you to relay a truncated
0:15:43 version of that
0:15:45 to his
0:15:48 grace and my Coterie understood so they
0:15:51 know how to handle things in New
0:15:53 Haven thank you of course kind of gives
0:15:57 you a nod is there an Armory
0:16:01 here uh yes what do you need we're
0:16:05 probably going to be facing wraiths
0:16:06 folks um I can punch the incorporeal
0:16:09 ones I don't know what they're going to
0:16:11 be able to do to you be ready to be
0:16:13 [ __ ] with oh my favorite one says and
0:16:15 they kind of agree and right we'll
0:16:18 support as best we can okay um also
0:16:22 their
0:16:23 necromancers so
0:16:26 casters think of fighting a bunch of
0:16:28 Neils
0:16:29 tell me a little bit about how you
0:16:32 intend to locate this alleged harbinger
0:16:36 of skulls whatever that even means so
0:16:39 talk to me a little bit about the
0:16:41 effects of extensive necromancy use on
0:16:45 the meat side of things well there is
0:16:51 the path of Ash uh which allows for the
0:16:55 manipulation of the Shroud mhm uh so it
0:16:58 can be raised lowered twisted around
0:17:00 you're not overly sure as to what the
0:17:02 harbingers of skulls themselves can do
0:17:05 MH but you know that the Giovani have a
0:17:09 great deal of experience with playing
0:17:11 with the barrier between worlds MH so
0:17:14 much that they can actually open doors
0:17:17 between them right to the best of wind's
0:17:19 knowledge what we're going to do is
0:17:21 since I do sense that the gauntlet is
0:17:23 lower here we're going to drive around
0:17:24 till we feel it lower like in a you know
0:17:27 that necromancy is easier to perform and
0:17:30 tends to benefit from the presence of a
0:17:32 haunt uh so graveyards old scary places
0:17:36 where people have died are very much
0:17:40 right in tune with what a harbinger of
0:17:42 skulls is going to need to work their
0:17:44 magic okay so knowing that checking the
0:17:47 maps before we go City locations what
0:17:51 have we got in the area what kind of
0:17:53 like graveyard what kind of like
0:17:55 legendary scary manners what kind of
0:17:59 you know the Holy Land yeah you've been
0:18:01 a medium in the city for a long time
0:18:03 yeah I've been a medium in the city for
0:18:04 a while I probably am not unfamiliar
0:18:06 with some of these haunts just looking
0:18:08 at it you're like okay hold on knowing
0:18:10 what a necromancer needs there is a
0:18:12 place called historic Grove Street
0:18:14 Cemetery okay it is a barrel ground
0:18:17 opened back in 1796 and is the oldest
0:18:19 cemetery in the nation designed as a
0:18:22 city of the Dead oh yeah that's that's
0:18:25 what we're looking
0:18:26 for when will kind of pull over a map
0:18:30 shroud is already thinner here guys but
0:18:32 I suspect we're going to find its
0:18:33 thinnest and we're going to find these
0:18:36 skullface
0:18:37 [ __ ] here at the Grove Street
0:18:41 Cemetery it's one of the oldest it may
0:18:43 be the oldest cemetery in the
0:18:47 country all right um I'm going to pack
0:18:50 some weapons and one of them just
0:18:52 marches off by the time they get back
0:18:56 they're ready to head out to the parking
0:18:57 lot and move it the three of you make
0:19:01 your way out one of them is driving this
0:19:03 kind of like Lincoln Town Car
0:19:06 shotgun like aler looks Sullen but kind
0:19:09 of gets in the back and it's not a
0:19:13 terribly long trip to the graveyard um
0:19:15 but when you get there the Shroud is
0:19:17 already much lower than it is elsewhere
0:19:21 in the city and you kind of get the
0:19:25 impression that there are things moving
0:19:27 around in the
0:19:30 graveyard when will kind of look back to
0:19:33 the the crew of people if your hair
0:19:36 stands on end can any of you see ghosts
0:19:38 they shake their heads okay your hair
0:19:41 stands on end you feel chills I'll try
0:19:44 and be there but it's going to feel
0:19:47 weird and ooky and gross but I'll try
0:19:50 and keep things from hitting you just
0:19:52 take care of the things you can see I'll
0:19:53 try to take care of the things you can't
0:19:55 see when you start kind of having a look
0:19:58 around the graveyard one of the first
0:20:00 things you notice is that at its heart
0:20:03 there is a bonfire that is burning
0:20:05 bright and it is
0:20:07 surrounded by you know a dozen dozen and
0:20:10 a half vampires or people but by the
0:20:15 strange body language and the way some
0:20:17 of them have very visible body
0:20:20 modifications you quickly pieced
0:20:23 together that it is the Sabbat that is
0:20:25 gathered here and there are these two
0:20:27 priests that are working in tandem with
0:20:30 one another performing this ritual where
0:20:33 one at a time these saat are leaping
0:20:39 through flames in more and more go and
0:20:42 daring ways and one of them is this kind
0:20:46 of young man big baggy jeans huge like
0:20:49 shirt he's got like a backwards baseball
0:20:52 cap and his face has these like
0:20:57 serpentines scales and he has these
0:21:01 massive Cobra fangs and like bright
0:21:03 yellow eyes and he's just yelling and
0:21:08 screaming and in Spanish kind of uh
0:21:12 directing this very like energized
0:21:15 pumped up right the other figure in
0:21:19 stark contrast to this Serpent of the
0:21:22 light that is performing the right there
0:21:26 is a woman who is clad in the Garb of a
0:21:29 nun and she actually has this very
0:21:33 almost Pious Aura to her except she's
0:21:38 very thin and has the build of like uh
0:21:42 sort of kind of like the older decrepit
0:21:45 aged grandmother like build where she
0:21:47 kind of hunches over ever so slightly
0:21:50 her clothes kind of sit over this very
0:21:53 frail build and her face is completely
0:21:57 Flay off
0:21:59 exposing bone that is painted with all
0:22:03 of these flowers and pretty bright
0:22:06 designs all over her bone face and she
0:22:11 while silent has this very potent Unholy
0:22:20 Aura even though the serpent of the
0:22:23 light is being much louder her presence
0:22:26 while quiet is as all-encompassing as
0:22:31 you know that feeling when you're in a
0:22:33 grave or at a funeral the the thing that
0:22:37 unspoken uh presence that quiets the
0:22:40 world around it she is very much that
0:22:43 around her uh amidst these kind of like
0:22:46 Stone pillars all of the plants that are
0:22:50 there are desiccated withered and dead
0:22:53 most of it crumbling to Ash just with
0:22:55 her
0:22:56 passing and
0:22:59 though you don't know a great deal about
0:23:01 harbingers of
0:23:03 skulls uh you find
0:23:06 yourself confident that this is one uh
0:23:10 and one hand are these beads uh that
0:23:14 kind of end dangling from them is the uh
0:23:17 sabat ank and the other one is this like
0:23:20 leather bound book that is probably the
0:23:23 book of Nod and she is just emanating
0:23:28 the sabats power mhm when we take a
0:23:31 second to survey this if you guys have
0:23:34 experience fighting these guys I'll
0:23:36 defer to you but my suggestion would be
0:23:38 her then him then fire what the [ __ ] is
0:23:41 that thing harbinger of skulls I don't
0:23:43 [ __ ] know
0:23:45 necromancers what did it do to its face
0:23:47 it flade the skin off we can talk about
0:23:49 it after it's
0:23:50 dead he just like stares at you like
0:23:53 eyes
0:23:54 wide look man all right okay so are we
0:23:57 fighting this thing now now I guess not
0:24:01 um I guess she did say don't fight it
0:24:04 just find where they are she sort of
0:24:08 raises her
0:24:09 hands and a whole swath of the graveyard
0:24:13 starts to
0:24:16 shake and crawling from their
0:24:21 graves is this wave of Ratty
0:24:27 old something times wet sometimes dried
0:24:31 out
0:24:35 corpses hold that thought she says to
0:24:39 the one who was freaking out as a
0:24:40 necromancer you are aware that the
0:24:43 Giovani do possess the ability to raise
0:24:45 a corpse however by and large when they
0:24:47 do that they are raising a corpse she is
0:24:51 working some terrible old magic that is
0:24:54 meant to raise armies of the Dead do
0:24:57 they seem to
0:24:59 be pointed in any direction it seems
0:25:02 that they're actually being gathered
0:25:04 towards the sabat okay that they are
0:25:06 essentially raising a force with the
0:25:09 intentions of probably using it the next
0:25:11 night everything in Wind says no we
0:25:14 don't let them use these but Luc send
0:25:16 told her just to find them
0:25:22 yep
0:25:24 [ __ ] Red Death puts a hand on your
0:25:27 shoulder look
0:25:29 this is
0:25:30 fine I get it we're Kindred we're
0:25:33 strongest at night but we actually fight
0:25:35 best during the day let the crew come in
0:25:38 during the day Whittle them down we'll
0:25:40 hit them hard
0:25:44 tomorrow I don't think these zombies are
0:25:46 going to be beholden to the laws of day
0:25:47 and night no but the half dozen or more
0:25:50 sabat that's with them
0:25:51 Doo take every Advantage we can but
0:25:55 we're outnumbered and out gunned
0:25:58 if we go down now here at the start of
0:26:00 this Invasion then what it's not all
0:26:03 that bad for me actually but I know you
0:26:06 care about people don't feed me that
0:26:07 [ __ ] yeah that's
0:26:10 why let's go
0:26:14 let's all right let's go clown
0:26:18 shoes the group of you roll X Plus
0:26:23 stealth does my Swift spec count uh no
0:26:27 okay then I have three successes okay
0:26:30 with three successes uh you guys are
0:26:32 able to get out of there and you were
0:26:34 able to return to report to
0:26:37 Lucent providing Lucen is still on the
0:26:40 stage she will pop up on the stage um
0:26:44 same as she did
0:26:45 before they're in this graveyard
0:26:49 harbinger of skull is there they seem to
0:26:51 be doing some kind of right with a
0:26:54 bonfire and they have raised an actual
0:26:56 Army of zombies from the graves
0:27:00 I
0:27:01 see I did contemplate cleaning it up you
0:27:05 can credit red death for me not touching
0:27:08 that butt I shall rest for now your team
0:27:12 will deal with it tomorrow night I don't
0:27:14 know if it can wait till tomorrow night
0:27:16 it
0:27:17 will siging our mortal teams now while
0:27:22 the mavian and tribu are enacting their
0:27:26 power of Madness is a foolish act we
0:27:30 will control the tempo of this conflict
0:27:32 rushing out to meet the sabat every time
0:27:34 the sabat rushes placed to their hand
0:27:36 when does see the logic in that and
0:27:39 she's mad about it but she's not so mad
0:27:43 that she's not going to see logic when
0:27:45 it smacks her in the face and she will
0:27:47 give a
0:27:48 nod I'm guessing you're probably going
0:27:50 to have me
0:27:52 stay yes where red death will direct you
0:27:56 to your room
0:27:59 she'll turn and jump off the stage again
0:28:02 where am I going red death this
0:28:10 way
0:28:11 as the group of you set
0:28:14 off ready to face the sabat and defend
0:28:18 New
0:28:19 Haven for each of you who has a cell
0:28:23 phone your phone rings right at the same
0:28:27 time
0:28:30 [Music]
0:28:31 what's that don't answer it why why not
0:28:34 don't answer it it's it's Lex it was
0:28:37 like simultaneous simultaneous yes it
0:28:41 it's not I don't I don't think it's
0:28:42 going to be a good call just just ignore
0:28:44 it can I at least peek at the number or
0:28:48 Johnny peaks with the number on his
0:28:49 phone
0:28:50 blocked it's a blocked number now why
0:28:53 can't we look because I'm worried that
0:28:56 what year is it 9
0:28:58 Johnny brazenly flips open his phone and
0:29:01 [ __ ] says hello s who's this I aming
0:29:06 to you on behalf of the Ventrue office
0:29:09 under orders from archon cabit we have
0:29:11 been requested to update you on the
0:29:13 situation as it unfolds in New York City
0:29:15 at this time well thank you for the
0:29:17 update let's hear it in New Haven
0:29:21 multiple packs have besieged the city
0:29:25 and at this time the josian oper Ives
0:29:28 who have moved on Hell House have uh we
0:29:34 have lost contact with them sir it would
0:29:36 seem that there was an ambush laid at
0:29:40 the hands of a group of
0:29:41 infernals in addition to this seems like
0:29:44 the josian need some leadership good
0:29:47 call on the camaria from taking it
0:29:50 continue in New York the initial daytime
0:29:54 strikes were a complete
0:29:57 success and the saat lost onethird of
0:29:59 its forces during that time Roman pen
0:30:04 dragons call for the aid of Kindred
0:30:07 across the States was also a success
0:30:11 there is a large Camara presence in New
0:30:13 York fighting against the sabad at this
0:30:15 time however the Masquerade has grown
0:30:19 grown thin and forces are in
0:30:22 disarray reports indicate that Roman pen
0:30:25 dragon has ceased communic Comm
0:30:28 unication with other Kindred has become
0:30:31 prone to extreme fits of violence and is
0:30:34 otherwise
0:30:35 non-communicative Johnny kind of takes
0:30:37 the phone and props it against his
0:30:39 shoulder so he can light up a
0:30:43 morly well that sounds [ __ ] terrible
0:30:46 anything I can do for you about that um
0:30:49 no thank you we were simply asked to
0:30:52 keep your city officers appraised of the
0:30:55 matter God damn you're so thoughtful
0:30:58 thank you have a good day sir and he
0:31:00 hangs up okay sorry Johnny kind of looks
0:31:03 incredulously at the phone the [ __ ] do I
0:31:06 even have this thing closes it and just
0:31:09 drops it in the uh middle like phone
0:31:12 spot or uh drink container spot in the
0:31:15 in the car bad
0:31:17 news useless news looks like hell house
0:31:21 is still a [ __ ] problem swallowing
0:31:24 teams of josian New York is going as as
0:31:28 expected which is to say a complete [ __ ]
0:31:30 show Roman's [ __ ] Off the Grid
0:31:33 probably mad on diabl or something I
0:31:36 don't know this is [ __ ] Madness Neil
0:31:39 frowns um not that this is a great time
0:31:42 for it but there really hasn't been a
0:31:44 good time for it um when I went to say
0:31:48 goodbye to him there was some kind of
0:31:51 Magic Ritual happening and I I meant to
0:31:53 ask Neil about it but um and BR
0:31:57 described
0:31:58 what she saw with Zacharias Slaine to
0:32:00 Neil she describes the circle as she saw
0:32:04 it she describes the setup of the room
0:32:06 as she saw it various candles that kind
0:32:09 of thing Lex would I be able to piece
0:32:12 together what he was doing here give me
0:32:14 an intelligence plus a cult rule your
0:32:16 difficulty is nine does my sorcery spec
0:32:20 apply yes no one's one success you know
0:32:26 that the demon Z 's power has been
0:32:29 channeled into the bruha Roman pen
0:32:32 dragon and in this state ziil is
0:32:36 suppressed largely unaware of its
0:32:37 surroundings and is this in this dormant
0:32:40 state where its power is basically being
0:32:42 used as an instrument the the exact
0:32:45 details are not overly sure on but you
0:32:48 kind of get the impression that the
0:32:50 ritual was intended to steal the power
0:32:53 of a
0:32:54 demon oh God what a stupid idea um
0:32:58 what so Zachariah slain was was doing
0:33:02 the ritual and and it you know obviously
0:33:05 I wouldn't know exactly but it sounds
0:33:07 like what they were doing uh when had
0:33:09 told us we knew that slain had the demon
0:33:11 bound inside of Raven and it sounds like
0:33:14 what they were doing is trying to
0:33:17 use uh the ritual to sort of harvest the
0:33:22 power of the demon um Z to uh
0:33:29 Empower Roman Pendragon but like I
0:33:33 don't know any sort
0:33:35 of any sort of interruption of that
0:33:37 ritual any flaw in the ritual could
0:33:41 screw that whole thing up and and we
0:33:43 know for a fact based on what Wynn was
0:33:45 telling us that uh he didn't he didn't
0:33:49 have everything like that that the demon
0:33:51 was still capable of lying to him or
0:33:53 tricking to him tricking him or
0:33:55 something so if there's some sort of
0:33:57 like internal source of power that he
0:33:59 could get or some sort of loophole that
0:34:00 he kept in mind or something then he
0:34:03 could subvert whatever the hell is going
0:34:06 on why you don't mess around with demon
0:34:08 magic stupid trir something to summarize
0:34:13 we are saying that something may have
0:34:15 gone wrong with that something may have
0:34:17 have altered the terms of the ritual or
0:34:20 or or changed the the flow of power
0:34:23 within the ritual and yeah it's entirely
0:34:26 possible even if they didn't you know
0:34:27 maybe maybe something maybe the demon is
0:34:30 feeding Pendragon's impulses if if it
0:34:34 suddenly was able to to do something
0:34:36 like that it's going to you know
0:34:38 obviously it's going to
0:34:40 have this is why you don't mess around
0:34:42 with this kind of stuff because like you
0:34:43 never know everything and so anyways or
0:34:46 maybe he's diabled someone that the
0:34:48 demon isn't exempt from taking sway over
0:34:52 yeah I have no idea like if when you
0:34:53 deize someone you devour their soul and
0:34:56 in theory demon
0:34:58 are empowered by The Souls of others so
0:35:00 maybe just by demon plus diabl equals
0:35:04 you know I sounds like Roman is having
0:35:06 an eventful night I might have kissed
0:35:10 him while he was in the ritual Circle I
0:35:12 don't know if that you stepped inside
0:35:13 the ritual Circle I didn't move it or
0:35:15 anything but you were inside the ritual
0:35:16 Circle and you made contact with Roman
0:35:18 ped Dragon yeah and Johnny uh grabs the
0:35:22 rear view and turns it so that he's
0:35:25 looking directly at you at Neil or br BR
0:35:28 and you see him kind of give you a nod
0:35:31 [ __ ] serves him right and then he
0:35:34 turns the rear viw back to looking at
0:35:36 the road BR looks thoroughly chastised
0:35:40 and uh is not on your page about that I
0:35:44 don't know what's happening less
0:35:46 concerned that maybe it interrupted the
0:35:47 ritual and killed Roman Pendragon
0:35:50 although and more that BR would be some
0:35:53 sort of link to Pendragon who is
0:35:55 channeling the powers of a demon is kind
0:35:58 of my concern let's focus up here but
0:36:00 this is part of it though Miles because
0:36:02 like a demon will if you use a demon's
0:36:04 power it eventually will Hollow you out
0:36:07 just like it did to Raven and so can you
0:36:10 imagine like Z walking around with
0:36:12 somebody using the body of somebody with
0:36:14 the potency of Roman Pendragon
0:36:17 apocalyptic and we're already dealing
0:36:18 with enough apocalyptic stuff and I
0:36:20 could imagine that but we have pressing
0:36:22 matters at hand like miles was saying so
0:36:25 I'm not going to imagine that I'm going
0:36:27 to imagine what's [ __ ] in front of us
0:36:29 right now miles what's in front of us
0:36:32 right now Neil like rubs his eyes and
0:36:35 like his temples and just kind of f
0:36:37 don't roll your eyes at me I can feel I
0:36:38 can feel them rolling in the back roll R
0:36:41 I swear to God I will turn this [ __ ]
0:36:44 SUV around and drop you back off at the
0:36:46 at the Haven I don't need this kind of
0:36:48 energy in my combat SUV right now miles
0:36:53 what are we doing miles checks his phone
0:36:55 to see if there's any updates that he's
0:36:57 received from anyone in the
0:36:59 infrastructure miles you know that
0:37:01 currently Dixwell is actually being
0:37:02 overseen by weathers if he needs backup
0:37:06 something's probably going down that's
0:37:07 pretty bad over there uh in addition to
0:37:10 that you receive word that Union Station
0:37:13 is currently being overrun it is being
0:37:15 defended by Xavier when you hear from
0:37:20 the Gangrel that are fighting out
0:37:22 there one you hear gunshots uh kind of
0:37:25 coming in over the phone and the guy
0:37:27 tells you look we've got these sabat
0:37:29 haacks that are coming through one uh
0:37:31 some Wrecking Crew in Deliverance of the
0:37:33 Unworthy Xavier's putting in the work
0:37:35 but we are going to need a lot of blood
0:37:37 when this is done we think we can repel
0:37:39 them but we're going to need a lot of
0:37:40 blood all right I'll pass the messes
0:37:43 along uh you get into contact with
0:37:45 downtown uh lucita and uh Kabir are in
0:37:49 that area at the moment they do have
0:37:52 some blood stores that were prepared by
0:37:53 the asites due to a lack of the Tremere
0:37:56 though it's not nearly enough to sustain
0:38:00 this force of vampires over the course
0:38:02 of like multiple days but if you want to
0:38:05 cash that in now they can use it to help
0:38:07 the Gangrel let's keep Union Station
0:38:10 secured and help the Gangrel there's no
0:38:13 point in for now I will cash in the
0:38:16 stores from uh Lu and Kabir to solve
0:38:19 that problem is there any other ones
0:38:22 going on you said Dixwell is under is
0:38:24 Dixwell is where you guys are headed now
0:38:26 okay all right Johnny just checked in it
0:38:28 looks like uh we're heading our way to
0:38:31 Dixwell to see what's going on there
0:38:32 Union Station seems to be uh being
0:38:35 overrun by PS right now but the gang
0:38:38 girl there seem to think they've got it
0:38:40 under control have you heard anything
0:38:41 else from weathers not yet but we're
0:38:43 heading DM so hopefully we hear from him
0:38:45 soon do you think the message from the
0:38:48 the one that you were listening to
0:38:49 Johnny do you think that means W's okay
0:38:51 I hope so I have no idea where she is I
0:38:54 can only assume that the Jar's office
0:38:56 has pulled her away in business but
0:38:58 she's helping the city just from a
0:39:00 different direction she'll be in touch
0:39:01 if she needs us otherwise we need to
0:39:04 focus on what's in front of us which is
0:39:06 he um whatever Big's happening down in
0:39:08 Dixwell he glances over his shoulder
0:39:11 really quick at Neil we can't really
0:39:13 afford right now to be running off after
0:39:15 her we have to be focusing on putting
0:39:17 all of her attention to the problem at
0:39:19 hand Neil frowns and like his left hand
0:39:24 is very clearly rubbing the photo book
0:39:28 that's in his Satchel bag absentmindedly
0:39:31 but he snaps back into the
0:39:33 present
0:39:35 um yeah I I
0:39:37 guess okay H miles anytime you want an
0:39:41 eye on the sky though let me know let's
0:39:43 see what we're dealing with once we get
0:39:45 there turning on the dick well now first
0:39:49 thing you notice is that aside from the
0:39:51 light of fires and the red star that
0:39:53 hangs overhead there's no light here
0:39:57 powers out Johnny I need a DEX plus
0:40:01 Drive check as a group of something

0:41:15 way but whatever it is shoulders the SUV
0:41:19 tips it over onto its size you catch a
0:41:22 very quick glimpse of it but whatever it
0:41:24 is it is bigger than a van it is this
0:41:28 amalgamation of hands arms eyes rib
0:41:31 cages and
0:41:33 flesh it is sturdy as though you like
0:41:37 crash into a boulder and this thing just
0:41:40 very casually shoulders the SUV up on
0:41:43 its side with levels of potence that are
0:41:46 not possible for most
0:41:48 Kindred now now that you guys have
0:41:51 gotten a good look at this and I
0:41:52 apologize for a series of rules but now
0:41:55 I need a courage rule and difficulty six

0:42:28 [Music]
0:42:30 the group of you steal
0:42:33 yourselves and while on your
0:42:36 sides smashed windows busted up vehicle
0:42:40 you get to look at what Dixwell has
0:42:42 turned
0:42:43 into and you see roaming
0:42:47 corpses ransacking the street dragging
0:42:52 Mortals that they find who are trying to
0:42:54 flee to the ground to rip them to pieces
0:42:58 [Music]
0:42:59 you see a pair of these massive hulking
0:43:05 monstrosities one of them casually
0:43:08 shouldered your SUV onto its side
0:43:12 wrecking havoc and treating this as much
0:43:17 as a party as it is a religious Crusade
0:43:22 is a crew of canites who are gorging on
0:43:28 blood slapping each other playing
0:43:31 Breaking windows with bricks and just
0:43:34 having a great time at the head of this
0:43:39 small parade this
0:43:43 procession is a woman who is dressed in

0:47:59 does not approach you immediately about
0:48:01 it but if you do approach her
0:48:02 immediately about it you absolutely have

0:52:23 attacks um the first attack will have
0:52:27 uh three successes and the second attack
0:52:30 we'll have two successes two and then
0:52:32 one uh will carry over into damage and
0:52:34 each attack I am spending uh a point of
0:52:37 blood for potent for this
0:52:41 round so the first attack uh will be 10
0:52:47 what kind of damage is off this axe
0:52:49 blood tempered axe it is aggravated

0:54:24 fire a so yeah he tries to stab you with
0:54:26 the W next
0:54:30 one well Temple they will attempt
0:54:33 actually uh they'll spend W power to
0:54:34 redirect and will'll attempt the old
0:54:36 grapple
0:54:41 white they have one success to grab you
0:54:44 I don't really want them to do that do I
0:54:46 that's up to you it's just a bruha
0:54:48 grabbing
0:54:50 you I will Parry the attempt to Grapple
0:54:53 me you only need one success
0:54:57 four successes with four successes you
0:55:00 wave him off with your weapon but he
0:55:02 does try with a second attack to grab
0:55:04 you
0:55:07 anyways and completely fails he's very
0:55:10 afraid of that
0:55:13 blade uh that will Mark the end of uh
0:55:17 the quote unquote dogs and we are on to
0:55:20 Neil Neil will scramble out of the car
0:55:25 dragging himself out like the shadow
0:55:26 back window and then attempt to cloak
0:55:30 the Gathering on everyone can I see wi
0:55:33 at this point yeah yeah you saw win pull
0:55:35 up I he doesn't shout because he's
0:55:37 trying not to draw but looks directly at
0:55:40 win with this like oh thank God you're
0:55:43 here thank God you're safe look and then
0:55:46 I will attempt to cloak the Gathering um
0:55:49 to vanish everyone Lex what is the uh of
0:55:54 the crowd who is currently looking at me
0:55:56 and can like draw a line of sight to me
0:55:58 what's the highest with uh alertness in
0:56:01 the immediate vicinity you're looking at
0:56:03 a difficulty of six I am plus two dice
0:56:06 from R minus two dice because I'm [ __ ]
0:56:10 up okay I only get one success so we do
0:56:13 not disappear but you get that plus two
0:56:16 diff to be everybody can I include win
0:56:18 in this or is she too far away uh she's
0:56:21 a little too far away okay actually you
0:56:23 know go ahead it was your wish so
0:56:25 everybody
0:56:26 basically like Fades out a little bit
0:56:29 any attacks that are made against any of
0:56:31 you are at plus two difficulty unless
0:56:34 they can negate Hy skate or whatever but
0:56:36 like whenever they try and do something
0:56:37 they have to roll or else they are at
0:56:40 plus two difficulty to attack you um
0:56:42 that's be included and then he sort of
0:56:43 like Honkers down crouched behind the
0:56:46 the thing the other War ghoul kind of
0:56:49 gives this like twitch of
0:56:51 confusion and its body seems to kind of
0:56:55 take a step back back and start
0:56:57 spasming uh the zi controlling it is
0:57:00 like trying to direct it but it's not
0:57:03 responding to commands any kind of saat
0:57:06 Survivor lore I could check on to make
0:57:09 to see why that might be yeah go ahead
0:57:11 roll uh was that intelligence plus Sor
0:57:15 yep to
0:57:17 five uh well hot damn two successes with
0:57:20 two successes you recall this urban
0:57:24 legend that had existed the saat locally
0:57:27 for a while they had called it the
0:57:30 Weeping bear and it was this war ghoul
0:57:34 that had suddenly stopped obeying its
0:57:36 maker and had gone on this Rampage under
0:57:40 the direction of God knows
0:57:43 what turns out bringing War ghouls into
0:57:45 New Haven is a bad
0:57:47 idea [ __ ] that's not good for anybody
0:57:50 Man episode 8 call back mhm damn all
0:57:53 right is it is it wind's turn it is is
0:57:57 what the [ __ ] she's not totally sure why
0:58:01 she's here her head hurts she look kind
0:58:03 of looks to her crew like do they have
0:58:05 any [ __ ] answers they look a little
0:58:07 confused last year remember you were
0:58:08 actually suiting up the Armory and we're
0:58:11 getting ready to put on some gear and
0:58:12 hit the road and then all of a sudden
0:58:15 you're here okay I don't think our plan
0:58:17 has changed that much no go go after
0:58:22 those two she's releasing specters I'm
0:58:24 going to try and keep them under control
0:58:26 tell me what you do about the specters
0:58:28 when is going
0:58:30 to whip out that Seiler path and pop
0:58:34 Claws and hopefully they can work in
0:58:37 concert to take apart some specters okay
0:58:40 give me an attack roll as you lash out
0:58:43 at some
0:58:45 specters three successes two roll over
0:58:48 into damage I will spend a blood to for
0:58:51 potent for four automatic successes
0:58:57 some of these dice are getting put in
0:58:59 timeout oh no no successes uh four
0:59:03 successes from the potent oh there we go
0:59:06 you rake your claws deep into its Corpus
0:59:09 and the flesh doesn't bleed as much as
0:59:13 split apart from itself revealing this
0:59:16 gaping wound that leads into a sort of
0:59:21 uh wispy and nondistinct flesh like
0:59:25 normally when you rip anything you can
0:59:26 see organs you can see all the little
0:59:27 Parts in action with this thing it's not
0:59:29 so much how much damage did that seem to
0:59:32 do to it is it still like thriving or is
0:59:35 it like hurting so it's made of Corpus
0:59:38 it doesn't have wound penalties okay
0:59:40 they don't slow down from the damage
0:59:42 that they take they're either still up
0:59:44 or down okay the other War ghoul Johnny
0:59:47 it picks up the car and tries to smash
0:59:49 you with
0:59:51 it two successes
0:59:54 to yeah yeah
0:59:56 absolutely successes I'm not dodging two
0:59:59 successes let's [ __ ] get out of the
1:00:00 way huh you don't want to get hit with a
1:00:03 car twice in one scene no thank you well
1:00:05 the one takes my 10 away but that's
1:00:07 three successes to dodge you dodge it
1:00:10 kind of with one scooping motion lifts
1:00:12 and mashes the car right beside you it
1:00:16 is torn aunder and this thing is playing
1:00:20 with easily over a ton of weight uh what
1:00:23 car did It smash the SUV arrived you
1:00:26 arrived it Johnny glances over at
1:00:29 Miles glances back at the war ghoul and
1:00:31 kind of nods like I understand who has
1:00:33 celarity actions I do I do Johnny does
1:00:37 everyone but Rob yep R you're up the
1:00:40 Situation's getting bloodier and with
1:00:42 the arrival of wind there's some hope
1:00:44 but people are banged up and as much
1:00:48 damage as people are pouring in The
1:00:50 Field's still just as populated brda
1:00:53 feels something sharpen in her that she
1:00:56 hadn't felt sharpened before at least
1:00:58 not in a way where she felt in control
1:01:01 something Awakening in her training that
1:01:04 sends her into a controlled Fury I'm
1:01:08 going to activate her Berserker Merit
1:01:11 which will it will reduce the difficulty
1:01:14 of your combat Rules by three yes thank
1:01:16 you now what this means is that I must
1:01:18 take combative actions unless I'm doing
1:01:20 things such as running dodging that kind
1:01:22 of thing but that being said locked in
1:01:26 in and a new level of aggression showing
1:01:29 through I'm going to follow the plan
1:01:32 seek cover and br will point the assault
1:01:35 rifle towards the sui as I am shooting
1:01:39 from ausc does this count as an attack
1:01:42 from South
1:01:46 yes so on the south roll I got six
1:01:49 successes so then we're moving on to the
1:01:52 assault rifle roll head shots plus two
1:01:54 difficulty that will be I believe
1:01:56 canceled out and a little bit more by
1:01:58 the Berserker
1:02:03 yes eight successes okay seven will
1:02:06 carry over into
1:02:10 damage 11 successes uh they will take
1:02:13 seven levels of lethal damage and are
1:02:15 reduced
1:02:16 incapacitated there you go I believe
1:02:18 that pop spread it out of ay skate but
1:02:21 she is behind cover and there's an
1:02:23 intensity in her that you might
1:02:25 recognize from um her movements among
1:02:27 the tamaha she is intensely focused she
1:02:31 seems driven and remind you of that time
1:02:33 she shot veto miles it's your turn which
1:02:36 one of these dogs was trying to Grapple
1:02:38 me I believe C-Dog I believe C-Dog
1:02:41 is going to receive a uh sword to his
1:02:44 body um as I take a swing at him I go
1:02:48 you should have left my domain oh [ __ ]

1:03:02 [Laughter]
1:03:03 adequacy uh eight successes well that's
1:03:07 the hit he will

1:06:27 go as far as her feet will take her
1:06:29 before she will find another Spectre in
1:06:31 the row and take another swing at it go
1:06:34 for
1:06:35 it six to hit five will roll over into
1:06:40 damage 12 levels of egg to this one uh
1:06:44 he is destroyed out right okay and she
1:06:46 will take another few steps towards the
1:06:48 head of the Spectre pack to try and head
1:06:50 them off before they can get to BR okay
1:06:53 Johnny do you have any remaining actions
1:06:54 oh yeah budy I will dispatch the war
1:06:56 ghoul in front of
1:06:58 me one success zero will carry over oh
1:07:03 it's three
1:07:04 ones another 13
1:07:10 egg it is destroyed by your
1:07:14 hand and you need to roll to soak one
1:07:16 level of aggravated
1:07:18 damage uh seven successes you soak it
1:07:22 very easily however the acid is an elder
1:07:27 level power and as a result its acidic
1:07:29 effect does reduce your armor rating by
1:07:31 one so Johnny's leather jacket will be
1:07:34 destroyed this is going to apply to the
1:07:36 blood tempering oh so do I still have
1:07:39 the jacket the jacket also loses a level
1:07:41 of armor um so leather chck is gone
1:07:44 blood tempered is damaged understood
1:07:46 what do we have left I think we're on to
1:07:50 new round I still have a Celerity action
1:07:52 Bud oh oh you went five actions oh yeah
1:07:56 brother [ __ ] right go ahead good bye
1:08:00 uh I throw a blood tempered axe into the
1:08:03 back of the
1:08:04 dog is that Athletics or is that melee
1:08:08 uh it's going to be
1:08:11 Athletics four successes I'm guessing
1:08:14 three carry over uh
1:08:17 [Music]
1:08:19 yes 15 egg he dies
1:08:25 miles is very nearly hit as the axe bout
1:08:28 goes through
1:08:30 him nice aim can I have that
1:08:34 [Music]
1:08:38 back new round BR at the start of the
1:08:41 new round I will spend another Blood for
1:08:43 Celerity currently the enemies we have
1:08:46 on the field are farther down correct uh
1:08:49 yes um Johnny will actually go up to
1:08:52 initiative 20 because I'm not spending
1:08:54 any uh a Celerity this round okay
1:08:57 looking to seek cover and to keep on
1:09:00 shooting magic users first okay which
1:09:03 one are you targeting yeah that's true
1:09:05 they both look equally magicky I will
1:09:09 shoot at the one without the face okay
1:09:12 uh so you shoot I'm not going to have
1:09:13 you roll uh but the bullets
1:09:18 are consumed by the entropic field that
1:09:21 surrounds her and they L lose all
1:09:24 momentum and fall har harmlessly to the
1:09:27 ground before slowly atomizing away into
1:09:30 nothing you see Pera seek new position
1:09:33 seek new cover she goes to shoot and
1:09:35 there is no response apart from that
1:09:39 what have the other archons been doing
1:09:41 uh there is a [ __ ] ton of uh zombies and
1:09:44 whatnot walking around and they've been
1:09:46 just keeping the area clear and keeping
1:09:49 you guys from being overwhelmed by the
1:09:51 other saat that are present and the
1:09:53 undead very good MH uh will attempt to
1:09:56 spend a point of blood to heal in
1:09:58 addition to doing other actions so he's
1:10:00 going to make a stamina roll go for
1:10:02 it difficulty eight it is Def eight two
1:10:06 successes so he will heal a point of
1:10:09 Bastion damage and then for his action
1:10:12 he's going to split it up a little bit
1:10:13 the intent is to grab up Rufio drink
1:10:19 three points of his blood and then
1:10:21 potent smash his head into the ground so
1:10:24 I will gain net two blood and that'll
1:10:26 Johnny's action miles how far away are
1:10:29 these two fire and no face about 50
1:10:33 yards is that close enough for me to use
1:10:35 dominate on fire guy they are not going
1:10:37 to be able to hear you over the chaos of
1:10:39 the city all right I will start moving
1:10:41 towards the flame Guy The Harbinger and
1:10:45 the uh flame guy will go the serpent of
1:10:48 the
1:10:49 light Neil your consumed by Flames take
1:10:53 three levels of aggravated damage at
1:10:54 diff 9 to soak cannot soak it okay I
1:10:58 take three egg don't you have armor can
1:11:00 I use armor when you're consumed by
1:11:01 Flames sure but sff
1:11:04 nine I will soak one and take two egg
1:11:07 take two egg it's an important one bud I
1:11:10 need a r trck check difficulty nine oh
1:11:13 yeah
1:11:14 obviously uh wouldn't it be difficulty
1:11:17 uh seven so I've got hold on I've got
1:11:20 five one two it's not a fear power he's
1:11:22 just literally on fire yeah oh yeah I
1:11:26 guess I'll call it a fear effect cuz you
1:11:29 know I need all the help I can get I get
1:11:31 that yeah um okay there is the plus two
1:11:34 difficulty to be hit I don't know if
1:11:35 that counts for being lit on fire
1:11:37 no targeting me yeah yeah gang's all
1:11:41 here fire so here's the deal I had I'm
1:11:43 taking two EG I had five bashing on me
1:11:46 what happens here I don't remember how
1:11:48 so mark down two more and then your top
1:11:51 two Health levels are going to turn into
1:11:53 X's but if you have bashing and you're
1:11:54 in C are you at incap friend parents
1:11:56 don't go unconscious yeah okay I I could
1:11:59 not remember I am spending one of my
1:12:01 extraneous willpower
1:12:04 cuz I got a four a two and a two so that
1:12:07 one willpower keeps me from running
1:12:10 you're still in it Miles She reaches out
1:12:13 to touch you who is she in the S the
1:12:16 harbinger of skulls okay just
1:12:18 checking she has nine successes to touch
1:12:20 you she touches your cheek and says
1:12:26 rest now my sweet prince and for the
1:12:30 first time in a very very long time you
1:12:35 feel sick and you don't just feel sick
1:12:38 you feel more sick than you have ever
1:12:40 felt in life your eyes become
1:12:44 sunken you're covered in sweats of blood
1:12:48 your limbs are blackened and your body
1:12:51 is ravaged by the Bubonic plague Within
1:12:55 the next 24 hours you will enter a
1:12:57 torper that you may not
1:12:59 leave beyond that it doesn't actually
1:13:01 apply any penalties you just you just
1:13:02 have a clock now and you're extremely
1:13:05 virulent to other Kindred or to Mortals
1:13:07 both with ancient terrible power she
1:13:11 brings harm to miles do I need a frenzy
1:13:14 roll for that if you're asking you're
1:13:16 rolling I know that's three successes
1:13:19 Neil uh Neil had been hiding behind an
1:13:23 SUV That Was Then picked up up and torn
1:13:25 in half and then he was lit on fire from
1:13:28 down the street so he will do what
1:13:32 anyone uh would do panic in that
1:13:35 situation and uh scream and throw
1:13:38 himself on the ground and start patting
1:13:39 himself out and try stop Dro and roll
1:13:41 give me a DEX plus Athletics oh Jesus
1:13:45 Christ remember your tactics bonus yep
1:13:49 and your willpower uh I have to spend
1:13:51 that willpower to ignore wound penalties
1:13:53 or else I get negative one die even
1:13:57 including the tactics pool so by
1:13:59 spending willpower to ignore I have a
1:14:01 four diey pool here all right well I
1:14:03 don't have any specs that would apply
1:14:05 but I do get uh again thanks to this
1:14:07 tactics pool two successes okay thanks
1:14:10 to the tactics pool uh you are not
1:14:12 consumed by flames and instead put
1:14:14 yourself out you stop drop and roll
1:14:16 that's my whole turn when you're go what
1:14:20 does the Shroud look like around her
1:14:22 thin thin and around her there is an ore
1:14:24 of death people who are living uh plants
1:14:28 those things simply wither and die in
1:14:30 her presence she's like this sliver of
1:14:34 Oblivion walking the streets of New
1:14:36 Haven what does this road beneath her do
1:14:39 does like the road crack like nothing
1:14:42 okay it grows like pale and tarnished
1:14:45 but so I will be smacking that Spectre
1:14:49 okay two successes one roll over into
1:14:52 damage and I spent blood for four
1:14:55 automatic potent success is on damage
1:15:00 yeah 14 egg on the Spectre yeah it is
1:15:05 destroyed with one F swoop when will
1:15:08 then start moving toward the haringer
1:15:11 and the snur okay who has taken Celerity
1:15:15 actions I have
1:15:17 Brea I will attempt to shoot the serpent
1:15:20 of the light shooting for the head again
1:15:23 yes
1:15:26 11
1:15:27 successes 10 will roll over into
1:15:31 damage [ __ ] them off plus one for the
1:15:34 head
1:15:37 shot Seven damage
1:15:40 lethal you will take four seeing the
1:15:44 effect on her bullets but still driven
1:15:46 to purpose BR just shifts targets and
1:15:49 starts laying into the serpent of the
1:15:51 light miles as I move over to engage
1:15:55 snake man I go uh she destroys equipment
1:15:59 or anything that gets near her uh Wynn I
1:16:01 think you're best at this on
1:16:04 it uh seven to hit six roll over into
1:16:08 damage I'm going to spend for my
1:16:12 potent it'll be six
1:16:14 damage his uh scaly flesh is actually
1:16:19 quite resistant to uh the damage of the
1:16:21 weapon and uh he will soak five levels
1:16:23 of damage he will take one way do you
1:16:25 have any remaining City I have one more
1:16:27 I'll close in honor okay with the
1:16:29 remaining action you close in and arrive
1:16:32 to the harbinger of skulls I will stay
1:16:34 out of her easy reach I will close in on
1:16:36 my action or she will have to come to me
1:16:38 I am not going to be right there for her
1:16:40 to reach out and touch okay sounds good
1:16:42 uh anyone else have celarity actions I
1:16:44 can hit the snake man again
1:16:48 okay 10 to hit nine will roll over into
1:16:51 damage
1:16:57 seven damage he will be reduced to
1:17:03 torper round three BR you're up how
1:17:07 close are people locationally to her
1:17:09 miles and uh Wynn are relatively nearby we
1:17:14 know what happens to inorganic matter we
1:17:17 don't know what happens to organic
1:17:18 matter BR is going to use her new
1:17:21 Newfound potent that Johnny's given her
1:17:24 pick up one of the Dead bodies and hurl
1:17:25 it at the cter is this Dex Athletics Dex
1:17:28 Athletics does unspent solity count yeah
1:17:32 difficulty seven does her berserk count
1:17:34 for this yeah five successes okay four
1:17:37 will roll over into damage uh it's a
1:17:39 three bashing weapon if you spend a
1:17:41 blood you get three potents we're in
1:17:43 this
1:17:47 sure nine successes including the potent
1:17:51 she will soak six uh she will take one
1:17:55 level of bashing damage and she will
1:17:58 turn to look at you does she need a
1:18:00 frenzy check no R having served her
1:18:03 blood to the purpose of potent for the
1:18:05 first time in that way is feeling a
1:18:08 strange mixture of emotions all weirdly
1:18:11 affected by the state that she's in I
1:18:14 don't know that any Tomah training is
1:18:17 enough to not feel some fear at that if
1:18:20 I have any movement remaining I will use
1:18:23 it to get away
1:18:26 so you check the body and start running
1:18:28 away from her absolutely miles can I G
1:18:32 in eye contact with her she doesn't have
1:18:35 eyeballs does that preclude me from
1:18:37 using dominate on her you have no idea
1:18:38 man you've never seen anything quite
1:18:40 like this you certainly have no idea
1:18:43 whether or not you have eye
1:18:44 contact
1:18:50 fantastic you know what I pick up the
1:18:53 snake man's body and throw it at
1:18:58 said diff seven or is it yes it is diff
1:19:00 seven you are wielding a person so
1:19:02 slightly in effect four successes three
1:19:05 will roll over into damage I will allow
1:19:07 the big hand spec to
1:19:10 apply that'll be eight successes she
1:19:12 will soak seven I will move farther
1:19:16 away it is the harbinger's turn she is
1:19:20 going to close the distance and grab you
1:19:22 all right miles
1:19:25 wow she has one success to grab you I am
1:19:28 attempting to dodge whole boy successful
1:19:31 at least six okay uh you will avoid her
1:19:34 bone crafting you she
1:19:39 no so Miles jumps back very gracefully
1:19:43 uh yells
1:19:45 no like I feel terrible and she just
1:19:48 creeps towards you with long spindly
1:19:51 fingers uh Johnny I would like to split
1:19:55 my action into two parts part one would
1:19:58 be using leap and Bounds to uh jump as
1:20:01 high into the air as I possibly can and
1:20:03 part two would be to land uh boots first
1:20:06 on her head okay uh no role necessary
1:20:08 for Leaps and Bounds you aren't landing
1:20:10 on anything particularly slippery why
1:20:12 don't you go ahead and give me your Dex
1:20:14 brawl I had 50% dice
1:20:17 pool would you consider this to be a
1:20:19 street fighting maneuver I would okay
1:20:22 100% five successes four will roll over
1:20:25 into damage I will spend a point of
1:20:27 blood to uh get automatic successors
1:20:30 from my current potent eight do I get
1:20:33 any additional damage Dice from the fact
1:20:35 that I jumped very high into the air and
1:20:37 came screaming down like a comet uh yeah
1:20:41 I give you a couple two damage dice I
1:20:43 love
1:20:45 it well unfortunately my powerful arms
1:20:48 don't count here nope that will be
1:20:52 13 uh lethal damage she will soak nine
1:20:57 um and actually this is this just
1:20:59 becomes bashing damage against fair fair
1:21:00 enough it is just bashing yeah but she
1:21:03 will take two levels of bashing damage
1:21:04 in total outstanding she is now at three
1:21:07 bashing oh uh Johnny your boots [ __ ]
1:21:10 Neil how you doing over there all right
1:21:12 I got a couple of questions cuz I like
1:21:15 everybody else is up that way I'm a
1:21:17 little ways away yeah you said the city
1:21:19 is a little too chaotic and [ __ ] right
1:21:21 now for her to be able to hear me from
1:21:23 here right yes unless you have some
1:21:25 means of getting your voice over so
1:21:28 instead Neil will like stagger to his
1:21:31 feet still smoking and look at her she
1:21:34 is in my line of sight right she is in
1:21:36 your line of sight and then reach out
1:21:38 and make like a twisting grasping
1:21:41 gesture with his hands and then suddenly
1:21:44 lift up and I am going to try and
1:21:48 evaporate the blood inside of her body
1:21:51 okay she gets to roll stamina plus
1:21:53 fortitude to resist me at difficulty 9
1:21:56 which I know she's got a crazy ass pool
1:21:57 but this is what I can do from here I
1:21:58 have to spend a willpower to ignore my
1:22:00 will penalties or none of this is
1:22:02 getting off but that means I have a 12
1:22:04 die pool remember your tactics 12 that's
1:22:07 what makes it 12 will power 10 plus two
1:22:12 dice all right well I will have seven
1:22:14 successes uh at D eight actually well
1:22:17 two successes at diff nine okay so what
1:22:19 happens oh wait D eight not seven
1:22:21 correct uh so that's what did I say
1:22:24 seven you said seven that's five
1:22:25 successes okay I'm sorry you have three
1:22:28 more uh than her okay so she will lose
1:22:31 three blood as it begins evaporating out
1:22:34 of her pores and sockets and like turns
1:22:37 to mist around her and she has to make a
1:22:40 courage test at difficulty six I should
1:22:44 spend W fire yeah and she has four
1:22:47 successes okay so despite the agony she
1:22:50 is able to take an action next round is
1:22:52 this a pain effect this is a pain effect
1:22:54 totally oh that makes sense with any
1:22:56 remaining like movement or whatever I
1:22:58 have I'll start staggering down the
1:23:00 street towards the rest of the Coty when
1:23:02 she is not paying attention to me
1:23:04 currently right I'm you you don't know
1:23:07 where her eyes are looking she they're
1:23:09 pitch has she turned her body away from
1:23:11 me I guess is my question no I mean
1:23:13 she's aware of her surroundings and able
1:23:15 to defend herself okay she's not like
1:23:16 randomly putting her back to people in a
1:23:18 fight like she seems competent enough to
1:23:21 not do that when will Dart in and SL
1:23:24 flash go for
1:23:27 it uh four to hit three roll over into
1:23:30 damage I'm spending for
1:23:34 potent uh that'll be 15 EG uh do you
1:23:37 have something that negates armor do I
1:23:38 have something that negates armor yeah
1:23:40 uh I do not CP she will soak 11 levels
1:23:43 of aggravated damage that puts her at
1:23:45 four more egg on her she is brought to
1:23:49 incapacitated damage with bashing so she
1:23:51 stays on her feet who's got Celerity
1:23:53 actions I have one I have two ready to
1:23:56 go I am continuing on with my terrible
1:23:58 strategy and I'm looking for one of the
1:24:00 dogs to hook at her all right you start
1:24:01 checking a dog go dexterity Athletics
1:24:04 yes sff seven then Modified by your
1:24:07 Merit this is absolutely not graceful
1:24:11 this is not counting my spec seven
1:24:13 successes six will roll over into
1:24:17 damage one success she is hit and
1:24:20 unfazed and after that I will keep on
1:24:22 running okay m were're on you I'm going
1:24:25 to hold just in case she tries to touch
1:24:26 me understood Johnny uh Johnny is going
1:24:29 to attempt a massive old uppercut
1:24:34 okay six successes five will roll over
1:24:37 into damage going uphill here with the
1:24:40 bashing but we
1:24:42 got just seven bashing damage she soaks
1:24:48 three damage so she will take four uh
1:24:51 two bashing which will wrap she is at
1:24:54 [ __ ] with lethal damage and has one
1:24:57 bashing when we go to
1:24:59 you I'm a raker
1:25:02 [Music]
1:25:03 again one success no dice will roll over
1:25:06 into
1:25:08 [Music]
1:25:10 damage 10 egg coming at her she will
1:25:13 soak six levels of aggravated damage and
1:25:15 you will ash
1:25:17 her when she starts to Ash wind will
1:25:20 take several steps backwards in case
1:25:22 something comes leaking or spurting out
1:25:24 you defitely feel that there is
1:25:26 something like wraith Le about her form
1:25:30 and as the ash crumbles a like spectral
1:25:34 Spirit does seem to remain but that also

1:27:57 kill the harer I have nine successes to
1:28:02 Parry really are you touching your
1:28:04 weapon to

1:28:15 I think it's immune to
1:28:17 that it's notm Elder Powers it takes
1:28:21 very Elder Powers yes
1:28:25 yeah
1:28:26 dude can you retake it comos to
1:28:30 dust let me make sure this is what Tim
1:28:33 wants to do Tim is doing
1:28:34 yeah can he just dodge without any
1:28:37 inanimate object that touches her is
1:28:39 destroyed he can't it's just not as he's
1:28:41 not as good at it so it's that touches
1:28:43 her yeah so if I ask her a question the
1:28:46 a one that's what happened to my bullets

1:28:51 God damn I have questions I'll wait for
1:28:54 my turn by anything short of the blood
1:28:56 of dragons or other similarly potent
1:28:58 monsters ELD their power yep I mean I
1:29:00 guess they're not very
1:29:02 good skulls are
1:29:05 scary I just didn't expect this is a
1:29:07 monster that wields the very concept of
1:29:09 entropy as a weapon I promise you it is
1:29:11 powerful enough to break an
1:29:14 object H now I
1:29:20 will what was that going to do to me
1:29:23 great question
1:29:24 it's not going to be good if I mean if
1:29:27 you are sacrificing your blade to save
1:29:29 yourself that's perfectly acceptable but
1:29:31 I want to make sure you know that you're
1:29:32 doing
1:29:34 that um I mean if this can break your
1:29:37 blade I don't know what I want to do to
1:29:39 you but you
1:29:48 know is he able to use his quick draw on
1:29:51 a different
1:29:52 sword in reaction no not a Perry
1:29:58 gotcha what's your Dodge pool you still
1:30:01 your extremely
1:30:03 less you do have your plus two um dice I
