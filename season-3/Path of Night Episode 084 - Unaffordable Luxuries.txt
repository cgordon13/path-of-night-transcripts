0:03:07 Dragon clad in this very dark gray
0:03:11 almost black suit and at his side a

0:04:37 yourselves the group is welcomed in
0:04:40 there are G servants who are present who
0:04:44 offer any changes of clothes any uh you
0:04:48 know Refreshments in terms of cigarettes
0:04:50 if anyone needs to feed they do offer
0:04:54 themselves in the form of
0:04:57 sustenance since the car parked BR had a
0:05:02 strange emotional state about her the
0:05:05 comparison of the terror of first
0:05:07 arriving here and the Whirlwind that
0:05:11 happened ever
0:05:13 since it is all brought to mind in that
0:05:17 moment and stepping forward she finds
0:05:21 herself trying to find the safe spaces
0:05:25 on the ground where she knows there
0:05:27 might not be gorgeous art follow shoes
0:05:30 of
0:05:31 ghouls and taking sock of herself how
0:05:34 she moves within the
0:05:36 space but she knows that hunger is going
0:05:42 to be an important thing to manage in
0:05:44 these
0:05:45 nights so she will accept the offer of
0:05:50 some ghouls to heal herself and take
0:05:52 some blood you were brought to the
0:05:55 smoking rooms that you can do that and
0:05:57 again for those of you who do gaze upon
0:06:02 these spaces they are filled with art
0:06:07 everything is perfectly
0:06:08 placed the silver the Gold Everything
0:06:11 shines
0:06:12 immaculately the
0:06:14 chandeliers produce perfect twinkling
0:06:17 lights cascaded across the spaces that
0:06:20 you walk for those of us who have not
0:06:23 been to Roman pen Dragon estate
0:06:26 Everything Is Beautiful Immaculate and
0:06:29 imp Place definitely a trap for toror
0:06:32 what's the impression the brewha like
0:06:34 Johnny Gets In This Place old
0:06:37 money you get the impression that this
0:06:40 dude has been wealthy and influential
0:06:45 for
0:06:47 centuries it's not like like with Miles
0:06:51 he has a very modern look to a lot of
0:06:53 his stuff he likes the bright fancy cars
0:06:57 that's not really where the money was
0:06:58 put here here here you're looking at
0:07:01 like you know 300 400y Old paintings and
0:07:05 these massive like golden frames etc etc
0:07:10 there's much more of an interest in like
0:07:12 Fine
0:07:13 Arts and the kind of classic
0:07:17 Decor that A very upscale home in
0:07:21 England would have like this is like a
0:07:24 like a Noble's estate and I think
0:07:27 there's a lot of War m robelia and
0:07:30 related art something from Carthage
0:07:33 that's a little further in but uh there
0:07:35 is a point where there are artifacts
0:07:39 from like Carthage that are kept under
0:07:42 glass able to be like viewed but not
0:07:45 touched is that the only kind of
0:07:47 artifacts that he has underglass he's
0:07:49 got like memorabilias from like Wars
0:07:51 that he probably visited and interacted
0:07:53 with but it's the items from Carthage
0:07:57 that are Far and Away the oldest and
0:08:00 clearly the most well like tended to
0:08:03 gotcha he it seems like he has a habit
0:08:05 of keeping old thing like relics under
0:08:08 glass those aren't the only relics under
0:08:12 glass right right gotcha as they're LED
0:08:15 in uh particularly as brda is given
0:08:20 blood dolls to feed on are we all all of
0:08:23 you are offered I'm I'm asking only
0:08:25 because Roman has a tendency to overlook
0:08:28 and forget that I'm even [ __ ] here so
0:08:30 I'm just making sure I also have he
0:08:32 spoke to the group of you as a whole
0:08:34 great he did not say anything directly
0:08:35 to you or gesture for anyone to go to
0:08:37 you so how you wish to interpret it is
0:08:39 up to you I'm only asking because Neil
0:08:42 because we had to run out to miles's
0:08:44 conclave uh Neil has not fed since
0:08:46 Johnny fed on him so he is still
0:08:48 starving what you do if there are I'm
0:08:51 being totally honest I'm too freaked out
0:08:53 I don't think I would feed unless
0:08:55 somebody came up so there's no way
0:08:58 realistically that Neil would like ask
0:09:00 for something for himself right now so
0:09:03 just putting it out there that he's
0:09:05 hungry but not like anxiety is
0:09:08 overriding that so I'm going to get a
0:09:10 change of clothes or whatever they have
0:09:12 here because I didn't get a chance
0:09:14 before I was sarily summoned miles I do
0:09:17 have I brought a suit from The Haven
0:09:20 fantastic and I will attempt to eat what
0:09:25 is provided we'll see how that goes
0:09:27 there are no musicians
0:09:30 yep um I tried to run back and grab this
0:09:32 stuff for court for you guys but it all
0:09:35 happened so fast
0:09:37 so I'm sure there will be really good
0:09:39 stuff here too but if you wanted some of
0:09:41 your own
0:09:42 clothes uh yeah that um yes that I my
0:09:48 stuff please would be I
0:09:51 trust you need
0:09:54 to yeah please and Neil kind of like
0:09:58 goes towards br like looking for
0:10:00 whatever she had you brought St for all
0:10:02 of us well it had felt silly but when we
0:10:05 were running trying to catch up with
0:10:06 Miles I had I wish I hadn't spent the
0:10:10 blood on it but when and I stopped by to
0:10:12 try to make the court appearance go a
0:10:14 little
0:10:15 better your
0:10:17 closets I would appreciate something to
0:10:19 get dressed in Johnny kind of looks down
0:10:21 at himself he's still covered in all of
0:10:23 the freaking
0:10:25 uh all of the damage and blood and
0:10:28 everything from early when we were
0:10:29 fighting vitel BR had picked out outfits
0:10:32 that would be good for court they're as
0:10:35 quick as she can have picked out outfits
0:10:37 in that half-hazard situation but
0:10:39 they're
0:10:40 clean um miles
0:10:44 um you think you're going to have any
0:10:46 luck here with any of the provided
0:10:49 Refreshments probably not what about
0:10:52 your sire maybe maybe he might uh know
0:10:56 where you might be able to to feed Maybe
0:10:59 I it's on my list to talk to you
0:11:02 guys I'm going to mingle and talk
0:11:06 present um yeah I think that might be
0:11:09 the best I'll um I'll look after the
0:11:13 rest of the codery she glances over
0:11:15 towards when cuz she's here right when
0:11:19 arrived with her power but she's not
0:11:22 leaving lucin's side when is wandering
0:11:26 as far as she is able when is B to go
0:11:29 wherever she wants she's mostly just
0:11:31 been leaning against like like a thing
0:11:33 in the entryway like a just a place
0:11:36 where like a calling card dish would be
0:11:38 kept or something like that and she's
0:11:39 just kind of been sitting there leaning
0:11:41 with her arms crossed okay if wi is in
0:11:43 here not even thinking about blood and
0:11:46 [ __ ] I probably would not even take the
0:11:48 clothes from BR that no Neil would also
0:11:52 just kind of yeah I'm be lining straight
0:11:54 for win but yeah no I agree and um I
0:11:58 will catch up and see what I can do
0:12:00 later I'll try and see if I can get to
0:12:02 make sure the rest of the coder is fed
0:12:03 clothed and we'll get in touch with you
0:12:07 yeah I'm going to go see what's going on
0:12:09 um I've got this I've got the cell phone
0:12:12 on me now so if you need me ahead of
0:12:15 time call gotcha he kind of puts a hand
0:12:19 out like grips miles on the shoulder
0:12:23 let's see what this battle looks like
0:12:24 all right man and Johnny will um turn to
0:12:28 go kind of gather up Neil wi and and
0:12:31 brda and kind of make sure that they are
0:12:33 being fed and clothed um actually
0:12:36 Britt's off feeding so I don't need to
0:12:38 worry about her at the moment she's
0:12:39 probably out out of sight right you're
0:12:41 not just feeding in the main area uh I
0:12:43 had been brought to a smoking room yeah
0:12:45 and I had uh chosen to accept the
0:12:49 accommodations when they when they were
0:12:51 offered so effectively someone must have
0:12:53 come up and offered and I would have
0:12:56 said yes thankfully and you would have
0:12:58 seen me head off gotcha so before she
0:13:01 heads off uh Johnny will grab some of
0:13:03 the bag or the bag that she has
0:13:05 presumably with with our clothes in it
0:13:07 yep
0:13:09 um and um we'll head over to meet up
0:13:13 with uh wi where Neil's
0:13:16 already you know making sure she's all
0:13:23 right when or Neil
0:13:26 Will Neil will very EAS
0:13:29 ascertain Without Really any effort when
0:13:32 is far from okay she will just kind of
0:13:35 lift her eyes look at him and not it
0:13:37 toward the blood dolls go eat Neil
0:13:41 ignores all pretense and almost leans on
0:13:45 the old mavian Boon of like oh weirdo's
0:13:49 going to weirdo so just ignore it walks
0:13:52 like directly walks qu silently directly
0:13:55 up to win ignores the head nod and the
0:13:58 go feed and just in the same exact way
0:14:01 that she does to everybody else in the
0:14:02 codery leans his head down puts his
0:14:04 forehead against hers and she breaks
0:14:08 down you're Kindred I gu spend a
0:14:10 willpower for this
0:14:12 but in your
0:14:15 head the thought in Neil's voice
0:14:18 intrudes and just says in that like
0:14:21 weirdly less stuttery more confident
0:14:23 mental voice that he
0:14:25 has I know she's going to change you
0:14:29 I know you're changing but no matter
0:14:32 what I know you're
0:14:34 win I won't forget and I won't let you
0:14:38 either I love you and this is going to
0:14:40 be okay and then he takes his forehead
0:14:42 away and he just wraps her in this like
0:14:44 [ __ ] stupid gangly hug and doesn't
0:14:46 let go all propriety and pretense left
0:14:49 aside probably looks awkward as [ __ ]
0:14:52 given the you know the the surroundings
0:14:54 that they're in but he doesn't say
0:14:56 anything for all outward appearances say
0:14:58 it's
0:15:03 silent please go eat while I still care
0:15:05 whether you do I know you're always
0:15:08 going to care but you have to eat
0:15:10 too and you got no orders right now
0:15:13 nothing to do so how about you come join
0:15:16 us H
0:15:18 maybe I'm going to get lost in here I
0:15:20 need somebody to Johnny's the one with
0:15:23 good directions Johnny's kind of
0:15:24 standing a little bit away from the two
0:15:26 of you just kind of watching and he kind
0:15:28 of nods at that like I do um and I was
0:15:32 just come over here to say exactly what
0:15:34 Neil said both of you need e the three
0:15:36 of us need to eat yeah and uh we do have
0:15:41 some clothes here I could use a change
0:15:43 Neil you could definitely get
0:15:45 changed when I don't know if she packed
0:15:47 anything for you I changed already all
0:15:51 right we were we were throwing down with
0:15:54 a methusa earlier tonight so I think
0:15:56 everybody could use a bite maybe right I
0:15:59 have no interest in eating right now I
0:16:02 have interest in you eating and if I
0:16:04 have to [ __ ] here comes the airplane
0:16:06 spoon feed you I will if you get in the
0:16:08 Baby
0:16:10 Bjorn
0:16:12 still sounds like about when BR might be
0:16:15 able to make her way back to the group
0:16:18 and she hasn't changed actually um not
0:16:22 yet she would have any change that she
0:16:25 could have made in time for court but
0:16:26 she's not quite prettying herself up for
0:16:28 the circumstance at the
0:16:30 moment when you okay for a hug oh [ __ ] I
0:16:34 should have asked first I'm not sure but
0:16:37 you're welcome to give one R comes in
0:16:40 gently gives WI a hug and using the
0:16:44 sleeve of her own dress gets the tears
0:16:48 out of wind's Eyes Cold Water hydrogen
0:16:52 peroxide it's okay I'm sure I can find
0:16:54 something there's plenty for me to
0:16:56 change into you guys have to to find a
0:16:58 way to kill me
0:17:01 no
0:17:03 nope don't let me go on like this nope
0:17:08 pick
0:17:08 one option three yeah either kill me or
0:17:12 get me out of this that's two I know I
0:17:15 picked
0:17:17 three sorry man what's three Neil looks
0:17:20 around at the
0:17:22 surroundings gives a big awkward gangly
0:17:26 shrug and doesn't say anything else
0:17:28 that whole talk about existing and
0:17:31 surviving I don't want to just exist I
0:17:35 know
0:17:36 and a whole conversation we had about
0:17:39 you know following each other down the
0:17:42 spiral I um I meant that too so I well
0:17:46 then keep me with you then but get me
0:17:49 out of
0:17:50 this we're going to get you out of this
0:17:53 give us the time to figure out exactly
0:17:55 we don't have it and if I say more than
0:17:59 that it's okay
0:18:02 when
0:18:05 I I'm not going to stop looking
0:18:09 up my
0:18:11 dress
0:18:13 no I when kind of like you're still you
0:18:17 yeah she kind of
0:18:18 like she looks a little confused for a
0:18:21 minute that she was allowed to be
0:18:24 dirty and seems a little more
0:18:27 comfortable you're still you no matter
0:18:30 what you're always still you and I'm not
0:18:34 going to give up on that okay no matter
0:18:37 where it takes us I need a bathroom do I
0:18:41 remember where they are you do come with
0:18:43 me do we have to travel in packs you
0:18:47 know where the bathrooms are in here she
0:18:49 got the advanced tour remember no how
0:18:51 about just at least
0:18:52 pirs yeah that's probably a smart you go
0:18:55 with brida I'll make sure Neil gets fed
0:18:57 too
0:18:58 he'd probably like the pancakes if he
0:19:00 can get them in that form and She'll
0:19:03 follow Brea I'd make you pancakes Neil
0:19:05 but somehow I think that uh pen dragon's
0:19:08 the type that doesn't keep pancake
0:19:10 materials around he doesn't seem like a
0:19:13 pancake kind of guy yeah maybe just
0:19:16 blood for now so I can keep my wits
0:19:19 about me best I
0:19:21 can you too you look you look like
0:19:24 you're not uh you look like you're
0:19:27 handling your Beast pretty well well but
0:19:28 it looks like it's shaking the bars of
0:19:30 the cage it's always
0:19:33 been quieter than most but I don't want
0:19:37 to test it right now all right we'll
0:19:40 find some spot to get cleaned up and fed
0:19:44 come on let's go okay and Neil follows
0:19:50 Johnny so the two of us will go the
0:19:53 group of you are directed to a room
0:19:55 there are four people uh waiting for for
0:19:58 you they look like
0:20:00 clubgoers and seem pretty like [ __ ]
0:20:04 jazzed up for the party and they start
0:20:06 bringing up all these like things about
0:20:09 like the Harford club scene that you
0:20:10 have no idea about but are essentially
0:20:13 prey that has been coralled here and is
0:20:17 waiting for you four young women
0:20:19 fishnets boots black skirts piles and
0:20:23 piles of mascara like just ready for
0:20:26 like the Afterparty and and thrill to be
0:20:29 there when the two of you enter the
0:20:32 room Neil you hear this there's the
0:20:35 softest
0:20:37 click of a lock behind you just in case
0:20:41 they try to
0:20:43 escape
0:20:46 Neil habitually feeds on the
0:20:50 sleeping because he is not good at and
0:20:54 is uncomfortable with this kind of
0:20:57 Confrontation but he's also
0:21:00 really inhumanly
0:21:03 hungry and he at first Pats around in
0:21:06 his pockets just to see if there's
0:21:07 anything left but the last of the khif
0:21:09 went with wi on a rooftop not that long
0:21:12 ago so he goes hey hey
0:21:15 um anybody have any
0:21:19 drugs one who's chewing
0:21:21 bubblegum emits a popping noise and she
0:21:25 goes through her purse and she pulls out
0:21:28 these like
0:21:30 tabs and you see just these brightly
0:21:33 colored little
0:21:35 things and she kind of shakes it like
0:21:39 doggy treats to a
0:21:41 pet Neil will go over sort of playing
0:21:45 that manipulative role of like the
0:21:48 slightly too overeager guy at the
0:21:52 club uh yeah let's do
0:21:56 it what do you think roll me a
0:21:59 manipulation subterfuge to get her
0:22:02 comfortable with you going near her cuz
0:22:04 um yeah
0:22:06 absolutely cuz I uh you know this is oh
0:22:10 new to me I'm a little nervous and um
0:22:13 Lex does my new manipulation spec apply
0:22:17 what is it fast talk sure
0:22:19 does I World okay I got five successes
0:22:23 manips up to it you're kind of a weird
0:22:25 guy but she's curious manipulation sub
0:22:28 Refuge a weirdly decent role for Neil
0:22:31 emotional manipulation not something
0:22:33 he's terrible at particularly when he
0:22:35 starts to play up the like oh I'm just a
0:22:37 little guy thing and as they start to do
0:22:41 drugs having no impact on Neil because
0:22:43 he's just like Taps don't do anything in
0:22:45 his mouth unless they're [ __ ] weird
0:22:47 somehow well she takes plenty herself
0:22:50 then Neil will feed and try and turn
0:22:54 this basically into a drugged out after
0:22:59 party at least this half of the room
0:23:00 Johnny what's going on in your end
0:23:02 Johnny kind of sigh at what what he's
0:23:04 been left in the room and what explain
0:23:09 the room a little bit it's uh you know
0:23:11 about the average size of like an
0:23:13 American bedroom there's like Sha's
0:23:16 lounge and lots of very pretty Furniture
0:23:20 paintings on the walls it's just this
0:23:23 private space to socialize or in all
0:23:26 likelihood do exactly this is there like
0:23:30 is is there any like music on in this
0:23:31 place or anything like that or is there
0:23:33 a place to turn music on there is a
0:23:35 place where one can turn music on it is
0:23:38 not on currently so yeah so Johnny just
0:23:40 kind of sigh he he watches Neil um doing
0:23:43 his thing kind of gives a a little bit
0:23:46 of a forced smile at the uh the girls
0:23:50 that are looking at him but is also
0:23:52 keenly aware that he has three a ripped
0:23:54 out of the side of his neck and drained
0:23:57 you know and that that has also like
0:23:59 caused you know all kinds of Gore to be
0:24:01 on his jacket and shirt and uh just kind
0:24:05 of goes fishing through the bag and
0:24:09 grabs some clean clothes girls you're
0:24:12 going to have to pardon me I uh I need
0:24:14 to get cleaned up he points to his neck
0:24:18 why don't you go turn some music on or
0:24:20 something uh enjoy hanging out with Neil
0:24:23 there you know just relax and he kind of
0:24:27 goes walking off to where the bathroom
0:24:28 is there's like a click at the door when
0:24:32 you're stepping out it's open for you
0:24:35 and one of the servants just allows hat
0:24:37 off oh so it's only one there's no
0:24:39 bathroom in here and it's just one entr
0:24:41 one entrance in yep it's like a it's
0:24:44 like a s yeah Johnny will spend a point
0:24:47 of willpower by the way his last point
0:24:49 of willpower and five blood to heal a
0:24:52 point of AEG you spend to heal how much
0:24:55 does that bring you down to so I
0:24:57 actually filled up on miles's ghouls so
0:25:01 I'm at eight blood now okay he'll get to
0:25:04 the bathroom and just kind
0:25:06 of sit there for a while look in the
0:25:10 mirror I mean these girls are young
0:25:13 right early 20s yeah not terribly
0:25:16 dissimilar from Bretta yeah or at this
0:25:19 point not terribly dissimilar from
0:25:20 Jessica that'd be
0:25:23 right Johnny will like strip off all the
0:25:25 bloody clothes and light up a morle and
0:25:29 before he's like healed up he's I
0:25:31 imagine theot process of healing the EG
0:25:33 takes a little bit it does it actually
0:25:35 largely happens during the day right but
0:25:38 like forcing it this way like is is
0:25:41 particular so he's kind of watching you
0:25:43 know some of the smoke drifting up out
0:25:46 of his
0:25:47 neck and he takes the ruined shirt that
0:25:50 he had and he rinses that down and
0:25:52 starts kind of cleaning up all the blood
0:25:53 off of himself and and trying to trying
0:25:56 to force the healing to make the the
0:25:58 wound look more presentable in a way
0:26:01 where a mortal might not look at that
0:26:03 and go oh [ __ ] you need to go to the ER
0:26:06 and more like okay yeah you got [ __ ]
0:26:09 up but you're okay now so he focuses on
0:26:13 most mostly superficial healing of the
0:26:16 wound okay and after he's kind of
0:26:18 cleaned himself up for the most part he
0:26:20 um dresses in the clothes that BR got
0:26:23 inspects his leather jacket does a once
0:26:25 over with that to make sure that's
0:26:26 presentable I guess he he just tosses
0:26:29 his uh his ruined clothes in like the
0:26:32 trash in the
0:26:33 bathroom but then thinks better of it
0:26:36 because there's blood all over that and
0:26:37 that's his blood and we're kind of in
0:26:39 the dent of
0:26:40 enemies so he'll take the bloody bag of
0:26:43 clothes in the garbage bag and just haul
0:26:45 that up out of there cuz im imag a small
0:26:49 little bathroom garbage right little bag
0:26:52 until uh exit um are there any servants
0:26:54 around or anything like that yes where
0:26:57 am I quarter
0:26:59 right this way follow you are brought to
0:27:04 a room it looks like there is one bed
0:27:07 that is arranged there so you'll be
0:27:09 rooming with one person and it is a very
0:27:14 nice open floor space with just this
0:27:18 again gorgeous gorgeous Decor this has
0:27:22 its own
0:27:23 bathroom there's a view of this like
0:27:28 Courtyard outside Johnny kind of like
0:27:31 looks over the whole area nods a little
0:27:33 bit and we'll put the uh the bag with
0:27:36 his stuff next to like like in one of
0:27:38 the closets of this room um and head
0:27:42 back out is the servant still just
0:27:43 waiting there or anything like that just
0:27:45 a little down the hall like you're
0:27:46 giving privacy but he's on standby shuts
0:27:49 the quarters and kind of like gives a
0:27:51 mental map for himself where everything
0:27:53 is and we'll head back to the room where
0:27:55 Neil is okay when Johnny gets back to
0:27:58 the room where Neil is Neil is sort of
0:28:03 sitting on like one of the couches near
0:28:05 a table and has pushed a bunch of stuff
0:28:07 to the side and has laid out a bunch of
0:28:10 little objects there is pretty clearly
0:28:12 blood around his lips uh and like all
0:28:15 his sort of lank hair is like hanging
0:28:17 low around his face yeah and he's got
0:28:20 this
0:28:21 really unusual kind of unusual for Neil
0:28:25 like I don't want to say full C leader
0:28:28 Vibe but like he's giving off predatory
0:28:31 air in a way he usually does not and
0:28:34 he's looking at somebody who uh some one
0:28:37 of the other people in the room and just
0:28:39 almost weirdly confidently compared to
0:28:42 just a few minutes ago is like yeah tell
0:28:45 me your uh tell me your birthday I I can
0:28:47 do horoscopes and tarrot readings and
0:28:49 stuff what's your what's your s i can in
0:28:53 a way you've seen him do that [ __ ]
0:28:55 before and you know he at least whether
0:28:57 or not you believed in the blood magic
0:28:58 you knew he was real about it mhm but he
0:29:01 apparently is just using that to spin a
0:29:05 like yeah no what's up horoscope kids
0:29:09 you want to know after having fed a
0:29:11 little bit of the the four the four
0:29:14 girls in the room are any of them like
0:29:15 passed out or anything like that or like
0:29:17 no uh Lex Neil was only going to take
0:29:20 two From Any Given
0:29:23 individuals um depending on who he could
0:29:25 sort of parlay access two I believe I
0:29:28 said there was four in the room there
0:29:29 was four you can take up to eight that
0:29:30 way he would have taken two cuz assuming
0:29:33 Johnny was coming back from the bathroom
0:29:35 which two from each does not put him up
0:29:37 to full three from each would not put
0:29:38 him up to full but like somewhere in
0:29:40 there he's still Neil he's not like
0:29:42 making anybody pass out you good in here
0:29:46 Neil yeah I think so just uh doing hor
0:29:51 uh horoscopes and stuff you know
0:29:53 so okay all right girls I'm going to
0:29:56 leave you here with my friend Neil take
0:29:58 good care of him please he gives them
0:30:00 kind of like a winning smile um you're
0:30:04 not sticking around no I'm I'm I'm all
0:30:08 set aren't we supposed to two by two
0:30:10 yeah I'm not going to be very far he
0:30:13 gives him a reassuring nod he's also uh
0:30:16 we got to get rid of those clothes too I
0:30:18 think they're uh they look pretty ruined
0:30:20 girls if if you want there's some uh
0:30:22 clothes in that bag for him make make
0:30:24 sure he gets dressed at some point going
0:30:25 to get dressed on my own I don't want to
0:30:27 I know that just broke him that break
0:30:29 whatever Zone Neil is in breaks
0:30:32 immediately and he just stands Up's like
0:30:35 I maybe we're good actually we're going
0:30:38 um all right then then I'll I'll just
0:30:40 leave these in your quarters um he uh
0:30:42 grabs the he grabs the bag but you you
0:30:45 you're if you're giving Zodiacs you give
0:30:47 these girls a
0:30:49 zodiac okay and he puts a hand on your
0:30:51 chest and kind of like keeps you in that
0:30:53 room and then we'll head out the door
0:30:55 I'm assuming I walk past the servant
0:30:57 again again who locks the door after I
0:30:58 walk out yep Jenny gives him a glare and
0:31:02 we'll move to like a bench somewhere in
0:31:06 view of the door of this room sit and
0:31:09 just start to chain smoke
0:31:15 morle when brida says that she knows
0:31:19 where a bathroom might be when is very
0:31:22 purposely heading in that direction with
0:31:25 her it doesn't make sense to pass her
0:31:28 but she kind of puts in urgency in br's
0:31:32 step by how close she's hanging and when
0:31:35 they get to the
0:31:36 bathroom there's no standing on ceremony
0:31:39 when just kind of grabs her by the shirt
0:31:41 and pulls her into the bathroom with her
0:31:43 and shuts the door and locks it when
0:31:46 does this and BR is a little thrown off
0:31:51 she trusts wind there's no major
0:31:53 hesitation but she definitely freezes
0:31:56 wind doesn't seem to regard her words uh
0:31:58 her first thought immediately when has
0:32:01 the presence of mind to lift both toilet
0:32:03 Lids like she's thrown up hastily in a
0:32:06 bathroom before and she crouches down
0:32:09 and just vomits blood into the toilet oh
0:32:14 wi are you okay BR kneels down next to
0:32:19 Wi immediately looking to grab the braid
0:32:23 and make sure her hair is away from her
0:32:25 face and set a hand her shoulder when
0:32:28 coughs a couple times
0:32:31 spits doesn't turn her face from the
0:32:34 toilet bowl just kind of leans an elbow
0:32:36 on it and rests her forehead on her own
0:32:39 bicep are you sick can can we get sick
0:32:43 or I
0:32:45 um I just
0:32:47 didn't it's not going to change anything
0:32:50 but I didn't want her in me anymore I
0:32:55 don't even know if this can do it it but
0:32:58 but I just needed to make that happen
0:33:01 what do you mean did did the just car
0:33:05 already yeah I'm
0:33:09 sorry I know um I don't know if you know
0:33:14 what that's like yet but I don't know if
0:33:17 you've had it happen before we you've
0:33:20 saw what what it was like for me and I'm
0:33:23 sorry that you're going through it when
0:33:25 just kind of think for a minut and is
0:33:28 quiet but that won't work right that
0:33:31 won't un blood Bond you
0:33:35 no there's no reason it should it
0:33:38 happened before I even swallowed it just
0:33:41 the taste
0:33:43 yeah and wi is quiet and just kind of
0:33:46 rests her head and after a minute kind
0:33:49 of puts her other elbow on the toilet
0:33:51 bowl and laces her fingers behind her
0:33:54 head not like she's hiding but just
0:33:58 almost trying to keep her head on
0:33:59 straight when wind moves her hands BR
0:34:02 tries to slide her hands down try to
0:34:06 trace a small circle on wind's shoulder
0:34:09 the same way that you would comfort
0:34:10 someone who is
0:34:12 nauseous remember your first
0:34:15 night how I dragged you into the
0:34:17 bathroom and told you how it
0:34:20 was yeah I remember it
0:34:25 um I know I've set up before win but
0:34:28 that's always meant a lot to
0:34:30 me
0:34:32 wi kind of gives a nod as much as she
0:34:35 can with her head held in her
0:34:38 arms and turns her face just enough so
0:34:41 that her Eagle colored
0:34:45 eyes can find
0:34:47 Britt okay repay the favor how am I
0:34:50 going to get through this BR kind of
0:34:53 settles forwards making sure to make eye
0:34:55 contact with when struggling to find the
0:34:59 words it's
0:35:02 taking there's so much I need to tell
0:35:04 you all and I want to say it to you
0:35:09 before it's just a memory of a feeling I
0:35:12 want to say it to you guys while I'm
0:35:14 feeling it and I don't know if I can get
0:35:16 it all
0:35:17 in is it something that you could say to
0:35:19 me
0:35:22 now words aren't
0:35:25 adequate is it something
0:35:28 that Neil or me could help
0:35:34 with I don't know
0:35:38 that I don't know that it would hurt
0:35:42 anything you can certainly try Neil's
0:35:44 done
0:35:46 it look I I don't know what you need to
0:35:50 say to me but I do know you and I know
0:35:53 you're asking me to tell you how you can
0:35:55 get through it and
0:35:58 and I don't know the details but I do
0:36:01 know that you're one of the strongest
0:36:02 people I know and that's not just cuz I
0:36:05 don't remember a
0:36:07 lot you've always been someone
0:36:11 with so much Integrity when and so much
0:36:16 heart and I know that that's been really
0:36:19 difficult for
0:36:21 you it's been difficult for all of us
0:36:23 but you I can't imagine a world where
0:36:27 you don't hold on to your sense of self
0:36:30 I feel like that's one of
0:36:33 the you you as a person you are so true
0:36:37 to yourself and I know that scares you
0:36:40 cuz sometimes you feel like you can't be
0:36:43 or like you're scared for
0:36:45 us
0:36:49 but you can make it when and we'll be
0:36:52 there with you the whole time we'll help
0:36:54 you the whole codery
0:36:58 when seems like she wants to say
0:37:02 something about
0:37:04 that and decides not
0:37:08 to and just kind of TAPS her forehead
0:37:11 telling brida to just take the plunge br
0:37:15 will spend a willpower to use telepathy
0:37:21 to try to pull a thought out of one can
0:37:23 I just relent to her telepathy into my
0:37:25 brain okay
0:37:27 then when just lets that happen what is
0:37:29 the thought that I am able to pluck from
0:37:32 your
0:37:33 surface wind has seemed to cram so
0:37:37 much and Lex you tell me how much of
0:37:40 this gets through it's not a thought so
0:37:43 much as a cocktail of
0:37:46 emotions Chief among them is pride in
0:37:50 Bria and how in how much she has grown
0:37:53 and how much she has endured and how
0:37:55 much she has become such an incredible
0:37:59 person there
0:38:01 is compassion for all she has
0:38:05 endured hope that maybe the camaria will
0:38:08 be okay because brda is here incredulity
0:38:13 at her intellect and her quiet strength
0:38:19 and sense of
0:38:21 self and just
0:38:23 cheer love for a sister a child
0:38:27 child a dearest
0:38:30 friend
0:38:32 gratitude for the opportunity to have
0:38:34 been a part of this incredible person's
0:38:36 life br's hand goes still on wind's back
0:38:40 and those big eyes on Brea widen and a
0:38:44 trace of tears that she's trying to hold
0:38:47 back she tries to take wi by the
0:38:50 shoulder it's such a gentle touch but
0:38:53 it's almost in the way that you would
0:38:54 Shake
0:38:55 someone when why does it feel like
0:38:58 you're saying
0:39:02 goodbye because I don't know what
0:39:04 tomorrow is going to bring and I don't
0:39:07 want to never see you again with
0:39:09 anything left
0:39:11 unsaid That's the basis of every tragedy
0:39:14 that's ever been written is all the
0:39:15 things you didn't get to say I don't
0:39:18 think that's true
0:39:21 because look I'm grateful that you think
0:39:23 that of me I I really am it means more
0:39:28 than I can say BR I want you to
0:39:31 understand I am not saying this with the
0:39:34 intent of saying
0:39:36 goodbye I plan to be here as long as I
0:39:38 can be but that's the thing you're
0:39:41 talking like you're going to disappear
0:39:43 and I don't think that's true I don't
0:39:45 think that there's anything that you
0:39:47 wouldn't be able to say that would
0:39:49 change things that would change how much
0:39:51 you're a part of our family that would
0:39:53 change how much I love you it's just it
0:39:56 won't change you it might change me and
0:39:58 I don't know how this addiction to
0:40:01 another person works I don't know that
0:40:04 you will ever be as important to me
0:40:06 again as you are right now while I am
0:40:08 still
0:40:09 me and I want you to know that without
0:40:12 the filter of this artificial connection
0:40:16 and need for another person look I've
0:40:19 been through that and I felt what it was
0:40:23 like to have the next night's step two
0:40:26 and I'm sorry I don't know a way to get
0:40:28 you out
0:40:29 of the second step of blood bonding but
0:40:33 I know what it feels like and if it's
0:40:36 any comfort it never made me change how
0:40:39 I felt about you when I thought about
0:40:41 the codery even though there was that
0:40:44 part of my mind that was poisoned
0:40:47 too I mean sometimes it's so confusing
0:40:50 sometimes it still feels like like I
0:40:52 lost someone I loved or I don't I've
0:40:55 heard that it all breaks differently for
0:40:57 different people but the point
0:40:59 is maybe the bond could change something
0:41:02 but we all know who you are and we all
0:41:05 know who you are to us you're someone
0:41:08 who is brave and unrelenting and you
0:41:13 keep hold of yourself you're so
0:41:16 intelligent and frankly look I get that
0:41:21 it's all a political play in the end but
0:41:25 the camera Ria would be pretty stupid to
0:41:27 pick anyone else to be
0:41:29 archon so then that's how I get through
0:41:33 it
0:41:35 is you
0:41:37 guys I think you could get through it on
0:41:40 your own if you had to I think you could
0:41:42 get through anything but I know that
0:41:44 we'll be there for
0:41:46 you I hope I'm still there for
0:41:49 you and she just kind of turns and Bear
0:41:52 Hugs BR she's not careful she might
0:41:55 tackle her uh
0:41:57 when and Brea does hug back it's a deep
0:42:01 hug she definitely takes the opportunity
0:42:05 to like Nestle in and give wi as much
0:42:10 comfort as she can because they're not
0:42:11 going to have a lot more
0:42:13 time when just holds on like she never
0:42:16 wants to let
0:42:18 go at a certain point br will wriggle
0:42:21 out just a little bit when will let her
0:42:25 go I need you to
0:42:27 take this BR CHS wi the end of her
0:42:32 sleeve if you could just rip it at the
0:42:35 elbow I I don't want anyone else to have
0:42:39 your blood when nods and kind of uses
0:42:43 her claw to work a hole in and rips
0:42:45 along the grain like she's done this a
0:42:47 million times when you're ready I'm
0:42:50 going to check where um I'm staying but
0:42:54 I have a guess
0:42:57 yeah
0:42:59 um did you feed
0:43:03 no you
0:43:05 just I know how you feel that you had to
0:43:07 get that blood out of your system yeah I
0:43:10 didn't want to feed before I got it out
0:43:12 okay are you ready to yeah
0:43:16 good no good to you guys on an empty
0:43:18 tank am I I'm honestly um kind of empty
0:43:23 still with all the healing that I to too
0:43:26 it's yeah it's going to be
0:43:30 rough well then let's go get a
0:43:33 snack how hungry are you I say snack but
0:43:36 I think I mean
0:43:38 Buffet like all you can eat I've I've
0:43:42 already got some blood I don't
0:43:45 know I can come with you but I want you
0:43:48 to feed too you might need it more
0:43:52 okay and when stands up flushes the
0:43:55 toilet
0:43:58 knowing that she just sent the justic
0:43:59 car's blood into the sewer not
0:44:01 particularly
0:44:02 caring and kind of takes a minute at the
0:44:05 mirror to clean herself up but um is
0:44:09 there to
0:44:11 help even if it's just something as
0:44:13 simple as like straightening what W's
0:44:15 wearing and little details am I going to
0:44:18 need a personal stylist for this do you
0:44:20 want a
0:44:22 job uh honestly I think that I know I
0:44:26 brought some of the clothes that we had
0:44:28 to court but if we can take what we're
0:44:32 given it's a sign of Goodwill too so
0:44:35 what we have is back up
0:44:37 and you were made our c for who you are
0:44:41 and you are going to have to have times
0:44:44 where maybe that agreement we made maybe
0:44:48 you're
0:44:49 good maybe that agreement we made where
0:44:52 I get to dress you up sometime will come
0:44:54 into play but for
0:44:58 now you are who you
0:45:00 are I don't think they're expecting
0:45:03 anything
0:45:04 else I think there's a lot about me
0:45:06 they're not expecting I think that's
0:45:09 true how could they ever
0:45:13 know and when will unlock the door
0:45:16 and kind of take BR by the hand and go
0:45:24 out when walks out of the bathroom with
0:45:28 BR
0:45:29 and she just kind of like looks around
0:45:32 for a minute just pick a direction and
0:45:35 maybe there will be food there um she'll
0:45:37 look to
0:45:38 BR is there like a space where he keeps
0:45:42 people to feed on if you ask one of his
0:45:44 people um I thought I saw Neil walk a
0:45:48 different direction than I walked all
0:45:50 right um let's let's try that way then
0:45:54 and she's kind of letting brida show her
0:45:57 around but making it look like she's
0:46:00 still in control but she's definitely
0:46:02 letting brda lead the directions BR is
0:46:06 looking for one of the servants in the
0:46:08 house to ask where wind should feed BR
0:46:10 arrives to one door and finds very
0:46:14 quickly this is
0:46:16 probably not the room to enter because
0:46:19 there are the
0:46:20 sounds of a heated discussion taking
0:46:24 place and and the heated discussion
0:46:29 seems to be a sort
0:46:32 of do use hi senses to get uh more
0:46:35 details or not yes I'd like to use uh
0:46:38 I'd like to heighten my senses if I'm
0:46:41 kind of catching on that there's
0:46:42 something going on so hideen senses
0:46:45 helps you hear one of the two voices
0:46:47 that are going back and forth and it
0:46:50 becomes clear that there's some sort of
0:46:55 meeting board meeting some sort of
0:46:57 discussion happening where one of these
0:47:01 parties is speaking over a phone and the
0:47:04 other voice you recognized to be the
0:47:06 voice of Miles as sire and whatever
0:47:11 they're saying is
0:47:14 emotional and when you tune back in when
0:47:18 you hear you start to make out a handful
0:47:20 of words the name New York comes up repe
0:47:26 repeatedly a
0:47:28 thing is being referred to
0:47:32 as the zantosa
0:47:35 case and whatever has been said has Yan
0:47:39 Peter zun frustrated and angry to the
0:47:44 point where you can hear that he is at
0:47:47 the edge of a
0:47:50 frenzy and then the line disconnects and
0:47:53 you hear almost The Stomping footsteps
0:47:56 of someone heading towards the door BR
0:47:59 has surreptitiously slipped her arm
0:48:01 inside of wz to look to another door
0:48:06 when kind of just waits to see what br's
0:48:08 plan is um she sometimes does see and
0:48:12 hear things and when is always kind of
0:48:15 on guard for okay is she actively
0:48:17 listening or has she gotten entranced by
0:48:19 the wallpaper br's plan is to make it
0:48:22 look like they were on their way
0:48:24 somewhere else
0:48:26 she as soon as she can hear that first
0:48:28 angry footstep of movement she is
0:48:31 looking to take win at like we're
0:48:34 definitely on task we're looking for
0:48:37 food we are not listening in Wind kind
0:48:40 of gives a wink like yes definitely not
0:48:42 doing the thing we were just doing and
0:48:44 Moves In step with her the door opens
0:48:47 Yan Peterson can be seen exiting and
0:48:49 adjusting his cuings he looks deeply
0:48:52 frustrated he runs his fingers through
0:48:54 that blonde hair of his
0:48:56 and storms off in the other direction
0:48:58 seemingly not suspecting a thing BR
0:49:01 continues listening to footsteps as
0:49:03 she's taking wi away and just counting
0:49:05 the distance measuring as well as she
0:49:08 can how well someone else with the same
0:49:12 ability might be able to hear what she's
0:49:14 saying if he were to have it and
0:49:17 eventually she just looks to win and
0:49:19 gives a sort of Nod that says that's
0:49:21 something to be talked about later when
0:49:24 kind of gives a yeah I figured kind of
0:49:27 Nod so
0:49:29 food Let's Get You full or
0:49:33 something I something would be better
0:49:35 than nothing at this point yeah and the
0:49:38 plan continues to look for someone to
0:49:40 direct when at the next door you hear a
0:49:44 slight mouth falling the sounds of
0:49:46 feeding and when you open the door you
0:49:49 find a Neil and a small throng of blood
0:49:54 dolls who are were gathered for the
0:49:57 purposes of being fed on walking in that
0:50:00 room br's eyes go a little hungrier but
0:50:03 she steps back getting wi through the
0:50:06 door first wi kind of seems a little
0:50:09 surprised that Neil is here as far as
0:50:11 she knows this is not hiso when it comes
0:50:14 to feeding and he kind of looks like
0:50:17 he's been sucking on Tootsie Pops for a
0:50:19 while just the cherry flavored one so
0:50:21 his lips are all red and Kool-Aid
0:50:24 mustach and and other than that she kind
0:50:28 of looks for the first Blood doll that
0:50:29 looks like it hasn't been fed on isn't
0:50:32 like drooping isn't like clearly
0:50:34 exhausted and she just kind of whether
0:50:38 she's taken a lesson from her time in
0:50:41 the park doesn't lead with any
0:50:45 conversation she just kind of points at
0:50:48 the blood doll and gives a questioning
0:50:50 thumbs up she gives a thumbs up when
0:50:54 proceeds and feeds on
0:50:56 her she goes slightly limp makes all of
0:51:01 the sounds and languid body motions you
0:51:04 would expect from someone who is
0:51:06 experiencing the kiss how much do you
0:51:09 take she will take three from that one
0:51:11 after the sort of sudden entrance of his
0:51:15 Cod mates Neil looks up yeah mouth
0:51:19 covered in blood and looks saded but
0:51:23 still that kind of like frantic like his
0:51:26 brain's running too hot look in his eyes
0:51:29 sees wind go after that one woman very
0:51:33 clearly on his face does some like quick
0:51:34 Mental Math nods to himself and then
0:51:38 while when is feeding looks at BR and
0:51:41 just points at a couple giving the clear
0:51:45 indication of like those ones are
0:51:47 probably safe I haven't touched those
0:51:48 ones yet party still going uh I was um I
0:51:53 was actually uh thinking about
0:51:55 heading
0:51:57 to well I don't know not bed yet but I
0:52:00 um I'm I'm not um it can be yeah I was
0:52:04 finishing up myself then brto will
0:52:08 approach the couple slide a glance over
0:52:10 to wind to check in how she's doing I
0:52:13 could use another would it be all right
0:52:16 if I give this one a kiss fine by me
0:52:20 make sure it's okay with her how about
0:52:23 you kiss me she gives you an awkward
0:52:26 thumbs up having seen that past
0:52:29 interaction BR takes her thumb and
0:52:33 kisses the pad of the finger and brings
0:52:35 her closer she a base wind kind of rolls
0:52:38 her eyes like stop being so hot but but
0:52:41 she does not say that out loud if she
0:52:45 looks untouched I would take three okay
0:52:48 you take three after she's finished and
0:52:50 she licks the wound she's not trying to
0:52:54 be sexy but she's paying attention to
0:52:56 how gross she's being rather than just
0:52:58 like slopping a kiss a lick on it to
0:53:01 close the wound she'll be like okay
0:53:03 maybe let's check how much slobber we're
0:53:05 we're getting on here when is vaguely
0:53:07 behaving and isn't sure of what that
0:53:09 looks like exactly once she's closed the
0:53:12 wound and kind of gently made sure that
0:53:14 the doll is in a comfortable position uh
0:53:18 she'll look to
0:53:19 Neil um I'd actually like to have a talk
0:53:22 I need to get a little more in me and
0:53:24 then maybe we take a walk before you go
0:53:26 to
0:53:26 bed
0:53:28 uh yeah sure
0:53:31 one did here or did you want to go did
0:53:35 you what's the a walk typically means
0:53:38 not here I'm not here for this right you
0:53:41 don't have to be do you want me to be I
0:53:46 want you guys with me all the time but
0:53:48 this is probably better just a kneel and
0:53:50 me conversation then I'll figure out
0:53:53 about staying here okay
0:53:55 and when will give her awkward eye
0:53:58 contact pointing at the doll thumbs up
0:54:00 uh and she will she will move to take
0:54:04 three from another untouched Blood Doll
0:54:07 the door clicks open a woman enters BR
0:54:12 recognizes her as Roman pen dragon's
0:54:15 primary ghoul
0:54:16 Maria
0:54:19 BR his grace requires your
0:54:23 presence what are you doing let's go
0:54:26 when we'll look at BR like remember our
0:54:28 talk Neil when all that happens stands
0:54:33 like rapidly with a very similar posture
0:54:36 looking at Maria kind of like a kid on a
0:54:39 playground where a strange kid shows up
0:54:42 to try and take your things he starts to
0:54:46 say something looks around the room
0:54:48 stops himself like kind of remembering
0:54:50 where he is for a second and just gives
0:54:52 Bretta a very piercing like
0:54:56 do you want us to do something about
0:54:57 this look totally unself-aware BR has
0:55:01 been doing a lash check on the blood
0:55:03 doll that the kiss sealed upright and
0:55:07 she looks to win giving her a little
0:55:09 smile and a nod there's a moment of
0:55:12 processing but her interest is more
0:55:15 towards Neil than Maria and watching the
0:55:18 change of Neil Bera crosses over gives
0:55:22 him a smile and says I got win a hug so
0:55:27 you all right with that what I don't
0:55:29 understand the question can I hug you oh
0:55:33 yeah sure I'm okay Neil
0:55:37 oh okay BR goes over squeezes Neil into
0:55:42 a hug uh let us know when that's not
0:55:45 true I would she goes over to Maria
0:55:50 after Maria turns and quickly marches
0:55:54 out expecting BR to follow Brea follows
0:55:59 again eyes still mostly on the floor
0:56:02 watching the way that the presuming like
0:56:05 a short heel clicks more aware as always
0:56:09 now today of getting caught in a trance
0:56:13 but pulling herself
0:56:15 together when but leaves it is just the
0:56:18 two of you in the blood dolls you might
0:56:20 want to wipe your face but do you want
0:56:22 to go see if we can find somewhere to
0:56:24 sit outside so we can see his Stars I
0:56:27 would like that very much yeah let's go
0:56:29 do that and he like runs a hand over his
0:56:32 mouth and follows wi wi kind of takes
0:56:35 him by the hand which is a little weird
0:56:37 for them but she does take him by the
0:56:39 hand and she's just kind of wandering
0:56:41 through the Halls looking for like a
0:56:43 balcony and if there's no balcony is
0:56:45 there a backed patio or something like
0:56:47 that where they can go look at the night
0:56:49 sky there's a whole Courtyard she goes
0:56:51 for that probably finds a spot where
0:56:54 they can sit on on the bricks but put
0:56:55 their feet in the grass and sits down
0:56:59 with him when they sit down Neil much
0:57:03 like he's done before when he feels the
0:57:05 need to like ground himself uh takes his
0:57:07 shoes off puts his bare feet in the
0:57:09 grass when is doing something
0:57:12 similar
0:57:15 so I'll be very honest with you Neil I
0:57:18 don't know how blood bonds work very
0:57:20 well beyond what they
0:57:23 symbolize so I don't know how
0:57:27 much I will be
0:57:29 authentic in my feelings for all of you
0:57:32 so I'm trying to get as much in as I
0:57:34 can
0:57:37 you'll you'll still care for us probably
0:57:40 but you won't be the as important as you
0:57:42 are now you we won't be as important as
0:57:44 she is right but like I told you when
0:57:48 when we first got
0:57:51 here I don't care how far you go
0:57:55 I'm going to remember for
0:57:58 you
0:58:00 okay
0:58:02 always I won't let you go alone Neil I'm
0:58:05 sorry for
0:58:07 what what what did you you don't have to
0:58:09 apologize to me I blood bound you to me
0:58:12 I know so did Miles it was an accident
0:58:15 it wasn't an accident it was a
0:58:17 choice it and I knew what it meant and I
0:58:21 knew it wasn't right to do it without
0:58:23 your permission and I did it anyway
0:58:25 and you shouldn't be mad at me and I
0:58:27 hope you are
0:58:30 someday I hope it doesn't supersede our
0:58:32 friendship but I do hope that you feel
0:58:34 like you can give me a ration of [ __ ]
0:58:36 for it
0:58:37 someday if you want at least my
0:58:41 experience to know what just a little
0:58:43 bit of a bond is like I can't really be
0:58:46 mad at you when I know so when someday
0:58:50 when I have to be far away from you guys
0:58:52 and there's a chance for it to
0:58:53 break I want you to know that it's okay
0:58:56 if you're
0:58:57 mad but I also want you to know
0:59:01 that I wanted it to be
0:59:03 me wanted what to be you I wanted to be
0:59:08 the one you were bloodbound to
0:59:11 because Neil you might be the most
0:59:13 important person in my
0:59:16 life and I wanted if you were going to
0:59:19 be bound to
0:59:21 someone I wanted you to be bound to
0:59:23 someone who
0:59:26 was wanting to keep you safe and
0:59:28 respected you exactly for who you
0:59:32 are kidnapping is
0:59:35 aside never been kidnapped before don't
0:59:38 [ __ ]
0:59:39 me I've been
0:59:42 missing yeah and one with my permission
0:59:44 which I still regret
0:59:48 but I um Neil

0:59:55 for
0:59:56 me everyone knows me for who I am you
0:59:59 know me for me and you have kept me me
1:00:04 you have kept me
1:00:08 here and I'm sorry if I can never mean
1:00:12 if you can never mean as much to me as
1:00:15 you do right
1:00:17 now when as um as as far as
1:00:22 as look things are the way they are now
1:00:26 and there's not really anything we can
1:00:27 do about it I've been thinking about it
1:00:29 all night I'm going to continue to think
1:00:30 about it I'm going to obsess about it I
1:00:32 know me I'm at least that self aware I'm
1:00:34 familiar with your work as well and I
1:00:37 need you to do me a favor I'm
1:00:39 not I'm not going to stop thinking about
1:00:43 it trying to think of a way out I don't
1:00:46 see
1:00:47 one but that doesn't mean it's not there
1:00:50 but I need you to know
1:00:52 okay I I said it before but I need I
1:00:54 need you to know inside and the way
1:00:56 you're talking right now I know you
1:00:57 don't know it inside yet so I need you
1:00:59 to hear
1:01:01 me you're not going into the dark alone
1:01:04 okay I'm never in the dark alone when
1:01:06 you're around man I will remember you no
1:01:09 matter what and no matter what
1:01:12 happens the justicar could tell you to
1:01:15 kill me for being a a a na and and and I
1:01:21 would know
1:01:23 okay so no matter what you
1:01:26 do no matter what you're made to
1:01:29 do I won't hold it against you okay she
1:01:33 looks gut punched at that like it's it's
1:01:36 too much it's too real it's too
1:01:40 close and she just kind of covers her
1:01:42 hand I know who you are Neil roll me a
1:01:46 perception plus
1:01:47 empathy
1:01:51 okay uh what difficulty seven I do not I
1:01:54 have height and senses up for this so
1:01:55 the difficulty is still seven does my
1:01:57 spec in intuitive count yes that is six
1:02:01 successes raw when she has been speaking
1:02:05 to you this through this this is
1:02:07 probably the most hurt you have ever
1:02:09 seen
1:02:10 her and that's including her being like
1:02:13 I I'm done with
1:02:15 existence this is the most helpless you
1:02:18 have seen her feel
1:02:21 somehow some way When you mention her
1:02:26 killing a member of the
1:02:29 quartery she sinks somehow
1:02:33 deeper when covers her eyes with her
1:02:37 hands elbows propped on her
1:02:40 knees toes making Fists in the
1:02:43 grass desperate to be back where she
1:02:48 was hey
1:02:50 wi
1:02:53 yeah
1:02:55 what's your
1:02:57 birthday August 20th 1940 mhm mhm
1:03:03 and you know this we've talked I know I
1:03:06 just want you to hear it out loud I want
1:03:08 you to say it out loud when we're you
1:03:11 embraced
1:03:13 1969 Woodstock right Woodstock New York
1:03:17 second day of the
1:03:19 festival yeah
1:03:21 yeah Lex I'm going to look up the stars
1:03:23 and do something haven't done in a long
1:03:25 time okay I am going to use the things I
1:03:29 know about wi and this clear night sky
1:03:32 and I am going to read to the best of my
1:03:35 ability what lies in wind's future give
1:03:38 me a roll and I will spend a willpower
1:03:41 on
1:03:43 this five successes gazing into the
1:03:47 heavens you
1:03:49 see a
1:03:51 hand lifting a stone
1:03:56 and taking the stone to the skull of one
1:03:59 they love most until you are familiar
1:04:02 with as an
1:04:04 artist you
1:04:07 suspect that
1:04:09 when by the almighty powers that rule
1:04:12 over her is going to be made to make a
1:04:16 sacrifice and she is going to
1:04:19 sacrifice one of the people she loves
1:04:23 most
1:04:24 to win all that it looks like although
1:04:27 she may have seen this him do this a few
1:04:29 times in the past he's just standing
1:04:31 there back on his [ __ ] looking up at
1:04:32 the stars and he kind of puts a hand on
1:04:34 his shoulder as he does this the hand on
1:04:38 his shoulder seems to take him back out
1:04:39 of it real quick and he just sits back
1:04:42 down on the bench next door her feet
1:04:44 still in the grass taking a minute not
1:04:47 as overwhelmed with information maybe as
1:04:51 he's been in the past but he looks at wi

1:08:51 similar to how I protect you from Office

1:08:56 his chemistry is less than my
1:09:00 aspcs uh I can just be like [ __ ] you pal
1:09:03 um if we have equal levels it's a
1:09:05 rolloff if he has more chemistry than me

1:09:10 slat
1:09:11 fight I don't give a [ __ ] it's fist cuff
1:09:15 Johnny gave me a point in Brawl I could
1:09:16 fight
1:09:17 him I dude if you hit him with c and he
1:09:21 starts trying to sling ho realities
1:09:22 while under the effects of
1:09:24 everyone [ __ ] loses but in the best
1:09:28 way TI is an escalation though I'm not
1:09:32 against
1:09:33 it we got into like an actual fight with
1:09:35 Kabir you're actually probably the
1:09:37 strongest PC to fight Kabir yeah because
1:09:39 I can get past to reality yep you can be
1:09:41 or reality yep I got Spirit tracking and
1:09:44 I can't do that or you can do it
1:09:45 weather's way yep or you just go first
1:09:48 and his ass that's why Johnny's number
1:09:52 two uh turns out if he never gets to go
