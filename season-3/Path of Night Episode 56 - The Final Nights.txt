0:00:26 same so listener discretion is advised
0:00:30 now let's walk the path of night
0:00:33 [Music]
0:00:40 last time on path of night Rhys called
0:00:43 the cautery and informed them of
0:00:45 britta's location in the tremair Chantry
0:00:47 the Corey argued about what to do both
0:00:49 about their missing torreidor and the
0:00:51 Werewolf in Johnny's truck
0:00:53 meanwhile Ritter fought to survive Vito
0:00:55 and an infected parent the group arrived
0:00:58 at Yale and met up with Romeo at the
0:01:01 same time Brita met up with shrike the
0:01:03 two discovered captive thin Bloods and
0:01:05 seers and Bretta had a strange encounter
0:01:07 with What Might Have Been Neil she freed
0:01:10 a mysterious mortal named Eden and
0:01:11 continued fleeing the others face down
0:01:14 against familiar flesh monsters and
0:01:16 sustained major injuries still they went
0:01:19 deeper into the Chantry
0:01:20 [Music]
0:01:27 Johnny when
0:01:30 miles and Ira
0:01:32 the group of your head down dark tunnels
0:01:36 and many of the paths seem to descend
0:01:38 deeper and deeper into this Hidden
0:01:41 Fortress that the charmir have made
0:01:43 as you go there are small Halls that
0:01:46 lead off into or seem to be office
0:01:50 spaces ritual rooms um irau recognize
0:01:53 that a few of them actually still have
0:01:56 some of the Spell components that are
0:01:58 made readily available for acolytes and
0:02:01 apprentices but much of this space has
0:02:03 been specifically cleared out it's like
0:02:07 something started going wrong some a
0:02:10 little while ago not like maybe you know
0:02:12 a couple weeks a few nights and the
0:02:15 tremeer started to clear out got much of
0:02:18 the way much of it done but now this
0:02:21 place is lost so they knew something was
0:02:25 coming more than just like a night or
0:02:27 two ago they they had at least a few
0:02:30 days a week maybe to plan to like get
0:02:31 the [ __ ] out and then something like
0:02:34 ramped up real hard perhaps not
0:02:36 something coming from without yeah but
0:02:39 from within like it became clear to them
0:02:43 that contained wasn't going to last
0:02:45 and the the option to transport was not
0:02:49 viable and sending in resources when the
0:02:52 city is already threatened by the Sabbat
0:02:55 risks just wasting all of those
0:02:57 resources the thing that really kind of
0:03:00 sticks with you about this though is
0:03:02 that above is a place of Higher Learning
0:03:06 where many many young people will come
0:03:11 and go and when the holiday seasons come
0:03:14 they'll travel off to various parts of
0:03:17 the country and Beyond and if these
0:03:19 people end up infected it could easily
0:03:23 become a global disaster
0:03:27 but at least for now the tumer at least
0:03:30 have a thing of things to a point where
0:03:33 if that front entrance to this Chantry
0:03:36 can be restored they have a contained
0:03:39 within the Chantry as a whole how long
0:03:41 all of this is going to last very
0:03:44 unclear and as you move on when keeps
0:03:49 falling behind so much of her flesh has
0:03:54 been worn to the point of almost
0:03:56 inoperable that she can't quite keep up
0:03:58 with the group she is
0:04:01 the side of the left side of her head is
0:04:04 kind of a lost cause at this point it's
0:04:06 just very bloody there's like half of
0:04:08 her white braid is stained red so she's
0:04:12 definitely focused elsewhere but always
0:04:15 forward occasionally she has not dropped
0:04:18 her protein eyes and so she
0:04:21 but she is visibly blinking longer than
0:04:25 she usually does like there is a
0:04:27 struggle
0:04:28 with the side of one of her hands
0:04:30 because she still has her claws up she
0:04:33 can't spare the blood to let them drop
0:04:34 she is actively like grabbing onto her
0:04:37 pants to help her move her wounded leg
0:04:40 like the need to move is still present
0:04:43 but the ability to has been greatly
0:04:46 diminished
0:04:47 she has said nothing she has not
0:04:50 complained her goal is very clear that
0:04:53 she is going to reach Rita miles takes
0:04:56 in a look around the group
0:04:58 all right we need to change this up
0:05:01 Ira Johnny more towards the front Iris
0:05:04 so you can keep the lights going
0:05:06 you guys take the lead we'll watch
0:05:08 behind and he grabs the functioning side
0:05:12 essentially the one whatever your arms
0:05:14 are fine right my arms are fine all
0:05:16 right just claw and then like props up
0:05:19 and like let's keep moving is there some
0:05:20 sort of place we can stop Ira win
0:05:23 weirdly doesn't protest the help and
0:05:28 that might be a little more distressing
0:05:31 than if she had fought it we're gonna
0:05:33 need a few minutes to recover I was uh
0:05:36 thinking the same and he sort of looks
0:05:40 back over his shoulder the electricity
0:05:41 is starting to die down a little bit as
0:05:44 they've been moving little Sparks of it
0:05:46 fly off and hit the wall and then just
0:05:48 kind of every time the light is
0:05:50 diminished a little bit more
0:05:51 there
0:05:53 should be a place uh
0:05:56 where we can rest this is a lot and I
0:05:59 know we know we're pressed for time but
0:06:01 I'm a goddamn liability right now if I
0:06:04 can get just even a little back I can I
0:06:06 can say in the game I can
0:06:09 I can use my gun this time
0:06:11 assuming it's not too infected my gun no
0:06:16 the store rooms wind kind of blinks like
0:06:20 maybe she's just a little low and maybe
0:06:23 she's just a little hurt that like she
0:06:25 couldn't follow even such a simple
0:06:27 conversation and she just kind of nods
0:06:29 there should be hopefully untainted
0:06:33 blood supplies
0:06:35 some place where it can stop even for a
0:06:37 couple minutes that are some sort of
0:06:39 Supply or Armory might be helpful in
0:06:42 seeing what they seeing what we might
0:06:44 have available to us
0:06:46 we should have expected these
0:06:48 spiders again but I had not expected it
0:06:51 to be this bad why would we expect them
0:06:53 to be anywhere but hell house
0:06:55 all right well this is all a good plan
0:06:58 but we're gonna need to get there first
0:06:59 IRA
0:07:01 you point us in the right direction I'll
0:07:03 lead the way
0:07:04 iron nods uh not completely familiar
0:07:07 with the layout of the Chantry but you
0:07:09 know mostly knows tramir yeah he knows
0:07:12 what to look for yeah those are like
0:07:14 tremir markings and stuff like that that
0:07:16 says signposts something like that uh as
0:07:19 the group of you go uh clearly in the
0:07:21 angles of this hallway you come to uh
0:07:24 another
0:07:25 office space entrance that says you know
0:07:28 do not enter
0:07:29 reflexively the group of you kind of
0:07:32 murmur to yourselves kind of like
0:07:34 irritated that you guys can't go that
0:07:36 way and start just moving right on
0:07:39 Ira this does not have an effect on you
0:07:43 and you as an employee
0:07:47 realize that this is a direction that
0:07:49 you the group of you can go in and you
0:07:52 notice that there is this little
0:07:55 blinking light that's on the electronic
0:07:58 lock for the very very reinforced door
0:08:03 and door frame and the fungus flesh the
0:08:07 spongy matter
0:08:09 and that has been uh growing throughout
0:08:13 this space doesn't quite reach the wards
0:08:17 uh that protect this entrance and you
0:08:19 kind of get the impression that this
0:08:21 might like this might be the sort of
0:08:24 place that you're actually looking for
0:08:25 Ira stops outside the door uh hold up
0:08:30 everybody this way we can't go that way
0:08:33 I've got a whole pass and nerd miles
0:08:37 realizes upon having the audacity to say
0:08:40 that he can't do something that's
0:08:42 something is amiss and realizes that the
0:08:45 sign shouldn't be taken to heart as much
0:08:47 as it has been and that there's some
0:08:49 sort of magic afoot I read not so do I
0:08:52 have the like access codes to get in
0:08:54 here or well you can short the lock I I
0:08:57 don't necessarily know if I want to like
0:08:58 it's up to you
0:09:01 uh so I'm gonna try to pick it you I
0:09:04 mean you have you have options so I was
0:09:06 looking at the Lock I want to get in
0:09:09 here and I could fry the lock but then
0:09:11 the doors open Wards would hold but I'd
0:09:15 rather have a closed door
0:09:17 uh I don't suppose anybody picked up a
0:09:20 key card or passcode well the only body
0:09:23 we've seen so far has been Ash so no not
0:09:26 on that part
0:09:28 um there is potentially another way to
0:09:31 do this could you give me a couple of
0:09:33 minutes have you tried the door
0:09:37 I was quiet for a few moments and then
0:09:40 reaches out to just try the door the
0:09:42 door opens [ __ ] God
0:09:45 damn it
0:09:49 when ah this seems to lift win
0:09:53 Iris stare as the door handle like opens
0:09:56 it is unlocked Ira stares at it for a
0:09:58 second and just goes
0:10:01 good the passcodes still work actually
0:10:04 very clearly a lie Johnny smirks at him
0:10:07 and Pats him on the shoulder as he kind
0:10:09 of goes by that's why in the center
0:10:10 shawl
0:10:11 is IRA still made of electricity that's
0:10:14 probably gone out by this point he um
0:10:16 Johnny will actually take this
0:10:18 opportunity though to just sweep inside
0:10:20 and make sure that there's nothing
0:10:26 when Johnny sweeps inside this space is
0:10:30 actually like two floors but is only
0:10:34 accessible from this floor and there are
0:10:37 very tall bookshelves they've been
0:10:39 cleared out their boxes everywhere
0:10:42 there's a table outside of them like a
0:10:44 row of tables that are meant to kind of
0:10:46 like set down review books pulled from
0:10:49 the library and on it in one instance
0:10:53 there is a collection of weapons and
0:10:56 bulletproof vests that were essentially
0:10:59 scrounged by the acolytes back when this
0:11:02 place was being more defended in its
0:11:04 emergency there's a lot in the way of
0:11:07 Stacks and stacks of like manila folders
0:11:10 with information within and racing
0:11:13 through this information pausing only
0:11:15 when he realizes that he is not alone
0:11:18 isReiss
0:11:20 and Rhys looks up towards you both
0:11:25 annoyed that you have Disturbed him in
0:11:28 the midst of his research and relieved
0:11:31 that he's not alone in a place like this
0:11:33 Johnny looks down at the grumbling
0:11:35 chainsaw in his hands looks up atReiss
0:11:38 kind of licks his fang for a second
0:11:41 funny what it is you in a place like
0:11:43 this prinagen
0:11:46 he says eyes locked with yours glad
0:11:48 you're still alive likewise Johnny turns
0:11:52 off the chainsaw heads over to the desk
0:11:54 where he is and Pops it down it's clear
0:11:56 guys
0:11:57 looks like we foundReiss Ira continues
0:12:00 to hold the door open and ushers for the
0:12:03 prince to help the sheriff into the safe
0:12:06 room miles does so gives a eyebrow raise
0:12:10 atReiss I see we've finally met up no
0:12:13 Grace hopefully this door locks he looks
0:12:16 at the door
0:12:17 ah
0:12:20 the acolytes are all dead uh he says
0:12:23 indicating he doesn't actually know how
0:12:24 to operate that [ __ ] thing
0:12:26 oh no similarity
0:12:30 oh no Common Ground
0:12:33 after miles and win are in and having
0:12:36 this exchange Ira closes the door behind
0:12:39 them do I know how to yeah this thing
0:12:40 you flip a couple switches yeah
0:12:42 he locks the door and like a powered
0:12:46 magnet there's like a little you know
0:12:48 electric Hallman buzz and then just
0:12:50 clanks into place it does lock your
0:12:53 grace
0:12:54 great this is big where are we this is
0:12:57 one of the libraries utilized by my clan
0:13:02 or at least it was
0:13:04 your friend
0:13:05 or whatever remains of her is within the
0:13:09 confines of the century but not this
0:13:11 room you need to venture elsewhere if
0:13:13 you intend to find her great this place
0:13:16 is awesome well we're going to take a
0:13:18 breather here for a second so I hope we
0:13:20 don't interrupt your research too much
0:13:21 there I am
0:13:24 if I am left to my work I don't see
0:13:26 where there would be an issue miles
0:13:28 brings wind to like a chair I assume
0:13:30 there's some sort of chair or something
0:13:32 like that sitting there's lots of chairs
0:13:35 there's actually like a very nice very
0:13:39 nice lounge space for like apprentices
0:13:42 to kind of kick it while doing their
0:13:44 research once miles walks her over to
0:13:47 the chair she kind of like shakes her
0:13:48 head like if I sit I don't know if I'm
0:13:50 getting back up we'll find some supplies
0:13:52 but take a seat for now can you
0:13:55 I need I need a favor what's up it won't
0:13:59 be weird for me
0:14:00 but my phone is in my back pocket
0:14:03 could you get it out and see if it can
0:14:05 send some messages miles reaches for
0:14:08 whatever pocket she's indicating it's
0:14:11 just a check and uh your cell phone
0:14:12 expertise tells you that there's no way
0:14:14 that you're gonna get a reception done
0:14:16 here uh yeah there's um there's not
0:14:19 gonna be any reception down here damn it
0:14:21 do you want to compose the texts and
0:14:25 I could get it to wherever

0:14:42 just I'm wearing serrated Steel on my
0:14:45 fingertips that extend about a foot
0:14:47 miles it's not real easy to text with
0:14:49 that I know I've seen some some uh
0:14:52 professional ladies do it but um
0:14:55 it's very uh it's very intricate it's a
0:14:58 skill set look [ __ ] get paid I'm a
0:15:00 [ __ ] I can't afford those Nails most of
0:15:02 the time
0:15:03 all right what text do you want me to
0:15:06 type up
0:15:09 Johnny visibly blinked
0:15:12 just
0:15:15 the first one um
0:15:16 there's there's a listing for cab guy
0:15:19 all right
0:15:21 just

0:15:34 Testaments here kind of okay well it
0:15:39 it's not a good buy it's a just in case
0:15:41 got it peace of mind yeah no reason
0:15:44 these will ever need to be sent send
0:15:46 them anyway
0:15:47 um
0:15:48 the other one to um Coffee Guy do you
0:15:52 not put real people's names on your
0:15:54 phone that doesn't seem like a great
0:15:55 plan if I'm ever caught or captured I
0:15:58 mean they'll still be able to figure out
0:16:00 the numbers there
0:16:01 yeah but you can pay people to get that
0:16:04 um look I don't know how it all works
0:16:06 but I'm making it as hard as I can make
0:16:08 it okay fair enough coffee guide is
0:16:12 just say
0:16:13 um
0:16:14 I tried to find you
0:16:17 I'll keep trying
0:16:19 I don't know if you'll see me though all
0:16:21 right his miles actually doing as she's
0:16:25 requesting or is he just saying he will
0:16:27 no I'm doing it okay
0:16:30 thank you
0:16:32 all right you don't have to put it back
0:16:33 in my pocket if you don't want to you
0:16:35 can just hold on to it it might be safer
0:16:37 with me for now just generally I feel
0:16:40 like that's
0:16:41 everything except me is probably safer
0:16:43 with you
0:16:44 because if I'm with you I'm getting in
0:16:46 the way I don't think that's true at all
0:16:47 you just got you intercepted many of
0:16:50 those bugs there and we did not know the
0:16:52 extent of their I should have guessed
0:16:54 though I need to get better about not
0:16:55 just letting things hit me I need to if
0:16:58 we get out of this if I get out of this
0:16:59 I need to maybe some solarities in order
0:17:03 we'll see we can do take a minute we'll
0:17:05 see what we can have I'm sureReiss has
0:17:07 some things around here we can use
0:17:08 Johnny's kind of poking through some of
0:17:11 the gear that's been laid out the vests
0:17:13 and the weapons
0:17:15 looks like you got more than just books
0:17:16 down here
0:17:17 any chance you might actually have some
0:17:20 fresh blood is that what it is that
0:17:22 you've come looking for
0:17:25 yes
0:17:27 come this way
0:17:29 he gets up again looking looking like
0:17:32 he'd rather just be doing whatever it is
0:17:35 that he's been doing down here Ira
0:17:37 interjects real fast as he's walking for
0:17:39 us if you like region yes Apprentice uh
0:17:44 the back area of the library you're
0:17:45 going to find containers I
0:17:48 all the principal Focus beads
0:17:51 the incantation for them is
0:17:53 unfortunately lost however they're still
0:17:55 a set of canopic jars
0:17:58 you use the canopic Jaws for your
0:18:00 for our friends
0:18:03 and
0:18:05 put a ticket use
0:18:07 nods and gives a true mirror appropriate
0:18:10 little bow to the region
0:18:13 of course region I'm very happy to help
0:18:17 Splendid Apprentice Ira hasn't known
0:18:19 Johnny for very long but I think he will
0:18:22 have recognized the fact that when
0:18:24 people are short with Johnny he tends to
0:18:27 be short back with them you notice that
0:18:30 Johnny kind of his jaw locks up around
0:18:33 Rhys and he gives him a little bit more
0:18:36 deference than Johnny would normally
0:18:38 give to any other vampire
0:18:41 yeah an interesting Quirk of his
0:18:44 personality for the time being yeah
0:18:46 iron nods and leads Johnny uh back
0:18:51 towards like the back Supply area this
0:18:54 should be plenty of blood back here
0:18:57 he pulls the uh he pulls his own pack of
0:19:00 Morales back out
0:19:01 and in the absence of
0:19:04 a lot of the books I don't see a problem
0:19:06 with this either
0:19:08 giant kind of nods pulls out his own
0:19:11 cigarette and Ira leads him back to
0:19:14 where Lex presumably there's just plenty
0:19:16 of blood
0:19:17 when you get back there uh you find that
0:19:21 there are indeed a great deal of
0:19:22 principal Focus beads
0:19:24 but more importantly more useful to the
0:19:28 actual group of you are what looks to be
0:19:31 these kind of clay cylinder containers
0:19:34 like these jars uh with wax seals on
0:19:37 them uh you recognize the Miss
0:19:39 sanguinous files they are organized and
0:19:43 there is somewhere in the area of 200 of
0:19:46 them
0:19:47 neatly stacked and organized the region
0:19:50 gave us permission to open the jars for
0:19:54 what we need so feel free to
0:19:57 fill yourself up
0:19:59 Johnny kind of looks like is shocked
0:20:03 that this giant store of blood
0:20:06 um he blanks a little bit we'll crack
0:20:08 One open
0:20:10 and uh drink the contents
0:20:13 the blood feel the blood tastes
0:20:16 fresh the container itself is kind of
0:20:18 like a little older especially in the
0:20:21 past like
0:20:22 and determine the amount of time as the
0:20:24 little dust over it but when you open
0:20:26 the seal it is though that blood had
0:20:29 just been spilled from its vessel how
0:20:31 much blood do I get from drinking one of
0:20:33 these one per how big are these
0:20:35 containers like a 20 ounce bottle of
0:20:37 soda okay he looks around for like a box
0:20:40 there are boxes
0:20:42 um he's gonna start uh putting uh
0:20:45 bottles into this into a box so that he
0:20:48 can bring them over to the lounge area
0:20:49 where wind and miles are relaxing Can I
0:20:53 stack let's say three dozen of these in
0:20:57 a in a box done okay Johnny comes
0:21:00 walking over with a box filled with
0:21:03 little blood vessels and sets them down
0:21:06 next to the two of you guys win has kind
0:21:09 of refused to fully sit she has her her
0:21:13 damaged leg kind of like the knee is
0:21:15 resting on the seat of the chair so it's
0:21:18 the weight is off of it and she's just
0:21:19 kind of standing on one leg and holding
0:21:22 on to the back of the chair
0:21:23 when you can uh you can drop those claws
0:21:26 I can promise you you're not getting at
0:21:28 any more fights in the condition you're
0:21:30 in I need you to to worry about getting
0:21:32 yourself all all tanked up with this
0:21:35 blood is there enough that I can heal
0:21:37 some of that I promise you there is that
0:21:40 sounds very certain
0:21:42 okay Ira comes out of the back pushing a
0:21:46 little like well it's like plastic carts
0:21:48 from uh like that you would have at
0:21:50 school or at the library this is made of
0:21:53 wood probably yeah
0:21:54 um with some stacked on it and looks
0:21:57 very at home pushing a book card around
0:21:58 and looks over the group of you as
0:22:00 Johnny sets the box down and goes uh
0:22:02 gestures towards reasons thanks to the
0:22:06 generosity of the region we should not
0:22:09 have any
0:22:11 problems with blood for the moment so
0:22:15 feel free to partake salute if you guys
0:22:18 don't mind deal just let me try these
0:22:20 out first before you yeah yeah
0:22:22 particularity and taste and all that you
0:22:25 have a refined palette I get it Lex we
0:22:27 get the premiere get very exacting about
0:22:30 this is there like a list of traits or
0:22:32 whatever of who this blood came from or
0:22:34 a labeling system there's a labeling
0:22:36 system a blood Dewey Decimal System yeah
0:22:39 but I imagine it's like it's not going
0:22:40 to be pertinental like musicians yeah I
0:22:43 don't know if that does considering who
0:22:46 the region was so Miles why don't you
0:22:49 give me an intelligence Rule and see if
0:22:50 any of those names are musicians you
0:22:52 recognize from the area because a
0:22:54 straight intelligence role yeah are they
0:22:56 in Latin
0:22:58 boom what's that uh what am I looking
0:23:01 for difficulty ate oh come on this is
0:23:04 what'd you get seven seven nine if it's
0:23:06 with six of it would have been three
0:23:08 successes well with one success you
0:23:09 recognize a name and there are four
0:23:12 traits of blood belonging to that person
0:23:14 oh hello
0:23:16 I'd recognize the names but it's written
0:23:17 in Papyrus he's a member of uh one of
0:23:21 the local bands
0:23:23 the uh the down river blood Spillers and
0:23:27 they used to play The Underground metal
0:23:31 scene I wonder where these guys have
0:23:33 gone to giving the group a little bit of
0:23:35 space uh Ira will sort of stand back and
0:23:37 sit at another one like little lounge
0:23:39 chairs but it's such an angle where he
0:23:41 could watch them and race kind of at the
0:23:43 same time opens his coat before he
0:23:45 drinks any of the blood and takes out
0:23:46 like a little what's like a Pomade jar
0:23:48 kind of looking thing takes this
0:23:50 grotesque looking paste out of it and
0:23:52 starts pushing the part of his face that
0:23:56 was like pulled down into jowls kind of
0:23:58 back up into pay place with the paste
0:24:00 and just rubbing it onto his skin which
0:24:03 looks like it's kind of becoming
0:24:04 malleable as he's doing it the hell is
0:24:07 that
0:24:08 it's um
0:24:10 mixture of my blood and some dirt from
0:24:13 the city I was born in
0:24:16 takes a bit you know I do it so much but
0:24:18 it will hopefully take care of this
0:24:20 whatever the [ __ ] they did you got more
0:24:22 of that it has to be your blood and your
0:24:24 Homeland it kind of looks over a wind
0:24:26 kind of sags a little bit I'll be fine
0:24:30 Johnny I'll get there sorry also are you
0:24:32 [ __ ] smoking in a library there's no
0:24:34 books I would not do it if there were
0:24:36 books I would I know you would
0:24:40 recalling the last time in a abandoned
0:24:42 Chantry of forbid knowledge he's like
0:24:45 Smoke's gotta go
0:24:47 I think that was a condemned Library
0:24:49Reiss visibly winces and frowns I don't
0:24:53 entertain our guests I am
0:24:56 required elsewhere
0:24:58 course region he heads for uh one of the
0:25:02 lounge seats that's kind of it'll fit
0:25:03 its own little corner and he sits down
0:25:06 sits back into a seat closes his eyes
0:25:10 and goes perfectly still
0:25:16 yes I was gonna say does this look like
0:25:18 when nail would step out of his body it
0:25:20 does as soon as the region is like very
0:25:22 clearly out of it Ira stands up from his
0:25:25 seat takes like a little handkerchief
0:25:26 out of his coat and starts wiping the
0:25:28 paste back off his face and his face is
0:25:30 fixed and then goes over and starts
0:25:33 without touching anything because I
0:25:35 don't want any of the papers to not to
0:25:37 be out of place starts looking very
0:25:40 deliberately and calculatingly at the
0:25:42 things that Rhys was reading when is
0:25:44 obviously interested but she is focusing
0:25:48 on just slamming these blood vials and
0:25:52 she like
0:25:53 we're just going shopping with blood
0:25:55 vials
0:25:56 smoking cigarettes and slamming blood
0:25:59 vials just party on Wayne until dawn
0:26:02 talking game mechanics yep you know
0:26:04 we're not in a parking lot it's fine
0:26:07 when will will sink 16 of these blood
0:26:12 vials done which will allow her to fill
0:26:15 up and heal one of the damage you will
0:26:20 need to spend a point of willpower as
0:26:21 well yep to enforce the healing reading
0:26:24 extremely quickly what I can see here
0:26:26 what's Rhys doing so what's looking at
0:26:30 uh I will spend to read it double speed
0:26:33 here as you start going through firstly
0:26:35 it's in Latin I do have I do excellent
0:26:37 uh
0:26:41 shut up and drink your special blood
0:26:43 reviewing events that happened over 90
0:26:46 years ago involving a Premiere by the
0:26:49 name of Zechariah slain and what you
0:26:52 come to find out just by going through
0:26:55 what information he has on Zechariah
0:26:56 slain is that Zechariah is a potent
0:26:59 Premier that resided and may continue to
0:27:03 reside in the area he was originally
0:27:05 from Boston and when the city fell to
0:27:09 some conflict involving which is a woman
0:27:13 named Madeline Coventry and the Sabbat
0:27:16 he was forced out of the city and ended
0:27:20 up under the care of JohnReiss who was
0:27:24 running things out this way and in
0:27:26 Hartford and this guy Mr slain had been
0:27:32 wanting to get back into Boston to
0:27:34 continue some sort of research that he
0:27:37 had been involved in what you find out
0:27:39 out as you kind of go through is that
0:27:42 Zechariah slain had
0:27:44 dealings and interactions with a group
0:27:46 known as the zantosa and the zantosa
0:27:49 used zechariah's help smuggling victims
0:27:53 like lie like people uh that were being
0:27:57 used to feed something that was growing
0:28:00 for the purposes of an experiment being
0:28:02 conducted in New Haven the address lines
0:28:06 up with that of
0:28:08 Hell House
0:28:10 and you kind of find out that Vito
0:28:14 zantosa was working with the premier
0:28:17 named Zechariah slain to get the
0:28:19 location set up and it was meant to be a
0:28:21 kind of sight for use for the purposes
0:28:25 of studying the ancient vampire Vito the
0:28:28 zantosa and something that is referred
0:28:31 to as the eldest and it's it's got like
0:28:34 a lot of notes involving uh conflicts in
0:28:38 Transylvania
0:28:39 events referred to as the war of princes
0:28:42 and just various major conflicts that
0:28:47 happened among the within the Kindred
0:28:49 World
0:28:49 bleeding all the way back to like the
0:28:52 14th century what he is specifically
0:28:55 looking for are The Apprentice reports
0:28:59 from Zechariah slain when he was under
0:29:02Reiss because during that time it would
0:29:04 appear they had developed a pair of
0:29:06 rituals one that allowed for the
0:29:08 summoning of a spirit and then another
0:29:09 one that Allah out for a binding slash
0:29:11 psychic connection to a spirit it was
0:29:15 regarded as extraordinarily dangerous
0:29:17 stuff the kind of thing that draws the
0:29:19 attention of raging lupines but
0:29:21 Zachariah did it and you find out that
0:29:24 it was actually zachariah's
0:29:26 experimentation at a Chantry in Salem
0:29:30 that led to disaster with a coven of
0:29:34 witches and a demon that ended up going
0:29:39 loose because of the interference of
0:29:42 some sort of hidden Society of Mages now
0:29:46 when you look through there's actually
0:29:47 kind of a name you recognize because of
0:29:49 some past work in this case the name
0:29:52 that comes to mind is the order of the
0:29:53 worm and
0:29:56Reiss seems to be in the midst of
0:29:59 considering legit breaking some rules
0:30:04 because
0:30:05 he blames all of this chaos that's going
0:30:08 on on zechariah's slain and it was risk
0:30:12 was tribunaled for zachariah's actions
0:30:15 and it's actually the information on his
0:30:17 tribunal that's largely redacted he was
0:30:19 seen as a hero and yeah a good guy so
0:30:23 like he's going through in some
0:30:26 instances like centuries of information
0:30:30 and you're kind of starting to think
0:30:33 that this Premier that was reported as
0:30:36 dead
0:30:37 might not be andReiss might be
0:30:41 considering going after him to take him
0:30:45 out like personally I don't touch any of
0:30:48 these because I don't want the region to
0:30:49 know that I'm touching them or looking
0:30:50 at them yeah you can tell each other's
0:30:52 much there's there's a lot more there's
0:30:54 stuff under there but just looking at
0:30:56 what you can see
0:30:58 Ira pulls a little camera out of a
0:31:02 pocket and the three of you very clearly
0:31:04 see him take a couple of photos of the
0:31:07 thingsReiss was looking at and then
0:31:09 surreptitiously put it back in his
0:31:10 pocket and as soon as he does that goes
0:31:12 back to the chair that he was sitting at
0:31:14 next to the cart covered in like blood
0:31:16 vials and then just sits down not really
0:31:19 paying attention and starts like casting
0:31:21 and healing and trying to like heal some
0:31:24 of the damage that Johnny did with the
0:31:25 chainsaw so Lexile it's been a will and
0:31:27 five blood to do that sounds good
0:31:30 um and like casting magic and doing
0:31:32 basically like combat prep is is what is
0:31:35 very clear so not too long afterReiss
0:31:38 sits down and astral projects
0:31:43 I'm sure on the frenzy check part of
0:31:45 this because that very much reminds me
0:31:47 that I owe him for something for Marcus
0:31:51 and the actual projection and all that
0:31:53 well you have diablarized in the past so
0:31:56 I'm going to ask for a self-control
0:31:58 check difficulty eight to not try to
0:32:00 devour him
0:32:02 what was that difficulty eight
0:32:06 that is no successes
0:32:10 okay what's going on in the room
0:32:14 right now the room was actually pretty
0:32:18 quiet but not a comfortable quiet
0:32:23 seconds minutes who knows past has each
0:32:26 of you one at a time noticed that miles
0:32:29 is staring atReiss with eyes that
0:32:34 narrow more and more and just as the
0:32:39 tension
0:32:41 consumed the room it was broken by a
0:32:45 pitter patter at the door
0:32:51 as the two are running Brita uses an
0:32:54 ability she uses her ability to double
0:32:56 talk to everyone except for Eden that
0:32:59 awful mass of growing flesh and rot it
0:33:04 sounds as if she's begging peroon to
0:33:06 break out of it and it's sincere because
0:33:09 she really is asking someone to break
0:33:12 free and save themselves what she's
0:33:14 really communicating to Eden is
0:33:17 if they catch me if they kill me just
0:33:21 make it out safe okay don't touch
0:33:22 anything that looks orange artifacted
0:33:25 just go your pauses a moment tired weak
0:33:29 and exhausted and nods quickly too
0:33:33 choked up to really say words and
0:33:36 responds or say anything that would come
0:33:39 across as coherent but you can feel the
0:33:42 what little bit of strength she has left
0:33:43 in her she grips your hand just a little
0:33:46 tighter the mass of Flesh The Entity
0:33:50 that pursues you groans with Amusement
0:33:55 lips teeth all Mound mouths start to
0:34:00 manifest In the Flesh
0:34:03 they all say beckoning you back towards
0:34:06 the meat if anything could strengthen
0:34:08 British speed that would be on the list
0:34:10 being inspired to run just a little
0:34:13 faster the two of you head towards a set
0:34:16 of hallways and that's like almost like
0:34:20 a fork in your path one of them has one
0:34:24 of the major vaults passageway is likely
0:34:27 to like another uh like quadrant of this
0:34:30 this underground Fortress the other says
0:34:34 employees only and you find yourself
0:34:36 working on the huge vault door and it is
0:34:42 sealed it's tight it doesn't look like
0:34:43 it's been Disturbed in a little while
0:34:45 and this mound of Flesh draws more near
0:34:48 the girl who is accompanying you Eden
0:34:52 she seems to be drawn the other way and
0:34:55 with her little fists she starts
0:34:58 pounding on this reinforced door that
0:35:02 you're not allowed in Britta confuse
0:35:04 gets up but goes over to investigate she
0:35:07 doesn't really have the time to both
0:35:10 check on her and try to break the store
0:35:12 open so she doesn't want to let this
0:35:14 girl get in checking the door it says
0:35:17 employees only so you can't do anything
0:35:19 here Aiden we have to escape
0:35:22 I
0:35:24 we can't go that through the full door
0:35:27 we're at a dead end
0:35:29 which kind of pauses at this point
0:35:30 having hurt her hands banging on the
0:35:33 door the mass of Flesh kind of slows
0:35:37 down as if intent unsavoring the moment
0:35:40 the mouth is give way to hands that are
0:35:44 outstretched reaching for you and ready
0:35:47 to embrace you and pull you into the
0:35:50 others the reinforced door opens up and
0:35:52 the second the door opens you hear the
0:35:55 grumbling of a chainsaw and standing in
0:35:57 the door frame is Johnny Saxon smoking a
0:36:01 cigarette and ready ready to use a
0:36:03 chainsaw the girl screams in Terror of
0:36:07 this muscular
0:36:11 broad shouldered killing machine
0:36:13 wielding a chainsaw Brita still is
0:36:17 enraced in her majesty and using that
0:36:21 she'll say to Eden please go in I know I
0:36:24 know what does Johnny see beyond them
0:36:26 what Johnny sees one is what looks like
0:36:31 a
0:36:32 very young malnourished teenage girl
0:36:35 with very dark hair very light skin and
0:36:40 obviously this look of panic as she
0:36:43 beholds him in All His glory
0:36:46 um and with her
0:36:48 is Brita who is dressed in way more
0:36:55 leather than the last time you saw her
0:36:58 and for so whatever reason looks like
0:37:02 she came here to be a femme fatale
0:37:04 killer and then something else catches
0:37:06 your attention
0:37:07 got this thick layer of mucus
0:37:10 that covers it insulating it from the
0:37:14 risk of any like fire or weapons and it
0:37:18 is this amalgamation of the people that
0:37:24 were here and it shutters and pulses and
0:37:28 twitches and manifests rows of teeth and
0:37:33 fingers bristling and kind of feeling
0:37:36 along the walls and it seems to
0:37:40 recognize you rapidly constructing eyes
0:37:45 to behold you with and it looks at you
0:37:48 like a child looks to their sire
0:37:52 um Johnny uh tosses the chainsaw to the
0:37:57 ground uh which the second he takes his
0:37:59 hand off the safety and just kind of
0:38:01 like it sputters to to just turn like
0:38:04 you know it stalls out and sputters it
0:38:06 to off grabs the two of them and pulls
0:38:09 them inside and slams the door behind
0:38:12 Ira lock it lock it lock it I'm assuming
0:38:15 Ira actually helped Johnny open it yeah
0:38:18 and then Johnny's went out first because
0:38:19 I'm the one that's actually already Ira
0:38:22 looks just eyes wide and then slams
0:38:25 helps Johnny's like slam the door and
0:38:27 immediately like hits the uh hits the
0:38:29 levers to like electronically lock the
0:38:31 door again
0:38:33 something bangs against the door from
0:38:35 the other side and puts a like visible
0:38:39 dent in the reinforced door Johnny
0:38:47 Britta looks for more locks on the door
0:38:49 regardless of the door being locked she
0:38:53 is unable to because Johnny grabs her up
0:38:55 in a bear hug and starts squeezing her
0:38:58 Brita once she can mentally process so
0:39:02 that that's Johnny
0:39:03 melts into it and hugs really hard back
0:39:06 it takes a couple seconds of total panic
0:39:09 but once she's there she she's not
0:39:12 letting go glad to see you're all right
0:39:14 kid
0:39:16 you're okay too
0:39:18 I'm sorry I didn't want you guys to have
0:39:20 to come here right well next time you
0:39:23 decide to go crash in the Chantry just
0:39:25 give us a heads up first Ira frowns but
0:39:27 it's not dumb enough to say anything it
0:39:29 just kind of steps back and lets them
0:39:30 have this like oh he has no idea
0:39:32 father-daughter moment whatever this is
0:39:34 when Ira steps back that draws bretta's
0:39:38 attention to the fact that there's an
0:39:39 unknown factor in the room you have some
0:39:42 kind of identification you have a pin
0:39:45 there's a pin on his tie right now uh
0:39:48 now it just ties back in place that is
0:39:50 very clearly the symbol of Clans from
0:39:51 here her eyes do skim over to the
0:39:54 movement and with a quick once over she
0:39:58 starts and stops the sentence when she
0:40:01 sees the pen I didn't want to come here
0:40:03 I oh don't don't worry about it this is
0:40:07 uh I don't worry I'll give you to a
0:40:10 moment all right goes back into like the
0:40:12 library proper Johnny points a thumb
0:40:14 over at the recliningReiss in the uh
0:40:17 chair the uh Regent apparently gave the
0:40:22 prince and his cotery permission to be
0:40:24 here so everything's on the up and up
0:40:26 produce eyebrows Furrow for a moment as
0:40:31 you say prince and codery She lays her
0:40:34 head against your chest kind of looking
0:40:35 sideways at who else is present when a
0:40:39 combination of having her hearing
0:40:41 damaged by the flesh crafting beasties
0:40:44 didn't particularly notice that there
0:40:47 was a banging at the door she was
0:40:49 focused on Miles looking atReiss like
0:40:53 like chaps would look at raw meat there
0:40:56 is more happening behind the glasses
0:40:58 than the calm composure surface is
0:41:02 letting on miles is essentially stock
0:41:05 still like unnaturally still in one of
0:41:08 his hands is uh gripped his um was is
0:41:12 just gripping the hill in a just White
0:41:15 Knuckle way as he looks at the not
0:41:18 moving also on naturally stillReiss
0:41:21 and just
0:41:22 that kind of flaring energy that was
0:41:25 around him the last time when you when
0:41:28 Marcus was dead is is very similar here
0:41:31 when calmly steps between miles's eye
0:41:35 line towardReiss blood spattered it
0:41:38 seems most of the healing that she was
0:41:40 able to do on herself was directed
0:41:42 towards her hip so she's able to walk
0:41:45 without dragging her leg and she kind of
0:41:48 approaches miles and she drops her head
0:41:51 without dropping her gaze I'm right with
0:41:54 you
0:41:55 he doesn't deserve
0:41:57 Mercy
0:41:59 but we don't have time right now
0:42:02 and British here and she doesn't need to
0:42:05 see us do this
0:42:07 I would rather be with her if this is
0:42:09 going to be our last stand
0:42:11 teeth almost cracking
0:42:13 before he says anything
0:42:16 for now
0:42:17 oh no I'm definitely gonna draw a dick
0:42:19 on his forehead later but we there will
0:42:22 be time Justice will have its day
0:42:25 we don't need to do it all now
0:42:27 stepping over from uh like away from
0:42:31 Britta and Johnny giving them their
0:42:32 space Ira clocks the weird energy over
0:42:35 byReiss looks like he considers
0:42:37 something for a second like uh like he's
0:42:39 having some sort of internal debate and
0:42:41 then pushes his glasses up has to
0:42:44 readjust them and looks over between the
0:42:46 two uh between win and miles and Gus if
0:42:50 you're looking for justice for the
0:42:53 region
0:42:54 I can guarantee you it's coming
0:42:56 there is
0:42:58 something a lot bigger going on here
0:43:02 than even just this Chantry or
0:43:05 whatever beef you have
0:43:08 with the region all it's going to take
0:43:11 is a few more pieces
0:43:13 and there will be Justice for whatever
0:43:16 is going on here
0:43:18 and if you help me if you're patient
0:43:21 because these things can take time
0:43:24 they'll be Justice
0:43:26 but instead of making an enemy Clan
0:43:29 Premier wood thank you for it
0:43:32 strange words Johnny you feel britta's
0:43:35 fingers curl into your leather jacket
0:43:37 Tighter and she puts her face into you
0:43:40 instead of looking to the side that the
0:43:43 encroachment of politics into this
0:43:44 already complicated and terrifying scene
0:43:47 Johnny kind of Pats you on the back and
0:43:49 looks up everyone else all right guys
0:43:51 how about enough talk of the Jihad for
0:43:52 right now we gotta worry about getting
0:43:54 the hell out of this [ __ ] horror show
0:43:56 win kind of takes a minute to make sure
0:43:59 that the minute she's gone miles isn't
0:44:01 going to charge she's looking to see if
0:44:03 his shoulders have relaxed if there's
0:44:05 some movement Eden seems to have sought
0:44:09 out kind of a corner between bookshelves
0:44:11 and well everyone's talking and figuring
0:44:13 things out she wraps her arms around her
0:44:16 knees and well kind of sitting there
0:44:18 rests her head and softly cries when
0:44:23 she's crying there's actual tears coming
0:44:25 up right there are tears not blood so
0:44:28 you're seeing that Johnny kind of looks
0:44:30 down at Brita Brita the hell's the kid
0:44:33 you found before she can answer win
0:44:35 finally can't wait any longer to make
0:44:38 sure that everyone is frenzy proof and
0:44:40 she comes over and it's not weakness but
0:44:43 she just feels too relieved to be strong
0:44:46 about it just grabs Brita and holds on
0:44:48 to her Butta allows herself to be
0:44:49 transferred into the next hug and
0:44:51 squeeze his wind back just as hard as
0:44:54 she squeezed Johnny except more careful
0:44:57 when I'm fine let me have it you can
0:45:00 feel the hesitation then you say that
0:45:01 and you feel it resume back to a usual
0:45:05 grip rather than Brita kind of angling
0:45:07 her arm so where there might be damage
0:45:10 to your closer to your armor wind
0:45:12 finally lets the claws go and just like
0:45:15 Strokes britta's hair and just holds her
0:45:19 I went hey Brenda
0:45:21 it's hard to explain but there's a
0:45:25 couple things I mean
0:45:27 her name is Eden and whose name is Eden
0:45:30 she she's over there when we'll kind of
0:45:33 look over and the instinct is clear to
0:45:37 go to her but she knows what she looks
0:45:39 like and I don't know if I saw the way
0:45:43 that he veto that he was pulling people
0:45:47 through into him and I don't think I can
0:45:51 leave here without making sure he's done
0:45:56 recess me to reconsider that but I why
0:46:00 he must have given you more to go on
0:46:02 than just please do this for you to
0:46:04 actually consider it he said that veto
0:46:07 was important to research that could
0:46:09 save people that with everything coming
0:46:13 that
0:46:14 was that veto outside
0:46:16 I there's
0:46:19 things people I think
0:46:22 everything in here that's organic that
0:46:24 looks like that the orange and the Slime
0:46:27 and when people stop moving right and
0:46:30 her eyes land on Race for a second the
0:46:34 way that he's not moving he's
0:46:37 doing like what Neil used to do well he
0:46:40 went and sat down first rather than just
0:46:42 dropping in the middle of the street I
0:46:44 will use some heightened Vision to
0:46:47 double check that you can roll to or
0:46:49 perceive
0:46:52 that is six successes
0:46:55 not usually how that goes for our
0:46:56 perception for Greta
0:46:58 six successes you can see that he has no
0:47:00 current emotional state his mind is in
0:47:03 this case literally elsewhere
0:47:06 Brita looks intensely over at aReiss
0:47:09 but seems to nod in confirmation that
0:47:12 he's doing as Neil did and she continues
0:47:15 to explain when will gradually let her
0:47:18 go when Brita is ready to let go unless
0:47:21 miles is moving for the hug she's just
0:47:23 staying okay Johnny slowly and
0:47:27 delicately moves towards Eden and takes
0:47:31 his leather jacket off he kind of frowns
0:47:33 a little bit noticing that over the
0:47:35 course of tonight there are slices from
0:47:38 werewolf claws a whole spattering of
0:47:40 acid and maybe some uh some slashes from
0:47:45 the uh the New Jersey goons from even
0:47:47 earlier tonight
0:47:49 a couple little Scorch marks from away
0:47:52 this this jacket is almost at wit's end
0:47:56 which it's been through a lot with
0:47:59 Johnny and he does not like the fact
0:48:00 that it might have to be retired soon he
0:48:03 kind of looks down at Eden who's
0:48:04 shivering and kind of like very very
0:48:06 gently offers her the jacket hey uh
0:48:11 mind looking after this for me for a
0:48:13 while and he kind of gently places it
0:48:15 around on her shoulders so that she's
0:48:17 got a little bit of protection literally
0:48:19 and metaphorically she looks up at him
0:48:22 afraid perhaps not not of him at least
0:48:25 not anymore but clearly understanding
0:48:28 just how grave the situation is with the
0:48:31 little hand she reaches up and accepts
0:48:33 the offer how old does this girl seem
0:48:35 she's got to be in her mid-teens she's
0:48:38 not not very old not an adult no not an
0:48:41 adult and almost like if she's
0:48:44 attempting to like distract herself her
0:48:47 fingers kind of brush over the texture
0:48:51 of the torn parts of leather and she
0:48:55 uses it like uh like a little blanket
0:48:57 almost like putting it over her knees
0:48:59 and with a very soft voice she says
0:49:04 but thank you
0:49:07 thank you you need anything else you let
0:49:09 me know all right relax this library was
0:49:12 designed for acolytes and apprentices
0:49:13 and stuff right that is correct human
0:49:15 beings would be in here sometimes yes
0:49:16 because they're like a fridge or
0:49:18 something that would have food in it uh
0:49:20 when you take a look around there is a
0:49:22 fridge it is mostly stocked with um
0:49:25 alcohol and simple Refreshments but
0:49:28 there's like cheese like Lunchables in
0:49:31 there kind of yeah there's like minor
0:49:33 snacks uh Small Things meant to kind of
0:49:35 like boost sugar while John is over
0:49:37 there taking care of her Ira very
0:49:39 clearly like there's a vibe in here he's
0:49:41 trying not to intrude and he's keeping
0:49:42 half an eye on Miles and the region but
0:49:45 we'll grab some crackers cheese whatever
0:49:48 food and just doesn't want to intrude on
0:49:50 whatever that Vibe is so just kind of
0:49:52 like hands it off to Johnny who has
0:49:55 developed some sort of Rapport well if
0:49:58 you start getting near he starts walking
0:50:00 over towards Eden yeah and Beretta tries
0:50:03 to slip out of win's grip and seems
0:50:06 intense Place herself between IRA and
0:50:09 the girl wind does not stop Brita but
0:50:13 kind of holds on to her hand so Rita can
0:50:14 lead her over her question is Majesty's
0:50:16 still up yep because that doesn't have
0:50:18 an effect on me but it doesn't affect
0:50:20 the rest of you
0:50:23 all right turning that off man
0:50:26 does stop
0:50:27 all right
0:50:29 and holds his left hand out with like a
0:50:33 bunch of you know a little tray with
0:50:35 some food
0:50:36 girls alive and looks hungry
0:50:39 Heroes welcome to bring a tour is me
0:50:42 when reaches out both for the sake of
0:50:45 expediency but also showing through
0:50:47 action to Brita that he's okay there is
0:50:51 mistrusts widen bread as ice
0:50:55 she has some reason to believe that Ira
0:50:57 would cause harm to this girl at least
0:51:00 she thinks she does
0:51:01 but she lets this happen she doesn't try
0:51:04 to stop you
0:51:05 and just seems very alert about the
0:51:08 situation Brita this is Ira he is
0:51:12 working with Mr Giovanni and Mr Giovanni
0:51:16 has tasked him with working with us back
0:51:20 when Ira said something two miles miles
0:51:23 would have taken a few nodded
0:51:25 reluctantly basically and then moved off
0:51:27 so that the situation has diffused a bit
0:51:31 a bit Yeah okay and then continues to
0:51:34 watch as the other things play out and
0:51:37 kind of taking some time to gain
0:51:39 complete control Iris this is the first
0:51:42 time that you're seeing Brita yes Bretta
0:51:45 looks to be about maybe 18 to 19 in her
0:51:48 mortal life
0:51:49 she has very large light blue eyes they
0:51:55 lean gray sometimes and her hair is a
0:51:58 light to medium brown she does look
0:52:01 comfortable in the strange outfit that
0:52:05 she has the body armor the leather but
0:52:07 it seems harsher than maybe her usual
0:52:09 Vibe and she especially with Majesty I'm
0:52:14 uncertain sometimes Majesty doesn't work
0:52:16 if you're miles what's when you've got
0:52:19 presents up does it can you tell when
0:52:21 it's affecting somebody or like not
0:52:22 affecting somebody based on their
0:52:23 behavior yeah I mean people react when
0:52:27 presence is up so it's pretty easy to
0:52:28 tell that it's coming Ira is not
0:52:30 reacting all right but Bretta is so
0:52:33 ridiculously gorgeous we got this
0:52:35 delight effect and despite the panic and
0:52:39 the lack of trust for you you see a
0:52:42 slight dip of the eyes towards your
0:52:44 Premiere pen she does finally give a
0:52:48 squeeze one more to win's hand let go
0:52:52 and look over to where miles is intent
0:52:55 on hugging him but only if he seems
0:52:57 ready he will nod his head at her then
0:53:00 he gets attacked with a hook
0:53:02 win kind of smiles and smile is miles is
0:53:06 clumped yeah he's not given once he
0:53:08 wants he gives the nod and seems all
0:53:10 right he's wrapped up in the hug just as
0:53:12 everyone else well this is one hell of a
0:53:14 way to come into here
0:53:16 yeah but that thing I think that was
0:53:20 Vito but I don't know if he just has
0:53:22 control over it when I first saw him
0:53:24 he was separate he was a person but
0:53:29 every time that I've encountered someone
0:53:31 else in here and they've been infected
0:53:34 they they speak very flatly or they say
0:53:38 what Vito would say and they move
0:53:40 jerkley like they don't fully understand
0:53:42 control of their own Limbs and they
0:53:47 start seeming more and more under his
0:53:49 control I mean what wait there's other
0:53:52 people in here like that are being
0:53:55 subsumed by him yeah yeah there were a
0:53:59 whole room of
0:54:01 people that the mirror had stolen and
0:54:04 put into a cell and they weren't
0:54:07 planning on taking Neil to his name was
0:54:09 on the list but it was when kind of
0:54:11 looks up when she mentions the whole
0:54:13 room of people seemed to absorb a lot of
0:54:16 thin blood sincerest right out of that
0:54:19 cell like like they'd been pulled
0:54:21 through the little slot into the mass
0:54:25 when is listening but she is effectively
0:54:29 between a very hungry girl and her food
0:54:32 so she crouches down she's trying to not
0:54:35 show the mangled side of her face to
0:54:37 Eden because she she's a lot to take in
0:54:40 in general but she kind of crouches down
0:54:43 and offers the snacks was there a bottle
0:54:46 of water with it at all yeah and she
0:54:48 offers she offers to unscrew the lid for
0:54:52 Eden do you want me to open that she
0:54:54 gives like a little nod but once that
0:54:57 food's in Arms Reach she is like
0:54:59 reaching at it take taking it and just
0:55:02 voraciously eating and maybe a little
0:55:06 too fast but she's gobbling down as much
0:55:09 as she can get when takes a calculated
0:55:11 risk and kind of puts her hand over the
0:55:13 food but doesn't touch it and when she
0:55:15 sees how fast she's eating I know you're
0:55:17 hungry I know what it's like to be that
0:55:19 hungry you are going to barf if you keep
0:55:22 eating that fast with cheeks kind of
0:55:25 like like wide and chipmunk like what
0:55:28 she like tries to chew don't swallow all
0:55:30 that at once make that at least two
0:55:32 different swallows what you've got in
0:55:33 there okay there's a slow nod okay
0:55:36 between bites get some water that's
0:55:38 going to help fill you up better I'm win
0:55:41 sorry yeah Eden that's
0:55:45 mouthful Eden yes I speak mouthful
0:55:49 that's yeah when and that's Johnny and
0:55:52 Miles here and
0:55:55 Ira you said the people just squeezed
0:55:58 through a hole in the door Fido used
0:56:00 vicissitude to just pull them through
0:56:04 one of those little sight slots and they
0:56:07 got mixed into that thing that you saw
0:56:10 along with the the walls I don't know if
0:56:13 you guys saw the walls running through
0:56:14 but they're
0:56:16 covered in the fungus like like from the
0:56:19 Weeping pair yeah
0:56:21 this is from
0:56:22 something that I saw a while ago
0:56:25 um Sheila one of the one of the hunters
0:56:29 um I met her through people near my
0:56:33 Haven the bar there Sherwood Cafe she
0:56:37 asked me to look into a an ex-boyfriend
0:56:39 of hers something happened to him down
0:56:42 in New York that made him I nothing like
0:56:45 I'd ever seen before uh did he walk like
0:56:49 a zombie
0:56:51 it's hard to say exactly how you walk
0:56:53 but it wasn't natural his flesh was
0:56:56 spongy it was spongy-like disease or
0:56:58 spongy like Decay I'm not sure how to
0:57:01 answer that spongy like something of
0:57:03 unnatural
0:57:05 um I hate to say it but something almost
0:57:07 like fungus was it
0:57:10 was there anything slimy in Orange
0:57:14 there could have been I it's been a
0:57:16 while I don't remember too well but they
0:57:19 weren't he was oozing something there's
0:57:22 been a lot of like pus and it looks like
0:57:26 the same mushrooms from around the
0:57:28 Weeping bear and and the thing in my
0:57:30 fridge and stuff like hell house it all
0:57:33 smells the same I know that for sure and
0:57:35 he'd been in New York you said yeah so
0:57:37 he'd be apparently something down the
0:57:39 subway had bitten him great so our
0:57:41 totally normal house out here in New
0:57:44 Haven is now reached far enough away
0:57:46 that it is affecting people in New York
0:57:48 no Vito said something about this just
0:57:51 being a piece here in New Haven yeah
0:57:54 maybe we're thinking about it the wrong
0:57:55 way maybe this came from New York and is
0:57:58 starting to look for new homes like hell
0:58:01 house right that's what viruses do they
0:58:04 expand and spread unfortunately I found
0:58:06 an even better spot to propagate here in
0:58:08 the Chantry I don't know what the hell
0:58:10 your Clan has done to it it's caused it
0:58:12 to grow like this though I wrote has
0:58:14 been listening quietly and nods and
0:58:17 looks over at Brita and just goes I'd
0:58:20 like to know that too you didn't happen
0:58:22 to see any files or anything on any of
0:58:25 this we could make some sense
0:58:31 physically exudes narc energy yes he
0:58:34 does
0:58:37 and Bretta hears him requests files
0:58:42 and express his interests in this
0:58:46 dangerous Premier situation and she's
0:58:50 already not letting go of the hug from
0:58:52 Miles unless prompted to
0:58:54 unless you've prompted her to move she
0:58:56 just Fades closer into your shoulder no
0:59:00 but Iris eyes looks like makes the you
0:59:04 know six inch glance from from Buddha up
0:59:06 to Miles because your grace I'm just
0:59:10 trying dito wasReiss's prep project
0:59:12 how'd he get his hands on him we brought
0:59:15 him here you brought him after the
0:59:18 second time we captured him captured him
0:59:20 from the house once from the house once
0:59:23 he was out in the wild and then why
0:59:26 bring him here to secure an alliance the
0:59:30 region had requested him previously our
0:59:33 nods looks back and forth I'd say it was
0:59:35 less of a request and more of a demand
0:59:37 but yeah I mean that's never really
0:59:40 stopped us before he was currently the
0:59:43 son of shawl so there was silencer all
0:59:46 asks you to do something and it's
0:59:48 honestly to the benefit of the domain to
0:59:50 not have this [ __ ] wandering around the
0:59:53 streets I tried to break through to one
0:59:56 of the people that Vito got infected and
0:59:59 it seemed like maybe
1:00:03 he was still in there but it's strong
1:00:08 Brita I know when kind of like she stays
1:00:11 crouched by Eden monitoring how fast
1:00:14 she's eating making sure she is drinking
1:00:16 water but she's also kind of listening
1:00:18 as best she can to this conversation and
1:00:21 she just kind of cracks her Knuckles a
1:00:24 little bit and looks to Brita it's been
1:00:26 a very trying week and longer maybe so
1:00:32 how did you get here miles does Patcher
1:00:35 on the back and basically go to
1:00:37 disengage at that point Bretta does let
1:00:39 miles free honestly with a bit of a
1:00:41 flicker of the surprise that she got
1:00:43 away with just hugging him that hard for
1:00:45 that long but she lets him go to dignity
1:00:49 um
1:00:50 do you do you all know where Neil is he
1:00:55 went after you yeah I know um I thought
1:00:58 he would be with you or I hoped he would
1:01:00 be with you after unfortunately I think
1:01:03 he's been everywhere recently
1:01:06 that's
1:01:07 yeah you had that weird I saw him in
1:01:10 body dashwood for a while he seemed like
1:01:14 he was
1:01:16 telepathically connected to one of the
1:01:19 thin bloods in that cell and he talked
1:01:23 to me there
1:01:25 was it like like like he was in someone
1:01:28 else's body and he was so kind of
1:01:31 hunching and
1:01:34 stuttering
1:01:35 um while his conversations were
1:01:36 happening Johnny he's kind of angled
1:01:38 over towards the door whether where
1:01:40 there was kind of like a that that was
1:01:42 kind of partially knocked in by whatever
1:01:46 was on the other side and he kind of
1:01:47 just listens a little bit to the door
1:01:49 does it sound like there's still
1:01:50 something out there moving around or
1:01:52 does it sound like it's kind of moved on
1:01:54 or maybe it's just biting his time you
1:01:56 don't hear anything on the other side he
1:01:58 frowns a little bit and kind of moves
1:02:00 back towards where the group is the
1:02:02 little girl Eden looks up at when who
1:02:06 and kind of tilts her head to the side a
1:02:08 little catching a better look at just
1:02:11 how her win really is
1:02:13 after when kind of revealed how hard
1:02:16 things have been when kind of if she
1:02:19 notices this she just gives a smirk she
1:02:21 has seen the other guy
1:02:23 she actually smiles a little at that and
1:02:27 puts her hand up on Wynn's hand it's
1:02:32 okay
1:02:33 and a third eye opens on her forehead
1:02:36 that shines with a soft blue light and
1:02:39 over the course of a handful of moments
1:02:43 wins wounded and manipulated flesh
1:02:47 begins to rapidly repair itself Ira as
1:02:51 soon as there's that light change
1:02:53 immediately is looking over there with a
1:02:56 with a a yet unseen intensity Ira you
1:03:00 recognize this kind of thing as
1:03:01 something that is said to be done by the
1:03:03 salubri a long destroyed bloodline of
1:03:07 monsters who devoured souls and engaged
1:03:11 in terrible infernalism up until the you
1:03:14 know the tramir nobly wiped him out
1:03:16 that's what I heard
1:03:19 I think at the weird Sudden Change I
1:03:22 have gone back to being prepared to stab
1:03:25 something because I'm unsure what is
1:03:26 happening what does it feel like it
1:03:28 feels actually rather reminiscent of
1:03:31 British hug it is this
1:03:35 supernaturally conjured sense of warmth
1:03:39 and peace and humanity and it is all the
1:03:44 things that are anathema to the curse of
1:03:47 Cain
1:03:48 when when the third eye opens it looks
1:03:52 like the instinct is to jump up in
1:03:54 yellow [ __ ] but something about the
1:03:57 girl's hand on hers it's sort of like
1:04:00 when a caged animal realizes that the
1:04:02 person is there to help
1:04:03 wind rests her hand on Edens and she
1:04:07 doesn't completely relax but she just
1:04:12 kind of lets it happen and the relief
1:04:16 she's not even going to try to hide the
1:04:19 relief winds Health levels are restored
1:04:21 Jesus the dust in the air around Ira
1:04:25 freezes as like he's not crackling with
1:04:29 lightning or anything like that but very
1:04:31 clearly there's like a static in the air
1:04:33 around him as this is happening his coat
1:04:36 starts to ruffle a little bit and
1:04:37 there's like a cold breeze in the room
1:04:39 and he looks at wind and goes
1:04:42 Sheriff
1:04:44 I would recommend stepping away
1:04:48 from the girl Johnny whose mouth is
1:04:50 completely a gape and the uh his
1:04:52 cigarette is has fallen out and is on
1:04:54 the floor just kind of takes a few
1:04:56 moments and blinks and goes the [ __ ] was
1:05:00 that wind kind of looks
1:05:03 eyes with Eden Eden you kind of
1:05:06 toward IRA
1:05:08 duly noted the thing
1:05:11 the eye that is um a thing traditionally
1:05:15 associated with demonic Soul Eaters so
1:05:19 maybe I'm not gonna do violence right
1:05:22 now but maybe don't let it touch you she
1:05:26 her if you prefer you might not have
1:05:30 noticed Brita readying the gun she is so
1:05:34 efficient about it how many demons have
1:05:36 you been around Ira a few yeah this
1:05:39 isn't that isn't it no what is it then
1:05:43 something else studies disagree Studies
1:05:47 have been known to be wrong that's not
1:05:49 what her file said you've seen her file
1:05:52 yeah I saw the file for the Mortal girl
1:05:55 that you had that your clan had trapped
1:05:58 in a cell and
1:06:01 I didn't say anything about demons what
1:06:04 did it say then
1:06:06 Ira's not looking over it Brita may not
1:06:08 even recognize she probably has a gun
1:06:10 trained on him right now you said the
1:06:11 gun is ready yep he's still not even
1:06:13 really looking at wind is like very his
1:06:16 reaction to this girl seems deeply
1:06:19 ingrained of like like he does not
1:06:21 appear to be at least from his
1:06:23 perspective overreacting at all
1:06:25 but out of the side of his mouth it just
1:06:27 goes not demons
1:06:30 wanted to say I would love more
1:06:32 information
1:06:33 why are you here
1:06:36 with them
1:06:37 the Regent called me
1:06:39 and asked me to escort them to the
1:06:41 Chantry to find
1:06:43 you
1:06:45 he came from another source
1:06:47 uh Mr ambrosino who you met before Amber
1:06:50 Gino Giovanni right Mr Giovanni he's not
1:06:53 here I'm good yeah I know I just you
1:06:55 said that but I sounds like he's here
1:06:58 withReiss he's a tremeer but he's not
1:07:01 he's he's subject to the pyramid Beretta
1:07:05 decides to test IRA and with her new
1:07:10 success in Aura rating she trains her
1:07:14 eyes on him and she says what would it
1:07:17 mean to you if her file said that she
1:07:19 was the last solder of Eve Lex does that
1:07:22 mean anything to me well me intelligence
1:07:24 occult difficulty eight
1:07:27 uh sadly my tens don't blow so seven
1:07:30 successes with a mere seven successes
1:07:33 you manage to recall in some of your
1:07:36 training occasionally there are tremir
1:07:39 who come upon information that is
1:07:42 disruptive to their world view and some
1:07:45 Jamir lose it
1:07:47 and have to be put down
1:07:49 and as part of your training it's become
1:07:51 one of the men who puts those Premier
1:07:53 down you learned a little bit about
1:07:57 gehenna cults
1:07:59 and in multiple instances
1:08:02 there have been gehenna Cults that
1:08:04 believed in the coming of a Messiah some
1:08:08 sort of individual that would be able to
1:08:11 offer redemption in the final nights in
1:08:14 some instances this Messiah would bring
1:08:17 about Golconda in some instances they
1:08:20 would be the path to Breaking the curse
1:08:24 of Cain and others they are a symbol of
1:08:28 gehenna and the rise of the Ancients if
1:08:32 it is believed that this person is
1:08:35 somehow tied to then at least in some of
1:08:38 the more recent conversations in the
1:08:41 cold circles
1:08:42 she might be part of a phenomenon that
1:08:45 is called
1:08:46 the dumb fear
1:08:48 Mortals born from thin-blooded vampires
1:08:53 a living breathing
1:08:56 human born from a vampire
1:09:00 now
1:09:02 supposedly
1:09:04 any instance of the last daughter of Eve
1:09:07 is going to have some sort of crescent
1:09:11 moon birth mark on them that's kind of
1:09:13 the big sign the Crescent Moon
1:09:17 all right you're not a villain are you
1:09:20 I don't think so you don't get your spec
1:09:26 to some of the premiere out there I'm
1:09:28 sure that I am for successes
1:09:31 IRA what is your emotional state and how
1:09:34 does it change as you learn that some
1:09:39 people apparently believe that this
1:09:41 little girl is the last daughter of Eve
1:09:44 before last daughter of Eve is mentioned
1:09:48 Ira looks ready to fight
1:09:51 looks truly ready to throw down with a
1:09:54 demon and maybe die because that [ __ ] is
1:09:58 not okay so like flickers of fear not
1:10:01 necessarily anger but more like the fear
1:10:03 of a seasoned Soldier who's done this
1:10:06 kind of thing and knows how to keep his
1:10:08 motions in check to do the job that has
1:10:10 to get done for everyone's sake the kind
1:10:13 of person who will make hard decisions
1:10:15 and terrible decisions that have to be
1:10:17 made and when she says last order of Eve
1:10:19 first there's confusion and then
1:10:22 recognition
1:10:24 and then his emotions get chaotic as
1:10:29 beliefs that he dismissed for a long
1:10:32 time crash up against a conversation I
1:10:36 mean you don't know the full context but
1:10:38 basically it is it is the emotional
1:10:40 turmoil of someone who believed
1:10:43 something for a long time and in a very
1:10:45 short span of time is having a lot of
1:10:48 that stuff questioned and challenged you
1:10:50 don't have a context for this but I mean
1:10:52 councilman Orlando yesterday was like
1:10:54 Hey so gehenna's real so that's
1:10:56 basically his emotional state the cold
1:10:58 breeze continues to blow you're looking
1:11:00 at his aura that appears to not be
1:11:02 something he's doing deliberately just
1:11:04 some sort of weird emotional
1:11:06 Supernatural side effect to his
1:11:08 existence as a kindred maybe when he is
1:11:10 in a heightened state but that sort of
1:11:13 like potential energy in the air that
1:11:15 was gathering around him does dissipate
1:11:17 the dust starts to settle again and
1:11:20 almost by rote like something he's read
1:11:22 and memorized a million times
1:11:24 he just says he looks from Brita and
1:11:27 then back directly at the girl when the
1:11:30 Snows consume the Earth and the Sun
1:11:33 gutters like a Candle in the Wind then
1:11:36 and only then there will be born a woman
1:11:38 the last daughter of Eve
1:11:41 and in her there will be decided the
1:11:44 fate of all
1:11:46 and you will not know this woman except
1:11:50 by the mark of the moon on her
1:11:52 and she will face treachery hatred and
1:11:56 pain
1:11:57 but in her is the Last Hope and he looks
1:12:01 over it would make me feel uh [ __ ] I
1:12:05 don't know if it would make me feel
1:12:07 better or worse but and he's like
1:12:09 clearly talking to Eden you don't have a
1:12:12 mark
1:12:13 of the moon on you
1:12:15 do you Bretta surreptitiously closes one
1:12:18 hand nervously
1:12:20 eating wipes the crumbs and subtle
1:12:25 chocolate smears from her mouth and
1:12:28 stands up finally putting the leather
1:12:31 jacket on she rolls up a sleeve and
1:12:35 turns revealing on her left palm
1:12:40 following the the lines that curve
1:12:43 around the Palm facing her thumb you can
1:12:47 see this eerily perfect
1:12:50 birthmark that looks like a crescent
1:12:55 moon
1:12:56 Jesus Christ
1:12:58 when isn't prepared to stop protecting
1:13:03 this girl and she keeps her shoulder
1:13:06 kind of in front of Eden in case someone
1:13:10 decides to get silly her third eye
1:13:13 closes very subtle when it's closed you
1:13:17 can there's almost no indication of it
1:13:19 whatsoever
1:13:20 I didn't mean to scare you
1:13:22 I'm sorry
1:13:23 Ira doesn't say anything just gives her
1:13:27 a little nod like he is still very not
1:13:29 comfortable with this and let's slip
1:13:31 just a quiet death fear
1:13:34 she gives a slow nod my God Johnny kind
1:13:38 of fixes her a hard look how much do you
1:13:41 know about what we are it's like a
1:13:44 slight Shake of the head
1:13:46 I know
1:13:48 and I know that you're vampires
1:13:52 Johnny kind of nods reassuringly I've
1:13:55 seen that you drink blood and she kind
1:13:57 of eyes one of the open cylinders that
1:14:00 were filled with blood
1:14:01 she eyes it
1:14:03 hungrily
1:14:05 do you need blood she gives a little
1:14:08 knot it's hard to heal when hit hands
1:14:11 one over to her looking like she's she
1:14:14 has the demeanor like she's handing her
1:14:16 like a tall boy like I probably
1:14:18 shouldn't be giving the child some
1:14:20 alcohol but
1:14:22 but she says she needs it and she she
1:14:24 looks like a straight shooter she just
1:14:26 did me a solid so
1:14:28 she just kind of passes it to her thank
1:14:30 you she says and now you can see
1:14:33 these like kind of cute like like not
1:14:38 quite real ass vampire fangs in her
1:14:40 mouth but like baby fangs well yeah yeah
1:14:44 like
1:14:45 like kitten fangs you know
1:14:48 she accepts the drink
1:14:50 and guzzles down the blood like again
1:14:56 hungrily do you need more is there more
1:15:00 for everyone short answer yes there is
1:15:03 yes let's take a few minutes let's let
1:15:06 them rest up get up here I want more
1:15:10 please how much more do you think you
1:15:12 need like five six ten twenty just look
1:15:16 she doesn't seem sure I'll bring some
1:15:18 over you just have a c over there if I
1:15:20 could take like seven that would be
1:15:22 great but I want to make sure everyone
1:15:24 everyone needs to have as much blood as
1:15:27 possible if they're gonna be fighting I
1:15:29 think Clan Premiere is opening their
1:15:31 Hospitality to their blood stores here
1:15:33 my understanding the region has offered
1:15:38 it and we're not sticking around the
1:15:41 chantry's gone anyways so good then I'll
1:15:44 I'll just keep on bringing the drinks
1:15:45 you relax uh miles you might want to
1:15:49 think about granting her Hospitality at
1:15:51 this point I don't know how the [ __ ]
1:15:54 that applies miles you recognize the
1:15:58 word dumb fear and you think back too
1:16:01 and it's very
1:16:03 it's an uncomfortable feeling it's like
1:16:07 fragments of memories that you
1:16:09 experienced while under the tutelage of
1:16:12 your sire kind of coming back to you in
1:16:15 ways times that you helped him with
1:16:19 investigations and in this instance
1:16:21 hunts
1:16:23 as you may recall your sire isn't just
1:16:25 an archon he is a joseon the leader of
1:16:29 the Josephine specifically a task force
1:16:32 that is designed to wipe out geanna
1:16:36 Cults where and when they rise it is
1:16:38 policy for them to take all Ghana
1:16:43 oriented paraphernalia from the Cults
1:16:45 when they are found in dispatched and on
1:16:48 more than one occasion that has included
1:16:51 a child born of vampires
1:16:54 or more specifically thin Bloods
1:16:58 you know that your sire will take this
1:17:03 girl and she will never be seen again
1:17:06 you know that if there are any signs of
1:17:08 thin bloods in your city
1:17:11 it is going to be the start of trouble
1:17:13 Elders old princes there are all kinds
1:17:16 of tales about the time of thin blood
1:17:18 and the Doom of Kindred society that
1:17:22 follows it so it looks like Greece has
1:17:24 been preemptively rounding them up and
1:17:26 keeping them out of sight perhaps
1:17:28 attempting to understand why thin Bloods
1:17:31 and dumb fear and all of these strange
1:17:33 things that keep popping up all over the
1:17:35 place are popping up all over the place
1:17:37 and more specifically what comes next
1:17:39 what is the point of elimination of the
1:17:42 gehenna Cults well the Camarillo
1:17:44 officially does not believe in gehenna
1:17:46 right it is a thing that Causes Chaos it
1:17:50 is ridiculous fables that lead to
1:17:52 violence and in the case in one
1:17:55 particular case an entire Rebellion
1:17:58 so those who have the will to face such
1:18:03 heresy
1:18:05 are tasked with finding and
1:18:07 Exterminating it
1:18:09 your sire is their leader
1:18:13 I do not think
1:18:16 it would be smart for her or for some of
1:18:19 us to have her publicly given
1:18:22 Hospitality probably not as she is
1:18:25 hospitality is for
1:18:27 Andrew so well isn't she a vampire no
1:18:31 well that's complicated anyway to draw a
1:18:35 lot of attention a lot of attention and
1:18:37 there are factions in the Camarillo who
1:18:40 will come and take her away and the bad
1:18:44 things might be happen to us Ira nods
1:18:47 not quite understanding he's not talking
1:18:49 about the same factions as miles but
1:18:51 nods in solid arrow with Miles like yes
1:18:55 all right well she is in the city
1:18:58 perhaps
1:19:00 an acknowledgment on the down low and
1:19:04 some kind of cover story at least
1:19:06 acknowledgments go in books she's a
1:19:09 ghoul she's a living being she has
1:19:12 disciplines who would be the wiser we
1:19:15 can possibly figure this out for now I
1:19:17 think we're going to keep her safe and
1:19:19 we're going to try to get her out of
1:19:21 here and I believe our the problem is to
1:19:24 stop veto from continuing whatever he's
