0:00:28 now let's walk the path of night
0:00:32 [Music]
0:00:40 last time on path of night Reiss
0:00:43 explained that the Chantry is built on a
0:00:45 node which has been infiltrated by A
0:00:47 Shard of the eldest empowering by
0:00:49 zantosa unsure if Vito can even be
0:00:52 killed okori ultimately decided that
0:00:55 they needed to try regardless
0:00:57 Ira promised to watch over Eden and
0:01:00 Enchanted the Coteries equipment for
0:01:01 the upcoming fight they find that
0:01:03 infestation has grown as they creep down
0:01:06 the Halls Breda had a final discussion
0:01:09 with parent before offering a merciful
0:01:12 end the Corey arrived to find Vito
0:01:16 waiting
0:01:19 foreign
0:01:22 [Music]
0:01:31 why don't we start with Miles what is
0:01:35 your initiative score 21 I'm taking two
0:01:37 celebrity actions understood win 18.
0:01:41 Johnny what is your initiative I'm going
0:01:43 to spend uh two blood for Celerity
0:01:45 actions and go on a 19. IRA what is your
0:01:49 initiative spending my nine points of
0:01:52 Readiness I am going on a 27.
0:01:55 gross Britta what is your initiative
0:01:59 weirdly the same as Johnny I'm spending
0:02:01 two blood for two actions of Celerity
0:02:04 and Dad 19. veto is going to be going on
0:02:07 a 13. the mass of roiling Flesh that is
0:02:12 accompanying him is going under 26th
0:02:16 the creatures that are all clumped
0:02:20 together in a gray mass of tick-like
0:02:23 things is going on a zero they act on
0:02:25 the end of the round
0:02:27 so with that Ira we begin with you Jesus
0:02:31 Ira will spend blood for dual thought uh
0:02:36 so he can do two things at once and the
0:02:40 first thing he does is light up in a
0:02:43 pillar of electricity again not because
0:02:45 it was crazy effective but because flesh
0:02:48 is everywhere the more [ __ ] that is
0:02:51 surrounding me that will burn away the
0:02:53 things that try and touch me the better
0:02:54 before he does he looks at Eden real
0:02:56 fast and just goes be uh careful Shield
0:03:00 your eyes don't look right at me and
0:03:02 then is a pillar of electricity and then
0:03:05 with a second action we'll pull the
0:03:08 paper with the true name in out of his
0:03:10 pocket and in one smooth motion slice it
0:03:14 across like in the webbing between his
0:03:16 fingers to give himself like a nasty
0:03:18 paper cut enough to draw a little bit of
0:03:20 blood and then with the electricity burn
0:03:22 it away as he looks at veto
0:03:26 hope this [ __ ] works
0:03:28 and burns the paper to Ash with vetoes
0:03:31 hopefully true name on it
0:03:33 after you go the mass of a spongy
0:03:38 strange orangey flesh
0:03:42 ATS and these kind of uh
0:03:46 intestine-like organs started to grip
0:03:50 veto more and more and more of them and
0:03:53 as that happens bone muscle a lot of it
0:03:57 starts to kind of rapidly generate and
0:04:02 over the course of mere moments
0:04:05 he becomes part of this monster that
0:04:10 dwarfs even the Weeping bear from your
0:04:14 memories and it
0:04:16 bristles with organs and appendages
0:04:21 starting with fingers but quickly
0:04:24 devolving into bone spurs and sex organs
0:04:30 when his attention focuses towards Britta
0:04:34 and with a hand outstretched towards her
0:04:37 it starts to speak
0:04:41 it's words
0:04:42 are heard out loud
0:04:45 but also echo in your minds
0:04:54 gives for you
0:04:56 ye but accepts
0:04:59 and Britta will become subject to a
0:05:01 psychic soul
0:05:07 psychic assault is nothing less than a
0:05:09 direct mind-to-mind attack which uses
0:05:11 the sheer force of an Elder's will to
0:05:13 overpower his Target victims of psychic
0:05:15 assault show little outward sign of the
0:05:17 attack save for the nosebleeds and
0:05:20 expressions of intense Agony all
0:05:22 injuries by means of this psychic
0:05:24 pressure inflicted are internal a
0:05:27 medical examination of a moral victim of
0:05:29 a psychic assault invariably shows the
0:05:31 cause of death to be a heart attack or
0:05:33 aneurysm while vampires killed with this
0:05:36 power because it is haliful Power
0:05:38 Rangers and vampires Decay to dust
0:05:40 instantly regardless of age
0:05:42 ready
0:05:43 [Laughter]
0:05:45 I need a willpower rule from you that is
0:05:49 total willpower not romantic uh right
0:05:54 tends do not explode correct correct two
0:05:56 successes
0:06:00 they have six successes
0:06:03 Britta it has four successes more than
0:06:05 your total which means the dragon loses
0:06:08 all temporary willpower points and half
0:06:11 of their permanent wool power points
0:06:13 rounded down and they suffer three
0:06:15 Health levels of lethal damage which may
0:06:17 be soaked normally
0:06:21 one success you will suffer two levels
0:06:23 of lethal damage you do not suffer any
0:06:26 actual damage to your health levels so
0:06:28 there's no need for a frenzy check but
0:06:30 Brett is not feeling great you are
0:06:32 stricken with absolute agony and reduced
0:06:36 to a state of despair blood flows freely
0:06:40 from your nose from my nose all right
0:06:42 and then
0:06:44 it is your turn what do you do in the
0:06:46 state of Terror am I able to act even
0:06:48 with the will drained out of me yes you
0:06:49 are all right in that case have any of
0:06:53 the texts dropped yet they have not they
0:06:55 will be acting at the end of the round
0:06:56 end of the round thank you out of pure
0:06:58 reactive fear mixed with the half
0:07:00 thought to provoke veto to try to fool
0:07:03 him into getting close enough range for
0:07:06 her to do as she's planned she's gonna
0:07:08 try to shoot him go for it her usual
0:07:10 habit of shooting to make herself as
0:07:12 small as possible to lessen that Target
0:07:14 but there's something shrinking in it
0:07:16 now with all of the horror that she's
0:07:18 failing
0:07:21 six successes with six successes five
0:07:24 successes will carry over into damage
0:07:29 I really hope that [ __ ] paper flesh
0:07:31 worked
0:07:32 [Music]
0:07:33 I guess it did not
0:07:36 eat successes
0:07:39 [ __ ] bro what the hell also on 19 Johnny
0:07:45 what was um miles 21 oh miles I'm sorry
0:07:48 go I'm going to unload my entire rifle
0:07:52 into the tick swarm above us sounds
0:07:55 awesome after moving uh to take an
0:07:58 angled approach so it does not rain acid
0:08:00 on me
0:08:02 so plus two difficulty 10 extra dice get
0:08:05 to spread it around though you should
0:08:07 put one on each yeah so I've got six
0:08:10 successes uh give me a single damage
0:08:11 roll I don't apply it to all six
0:08:14 four that is sufficient to destroy six
0:08:17 of them uh I'll have you roll it right
0:08:19 now roll me a d10 seven one of them will
0:08:24 drop down to join combat against you
0:08:25 this round did they drop at the end of
0:08:27 the round yeah end of round but Tim got
0:08:29 ahead of them no pressure fellas that is
0:08:32 the end of my turn we are now on Johnny
0:08:34 so the transformed veto and the mass the
0:08:39 sentient mass of Flesh that has
0:08:41 assaulted Britta are down in the ritual
0:08:45 chamber beneath us uh yes I do want to
0:08:48 clarify veto has not finished
0:08:50 transforming he is still gaining mass
0:08:53 and the shape is refining itself above
0:08:56 in the rafters we have the ticks which
0:09:00 are falling from the sky how is the mass
0:09:03 of Flesh positioned in relation to where
0:09:06 Vito is is it surrounding him it is
0:09:09 actually a mass that is up in the
0:09:11 rafters towards where the pipes are
0:09:13 broken and it looks like they've been
0:09:16 collecting body parts from throughout
0:09:19 the Chantry and are depositing and
0:09:21 knitting it into the veiny substance
0:09:25 that's kind of come through those pipes
0:09:27 so they've just been kind of like being
0:09:30 little worker ants Vito is down below so
0:09:33 he's he's down below there way up above
0:09:35 veto is down below and he isn't in the
0:09:38 throes of transformation yes can I see
0:09:41 his head yes we can
0:09:45 well
0:09:47 Johnny came here to do something and I
0:09:49 think he's gonna try and do it so I
0:09:52 think he's going to LEAP some bounds to
0:09:55 try and land on Vito's shoulders or land
0:09:58 on his back rather and and take his head
0:10:00 with a chainsaw I'm going to say the
0:10:04 that is a very short jump for you uh I
0:10:07 mean it's a long jump but it's a very
0:10:08 short jump for you uh so no need to rule
0:10:11 for that however it is a split action
0:10:12 and you may make your melee attack roll
0:10:15 at half dice pool it sounds very fair to
0:10:18 me plus two difficulty because you are
0:10:19 aiming for that so it leaves me with
0:10:21 seven dice looking for Eights
0:10:26 with his powerful arms Johnny scores
0:10:28 four successes to hit 3-0 carry over
0:10:31 into damage I will spend a further point
0:10:33 of blood to gain five automatic
0:10:35 successes from potence
0:10:38 five successes on the dice plus five
0:10:41 automatic successes means a total of ten
0:10:43 aggravated damage from the chainsaw and
0:10:46 as five successes to Circle so it will
0:10:48 take five levels of uh aggravated damage
0:10:50 as the chainsaw tears into his flesh and
0:10:54 you are mortified to see that it is not
0:10:57 blood that sprays from him but a black
0:11:01 sizzling acid that splashes up at you
0:11:05 hold
0:11:10 there's two things I would like to do
0:11:13 actually but they're a week of
0:11:14 nightmares things so if I could go over
0:11:16 them yes please go ahead because you
0:11:18 still [ __ ] have you
0:11:20 it's a week I said
0:11:23 I spend my candy oh I have three eyes of
0:11:25 the moment I think I'm using two um the
0:11:27 first one is I think that Britta is
0:11:30 feeling like I think she's kind of
0:11:32 intensely watching the scene and the
0:11:34 danger that Johnny's putting himself in
0:11:36 and wishing that Johnny had every
0:11:38 Advantage wishing that Ira had casts to
0:11:42 improve his chainsaw even if Johnny
0:11:44 hates Blood Magic Gross oh [ __ ] but like
0:11:49 she's wishing against what Johnny would
0:11:51 want to protect him and if that's able
0:11:54 to reach out through the entire whatever
0:11:56 the [ __ ] it's like retroactively I guess
0:11:59 maybe that like the way that she's
0:12:01 subconsciously imagining that it might
0:12:03 have happened what would have been like
0:12:05 Ira kind of cockly figuring that Johnny
0:12:08 wouldn't notice if he got it done in the
0:12:10 hallway okay I dig all right yeah so for
0:12:13 that Ira I want you to go ahead and make
0:12:15 a casting rule we will use that to
0:12:17 modify Johnny's dice pool Johnny you may
0:12:21 roll the additional dice based in the
0:12:23 Moody world I retroactively sped the
0:12:25 blood when Johnny's not looking
0:12:28 four additional dice Johnny roll four
0:12:31 additional dice
0:12:36 well that is oh my God four more
0:12:40 successes
0:12:41 so that's a total of nine aggravated
0:12:45 damage science
0:12:50 and the chainsaw gets caught on a spine
0:12:55 for about a moment before his head is
0:12:58 taken from the rest of his body
0:13:03 okay do I still get splashed with
0:13:06 horrible acid you do
0:13:10 no
0:13:14 says but preferably no I have more week
0:13:18 of nightmares two out of three so I'd
0:13:20 like to spend the second so that it
0:13:22 happens that The Recoil from the
0:13:24 chainsaw pushed Johnny back with the
0:13:27 chainsaw out of range just he happened
0:13:29 to be pushed in the direction away from
0:13:32 the splash maybe it's something against
0:13:33 knocking against a particular hard bit
0:13:35 of spine or bone spur but he just the
0:13:38 angle of the Chainsaw veers the spatter
0:13:40 away Johnny's moved away from the acid
0:13:42 Splash and vetoes at least his torso and
0:13:47 head are separated from one another that
0:13:50 collapses to the ground Landing in a
0:13:52 pool of acid and begins to melt away
0:13:58 veto is dead
0:14:03 there's still a big flesh monster yeah
0:14:05 there's still a lot yeah
0:14:08 win a year ago his body continues to
0:14:11 transform I'll handle the little things
0:14:12 for now what is Miles say essentially
0:14:15 get him
0:14:17 kill that thing well those are the magic
0:14:20 words
0:14:24 I pop blood and pop claws give me an
0:14:28 attack roll
0:14:30 [Music]
0:14:32 well I get two success one carries over
0:14:35 into damage as you plunge your claws
0:14:38 into its flesh
0:14:40 you have a strong Speck yes I do rending
0:14:43 they'll do it five ah six because I'll
0:14:47 spend the blood for yeah
0:14:50 it will suffer two levels of aggravated
0:14:52 damage and then do you have an
0:14:54 additional action that you may sacrifice
0:14:56 whether split dice spool or Celerity
0:14:59 actions I did not think to split my dice
0:15:01 pool you're automatically hit yep for
0:15:03 three levels of aggravated damage can I
0:15:05 so yes you may as it sprays up at you I
0:15:08 just have extra Health levels from Ira
0:15:10 correct correct it does not play into
0:15:11 this nope if you get hit it goes under
0:15:14 your it hits your flannel first check
0:15:16 out that up armored flannel
0:15:19 I soak 12. I did okay
0:15:23 12 out of your 14 12 out of my 14. Jesus
0:15:27 what yeah and when
0:15:29 that's why I sent her in Vito has met
0:15:34 final death however his flesh remains of
0:15:37 use
0:15:39 the shape that it is taking
0:15:42 starts to become more
0:15:45 symmetrical purposeful and rows of eyes
0:15:49 on a huge monstrous skull start to open
0:15:53 and it has teeth like short swords this
0:15:57 huge gaping Mall along her neck a body
0:16:01 built out wings like a bat starts to
0:16:04 open up and press against the walls of
0:16:07 the space that you were fighting it in
0:16:09 it assumes this flesh and Bone draconic
0:16:13 form it will use physical actions to
0:16:15 diabolize it
0:16:21 Christ lacks let's [ __ ] do this
0:16:25 Johnny
0:16:27 bones it all around yep
0:16:31 air bombs miles
0:16:33 it will take its free action to frighten
0:16:36 you cool I need a willpower rule to
0:16:38 resist it iron role playing to this yeah
0:16:40 I'll put it at an increased difficulty
0:16:42 to intimidate you because of it what's
0:16:44 that plus three diff
0:16:46 counting blood Buffs and transformation
0:16:48 it does have a strength rating of 20.
0:16:52 okay spend willpower on this you may I
0:16:55 will
0:16:56 there is no possible way to convey the
0:16:59 tension in this room through the audio
0:17:03 I mean there is a I don't think are this
0:17:05 listeners would enjoy just extended
0:17:07 screaming
0:17:09 five successes that is five to its 11
0:17:12 successes 11 on 20 Dice Man no that's
0:17:16 it's strength plus intimidation
0:17:18 can't even
0:17:20 I can't even hit that number your next
0:17:22 role against it whatever that may be is
0:17:24 that a minus six die penalty
0:17:27 I'm glad it's me
0:17:28 [Music]
0:17:33 we're a little quiet in here now all
0:17:35 right
0:17:37 at the end of the round
0:17:39 two things happen
0:17:40 the right wing door opens
0:17:44 and a handful of individuals emerge
0:17:48 Britta you recognize them
0:17:51 eagle
0:17:52 Tanakh Phantom
0:17:55 and shrake enter the space
0:17:59 and you see shrike look up at the mass
0:18:03 of gray forms
0:18:06 and they kind of stop at the doorway
0:18:10 press up to sides of the hallway uh like
0:18:13 entrance to the space as like kind of
0:18:16 like cover and they start shooting up at
0:18:18 it then we get to
0:18:21 Miles Celerity actions please I will
0:18:26 do a reaction reload uh did one of the
0:18:30 things drop I guess one drop down okay I
0:18:33 will perform an action to reload and
0:18:35 take a shot at it sounds good I can
0:18:38 reload as part of a normal action
0:18:39 without splitting it
0:18:42 reload is successful you guys see a mile
0:18:45 start making quick work with the gun and
0:18:47 I think it was a very organized Fighters
0:18:53 four to hit three okay area over into
0:18:56 damage
0:18:59 three damage
0:19:01 uh three damages is enough to cause it
0:19:03 to burst Quick Stitch of the rifle put
0:19:06 that one down
0:19:07 okay uh we will then go to brother I
0:19:11 have this glove uh that is meant to give
0:19:14 a negative effect to the first Brew High
0:19:16 touch veto is dead is that silly Brujah
0:19:21 you have no idea
0:19:23 time to find out
0:19:26 well I think that is the thought because
0:19:30 I think that there is this Beast of
0:19:33 literal mythical proportions standing in
0:19:36 the flesh that Vita once wore and the
0:19:39 trauma of what Britta has gone through
0:19:41 has broken her down in ways that she
0:19:43 hasn't remembered ever feeling and with
0:19:48 everything that just occurred between
0:19:49 every aspect of veto's grossness and the
0:19:52 literal psychic assault I think Brit is
0:19:55 collecting her bravery to run out and
0:19:59 where is Johnny just to avoid him where
0:20:02 is he located on the dragon or did he
0:20:04 fall off the dragon he is up on its
0:20:06 shoulder okay where is the closest point
0:20:09 to the dragon to me or a location I
0:20:11 might be able to jump to and jump back
0:20:13 such as a wing point if I could
0:20:14 theoretically do that its reach
0:20:16 encompasses the room okay if it would be
0:20:19 possible to try to jump onto a point of
0:20:22 it to touch it and then jump back to a
0:20:25 higher place I'd like to uh that would
0:20:27 be taking three actions you're gonna
0:20:29 what you cannot do with Celerity yep uh
0:20:31 you can either leap onto it yeah you're
0:20:33 gonna attempt to go over and touch it
0:20:34 and stand before it essentially one of
0:20:37 those well I'm definitely not trying to
0:20:39 face the front of it and I'm trying to
0:20:40 stay away from where Johnny is out of
0:20:42 pure psychotic caution so uh if I can
0:20:45 reach out enough to touch it we'll say
0:20:47 this happens now choose someone in the
0:20:49 room that Reiss casts a spell on to just
0:20:52 that's all I get information about all
0:20:54 you get
0:20:57 um
0:20:59 I guess I'm the appropriate guinea pig
0:21:01 here you okay uh he hits you with a
0:21:05 power called wind dance here's what it
0:21:09 does that's a real 50 50. people are
0:21:11 making happy noises
0:21:14 it's it's he's helping you it's a boon
0:21:18 you get a full Dodge dice pull against
0:21:21 all incoming attacks [ __ ] what does this
0:21:23 feel like you feel impossibly light on
0:21:26 your feet everything around you seems to
0:21:29 move a little slower
0:21:31 you have a sense of the direction
0:21:33 everything is moving all at once it's
0:21:36 like you're very much in tune with the
0:21:37 flow of air in the room and do I get the
0:21:40 sense that Reiss has done this and that I
0:21:42 have chosen that yes so a little
0:21:45 hesitantly Britta selects herself as a
0:21:48 guinea pig unsure of what race exactly
0:21:51 intends to do and she feels that power
0:21:54 fuel her it's almost as if the willpower
0:21:57 that was stripped from her gives her a
0:21:59 lightness she never had before with that
0:22:01 upgrade and she'll Dart over to try to
0:22:04 touch the glove I imagine the bones
0:22:07 beneath the leathery skin of the wing
0:22:09 seems like the thing that might be the
0:22:11 closest give me a DEX plus brawl oh
0:22:16 difficulty six oh sorry five he's uh
0:22:20 easy to hit does graceful apply sure
0:22:24 five successes when you make contact
0:22:26 something horrible happens and a second
0:22:29 spell is fired from The Amulet Rob I
0:22:32 have thumb side up what magic what's
0:22:35 going on here Eden has been targeted
0:22:37 with a spell Eden has been targeted with
0:22:39 a spell this spell is Chill of the
0:22:41 windsaber
0:22:42 oh I told you [ __ ] that come
0:22:45 here [ __ ] piggyback [ __ ] on their
0:22:48 magic
0:22:53 hold on I have questions I have thumb
0:22:56 sign ups am I the only one who's aware
0:22:58 this is happening no one else is going
0:23:00 to be aware until it happens so my first
0:23:04 let me think this out real fast doesn't
0:23:07 have to be real fast
0:23:09 I'm aware that this is happening show of
0:23:12 the windsaber is an elder level ritual
0:23:15 right indeed it is the amulet
0:23:18 itself
0:23:20 is not an elder level ritual correct
0:23:23 Eden is going to be decapitated
0:23:27 immediately indeed and no one can do
0:23:30 anything about it she is unlikely to be
0:23:33 able to resist his will
0:23:37 Ira is extremely loyal to the tremair
0:23:40 doesn't
0:23:42 still very not cool with this salubri
0:23:45 girl dump here but Ira is sometimes to
0:23:50 his detriment
0:23:52 a fundamentally good person
0:23:56 and so I think what he does In This
0:23:58 Moment is he blows up his own [ __ ]
0:24:01 spot with race
0:24:02 and reacts without thinking
0:24:05 and Lex I would like to use the
0:24:09 Forbidden discipline of
0:24:11 counterthometergy to destroy the amulet
0:24:14 all right get it Esther which would stop
0:24:17 his line of sight correct sure would
0:24:19 it would stop the smell from happening
0:24:21 okay Ira absolutely is acting without
0:24:24 thinking here and he's gonna have some
0:24:26 [ __ ] like if we survive this I'm so
0:24:28 [ __ ] I am gonna spend a willpower on
0:24:30 this okay uh no pressure Rob but you're
0:24:33 looking for four successes
0:24:35 because I have perfect clarity up that
0:24:39 lowers my difficulty so I have six
0:24:41 successes
0:24:42 including the will
0:24:44 power seven successes
0:24:46 with seven successes you snuff the magic
0:24:50 of the amulet out and save Eden's life
0:24:57 I mean we're in the middle of a dragon
0:24:59 fight with TMR and all sorts of [ __ ] but
0:25:01 if anyone looks at Ira's face or sees
0:25:04 him as he just throws a hand out towards
0:25:07 Britta faster than thought and then he
0:25:10 has an immediate look on his face of
0:25:11 like oh [ __ ] what did I just do oh no
0:25:15 well it depends does anything happen to
0:25:18 the amulet that I know of because I
0:25:20 would look at Ira if there's something
0:25:22 wrong with the premier [ __ ] he very
0:25:24 dramatically gestures to the amulet and
0:25:26 that's all that seems to happen Okay
0:25:28 when uh his the motion of the lightning
0:25:31 rod over there looks up but she sees his
0:25:34 face he looks horrified at what he just
0:25:37 did like like he just acted and doesn't
0:25:39 know why he just did what he did she's
0:25:42 finding a lot of things away for later
0:25:44 this is one of them but there is a
0:25:46 [ __ ] dragon in the room and Ira did
0:25:50 something it's not apparent that it was
0:25:52 something bad so we're just gonna move
0:25:54 forward from here yeah I mean he turns
0:25:56 his attention back to the dragon and all
0:25:57 the [ __ ] problems pretty quick but he
0:25:59 did in the middle of all this [ __ ] he
0:26:01 definitely just had an existential
0:26:03 crisis yep in addition to this it's body
0:26:06 begins to Twitch and wriggle and writhe
0:26:09 uncontrollably as it is Afflicted with
0:26:12 seizures okay so question
0:26:15 so seizures usually involve falling down
0:26:17 uh it does not fall down okay good
0:26:19 because it is not a Grand Mall okay
0:26:23 search because I when I last checked I
0:26:25 am on the ground next to it so if a
0:26:28 dragon gonna fall on me
0:26:30 I want to soak it it's not quite that
0:26:32 kind of station
0:26:34 so that is Britta Johnny what do you got
0:26:37 so
0:26:39 from the last time I had an action
0:26:42 mere moments ago I decapitated veto and
0:26:46 then suddenly the the dead flesh
0:26:49 remaining
0:26:50 exploded with growth and has become a
0:26:54 dragon beneath my feet and wings have
0:26:57 sprouted on either side of me uh yes
0:27:00 things have gotten awkward it escalated
0:27:03 quickly well Johnny would rather fight a
0:27:05 crocodile so I'm gonna go ahead and I'm
0:27:07 gonna take one of the Wings off with a
0:27:09 chainsaw all right it's got these
0:27:11 horrific flesh tone scales bone spurs
0:27:15 spreading from a snack
0:27:17 a mean of fingers I'm making this worse
0:27:22 for myself but I imagine some of the
0:27:23 scales are actually like faces yeah it's
0:27:26 like that's some Kingdom Death Punch oh
0:27:27 he's got hand parasites gotcha oh I mean
0:27:30 it's it's made its body out of people
0:27:33 yeah and it doesn't really see a reason
0:27:36 to hide that
0:27:38 Chinese tackles the difficulty five do I
0:27:40 have its back technically
0:27:42 yes you do a two-day bonus uh you are
0:27:46 aiming for a wing so it's another plus
0:27:48 two diff so uh you will go to diff seven
0:27:50 perfect
0:27:52 four successes to chop into a wing throw
0:27:56 roll over into damage targeting the wing
0:27:58 will avoid the levels of armor that it
0:28:01 possesses due to the scales
0:28:03 come on buddy seven levels of aggravated
0:28:06 damage on the dice
0:28:08 plus five more from potence is 12 levels
0:28:13 of aggravated damage to the wing
0:28:17 you grind the wing and it falls limp on
0:28:21 its shoulder and it looks towards you
0:28:23 angrily I imagine we have some acid to
0:28:25 dodge indeed you do you may burning
0:28:28 meaning action or you may roll soak
0:28:33 so here's the question
0:28:36 how much acid comes at me well it's not
0:28:41 just acid uh it's like fire it also
0:28:43 bleeds fire at you so is acid and Fire
0:28:46 coming at you is it proportional to the
0:28:49 damage dealt
0:28:51 so one of these you get to dodge
0:28:56 uh which is the acid uh the acid is a
0:28:59 it's a it's a bit of egg some damage uh
0:29:02 the fire is gonna be terrible but I
0:29:04 could skip them both by spending an
0:29:06 action you can skip the acid okay I'm
0:29:09 taking the fire regardless yep [ __ ] it
0:29:11 let's let's just go through acid and
0:29:13 fire and then I'm Gonna Save I'm Gonna
0:29:15 Save my other action to cut off the
0:29:16 other wing
0:29:17 so these are separate silk rolls correct
0:29:22 one egg for acid
0:29:25 damn all right take no damage
0:29:26 unnecessary amounts of of successes
0:29:29 maybe you can use that on the next roll
0:29:31 uh the other one is four levels of
0:29:33 aggravated damage because of the heat of
0:29:36 the fire
0:29:37 uh this is a diff9 soak can I just use
0:29:40 the one that I just had
0:29:41 I'm afraid not can I spend a willpower
0:29:44 on this you may not spend what part of
0:29:46 the circle okay just
0:29:49 what happens if I'm tough as Nails can I
0:29:51 stand Through Fire uh yeah with that
0:29:54 Countess Twos for your fortitude so girl
0:29:56 four successes to soak
0:29:59 you eat that fire and roll your ground
0:30:09 lights up
0:30:10 I got a dragon to kill Shawnee is now
0:30:14 drenched an acid and dragon's blood and
0:30:18 is on fire uh your armor is gone
0:30:20 understood uh and why don't you roll me
0:30:22 a dive for that chainsaw all right get
0:30:24 out of the boat
0:30:27 nine all right uh you avoid letting the
0:30:31 chainsaw get splashed by the acid slash
0:30:34 fire
0:30:35 [Music]
0:30:38 question uh more of a meta question if I
0:30:42 shoot the things up there will I prevent
0:30:44 more of them from coming down this next
0:30:46 round uh yes they will roll into future
0:30:48 d-generals there are individuals who are
0:30:51 helping you do that uh you are currently
0:30:53 receiving aid incidentally from both
0:30:56 shrike and Eagle okay who are also one
0:31:00 is firing a grenade launcher up into
0:31:02 them that like bursts with fire and
0:31:05 another one is firing a fully automatic
0:31:07 assault rifle
0:31:08 um fire to the rain and a little oddly
0:31:11 the blonde one has a matching trench
0:31:14 coat right uh yes tibretta
0:31:19 currently firing a grenade launcher uh
0:31:21 has blonde hair that's like slicked back
0:31:24 uh right now a pair of sunglasses to
0:31:27 protect himself from the waves of fire
0:31:28 being generated by his grenade launcher
0:31:30 and is wearing a black trench coat
0:31:35 uh he looks like he's having a great
0:31:38 time
0:31:40 if I ended up catching his eye during
0:31:42 this part I give him a knot and it gives
0:31:45 you a nod
0:31:46 this is going to this Aid is going to
0:31:49 come in the form of an additional eight
0:31:51 dice tier tackles to them so that sounds
0:31:53 I need still need to shoot it got it
0:31:57 so seven eight okay don't make one
0:32:01 damage roll again
0:32:03 the grenade launcher effectively just
0:32:05 kills what it hits so no reasonable
0:32:07 damage point
0:32:08 that'll be three successes okay now
0:32:11 since we're here we may as well get out
0:32:13 of the way why don't you roll me uh how
0:32:15 many of them will be dropping to the
0:32:16 ground on run two this can be two d10
0:32:20 13 okay so far only five of them will be
0:32:24 dropping to the ground how many Clips
0:32:26 did I managed to get before I have to
0:32:27 beg for British gun
0:32:29 you got one left that's what I figured
0:32:31 wait
0:32:33 miles
0:32:38 gone I have another pistol that doesn't
0:32:40 change my question okay I am totally
0:32:43 fine with you just chucking your gun
0:32:45 over your shoulder towards miles while
0:32:47 you're on your way to go fight oh no I I
0:32:49 take it and I press it over here
0:32:55 I grab it and quickly stole it in my
0:32:58 waistband much the similar as you do
0:33:01 all right that is Miles
0:33:04 Johnny Celerity action two oh sorry
0:33:07 Britta Celerity action too you didn't
0:33:09 burn yours yeah yeah I'd like to back up
0:33:11 and
0:33:13 Fredo will try to shoot
0:33:15 in a similar location to where Johnny
0:33:17 shot before learning from him that that
0:33:21 might help bypass that scaly armor on
0:33:24 the other side go ahead and give me a
0:33:25 roll basically you get the other Wings
0:33:27 started the gravity of the situation has
0:33:30 her shaking but she points her gun
0:33:35 it's a single success
0:33:38 three successes the rounds start tearing
0:33:40 into its wing Johnny will finish the job
0:33:44 Brutus started he spins around
0:33:47 using the uh the gripping fingers on its
0:33:50 back to give his feet purchase the
0:33:53 torques in his in spot and chops at the
0:33:57 other wing
0:33:58 foreign
0:33:59 successes to hit okay uh with eight
0:34:02 successes seven will carry over into
0:34:04 damage okay so six strength four from
0:34:07 the chainsaw seven carrying over an
0:34:09 additional four from the uh Magic
0:34:12 it's like my full auto roll I'm gonna
0:34:15 hold your box we are actually hating the
0:34:17 point where Garrett cannot hold more
0:34:19 dice
0:34:21 that's I see five zeros
0:34:25 oh my God
0:34:28 it's like my silk roll plus five 19
0:34:31 levels of aggravated damage
0:34:33 [Music]
0:34:36 how's it looking it howls in pain with a
0:34:41 sound that shakes the shame tree but
0:34:44 also ass and fire
0:34:48 watch on NASA damage
0:34:52 he's getting good at that
0:34:54 three egg coming from the fire
0:34:56 if nine uh it is difficulty 96. uh I
0:35:00 only soak a single point of the fire so
0:35:04 I will take two levels of aggravated
0:35:05 damage from the fire it takes an
0:35:07 extraction at the end of the round uh
0:35:09 win it ferociously attempts to bite you
0:35:12 in half
0:35:13 [Music]
0:35:17 foreign
0:35:27 eight
0:35:28 that is versus 12 levels of aggravated
0:35:31 damage remember those four going to the
0:35:33 shirt first so Winton still has all her
0:35:35 health levels plus one did you take
0:35:38 damage like a superhero her shirt just
0:35:40 gets torn yep
0:35:42 but it's very aesthetic around her
0:35:45 muscles
0:35:47 so wins eyes she still has protein eyes
0:35:50 up and she sees this massive mouth
0:35:55 coming at her and she just throws her
0:35:59 arms in front of her face and around her
0:36:02 torso whatever Parts she can reach her
0:36:04 fingers extended so her claws provide
0:36:06 Extra cover and she feels the teeth
0:36:09 skip around
0:36:11 the hardness of her skin and bones as
0:36:15 one power of change versus another power
0:36:17 of change meat and almost bounce off one
0:36:21 another
0:36:22 as the mouth pulls back just a little
0:36:25 wind just kind of looks at the dragon
0:36:28 and maybe only Ira can understand when
0:36:32 she says
0:36:35 let me rage before I die as you finish
0:36:39 saying those words
0:36:41 it gulps and swallows you into it
0:36:47 Ira round two
0:36:51 [Music]
0:36:53 she's on the inside huh she sure is I
0:36:56 cannot see her anymore uh adjust
0:36:59 Johnny's initiative down three points
0:37:03 please so reflexively the start of his
0:37:05 turn Ira is going to spend some blood
0:37:09 and look over at the Seneschal who is
0:37:13 covered in Fire and acid and screaming
0:37:17 Dragon bits uh with a chainsaw
0:37:21 the sheriff's inside don't don't get
0:37:24 distracted now
0:37:26 you've got this and I'm going to use
0:37:28 centering because apparently this is a
0:37:30 reality where I'm okay with quietly
0:37:33 doing some Buffs
0:37:36 for the next six rounds you may not ever
0:37:39 take dice penalties uh nothing will give
0:37:42 you any penalties to dice you're totally
0:37:43 immune to that uh difficulty penalties
0:37:45 yes dice penalties now uh and you are a
0:37:47 plus two against all forms of frenzy
0:37:49 that's probably a good thing as Ira says
0:37:52 that you don't like narrow your focus
0:37:54 you just get that like centered calm of
0:37:57 like
0:37:58 time to get the job done you were in
0:37:59 your element you're in the zone it's
0:38:01 literally like yes I'm in the zone now
0:38:03 so that's reflexive then I will also
0:38:04 like spend for dual thought and then
0:38:06 because he's getting covered in [ __ ]
0:38:07 fire and [ __ ] I'm already here you have
0:38:10 the remnants of like armor Eden's got
0:38:12 your jacket right but like you've got
0:38:14 the redness of armor and stuff on yep so
0:38:16 I will harden that yes
0:38:19 burning strips of cloth he's largely
0:38:21 bare chested at this point if he's
0:38:23 largely bare chested this might not
0:38:25 actually work he's still got pants right
0:38:26 he's still got pants all right are in
0:38:29 contact with the dragon you can't burn
0:38:30 Levi's I'm gonna Harden those Levi's
0:38:33 yeah
0:38:35 I know what I said
0:38:37 I appreciate it Garrett your Levi's gain
0:38:39 five levels of Health
0:38:43 uh and then for my second action on top
0:38:45 of that Lex I have a question I have
0:38:48 thumb side up and Reiss had said that
0:38:50 influences start coming through the
0:38:53 circle at the node right yes I thought
0:38:56 I'm set up is that still happening is
0:38:58 there like energy leaking through the
0:39:00 node into the Chantry yeah if we destroy
0:39:04 the node which is something that they
0:39:05 don't generally want to do will that
0:39:07 stop that leak event will that help to
0:39:09 slow or stop that leak of energy or do I
0:39:11 have no [ __ ] idea I mean you
0:39:13 definitely get the impression that this
0:39:15 thing is drawing energy
0:39:19 from the node and is much more active
0:39:22 and aware and capable of doing things
0:39:25 because of that in the past even talking
0:39:28 to this quotery all of their past
0:39:30 stories about this thing is nothing like
0:39:33 this veto Druid here this node is
0:39:37 allowing it to behave in very new ways
0:39:41 and it's becoming exponentially worse a
0:39:45 node is not something I can destroy like
0:39:47 that's not something you can get rid of
0:39:48 because that's just a natural byproduct
0:39:50 Ley lines and stuff right yeah it would
0:39:51 take a lot of effort to do that but
0:39:54 what I guess what I'm asking is do I
0:39:56 have reason to believe that destroying
0:39:58 the ritual Circle there or at least
0:40:00 [ __ ] it up would cut off that flood
0:40:03 of energy from the node the flow of
0:40:05 energy would probably become
0:40:06 significantly less refined because the
0:40:08 point of that is to help with like high
0:40:10 ritual performances and channel the
0:40:13 energy of the node into purpose right
0:40:16 now that purpose is a gin horrible
0:40:18 monster that's like and the other thing
0:40:20 is standing in a pool of water yes I've
0:40:23 seen that yeah I'm aware of the water I
0:40:25 don't want to [ __ ] around though because
0:40:26 Johnny's riding it
0:40:28 um
0:40:28 let's do this I mean I'm thinking about
0:40:31 it uh but the first thing I'm gonna do
0:40:32 is it's in late it's the inlays and [ __ ]
0:40:36 that that Focus everything correct I am
0:40:39 going to look at one of the Rings and
0:40:41 I'm because it's in water it's actually
0:40:44 going to help a lot here because it's
0:40:45 splashing around I'm going to liquefy
0:40:47 the metal rings with the path of
0:40:49 transmutation sounds good and because I
0:40:52 really need this to work well I'm going
0:40:53 to spend a willpower
0:40:55 seven successes and five successes is
0:40:58 enough to melt a freight train car or a
0:41:01 train freight car so you easily
0:41:03 accomplish this and I'm hoping with the
0:41:05 water splashing around that it will just
0:41:06 obliterate this circle I mean the share
0:41:08 weight of it and you look behind the
0:41:10 form it's done and hopefully that starts
0:41:12 to cut stuff off a little bit after Ira
0:41:15 goes It goes
0:41:17 miles that's a psychic assault for you
0:41:19 iron will apply yes it does
0:41:24 assume tens don't count for two four
0:41:26 successes five successes you resist
0:41:30 the power of miles's ego is too much
0:41:34 there's not enough room in this giant
0:41:36 chamber for my ego you might be a dragon
0:41:38 but you're just a dragon question I hate
0:41:43 to ask it yeah what's up this
0:41:46 intimidation count do I have minus six
0:41:48 dice on this roll oh yes uh oh yeah
0:41:51 sorry buddy
0:41:53 um I thought he was just for one action
0:41:55 my next action against it yes
0:41:59 that's wash
0:42:03 okay
0:42:05 miles you will lose all temporary will
0:42:07 power points and half of your permanent
0:42:10 willpower in addition to this you will
0:42:12 suffer three levels of lethal damage
0:42:14 which you may will soak against welcome
0:42:16 to the terrible Club
0:42:19 no I'm just gonna Roll
0:42:22 No More Words just emotions yes that's
0:42:25 so good like seven eight okay miles what
0:42:30 you doing I reload shouting last clip
0:42:33 quick rule get at least one success
0:42:35 reload is good
0:42:37 question with multiple people helping me
0:42:40 do I need to full auto to hit multiple
0:42:42 targets yes
0:42:44 we're doing that
0:42:48 14 successes give me damage
0:42:53 four damage uh and that is going to
0:42:55 remove that many so what was that 14
0:42:59 right so I have nine to carry over nine
0:43:02 into the next round yep
0:43:08 the group that is with on the at the
0:43:12 right wing a few things happen one
0:43:16 the man of the trench coat pulls two
0:43:19 magazines from the vest that he's
0:43:22 wearing and hurls them to miles
0:43:25 excellent second
0:43:27 a man with thin lips and a mouth that is
0:43:31 far too wide for his face
0:43:34 throws his head back and lets out this
0:43:38 blood curdling scream and this whale
0:43:43 reverberates through the underworld
0:43:46 and when he lets out this scream
0:43:49 he manipulates probability shifting
0:43:51 entropy in favor of the group and all of
0:43:54 his teeth show right and his teeth arose
0:43:57 of shark teeth
0:43:59 but I'm gonna let you decide among the
0:44:01 PCS up to three of you you may have a
0:44:05 re-roll
0:44:06 when
0:44:07 Johnny Miles okay each of you has a
0:44:11 floating rule that you may use at any
0:44:12 point there is one more action that is
0:44:15 taken among them
0:44:16 the one who seemed like they weren't
0:44:18 actually doing very much for the
0:44:20 fighting is this very kind of small
0:44:23 woman with some Middle Eastern descent
0:44:27 and some of her skin
0:44:29 ashes and flows away from her particles
0:44:33 just kind of like drift away from her
0:44:36 like ashes on the breeze as wounds start
0:44:40 to manifest
0:44:42 and as she does
0:44:44 the fire
0:44:45 the mass of these huge gray tick-like
0:44:49 hunks of Flesh and bone this monster
0:44:53 that you are confronted with by
0:44:56 and even the water that flows from the
0:44:59 pipes down onto the main ritual Circle
0:45:03 itself everything
0:45:06 slows to a stop
0:45:10 and in the midst of the fight
0:45:12 the group of you find
0:45:15 yourselves paused and outside the flow
0:45:19 of time
0:45:23 you guys have a handful of rounds
0:45:26 within this space of time
0:45:30 what do you do
0:45:36 Britta is not going to wait on the flow
0:45:39 of time even if it's pause but I will
0:45:42 walk up to Eden extend out a can of Mace
0:45:46 and say I'm sorry but can I trade you
0:45:49 for that knife she nods very disoriented
0:45:53 by what's going on
0:45:54 and offers you your enough Britta is
0:45:57 disoriented nauseous but she takes the
0:46:00 knife and runs as fast as she can over
0:46:03 to try and cut one out or help if she's
0:46:06 cutting herself out from the inside I
0:46:08 don't know why don't you roll me a
0:46:09 dextrose melee every success you get
0:46:11 will give her a plus one day bonus
0:46:14 difficulty five does graceful count nah
0:46:19 no this is kind of yeah eating yeah
0:46:21 that's perfectly Fair it's just always
0:46:23 uh you know worth asking everything I
0:46:26 rolled except for One Singular four is a
0:46:29 five or over so hang on eight okay
0:46:31 you'll give win a extra dice British
0:46:35 trying to maybe like direct it based on
0:46:38 what she's seen of how this acid and
0:46:40 fire sprays now weird thing as you dig
0:46:43 against it its body is unaffected
0:46:47 for now wait I don't know if you could
0:46:48 hear me but I'm cutting so maybe follow
0:46:51 this cut how much of that can I hear all
0:46:53 of it inside this creature's eerily
0:46:55 silent right now miles looks around as
0:46:57 he grabs the two clips goes I think time
0:47:00 has stopped again Johnny cries out for
0:47:03 when Johnny I'm gonna need a frenzy
0:47:04 check yeah I think so you're at a minus
0:47:07 two difficulty for bringing a Brujah a
0:47:08 plus two uh sorry I had a plus two
0:47:10 difficulty for being a bra mine is too
0:47:12 difficult if you're being centered fifth
0:47:13 six
0:47:18 uh one success
0:47:20 manages to hold himself together there
0:47:23 is a damn sound that carries oddly in
0:47:27 the very still air and when wins voice
0:47:30 just yells no heart go for the head to
0:47:34 knock how much time she looks at you and
0:47:36 more Ash wafts away from her flesh
0:47:40 nine
0:47:42 seconds Johnny lets out a roar that
0:47:46 sounds like he is barely holding back
0:47:49 his Beast the chainsaw Roars with him
0:47:52 and he begins to try to hack his way
0:47:55 through the back of its neck towards
0:47:57 whatever is the on the inside of this
0:48:00 thing get her out thank you canades hemo
0:48:04 explosives anything
0:48:05 tricks even behind the sunglasses
0:48:07 because we're high in senses you can see
0:48:09 that he's rolling his eyes yeah yeah
0:48:11 hold on Ira is looking at the other
0:48:14 group at the Frozen time just extremely
0:48:17 suspiciously but starting to put the
0:48:19 math together as best as he can Lex
0:48:21 there are pipes that go up you said they
0:48:23 all Confluence into the one area right
0:48:25 where the nest is yes taking advantage
0:48:28 of like the lull he looks down at Eden
0:48:31 look out for a second and he's gonna
0:48:34 grab one of the nearby pipes and like
0:48:35 metal pipes on the wall and just send
0:48:38 tens of thousands of volts up into that
0:48:41 nest and I will dump all of my
0:48:43 electricity into it and then I will put
0:48:45 up more and I will dump all of that back
0:48:47 into it give me uh 14 dice of damage uh
0:48:50 you may apply it to all of them oh it's
0:48:51 touch so it's 15. go for it wow it's all
0:48:54 Frozen do I get any bonus Dice from this
0:48:55 being like water pipes and stuff that is
0:48:58 what is going to allow you to apply the
0:48:59 damage to all of them sick uh they would
0:49:02 normally be able to kind of just move
0:49:04 away from the pipes but they don't have
0:49:05 that opportunity
0:49:07 that is 13 lethal uh nothing happens to
0:49:10 them nothing yet men with a wide fin
0:49:14 mouth with a horrible sharp Fangs for
0:49:18 teeth he draws a silver dagger and
0:49:21 presses the tip towards his chest and
0:49:24 looks to those who he is accompanied I
0:49:27 am going to take us out of here and the
0:49:29 woman who is in the process of slowly
0:49:31 ashing maintaining this effect looks at
0:49:34 him wide-eyed like him doing that might
0:49:37 disrupt what she's trying to accomplish
0:49:39 here and Eagle uh rests his hand on the
0:49:42 shoulder of Phantom and Phantom by
0:49:45 virtue of having Eagles making contact
0:49:48 with him rethinks his decision and
0:49:51 decides to hold off at least for now
0:49:53 strike with the individual with the
0:49:55 trench coat and sunglasses pulls his
0:49:57 duffel bag off of Eagle's shoulder and
0:50:00 you'll kind of you know emotions that
0:50:02 you seem to work very well together and
0:50:04 he hurls this bag towards the group uh
0:50:08 it lands with a lot of clunk wind spins
0:50:11 a blood to beef her dexterity taking it
0:50:13 to a seven for the round and she
0:50:16 she tries to find where Britta was
0:50:20 making like where the bullets hit like
0:50:22 was there any impact on the inside was
0:50:24 she was digging with a knife okay and
0:50:26 you can you can hear where she's coming
0:50:28 from pretty okay well and she will dig
0:50:31 her claws in pushing them in as far as
0:50:34 she can give me an attack roll Brothers
0:50:37 helped you so you may enjoy the benefits
0:50:39 of her eight successes as bonus dice
0:50:42 yeah five up they'll be ten nine and
0:50:46 dice will carry over to damage
0:50:50 that'll be 13x
0:50:56 soaked two and when inside the gullet of
0:50:59 this monster she will rage before she
0:51:02 dies but that doesn't mean she wants to
0:51:05 die
0:51:06 she needs to die in a way
0:51:08 that she will see someone again
0:51:11 dying to a
0:51:13 horrifying Dragon older than the bones
0:51:16 of the Earth
0:51:17 to save the people she loves the most
0:51:20 and the child who could save the world
0:51:22 might be
0:51:24 just enough to do it
0:51:27 but also ripping the throat out of a
0:51:29 giant dragon might just get some more
0:51:32 Gangrel to come to the domain
0:51:33 [Laughter]
0:51:40 all she
0:51:41 can her horrifying boots which are their
0:51:45 own toxic monstrosity and rending this
0:51:50 the Flesh of this Beast
0:51:53 she grabs everything that looks vital on
0:51:56 her way towards Britta Johnny so deck six
0:52:01 no wound penalties because of magic two
0:52:05 dice cause I have its back four dice
0:52:07 because of melee and I have no extra
0:52:12 Celerity currently yep
0:52:15 [Music]
0:52:19 holy [ __ ] today's a day
0:52:22 all those bad rolls saved up for today
0:52:27 I'm actually not targeting anything
0:52:30 other than the back of its head so I'm
0:52:32 not at penalties right you're just at
0:52:34 diff five ten successes to hit okay nine
0:52:38 will uh carry over into damage
0:52:43 no one's no one bro
0:52:49 so it's 12 successes plus five from
0:52:52 potence so that's 17 aggravated damage
0:52:55 [Music]
0:53:00 okay miles what are you doing I will
0:53:03 take the bag that has thrown and I will
0:53:05 take it to insert into the dragon's
0:53:08 mouth cannot resist you
0:53:11 and then
0:53:13 um on myself if I get in there no
0:53:15 problem on my Celerity actions I will
0:53:17 start helping Britta the same thing with
0:53:20 good talent
0:53:29 uh it is frozen in the moment
0:53:37 very abruptly
0:53:39 the man with the Eerie smile the one
0:53:41 that took you from your parents thrust
0:53:44 the knife into his heart
0:53:46 and when he does
0:53:48 hem and the rest of his team save you
0:53:52 vanish
0:53:54 time continues on and there is
0:53:59 an explosion of blinding lightning
0:54:02 drawer Galore wind bursts from this
0:54:07 thing's throat and collarbone and Johnny
0:54:09 Fells the Beast I need to roll a lot of
0:54:12 aggravated damage relax
0:54:16 it was my intention because I am
0:54:19 thinking extremely fast I do not know
0:54:21 everyone's weights but to use my actions
0:54:23 to yank people mentally away from this
0:54:26 [ __ ] thing you may choose one person
0:54:28 uh how much does Johnny weigh it does he
0:54:31 weigh more than 200 pounds right now it
0:54:33 certainly does uh then Brenna who was
0:54:36 digging with a knife I will because
0:54:39 you're like right [ __ ] there right
0:54:40 and bread is very light so she can be
0:54:43 moving I am going to with my mind just
0:54:46 yank her probably not gracefully because
0:54:49 this is like a panic motion absolutely
0:54:51 not away from like the [ __ ] Gore on
0:54:54 fire better yeah you're confronted with
0:54:56 a wave of acid and fire but you are
0:54:58 yanked away from it before it makes
0:55:01 contact with your flesh there is a
0:55:03 little scream as Britta isn't sure what
0:55:06 grabbed her but she's actually been this
0:55:08 power's been used on her before so past
0:55:10 the Panic there's a slight sense of
0:55:11 familiarity the creatures up above
0:55:14 Sizzle and Crackle with uh being
0:55:17 scorched by the uh lightning and win and
0:55:23 Johnny and miles are blast with a wave
0:55:27 of this acid unless you have a spare
0:55:29 action for the Run still
0:55:31 okay uh you can make a roll through
0:55:33 avoid that ah the fire you cannot this
0:55:36 thing the flesh uh the the fungus it's
0:55:40 fiery blood is consuming everything and
0:55:45 this room is starting to burn wildly out
0:55:47 of control I will need a courage test
0:55:50 from everyone to not enterotrek if you
0:55:53 are affected by such things
0:55:55 um and I'm going to be rolling some
0:55:57 damage uh for those who are in the area
0:56:01 of the fiery blood
0:56:06 uh Johnny remember you get plus two dice
0:56:08 from centering
0:56:09 can we spend a willpower you may
0:56:13 better what'd you get for the courage
0:56:15 roll Britta got four successes she
0:56:18 recently lost her cool to Fire and built
0:56:21 up a bit of Bravery from that this time
0:56:23 you're ready miles one success and
0:56:25 courage you hold on Buddy don't like
0:56:27 fire

0:56:36 Johnny six successes it's just fire to
0:56:39 you Eden does not rush Rick and everyone
0:56:41 rolls uh silk versus AG at difficulty
0:56:44 nine everyone everyone that is being
0:56:46 burned by fire and so you and Britta are
0:56:48 fine uh four successes for the fire so
