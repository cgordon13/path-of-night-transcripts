0:00:37 last time on path of night miles
0:00:39 promised win that he wouldn't interfere
0:00:41 with the justicar binding wind into
0:00:43 service Yan petersun told miles he had
0:00:45 realized how the camaria had been lying
0:00:47 to him peterzon gifted miles a powerful
0:00:50 sword before slipping away Johnny and
0:00:52 Neil's conversation was interrupted by a
0:00:54 surprise Mass Gathering of mcavans they
0:00:57 talked about Kenna the Masquerade and
0:00:59 the possibility petun and the vios
0:01:01 bringing the caman saat together against
0:01:03 the Ancients Clan malavan offered their
0:01:05 support to me and he requested that they
0:01:07 try to free win of her blood bond to Luc
0:01:09 send Roman Pendragon demanded BR not
0:01:12 fighting the war for New Haven having
0:01:14 killed someone to secure her Freedom BR
0:01:16 refused asking instead to just spend the
0:01:18 night
0:01:20 [Music]
0:01:28 together
0:01:32 an alarm goes
0:01:33 off one that is pressed to your ear that
0:01:38 you have kept with you in the
0:01:41 bed and you wake up miles do you spend
0:01:44 the point of w power to awaken yeah you
0:01:47 look around and the room is just about
0:01:50 Pitch Black only the slightest smallest
0:01:55 rays of sunlight pierce the very edges
0:01:58 of the massive curtains that blot out
0:02:01 the
0:02:02 sun knowing I don't have long I
0:02:07 will cut my arm on the sword that I am
0:02:10 holding and I will feed it to Wynn when is
0:02:15 curled up on her side she's under some
0:02:18 blankets but her face is probably poking
0:02:21 out she seems to sleep with her mouth
0:02:24 just slightly open maybe hoping for bugs
0:02:26 or something who really knows but with
0:02:28 some aim you're able to get the blood
0:02:31 into her mouth unless I wake up at some
0:02:34 point when feels
0:02:38 cold slick fingers press between her
0:02:43 lips and starts to awaken to the taste
0:02:48 of
0:02:49 V when are you spending a point of
0:02:52 willpower to
0:02:54 wake if it comes up the fairy I'm
0:02:56 spending the willpower coints it is
0:03:00 she spends the willpower your eyes open
0:03:04 and you can feel the hand pressed
0:03:06 against your chin and the fingers delved
0:03:08 into her mouth Kabir stop it she's
0:03:12 probably not super awake when she says
0:03:14 that and she blinks a few times and just
0:03:17 starts like pushing slapping away at the
0:03:20 intruding
0:03:22 digits I will do the command for drink
0:03:27 which I can do because I am touching her
0:03:29 you're you in dominate as well roll it
0:03:32 current willpower my current willpower I
0:03:34 believe is
0:03:37 four 11 successes so tell me is this
0:03:42 like traditionally portrayed hypnosis
0:03:45 where head empty just follows command no
0:03:48 recollection or is this oh God miles
0:03:51 just told me to do a thing and my body
0:03:52 is complying it's as they say number two
0:03:56 drink wind's eyes fly open wider as she
0:04:02 like bites down on his fingers and
0:04:04 starts sucking the blood from his
0:04:07 fingers after a point of bet I'm going
0:04:09 to put her to
0:04:11 sleep nine successes sleep she falls
0:04:16 [Music]
0:04:19 asleep night
0:04:21 falls Miles
0:04:24 when you awaken to an alarm clock on the
0:04:29 floor
0:04:30 and the two of you snuggled up very
0:04:32 close in the bed I believe it it's time
0:04:35 to get
0:04:38 up and winds kind of realizes where she
0:04:41 is and like on Instinct like pushes
0:04:45 herself away from him and jumps out of
0:04:48 bed still wearing her camisol and
0:04:51 Underpants eyes flying wide what did you
0:04:54 do miles what did you do I am taking
0:05:00 responsibility how you said they would
0:05:02 get hurt I will be the
0:05:04 one when glares at him panicking and
0:05:10 clamps her jaw tighter miles
0:05:16 it's the time for you to be responsible
0:05:19 is not now it it's too late with all
0:05:22 those lectures and everything else I've
0:05:25 decided that I needed to be responsible
0:05:27 but also I'm not
0:05:30 I'm not giving
0:05:32 in
0:05:35 Miles this won't protect them it will
0:05:40 this might actually damn
0:05:42 them we can fix this
0:05:45 problem and Wynn just kind of like slumps
0:05:48 in a chair and holds her
0:05:50 head because realistically at this point
0:05:53 there's only so much she can argue with
0:05:55 Miles she wants to argue but even more
0:05:58 she wants to believe he's
0:06:01 right I see her kind of give up which is
0:06:05 super
0:06:07 weird I understand and I know you're
0:06:12 afraid of what they will do I am more
0:06:15 afraid of the things that they've
0:06:16 already
0:06:17 done I know the
0:06:19 Ventrue and I know you have some
0:06:24 Mission and we we are not talking about
0:06:27 it and I'm not asking you any questions
0:06:28 about it thank you but we are not simply
0:06:34 going to just allow others to come into
0:06:37 this territory and tell us what to do
0:06:42 and what if they kill me for this
0:06:45 miles would you rather the
0:06:48 alternative I would rather my death have
0:06:50 meaning it will not just be another tool
0:06:53 they throw
0:06:55 away yeah well they're kind of pissing
0:06:58 me off and and we have been doing
0:07:01 everything to uphold what they want and
0:07:04 this is what they're doing so I am
0:07:07 not not happy is an underselling of this
0:07:12 so so you're willing to sacrifice my
0:07:16 life
0:07:18 no what do you think she's going to do
0:07:21 if she finds out you've compromised
0:07:24 me don't let her find out not an option
0:07:28 buddy
0:07:30 don't volunteer information you don't
0:07:32 have to well obviously I'm not going to
0:07:34 do
0:07:37 that as a clan
0:07:40 we're very
0:07:43 arrogant this is my shocked face yeah I
0:07:46 know anyways did she ask you any
0:07:49 questions about your previous blood
0:07:50 bonds or anything no so she doesn't
0:07:53 know if you may or may not be
0:07:58 bonded I think it's a trap that she put
0:08:00 us in a room
0:08:03 together sometimes you have to Spring a
0:08:06 trap with me as the bait I'm pretty
0:08:11 sure that I am still the person being
0:08:14 affected here miles I'm trying to put
0:08:17 this to you
0:08:20 delicately you at least are regarded in
0:08:23 the point that you have a Target on
0:08:26 you they don't care what happens to me
0:08:31 there is strategic value in
0:08:35 you there's a value to all of us and
0:08:39 keeping this together at least for the
0:08:43 siege is in their best interest and they
0:08:46 know
0:08:50 it that gives us time very
0:08:54 hectic time but it is a time and it'll
0:08:58 be our time
0:09:04 this is why I
0:09:07 never this is why I never wanted to
0:09:09 blood Bond anybody this is why I never
0:09:12 did hard drugs for the same reason that
0:09:15 like I can't make my own decisions now
0:09:18 you
0:09:19 think I didn't want to do this either I
0:09:21 don't even like using dominate on people
0:09:24 that much and now you've done both on me
0:09:27 yes I understand
0:09:32 I
0:09:34 know and they were not options I wanted
0:09:37 to do what's the closest blood Bond
0:09:40 you've ever had fully to who my
0:09:45 sire did that wear off
0:09:49 yes how long did it
0:09:53 take over a
0:09:56 year when puts her head back in her
0:09:58 hands her braid kind of slips off her
0:10:01 shoulder hangs down by her
0:10:05 face miles I can't physically cannot
0:10:09 tell you what a desperate move this is I
0:10:13 understand we're it's a desperate move
0:10:15 but we are at a place where we have
0:10:18 Desperate moves we need to get out of
0:10:21 this
0:10:22 Council as whole as
0:10:27 possible it almost sounded like you said
0:10:29 that
0:10:31 [ __ ] miles just makes a
0:10:34 face get ready for a lot more of this I
0:10:37 have prepared myself to be the Martyr
0:10:40 well I'm your sinine eater so I guess
0:10:41 you can be the Martyr then sounds
0:10:45 great we're going to do everything in
0:10:47 our
0:10:48 power to both live and to piss these
0:10:51 people
0:10:53 off there's a little Quirk of a smile at
0:10:56 the corner of wind's
0:10:58 mouth I think I rubbed off on you more
0:11:01 than just tonight I've been operating
0:11:03 under these paradigms for a
0:11:06 while I don't like being messed with and
0:11:08 I don't like the people that I associate
0:11:11 being messed
0:11:13 with I did tell you
0:11:18 so
0:11:19 so glossing right over it perfect let's
0:11:22 do
0:11:23 [Laughter]
0:11:27 this are you in for a second
0:11:31 there's almost An
0:11:34 Itch in wind's brain at the suggestion
0:11:38 that she could have another
0:11:41 hit she wants to think this through
0:11:45 rationally but sometimes
0:11:48 when when you want a corn dog nothing
0:11:51 else is going to do you just need the
0:11:53 corn
0:11:55 dog and
0:11:57 she looks like she wants him to tell
0:12:01 her that it's not a
0:12:05 choice the look on her
0:12:07 face says make
0:12:10 me but instead she just
0:12:15 nods he moves over and offers up his
0:12:20 arm
0:12:23 she kind of puts
0:12:25 her puts a hand on his wrist puts a hand
0:12:28 on his elbow
0:12:30 and she puts her mouth down like she's
0:12:31 about to bite and she looks up at him
0:12:34 like
0:12:35 genuinely with
0:12:37 concern like don't freak out but
0:12:39 remember that I have rattlesnake
0:12:42 fangs I'm familiar he says remembering
0:12:46 last night and she puts her fangs
0:12:53 in on the next night those who are
0:12:57 operating out of
0:12:59 Pendragon's Haven they're coming and
0:13:02 going there's equipment that's now being
0:13:06 moved about you start seeing more and
0:13:08 more of these brewha wearing
0:13:12 tacar and when as you wander the
0:13:17 hallways at this point uh are you
0:13:20 looking for anyone what are you looking
0:13:21 to
0:13:22 do when's head is no longer really on
0:13:28 straight
0:13:54 [Music]
0:14:29 and hopes that Johnny is in the middle
0:14:31 of
0:14:32 it you find him sitting on a uh small
0:14:36 little decorative couch tucked against
0:14:39 one of the one of the walls Johnny seems
0:14:41 to has posted up next to a little
0:14:42 ashtray and is just kind of watching the
0:14:45 goings on of Pendragon's base of
0:14:50 operations he seems to kind of be
0:14:53 somewhat relaxed and just kind
0:14:55 of waiting
0:14:58 for this to come to an
0:15:02 end hey
0:15:04 um she says approaching
0:15:07 him you look like you've been having an
0:15:09 awful night I've been having a shitty
0:15:12 night actually so that's probably a
0:15:13 compliment believe it or
0:15:15 not um cigarettes outside I've been
0:15:19 smoking them inside are you saying you
0:15:21 want to go outside yes please all right
0:15:24 gets up off the couch kind of shakes out
0:15:27 his clothes puts his uh leather jacket
0:15:30 on kind of nods to you all right lead
0:15:33 the way when finds a patio or something
0:15:37 just some kind of exterior door where
0:15:39 there's unlikely to be a lot of foot
0:15:41 traffic heads outside shuts the door
0:15:44 behind them reaches out for a cigarette
0:15:47 once I've got
0:15:48 a I don't know paycheck I'll get you
0:15:52 another
0:15:53 pack don't you worry about this this is
0:15:56 my gift to you yeah uh puts him orally
0:16:00 in his own mouth waits for you to have
0:16:01 one in yours and then he flicks open his
0:16:03 Zippo to light both the cigarettes at
0:16:06 the same time she does she follows along
0:16:10 so they both lean in light off the same
0:16:12 flame and then he puts Clacks the zipo
0:16:15 back shut and leans back after taking a
0:16:18 long
0:16:19 drag so what's on your mind too much she
0:16:23 kind of like takes a big drag from the
0:16:26 cigarette and lets it out slow seemingly
0:16:29 buying some time to again put thoughts
0:16:32 into
0:16:34 words Johnny
0:16:37 how how long would you say that you were
0:16:39 with your daughter before unlife
0:16:45 intervened use any unit of measure you
0:16:47 think
0:16:49 appropriate she
0:16:52 was she had just turned n years
0:16:57 old when kind of
0:16:59 seems to do some mental math and decides
0:17:01 it's not worth
0:17:03 it it's a big
0:17:05 number she had turned nine right in the
0:17:09 beginning of
0:17:11 July and a few days later I had to go
0:17:15 out on a long drive out towards the
0:17:18 Chicago area and on the way back to the
0:17:21 Northeast I got way late at a truck
0:17:25 stop so she was N9 and a week old
0:17:30 it was uh July of
0:17:34 1990 I
0:17:37 don't
0:17:39 remember
0:17:41 exactly what day my daughter was
0:17:43 born but she died a minute
0:17:47 later
0:17:49 and there
0:17:51 is literally nothing in this world I
0:17:55 wouldn't do for even just one more
0:17:58 minute
0:18:01 Johnny
0:18:04 this you have a chance I
0:18:08 don't you have the option of more time
0:18:11 with your
0:18:12 child your
0:18:15 children and I don't care if you wait
0:18:17 until after this
0:18:21 Siege but you should not take that for
0:18:23 granted you should walk away from all
0:18:27 this and you should have whatever time
0:18:30 with them that you
0:18:32 can his jaw clenches a little
0:18:36 bit and he kind of stares down at his
0:18:43 boots it's tough being around them you
0:18:47 know it's got to be easier with Jessica
0:18:50 now no it's
0:18:54 not I spent a good long
0:18:57 time trying to figure out how to still
0:19:01 be in their
0:19:03 lives but a vampire is not something
0:19:07 that's good to have in a child's
0:19:10 life dad sure
0:19:13 is there's not a whole lot I wouldn't
0:19:15 have done to have him with me
0:19:18 either my
0:19:21 presence even if my kids wanted it even
0:19:24 if I wanted it was not a good thing for
0:19:27 them
0:19:30 I killed the boy that
0:19:33 Jessica went on a date
0:19:36 with you know
0:19:39 that I can't remember if you mentioned
0:19:41 that or
0:19:42 not it felt dishonest that you could
0:19:47 talk about your kids and I waited until
0:19:51 now to even talk out loud about mine
0:19:53 it's all
0:19:54 right but so much of what you went
0:19:57 through I got it
0:20:00 and it sucks there's nothing that sucks
0:20:02 more you know what also
0:20:06 sucks looking at your
0:20:08 children and thinking about how much you
0:20:10 miss
0:20:12 them and then having this Insidious
0:20:15 Beast inside you Whispering that they
0:20:19 would be easy pickings for
0:20:24 blood that is not a
0:20:27 conversation
0:20:29 that I like to have with
0:20:31 myself but every time I watched them
0:20:33 from
0:20:35 afar this sick thing inside me was just
0:20:38 saying go ahead they'd be with you
0:20:41 forever go ahead just eat them that came
0:20:43 when I watched my parents too which is
0:20:47 different I would rather watch the
0:20:51 sunrise than let my Beast anywhere near
0:20:54 my
0:20:57 children
0:21:00 my beast and my daughter were born at
0:21:02 the same
0:21:04 time I don't really have a basis for
0:21:12 comparison the man the sabat killed
0:21:15 deserves so much more time with his kids
0:21:19 when and I wish I was that man
0:21:25 still and I'm not sure if Jessica is
0:21:27 going to let me
0:21:29 be on the sidelines anymore from what
0:21:32 you've told me she's not and I think
0:21:35 that's my
0:21:36 fault when I killed that boy I did it in
0:21:39 front of
0:21:40 her I'm pretty sure I'm the one
0:21:42 responsible for the [ __ ] up situation
0:21:45 she's in
0:21:47 now whatever has awoken in her is my
0:21:52 fault and my daughter's dead because of
0:21:55 my
0:21:57 irresponsibility
0:22:00 I'm saying we're going to have regrets
0:22:02 no matter what if your regret would be
0:22:05 greater being with
0:22:08 them that's your
0:22:10 choice but you have a chance to not have
0:22:13 the same regrets that I do I just want
0:22:16 them to be safe
0:22:17 when and I didn't want you
0:22:21 to I don't know I guess before I'm not I
0:22:25 don't belong to this Coterie anymore how
0:22:28 do you figure
0:22:29 she said
0:22:30 so
0:22:32 who her
0:22:38 power so before I'm not
0:22:42 yours
0:22:43 anymore I wanted you to know that at
0:22:45 least one person in the Coterie gets
0:22:48 it Johnny reaches out and kind of like
0:22:51 grabs you by the base of the head and
0:22:54 pulls you in for like a just a be hug
0:22:57 win is more than willing squeezes you
0:23:00 with his powerful arms and just kind of
0:23:02 starts talking down into your
0:23:05 braid I don't care what the [ __ ] her
0:23:08 power says you are always
0:23:12 family the camaria can go to hell for as
0:23:15 far as far as I
0:23:18 care I stayed here because it gave me a
0:23:22 semblance of safety and control over
0:23:26 what I
0:23:27 was but if they're going to tear us
0:23:30 apart [ __ ]
0:23:33 them when kind of takes a stabilizing
0:23:38 breath it's already starting to sound
0:23:41 like your voice is further
0:23:42 away when you say the stuff like
0:23:46 that but I hear
0:23:50 you we got a huge fight ahead of
0:23:53 us chances
0:23:55 are either you or I could meet final
0:24:00 death in which case there's not a whole
0:24:03 lot of use crying about this I'm a
0:24:06 creature of
0:24:08 instinct if we're really lucky her power
0:24:12 will find F final death in this and I
0:24:14 won't be a whole lot of use worrying
0:24:17 about this but if the stars [ __ ]
0:24:21 align and you I our Coterie and her power
0:24:26 managed to make it through all this
0:24:29 [ __ ] I promise
0:24:32 you I will figure out a way to make sure
0:24:36 that you are wind cabbit master of her
0:24:41 own destiny I'll even [ __ ] go to the
0:24:44 ends of the world to learn some kind of
0:24:46 weird blood magic just to make sure that
0:24:49 you are
0:24:51 you when does laugh not because it's
0:24:55 funny but because she knows he would and
0:24:58 and she knows how much he hates Blood
0:25:00 magic and therefore she now has a metric
0:25:03 for how much he loves
0:25:05 her her family then he gives her a big
0:25:09 loud smacking kiss on the top of her
0:25:12 head and squeezes her tight she Ruffles
0:25:14 his hair and does the
0:25:20 same br's eyes snap
0:25:24 open as a new night begins and she
0:25:28 channels the power of the blood to
0:25:30 animate her
0:25:32 corpse the room she's in is not
0:25:36 hers but she is familiar with
0:25:39 it and for the first
0:25:42 time maybe as long as she can
0:25:46 remember she wakes up in someone's
0:25:52 arms while she is
0:25:54 held she very quickly comes to realize
0:25:59 that while she is
0:26:01 awake the Elder Roman Pendragon is far
0:26:06 too close to his
0:26:08 beast and he has not yet
0:26:13 Arisen but there is something
0:26:16 else that brda
0:26:19 realizes L that she
0:26:22 channeled was the last drop that
0:26:24 remained within her
0:26:26 system and very
0:26:29 sore and aching from last
0:26:33 night a wave of hunger washes over
0:26:38 her
0:26:40 Brea you are awake fresh for the
0:26:44 evening but
0:26:46 somehow sore and exhausted all the
0:26:50 same and more importantly in the moment
0:26:54 you are very very low on blood how much
0:26:57 do you have in your system
0:26:59 sounds like I've got
0:27:01 zero using the lust to wake up right
0:27:04 that's right in the presence of Roman
0:27:06 pen
0:27:07 Dragon there is a sleeping source of
0:27:11 Vite I need a self- control rule to
0:27:17 keep from pouncing onto the vampire to
0:27:21 feed are there any limiters on that you
0:27:24 may not roll more dice than your blood
0:27:27 pool
0:27:29 I would like to spend a willpower you
0:27:31 may do so if I have no blood am I
0:27:35 rolling anything what was that if I have
0:27:38 no blood am I rolling anything no all
0:27:41 right no you're either spending a point
0:27:42 of willp power to resist the urge to
0:27:44 feed from him gotcha or you feed from
0:27:48 him waking up BR nearly mistakes the
0:27:52 sense of comfort
0:27:53 of being
0:27:56 held as the same sort of animalistic
0:27:59 urge that the Beast might
0:28:03 present that same warmth that same
0:28:08 pleasure it almost extends into the
0:28:11 feeling
0:28:13 of of her
0:28:15 things in her mouth and she just catches
0:28:20 it funneling her thought and her will
0:28:23 into not doing it and holding
0:28:27 herself very very still so that she
0:28:31 might have any any grasp of control over
0:28:35 this
0:28:37 situation there's that moment but she's
0:28:40 not sure how long she can hold on and
0:28:43 she's not sure how long it would take
0:28:45 for him to wake up she's in his arms is
0:28:49 that effectively mechanically a grapple
0:28:53 in this sleep this deathlike sleep
0:28:58 the body doesn't really move at all
0:29:01 there's no tossing and turning just
0:29:04 whatever position you fall asleep and
0:29:07 your body holds to that
0:29:11 position it
0:29:13 is perfectly
0:29:15 possible that he might simply be too
0:29:18 strong to escape even in his sleep BR
0:29:22 feels she has to try it hoping to depend
0:29:25 more on her slipperiness than strength
0:29:31 to see if she can kind of ease her self
0:29:34 even even if it's just to move her mouth
0:29:37 away from him a little
0:29:39 bit well actually does it seem like it
0:29:42 would help at all if she were able to do
0:29:46 something like bite down on a blanket
0:29:48 sheet you tell me what you try she is
0:29:52 going to try to slip away she feels
0:29:54 she's too close to hold this back too
0:29:56 much go ahead and roll
0:29:59 decks plus
0:30:01 Athletics because you are entangled with
0:30:03 Roman Pendragon I'm going to have you
0:30:06 roll a difficulty n yeah
0:30:10 tracks it's a wash you wiggle you try to
0:30:15 slide along his form to snake your way
0:30:18 out of his
0:30:19 grasp and nothing seems to work at that
0:30:24 point that that would be when brto would
0:30:27 give up on that strategy and curl up
0:30:30 tight bite down on a blanket and just
0:30:33 try to tough it out if she does not have
0:30:35 faith that she's going to be able to get
0:30:39 out how long do you wait in this
0:30:44 state I think the next impetus to change
0:30:46 my decision would be the next wave of
0:30:49 hunger after about 10 minutes of
0:30:52 this and Roman still shows no signs of
0:30:56 waking the hunger
0:31:00 returns in that case br will spend
0:31:05 another willpower and that's when she'll
0:31:08 start to try to wake him up she'll
0:31:12 gently not really trying to move his arm
0:31:15 but touching him in the way of letting
0:31:17 someone know that they'd like to get
0:31:19 past you
0:31:21 say Roman I'm sorry to wake you I I
0:31:26 can't I really need to go
0:31:29 feet just one eye
0:31:32 opens an acknowledgment of what you're
0:31:36 saying and then a
0:31:40 smile subtle like a half smirk forms on
0:31:45 his
0:31:46 lips then feed he
0:31:50 dares
0:31:52 I last night we
0:31:56 already last night I think we already
0:32:00 bonded to each other didn't
0:32:03 we so
0:32:06 what look I I don't I don't regret it
0:32:09 I'm I'm glad that we shared that but I
0:32:11 don't think I'm ready to bond
0:32:14 further he shrugs he
0:32:19 stretches very well
0:32:21 [Music]
0:32:23 then as he stretches you are released
0:32:26 from his grasp
0:32:29 BR gets up immediately kind of putting
0:32:32 herself across the room from him holding
0:32:35 on to herself like she's trying to hold
0:32:37 back the Beast inside of
0:32:39 her and trying to get a grasp on herself
0:32:44 her mind is racing she can't remember
0:32:49 being hungry like this unless what the
0:32:52 first night that she remembers that
0:32:54 would be the same level of hunger maybe
0:32:56 but but last last night with everything
0:32:59 that happened she remembers the taste of
0:33:02 his blood and that just makes it even
0:33:06 worse cuz that first night she was awake
0:33:09 she didn't
0:33:10 remember what blood tasted like she
0:33:13 didn't know what her Beast was urging
0:33:15 her to do and now she
0:33:18 knows is it okay if I go
0:33:21 feed go he says kind of sitting up in
0:33:24 the bed and putting a robe on
0:33:28 and with that she'll find something to
0:33:31 throw
0:33:32 on some clothes and try to take herself
0:33:37 as quickly and as straight as as a line
0:33:39 as possible to where she might be able
0:33:42 to feed with a click behind her she
0:33:46 exits the room on the outside of the
0:33:49 room arms crossed and waiting for this
0:33:52 nightmare to be over is
0:33:54 Maria seeing the expression on Maria's
0:33:57 face face and the way her arms are
0:33:58 crossed BR just tries to circle around
0:34:02 her and go
0:34:04 past she makes no attempt to stop you
0:34:08 and brda successfully F
0:34:16 escapes you're alone now and able to
0:34:19 pursue any solutions to this new found
0:34:23 problem as you wish what do you plan to
0:34:25 do baa has quick ly to her room knowing
0:34:30 the need to slip out of the robe and
0:34:33 throw something else on she grabs the
0:34:35 first thing she sees gets changed
0:34:38 quickly of course it's still probably
0:34:41 ridiculously luxuriant but she throws
0:34:45 her red leather jacket over her arms if
0:34:48 she finds it in the closet where she
0:34:50 left it the one that Johnny gave her she
0:34:53 doesn't put it on more carrying it like
0:34:55 a stle but it gives her some comfort as
0:34:58 the Beast rages to hold on to it and
0:35:02 hold it tight and taking A hurried
0:35:07 wavering path giving everyone wide
0:35:10 circles she tries to follow the scent of
0:35:13 cigarette smoke hoping to find Johnny
0:35:17 hoping against the way that the beast's
0:35:20 hunger makes her feel you leave the room
0:35:23 and go looking around for Johnny as you
0:35:27 w under these Halls covered in gorgeous
0:35:31 art and perfect lighting it can be
0:35:34 difficult to focus can I have a
0:35:36 self-control rule as you may recall the
0:35:39 difficulty will be
0:35:42 eight it's a wash for a moment you swear
0:35:46 you can smell the old stale scent of
0:35:51 Morley's but before you really find
0:35:55 Johnny you just find your lost in this
0:36:00 gorgeous landscape
0:36:03 painting and Ponder the Sun that is
0:36:07 depicted in it kind of starting to
0:36:10 realize that you've forgotten what it
0:36:13 looks like and how it feels and you
0:36:16 forgot quickly you haven't been Kindred
0:36:18 that long I don't feel like I ever knew
0:36:22 I don't feel like I get that sense of
0:36:23 humanity I don't feel like I'm really a
0:36:26 person
0:36:31 Johnny you're out chain smoking things
0:36:34 are set to be a pretty needlessly
0:36:37 complicated night and hanging by the
0:36:41 door with it open you're looking around
0:36:44 and down one of the long Halls you can
0:36:47 see Brea lost and
0:36:51 enraptured in the thr of a painting
0:36:55 Johnny's leaning uh against the frame of
0:36:58 the door smoking with the uh the morle
0:37:01 hanging out outside little door to like
0:37:04 a balcony something like that right
0:37:06 little little veranda and he sigh seeing
0:37:09 Britta at the mercy of of her Clan's
0:37:14 curse looks at the uh morle which is
0:37:17 only 34s done flicks it outside starts
0:37:22 walking down the hall towards
0:37:24 her he'll gently kind of Sidle up next
0:37:27 to her and put a gentle hand on her
0:37:32 shoulder Hey kid you all
0:37:34 right when she doesn't respond we'll
0:37:38 shake her just a a gentle shake to see
0:37:41 if he can kind of Rouse her from BR is
0:37:43 startled by the shake oh Johnny hang on
0:37:46 let go let go okay all right he backs up
0:37:49 and gives her some space she can see
0:37:51 that he's um he's changing the fresh
0:37:53 clothes and it looks like he has healed
0:37:57 the vast majority of the Damage Done to
0:37:59 his neck but there is still this
0:38:02 horrible black purple bruise on one side
0:38:06 of his neck where the skin has mended
0:38:09 but the damage is still trying to heal
0:38:11 itself br's close cover where the wound
0:38:15 from vitel would be but maybe she seems
0:38:19 to be in less pain it would be hard to
0:38:21 tell though from the way that the Beast
0:38:23 thrums inside of her you can see it
0:38:25 hungry in her as she looks at you taking
0:38:28 a few steps back focusing trying her
0:38:32 best to think and
0:38:34 feel hey Johnny I'm I'm sorry I I I am
0:38:39 good grief kid you haven't eaten at all
0:38:41 have you
0:38:43 um well uh your Tank's on empty isn't it
0:38:48 yeah I look you're going to hurt someone
0:38:50 like that that's I needed to find you
0:38:53 cuz I wanted to make sure you could help
0:38:55 me not bite someone or kill someone and
0:38:57 all right all right all right C yourself
0:38:59 down we'll we'll find something for you
0:39:01 to somewhere for you to feed thank you
0:39:03 Johnny starts looking back and forth on
0:39:05 the hallway to see if there's any
0:39:06 attendance or ghouls or anything I
0:39:09 haven't seen anybody NE you can see
0:39:11 Johnny stiffen and tell that he is
0:39:13 holding back a thrashing fist at the
0:39:17 appearance of of someone behind him Neil
0:39:19 sorry you weren't in the room this
0:39:20 morning and I I went looking for um I
0:39:25 don't know we could go back down to the
0:39:27 room where the
0:39:28 where we fed yesterday L BR you ate
0:39:30 yesterday how are you this hungry look I
0:39:33 when gave me a good talk about how
0:39:35 things would go and things went well but
0:39:38 I I just I I don't know it kind of it we
0:39:43 went she's hungry that's all okay we got
0:39:45 to figure this out she can't be the way
0:39:47 she is right now no um let's let's go
0:39:51 down he didn't give you anything he
0:39:53 didn't give you anything to no I okay
0:39:55 look um and brda is going to activate
0:40:00 double talk so while the outside world
0:40:04 here's BR speaking about how she's
0:40:08 really sorry and she should have kept
0:40:10 better track and she really is very
0:40:14 grateful that she can come to you for
0:40:16 help in this kind of situation what her
0:40:19 intended hears
0:40:22 is look
0:40:25 um me and pendra and we we did end up
0:40:29 together last night and it it went well
0:40:32 I just um things kind of got out of hand
0:40:36 and then we ended up bonded to each
0:40:38 other and I did feed and it just kind of
0:40:41 kept going and um I don't when I I guess
0:40:46 I lost track who uh who hears that you
0:40:50 and Neil Johnny kind of puts up a hand
0:40:53 and he he kind of nods that's fine we
0:40:57 just got to make sure we're we're
0:40:58 feeding you now all right yeah um in the
0:41:04 state you're in Johnny seems cool and
0:41:06 collected Neil yeah I think you are
0:41:10 probably the most sober of the three of
0:41:12 us because as you look between Johnny
0:41:14 and brda you can tell that brida is
0:41:18 barely keeping her beast in check
0:41:20 Johnny's not much better she's probably
0:41:24 on an empty tank Johnny might only have
0:41:27 a few Vite holding his beast in check
0:41:30 himself look Pand Dragon said I could
0:41:33 feed off of him but I didn't think that
0:41:34 was a good idea to get double already
0:41:36 and I I remember how that felt with
0:41:39 Rowlands and I I know that Wynn is already
0:41:42 at risk and you make you're making good
0:41:44 choices BR yeah no no it's good we're
0:41:46 good
0:41:47 Jesus got to get back to my what worry
0:41:51 about that later yeah find somebody now
0:41:54 let's all walk together we are I just
0:41:57 need and we just I'll listen for foot
0:42:00 something or we let's head back down to
0:42:03 that weird feeding room he's got
0:42:05 heartbeats preferably well yeah that's
0:42:08 kind of what I Johnny I don't I I don't
0:42:11 have a lot of strength in me to keep not
0:42:14 H hurt anyone girl don't worry about it
0:42:16 please stop me nothing to stop you're
0:42:19 fine as Johnny says that his words are
0:42:21 punctuated by the arrival of a gentleman

0:43:44 sure he's alive so let's let's let's
0:43:47 round him up and go downstairs Neil I
0:43:49 want to I I would like that as well if

0:44:01 talking about all right well I there
0:44:04 does need to be Refreshments there is
0:44:06 what the outside world would hear but to
0:44:09 her Cod members BR says someone someone
0:44:13 did die last night I I don't know who um
0:44:18 some deal that it sounds like Luc sind
0:44:20 made with with Pendragon to get him not
0:44:25 to um Luc send wants most of us to die
0:44:28 in The Assault yeah and then whoever
0:44:32 survives win is going to kill so uh we
0:44:36 need to make sure that Johnny gives you

0:45:08 keeping our captors waiting it wouldn't
0:45:11 have been them no no

0:45:24 well we'll we'll cross that bridge when
0:45:25 we get there we'll across all of these

0:45:43 our
0:45:44 Coterie let's just let's just let's go
0:45:47 let's go Johnny um moves BR
0:45:53 along in a way where he's kind of just
0:45:56 trying to take some some of the he's
0:45:58 letting her kind of like fixate on
0:46:01 keeping her beast at Bay and helping
0:46:03 just guide her in the direction they
0:46:05 need to go so that she doesn't have to
0:46:07 think about multiple things at once if
0:46:10 Johnny seems open to it he might if if
0:46:14 he seems accepting of being br's guide
0:46:16 he might see BR squeeze her eyes shut as
0:46:19 she walks past particular art tighten
0:46:21 her grip on the jacket that he gave her
0:46:23 that she's recovered and let herself be
0:46:26 guided there
0:46:31 miles and wind there comes a knock at
0:46:34 the
0:46:35 door I go and check out who it is you
0:46:39 stride across the large bedroom that the
0:46:41 two of you have shared and when you open
0:46:43 the door there is something unusual
0:46:45 happening there are two people at the
0:46:47 door one of them is an archon toest
0:46:50 aent the other is one of the bruha who
0:46:54 serves in Roman Pendragons Army
0:46:57 they do not appear to have arrived
0:47:00 together but seem slightly at odds with
0:47:03 one another judging by their body
0:47:05 language and it seems that both parties
0:47:10 had arrived to this room with the
0:47:12 intention of arriving
0:47:15 first how can I help the two of you the
0:47:19 archon speaks first and says to you our
0:47:23 power expects when to report in
0:47:25 immediately the bruha says Ah
0:47:30 unfortunate his grace has invoked the
0:47:33 right of domain and expects to meet with
0:47:35 the Coterie immediately and they look
0:47:37 like they might
0:47:39 [Laughter]
0:47:41 fight I'm as to clarify as far as I know
0:47:44 Lucen can't actually she can do whatever
0:47:46 the [ __ ] she wants she's a justicar yeah
0:47:48 I wasn't sure if she could what is the
0:47:50 camaran knowledge miles has about this
0:47:52 situation what is the law what's the
0:47:54 Precedence of course miles Ro me law
0:47:57 uh unfortunately these are great powers
0:48:00 in conflict with one another so you will
0:48:02 be at difficulty seven what am I rolling
0:48:04 here intelligence mil's favorite stat
0:48:08 and
0:48:09 law one success with one success you
0:48:13 know that so long as Roman Pendragon is
0:48:15 Prince the right of domain an important
0:48:19 part of the camara's Traditions must be
0:48:22 honored by all who enter his domain the
0:48:26 right of main says that he is able to
0:48:30 have whatever he wants tell people to do
0:48:33 whatever he wants and essentially holds
0:48:36 all of the
0:48:37 cards however you also know that a
0:48:41 justic card possesses the power to
0:48:43 Dethrone a prince and remove them from
0:48:48 power provided they find reason whether
0:48:53 or not this reason has been just or leg
0:48:56 legitimate in the past has varied wildly
0:49:00 from justicar to justicar but it would
0:49:03 take months for any sort of resolution
0:49:07 to happen if lucenda were to pull that
0:49:09 trigger on Roman Pendragon now the
0:49:11 question is is lucenda willing to pull
0:49:14 that trigger on Roman Pendragon is
0:49:16 Roman Pendragon willing to expose
0:49:19 himself to a position where her power
0:49:22 Jus carus sind is willing to do that and
0:49:26 of all of these things are they willing
0:49:29 to have that Conflict at a time like now
0:49:33 over the two of you the answer to that
0:49:35 is
0:49:36 yes in the heart of Roman Pendragon's
0:49:38 domain no less that's right his literal
0:49:42 Haven yeah does Luc send have the gall
0:49:45 to tell Prince Roman Pendragon what
0:49:48 happens and does not happen in the heart
0:49:51 of his domain I look at the archon after
0:49:54 this is delivered on there is something
0:49:57 that I'm not aware of you're aware of
0:50:00 the law that I must follow in this part
0:50:02 and if you will want to impart any new
0:50:05 information to
0:50:06 that but otherwise we will be going to
0:50:09 meet Prince Pendragon respectfully Your
0:50:12 Grace you will be going to meet Prince
0:50:15 Pendragon Aron cabit has a
0:50:18 responsibility to or justicar and there
0:50:20 is no prince who can stand in the way of
0:50:23 that when gives a very longsuffering ing
0:50:27 sigh from inside the room and there's
0:50:30 the sound of a book closing and she is
0:50:33 dragging herself to her feet like the
0:50:37 this
0:50:39 [ __ ] again plain in her body Mo
0:50:42 movements and she comes to the door
0:50:45 straightening herself up as she
0:50:47 walks and looks to miles I want to go
0:50:50 with
0:50:51 him the archon
0:50:55 yep hopefully be quick figure out what
0:50:58 to do about me while I'm gone see you
0:51:01 soon and she looks at the
0:51:04 archon it was it someone from the car
0:51:06 yes okay which one it is Red Death who
0:51:10 uh is present in collecting you all
0:51:12 right Red Balloons let's go there's this
0:51:16 thin smile this way they turn and go she
0:51:19 looks back to Miles says I'll go right
0:51:21 you go [ __ ] yourself and turns back to
0:51:23 the archon miles just looks mystified
0:51:26 and just goes to put a sword belt on I
0:51:28 belt on the sword put on the new clothes
0:51:31 that I had delivered along with my
0:51:32 Ghouls and head off with this um it's
0:51:36 not servant I guess member of pen
0:51:40 dragon's Army miles is escorted to the
0:51:43 elevator where other members of the quy
0:51:45 are already
0:51:50 waiting when you were brought to a study
0:51:54 that her power is currently occupying
0:51:57 when you enter the room she is seated in
0:52:01 front of what appears to be a pair of
0:52:03 laptops that are set up on the desk and
0:52:06 on this silver tray is what looks like a
0:52:11 very ornate bronze thermos of sorts and
0:52:17 along the metal you can see that it is
0:52:21 very uh cool like this iced thermos
0:52:25 suggest just to the thermos not looking
0:52:27 away from the screen touch the thermos
0:52:30 and carry
0:52:31 on with what your
0:52:35 hand no I I know what to touch it with
0:52:38 carry on with what action that's all
0:52:41 touch the
0:52:42 thermos
0:52:44 leave cool good talk she goes over
0:52:49 touching it expecting to be bloodbound
0:52:51 when you touch the thermos it is a very
0:52:53 uh cold chilling sensation and and you
0:52:58 do sense that somehow within this
0:53:01 thermos the blood that was within has
0:53:03 transferred into you and you will become
0:53:07 one more step bloodbound to Lucent
0:53:11 what's on the screens you don't know
0:53:12 they're facing the other side of the
0:53:14 desk where she is
0:53:16 seated as she's walking away from the
0:53:19 thermoses she kind of looks over with
0:53:22 uncomfortable new interest in the justic
0:53:26 car
0:53:27 looking at her hands as they're on the
0:53:30 keyboard and kind of like looking up
0:53:34 over the monitor to see if she can see
0:53:36 her fingers what are you reading I need
0:53:40 to know if you look at the screens if I
0:53:42 can see them from where I am then yes
0:53:46 but if not then no I am not going out of
0:53:49 my way right now she is angling to look
0:53:52 at her
0:53:53 fingers I want to look at the screens
0:53:56 yes okay okay but she is also asking
0:53:58 what's on the screens as you lean over
0:54:00 and get a look at the screen you see
0:54:02 something and as you try to
0:54:05 contextualize it a hand is placed over
0:54:09 yours you hear the door shut behind you
0:54:11 as you're standing in the hallway you're
0:54:13 not sure how much time just passed the
0:54:16 [ __ ] she opens the door you see this in
0:54:20 she looks up from her laptops yes what
0:54:22 time is it go check the time archon you
