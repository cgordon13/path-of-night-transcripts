0:00:39 night the Cordy split after their
0:00:41 meeting with pen Dragon Neil followed wi
0:00:45 after she stormed off lucin's mind
0:00:48 control inflicted a terrible pain on wi
0:00:50 when the gangles spoke too much of her
0:00:52 secret
0:00:54 commands miles asked P to secure pen
0:00:56 Dragon further as an
0:00:58 ally the recollected themselves and
0:01:01 attempted to pull together before the
0:01:03 war council
0:01:05 [Music]

0:01:31 come in R Peaks
0:01:34 sin
0:01:36 hey I'm not mad at you I just want to be
0:01:39 very clear about
0:01:41 that I just didn't want you to be
0:01:44 alone do you want to be in here or we
0:01:48 seem to have really good talks in
0:01:50 bathrooms so I'm fine with it if you
0:01:53 are honestly when I um just kind of
0:01:57 wanted to spend some time with you
0:02:02 okay she kind of Pats the tile floor
0:02:05 next to her still kind of worrying at
0:02:07 the pillow do we invite Neil or yeah we
0:02:12 can do that it's okay I can hear you
0:02:14 guys yeah we know I'll pretend that I
0:02:17 can't no you won't cuz you'll bring it
0:02:20 up later come here come on Neil walks
0:02:25 into the bathroom and having been called
0:02:27 out on pre intense looks at wi and goes
0:02:28 I told you people wanted to spend time
0:02:30 with you can you bring some more pillows
0:02:32 oh um walks back out of the bathroom and
0:02:36 then comes in with like a gangly armful
0:02:38 of every pillow in the room oh I didn't
0:02:41 know which ones were the right ones to
0:02:42 bring in so I the honestly none of them
0:02:45 are ours so they're none of them are the
0:02:46 right ones but these will do let's just
0:02:50 take a minute okay what are we doing
0:02:52 we're hanging out oh hanging out in the
0:02:55 bathroom with a bunch of pillows let's
0:02:56 put these in the tub and we can all sit
0:02:58 in there look things are going to get
0:02:59 nuts I know you got to get set up for a
0:03:01 ritual and all that but we can't do a
0:03:04 lot of that right now no I'm sad so
0:03:07 let's just I I just want to hang out
0:03:10 with you guys I just want to spend some
0:03:11 time while I can do you mind if I ask
0:03:13 you sex questions in front of Neil I'm
0:03:15 going to go outside um he'll probably be
0:03:18 back no I won't I I'm not Neil you don't
0:03:22 have to no this is this feels like girl
0:03:24 talk do you want to be part of girl
0:03:28 talk I don't know how answer that do you
0:03:31 want in on the information we are about
0:03:35 to share the door opens Neil standing in
0:03:38 the doorway well then come and sit in
0:03:40 the bathtub with us that's not not a
0:03:41 fair way to put that I'm not going to
0:03:43 sit in the tub with you well then sit on
0:03:44 the toilet or something over and sits on
0:03:46 the toilet do you want a pillow no she
0:03:50 holds one out says a little huffle and
0:03:51 he takes one when she hands it up look
0:03:54 it's um I'm not sure what to say or what
0:03:58 not to say but
0:04:00 I I guess I'm kind of glad that you're
0:04:04 both here you guys specifically
0:04:07 cuz I mean when you're the one that
0:04:10 talked to me about how Kindred sex
0:04:14 worked
0:04:15 and
0:04:16 Neil I guess there's been a lot that we
0:04:19 haven't talked
0:04:21 about has
0:04:23 there you you came to get me at the gala
0:04:28 yeah you you were
0:04:31 kidnapped yeah and
0:04:34 um things have been so break neck I
0:04:37 don't know if we've ever talked
0:04:39 about what that meant to either of
0:04:42 us
0:04:44 um I I mean you you were taken away
0:04:48 needed to get you back you you needed
0:04:51 you needed to be there I mean I guess I
0:04:54 had some questions about sort of the
0:05:00 air and and attitude uh and and body
0:05:03 language that you had when you found out
0:05:06 I was there uh and in relation to you
0:05:08 walking with pen Dragon but I I feel
0:05:11 like a lot of those questions have kind
0:05:12 of been answered by subsequent
0:05:14 events I guess for
0:05:17 me a lot of this has been so confusing
0:05:24 um Neil when you got there I was so
0:05:28 scared yeah it was terrifying but but it
0:05:32 wasn't just because of the circumstance
0:05:34 I was in it was also
0:05:36 because I was I was kind of mad at you
0:05:40 yeah I got that impression I never quite
0:05:43 understood why uh outside of just the
0:05:46 impression that uh you you didn't really
0:05:48 want to be rescued I I I did want to be
0:05:55 rescued okay well I I guess that brings
0:05:57 up more questions for me than one were
0:05:59 you
0:06:02 mad you got there and there was so much
0:06:05 pressure on me because
0:06:07 I I knew that if I did anything wrong
0:06:10 that you guys were going to
0:06:13 die and then you were kind of doing what
0:06:16 you wanted to do to try to get me back
0:06:19 and
0:06:20 yeah and that meant that you were going
0:06:23 to die if you did anything
0:06:27 wrong I guess
0:06:30 we have different Recollections of that
0:06:33 event
0:06:34 then no
0:06:38 cuz I I mean that sounds to me very
0:06:44 um like I went into that understanding
0:06:47 that you were basically a
0:06:49 hostage and um was looking to sneak the
0:06:53 hostage away uh and then when I found
0:06:56 the hostage the
0:06:58 hostage was like hey no thank
0:07:02 you not with words but sort of the way
0:07:05 that you
0:07:07 um I don't know like when you were sort
0:07:10 of clinging to him coming down the
0:07:11 stairs and and and deliberately avoiding
0:07:15 looking at me um and and that sort of
0:07:18 thing
0:07:20 where
0:07:21 uh from how it looked you you were more
0:07:25 interested in in being there with
0:07:27 um Prince Pendragon than than uh
0:07:31 grasping out an opportunity to get
0:07:33 out and you still don't get that that
0:07:36 was to keep you alive too no I
0:07:40 don't I don't see how
0:07:43 that would um play in or or at least our
0:07:49 goals were I I wasn't going to leave
0:07:51 without you it just wasn't going to
0:07:54 happen
0:07:56 so
0:07:58 um I I I guess I don't understand BR did
0:08:01 pen Dragon make some threat of some
0:08:05 sort about us if you didn't
0:08:08 behave the threat was always there you
0:08:12 remember
0:08:13 Boston if you guys if if we leave Boston
0:08:17 he'll summon and kill
0:08:20 us but that was Boston which which he
0:08:23 basically Shadow ran and Rhode Island
0:08:27 wasn't the same there was a Warwick a
0:08:30 Warwick stronghold and as much as might
0:08:34 not always seem like
0:08:35 it I mean I had connections to Warick
0:08:38 and the nas ratu that that was a a
0:08:41 stronghold of
0:08:44 of my people not not
0:08:48 his that's why I I asked Fester to go I
0:08:51 got an invitation to be brought um I
0:08:54 knew there could have been repercussions
0:08:56 but I I did
0:08:57 everything by a book if not pen dragon's
0:09:01 book at first I was
0:09:04 so scared of what would happen to me and
0:09:08 what would happen to you guys and and
0:09:11 some of that's so there I mean this is
0:09:14 It's why the first thing I said is that
0:09:16 I'm confused it's it's a hard thing to
0:09:20 balance it's a hard thing to balance
0:09:22 feeling everything that I felt in a
0:09:26 row feeling like
0:09:29 like I was under threat and then going
0:09:33 through every step of the way I mean
0:09:36 coming back
0:09:38 here it's put a lot of things into
0:09:41 perspective but muddled other things
0:09:44 like
0:09:46 like
0:09:48 I when I went to that Gala I was hoping
0:09:53 that I could behave well enough that you
0:09:56 guys would be safe that if I looked and
0:10:00 acted the part
0:10:02 that I could keep you guys
0:10:06 alive
0:10:08 and then things got even more confusing
0:10:11 and I don't know
0:10:14 feelings they they happen and sometimes
0:10:17 I feel
0:10:18 so wrong about it
0:10:22 I when
0:10:25 like I feel like I'm the reason that
0:10:28 Elsa's dad
0:10:30 well I mean that's not true Carmen
0:10:32 killed her but I made her Panic why do
0:10:36 you think you made her Panic as I said
0:10:39 the sabat was coming but they were
0:10:41 coming and the entire scenario there was
0:10:44 intended to make people panic you can't
0:10:46 take that on your own shoulders we all
0:10:48 panicked I panicked you you heard the
0:10:51 the the the screams and the like the
0:10:54 whole point of that
0:10:56 that um the thing the the the Invasion
0:10:59 the whatever you want to call it that it
0:11:01 was designed to cause panic but I should
0:11:03 have known better after she froze up
0:11:06 when the werewolf was dropped off at our
0:11:08 court but that was because of the
0:11:09 werewolf that was a that was a werewolf
0:11:11 specific not a sabat
0:11:13 specific I I guess I'm bringing up Elsa
0:11:16 partly
0:11:18 because she was trying to get me away
0:11:20 from pen Dragon 2 then that was her last
0:11:23 request of of of of me is to get you out
0:11:28 and get you away it's
0:11:30 not why I showed up but once I got there
0:11:32 it was why I was so insistent her final
0:11:34 request before she died was to get you
0:11:36 away from him and she was she was going
0:11:39 to help and sometimes it makes me feel
0:11:43 really guilty every every step up
0:11:46 to feeling what I'm feeling but I I am
0:11:50 feeling something and I I want to feel I
0:11:54 want to explore this feeling too and I I
0:11:58 know it sometimes times it it makes me
0:12:00 feel monstrous and [ __ ] up that
0:12:04 I I it's not I do I do feel something
0:12:08 for him and I don't
0:12:11 know why if that just means that
0:12:14 I'm I'm a monster too BR we all are yeah
0:12:19 that was what I was going to say
0:12:20 too and I want to hammer home for you
0:12:23 that you are not responsible for the
0:12:26 choices people make yeah else made
0:12:29 choices that led her to die war made
0:12:33 some choices that led a whole mansion of
0:12:36 people to die and that one was even
0:12:39 deliver it
0:12:41 yeah
0:12:43 so I just want you to know as far as
0:12:45 Elsa like Elsa went knowing you know she
0:12:48 was not a friend to operation longbo and
0:12:51 she knew for a fact that that was a
0:12:52 stronghold of operation Longbow did she
0:12:54 know this zot were going to attack no
0:12:55 none of us did
0:12:56 but she went with her eyes open to to
0:13:00 that um place and
0:13:03 and I I kind of got a hammer home that
0:13:05 so did I right like if I had died there
0:13:08 it wouldn't have been your fault I
0:13:09 walked in knowing that that was a
0:13:11 possibility there was a strong
0:13:13 possibility probably but I don't know as
0:13:16 someone who's been taken
0:13:18 away and quietly taken on burdens um to
0:13:25 for for the good of the people I care
0:13:26 about I I to me and maybe I'm projecting
0:13:30 onto you to me the first part about it
0:13:31 was always being alone and I just wanted
0:13:33 you to know that you weren't alone even
0:13:35 if it meant two of us went out rather
0:13:37 than one of us because I mean for me I
0:13:40 would rather that happen uh as far as
0:13:43 attraction and and all that kind of
0:13:45 stuff I don't know I'm not the best
0:13:46 person to talk to about all that kind of
0:13:48 thing but I don't think either wi or I
0:13:49 can judge you for you know having
0:13:51 feelings for the wrong people would be
0:13:53 huge Hypocrites for that I would also
0:13:55 argue that I don't think your feelings
0:13:57 are wrong
0:14:00 I don't think that indulging those
0:14:02 feelings in what may be the final nights
0:14:06 are wrong on the flip side to that
0:14:08 though um so long as you do keep in
0:14:11 mind that he is a a monster he's awful
0:14:15 he's an awful horrific person um I know
0:14:20 you're going to think that I'm just
0:14:22 saying this cuz we blood bonded each
0:14:25 other but there is good to him too the i
0:14:32 in the meeting that we just had I don't
0:14:34 know if it really came across that he
0:14:36 was willing to do what it took to end
0:14:40 gehenna even to take on
0:14:43 something that would I kill him so I
0:14:46 don't agree with that personally and
0:14:50 that's that's because um my read is that
0:14:54 he is willing to do what it
0:14:56 takes within the scope of what he does
0:15:00 and what he understands but if we were
0:15:02 to say the only thing you could do is to
0:15:04 stand aside if you were to lay down arms
0:15:08 curl into a ball beg and die that it
0:15:10 would save us all he would not do that
0:15:13 but he's absolutely willing to fight
0:15:15 because he's a
0:15:16 fighter so so I'm not saying that he's
0:15:19 not willing to do things that are
0:15:21 aligned with the goals that we have but
0:15:24 I would not say that that makes him
0:15:26 willing to do anything
0:15:29 why do you think that because my read on
0:15:34 him is that he is a man who he is that
0:15:39 he I mean just the way he was talking in
0:15:41 that meeting he he was not
0:15:42 willing I understand that I get
0:15:44 fatalistic sometimes but he was asking
0:15:48 for
0:15:49 Solutions and was not willing to hear
0:15:52 that there might not be any that's
0:15:54 because there are always something you
0:15:56 can do even if it's not going to fix
0:15:58 everything he's a man of action yes I
0:16:02 guess that's what I'm saying is so long
0:16:05 as what he is asked to do aligns with
0:16:09 being a man of action he willing to do
0:16:12 things curling up in a ball and begging
0:16:14 for forgiveness is also an action but
0:16:17 that's where I don't think he would do
0:16:18 it and that's where BR is saying he
0:16:19 might be I I don't know that he'd be
0:16:22 willing to do anything he I but you've
0:16:25 seen parts of him that anything maybe
0:16:28 not but things that others wouldn't be
0:16:30 willing to do maybe so I don't think
0:16:33 that he'd be willing to curl up in a
0:16:35 ball and beg no but I I do think that
0:16:40 look I that's part of what's so
0:16:42 confusing about all of this is it feels
0:16:45 like my greatest strength and my
0:16:47 greatest weakness all in one I I can
0:16:51 listen to people and really hear them
0:16:55 but I also try to really hear them in
0:16:58 the way that they want to be heard and
0:17:01 be empathetic towards what they're
0:17:03 thinking what they want so thinking of
0:17:08 the good in people um it can I don't
0:17:12 know if
0:17:14 that's me wanting so badly to be true to
0:17:18 my heart or if that's me being a
0:17:22 fool it it seems to be something that
0:17:25 the codery really needs it it seems
0:17:28 seems like that's what I can really do
0:17:31 for you guys but at the same time
0:17:34 sometimes it seems like like it's
0:17:38 selfish I don't think that it's the
0:17:41 worst thing in the world to see the good
0:17:42 in Monsters R this so long as you
0:17:46 remember that it is in the nature of a
0:17:49 monster to be
0:17:56 monstrous
0:17:57 miles I as things wind down you find
0:18:01 yourself approached by a man in a red

0:19:32 over a dozen Kindred gathered a number
0:19:35 of them are agents of Roman pen Dragon
0:19:38 his various lieutenants that are head to
0:19:41 different areas of the upcoming battle
0:19:43 in New York almost everyone has laptops
0:19:46 that are gathered there are manila
0:19:47 folders some are already perusing
0:19:49 information in the center of the room
0:19:52 there's a table where only a handful of
0:19:54 Kindred are seated at the head of the
0:19:57 table is Roman Dragon who is flanked by
0:20:01 a pair of his most loyal subjects one of
0:20:04 which is his own child cir seated across
0:20:08 from him at the table is a man who you
0:20:12 do not recognize but he has dark skin
0:20:17 long curly hair that kind of rests
0:20:19 around his shoulders a thick beard very
0:20:23 dark eyes he is not dressed in a suit
0:20:28 but instead is wearing like these old
0:20:32 like Army
0:20:34 bdus seated at the table as well is just
0:20:38 a
0:20:39 Carin and another face you do not
0:20:43 recognize personally but miles you have
0:20:46 enough knowledge of the camria to
0:20:50 recognize who they must be um because
0:20:54 this woman is unusually
0:20:57 gorgeous but there is also something
0:21:00 that is just cold and monstrous about
0:21:03 her she looks to be a beautiful lady
0:21:08 with Alabaster skin dark blood red hair
0:21:11 and these bright icy blue eyes she is
0:21:15 dressed in very tight black Sleek
0:21:22 leathers and has these gloves that she
0:21:24 wears all black that come up past her
0:21:27 elbows you recognized her to be Madame G
0:21:31 the jtic car of the toror the most
0:21:34 infamously cruel justic car of them all
0:21:38 she smiles but is not a beautiful swap
0:21:43 mile oh it is it is a beautiful smile
0:21:46 but it isn't one that brings you any
0:21:48 comfort it's the sort of smile you would
0:21:50 imagine a spider having for the
0:21:53 fly in the center of the table is an
0:21:57 audio device that's meant to essentially
0:22:00 be like a speaker for uh a meeting and
0:22:05 someone who might be speaking remotely
0:22:07 one side of the table doesn't have any
0:22:09 seats and it's because on the wall there
0:22:13 is a very large television and it's like
0:22:17 one of those big thick Gigantor blocky
0:22:20 TVs this isn't like a this isn't the
0:22:22 agge of flat screen right is there an
0:22:25 obvious spot for me or you have a seat
0:22:29 waiting for you right between Madame
0:22:32 ghee and jusa
0:22:36 carent woof Johnny gives you a quick Pat
0:22:40 in the back uh I will state Madame G has
0:22:43 appearance six she is not beautiful in a
0:22:46 way that is possible for the human she
0:22:50 also has Humanity too it's a very
0:22:53 conflicting set of Virtues she's pretty
0:22:55 in the way that a praying mantis is yeah
0:22:58 I
0:23:00 will after assessing the room quickly
0:23:03 move to take my seat leaving a bow to
0:23:06 those that are already there sensing
0:23:09 your discomfort Madame ghee reaches out
0:23:13 takes your hand and holds
0:23:16 it Johnny you're escorted to stand
0:23:20 behind and to the right of your
0:23:24 prince so Johnny was probably going to
0:23:26 be heading that way anyways but he
0:23:29 definitely gives kind of like a
0:23:31 indignant look at his escort they kind
0:23:34 of try to not like Flinch for fear of
0:23:37 drawing the eye of some of these
0:23:40 guests Madame Gees speaks up your grace
0:23:44 delightful that you can join us I've
0:23:47 heard of some of your escapades and was
0:23:49 hoping that I might have the opportunity
0:23:51 to meet
0:23:52 you I understand you're a very busy man
0:23:54 and don't have very much time not
0:23:57 anymore
0:23:59 now we are joined by the warlord of the
0:24:03 camaria Kos she gestures to the man who
0:24:06 is sitting at one end of the table it is
0:24:11 a disappointment to
0:24:13 me that the warlord has been instructed
0:24:16 to destroy any Kindred who disrupts this
0:24:18 meeting or behaves in a manner
0:24:22 that hard stat finds
0:24:25 unacceptable I am deeply jealous of K I
0:24:27 hope you understand stand doesn't seem
0:24:29 like a good time to talk cuz I've been
0:24:31 just like I'm leaving that up to you
0:24:33 okay I will she does not seem to give
0:24:35 you indications kind of just waiting to
0:24:37 see what you will do Johnny straightens
0:24:39 the mention of some of those names and
0:24:41 his eyes start kind of flicking around
0:24:43 he's pretty sure he's she gers towards
0:24:46 ksh the man in the bdus is correct she
0:24:48 does but he's looking around and kind of
0:24:51 just is nervously kind of eyeing the
0:24:53 television when she mentions harat
0:24:56 without further Ado I believe that who
0:24:58 is hosting this meeting is ready on his
0:25:01 end of this continent and now that it's
0:25:04 deep enough into the night man heads
0:25:06 over turns on the television and the
0:25:10 phone rings one of the ghouls working in
0:25:13 the area has the phone answered and a
0:25:16 voice comes through on the speaker that
0:25:18 is in the center of the
0:25:20 table ah my boy you've joined us for the
0:25:23 meeting of course grandsire I am so
0:25:26 pleased to know that you should be the
0:25:28 face of our war effort here on the East
0:25:31 Coast you bring honor to the clan I seek
0:25:35 to do nothing
0:25:36 else I have a gift for
0:25:40 you Madame ghee she bows of course she
0:25:45 does not let go of your hand yeah but
0:25:50 reaches kind of like into her
0:25:54 cleavage and takes out this NE
0:25:59 like the needle that you would like
0:26:01 thread with and she
0:26:03 turns and on one of your dignitas
0:26:06 particularly the white cross that you
0:26:09 wear the needle is thread behind it and
0:26:13 seems to sort of
0:26:15 disappear
0:26:18 now as of Nightfall tomorrow the East
0:26:22 Coast operation is to begin is Grace
0:26:26 Roman pen dragon and
0:26:29 allies from operation Longbow or to
0:26:31 besiege the city of New York directing
0:26:35 influences and boots on the ground Into
0:26:39 the Heart of the sabat territory your
0:26:42 objective is to detain the Cardinal of
0:26:46 this East Coast Cardinal
0:26:49 ponia the details have been shared the
0:26:52 plan is arranged in that regard but how
0:26:55 it pertains to the defensive new New
0:26:58 Haven is what remains to be
0:27:00 discussed My
0:27:02 Boy Tell Me Lord of the
0:27:07 Camara what do you need to
0:27:12 win
0:27:14 miles
0:27:16 Johnny after he asks you that question
0:27:20 you can hear the sounds of this fire
0:27:23 poker being used to work the uh
0:27:28 fireplace that currently is not lit in
0:27:31 this in this very large parlay
0:27:34 area
0:27:36 and you see that they are crunching up
0:27:40 Ash and Bones in this
0:27:44 fireplace and as you see this bone Skull
0:27:49 Cave and be crushed by this working
0:27:52 ghoul
0:27:55 miles you recognize a warped
0:27:59 iron ciret
0:28:01 pin in the
0:28:04 fireplace covered in
0:28:07 Ash a hand grips yours just a little
0:28:10 tighter and Madam ghee leans
0:28:14 in did you see it I heard it was
0:28:24 excruciating I know this is going to
0:28:26 sound hypocritical maybe I I um um in my
0:28:31 experience you can want very
0:28:35 badly to see the good in
0:28:38 someone to the point where you're unable
0:28:41 to really truly internalize the
0:28:45 bad what if
0:28:47 that's what if I like that he's
0:28:51 monstrous what if that makes me
0:28:54 feel what if that does make me feel
0:28:58 safe
0:29:00 like like everything that I don't like
0:29:02 about myself I know that he would accept
0:29:05 it like like I don't have to worry
0:29:10 about all the times that I look in the
0:29:12 mirror and I don't know who I am that's
0:29:15 not a
0:29:17 problem why are you phrasing that as a
0:29:19 what if because I I know that you
0:29:23 guys love isn't a perfect topic for
0:29:26 either one of you either I I don't know
0:29:28 everything um but um I I feel like um
0:29:34 when you and kir mhm ravos and gang girl
0:29:39 you're supposed to hate each other mhm
0:29:41 but that feels
0:29:44 more
0:29:46 romantic it's it it's not the same as
0:29:49 um me really catching feelings for
0:29:53 someone that I know hurts
0:29:55 people someone that I know isn't Humane
0:30:00 who isn't going to do the right thing
0:30:03 necessarily usually isn't so here's
0:30:07 where I stand on the issue of you
0:30:10 feeling good about how you feel about
0:30:14 pen
0:30:16 Dragon I love
0:30:18 you and that is without caveat
0:30:22 addendum knowing everything that I know
0:30:25 about you and anything that I will learn
0:30:27 about you
0:30:28 and he has taken steps to keep you
0:30:32 safe he makes you happy he makes you
0:30:35 feel safe the man is repulsive he is
0:30:39 repugnant I do not choose him to be an
0:30:42 ally of mine or a
0:30:44 friend and I don't trust
0:30:47 him but if you have chosen him to feel
0:30:51 safe
0:30:52 with then I will give him the benefit of
0:30:55 the doubt for you but I do do not see
0:30:59 him as anything other than a predator
0:31:01 but I will respect your choice in
0:31:03 feeling safe with
0:31:06 him what if I like him because I'm like
0:31:10 him do you really think you're like
0:31:13 him you just got done saying that you
0:31:16 can talk to people in a way where they
0:31:18 feel heard they feel seen and they feel
0:31:23 appreciated do you think most people
0:31:25 feel that way when they talk to him do
0:31:27 you you think most people see him as
0:31:30 compassionate I I don't see him as that
0:31:34 okay so then are you like him do you
0:31:36 enjoy killing did you enjoy your trip
0:31:39 into the trir
0:31:40 Chantry I think
0:31:43 there's doesn't the beasts always enjoy
0:31:46 killing a little bit it can your Beast
0:31:49 isn't
0:31:51 you and if you don't want to enjoy
0:31:55 killing BR you've also had some [ __ ]
0:31:57 up childhood trauma you probably need a
0:31:59 psychiatrist of some sort
0:32:01 but if you don't want to feel good like
0:32:04 you like killing that doesn't mean
0:32:05 that's how you have to
0:32:08 stay good people don't worry about being
0:32:13 bad I'd push back on that well then go
0:32:17 ahead those who really I'm just going to
0:32:20 say in my experience there are people
0:32:23 who think that they are good that they
0:32:25 are doing what is good that they are
0:32:27 even convince themselves that what
0:32:29 they're doing is for the greater good
0:32:30 and they are still horrific monsters who
0:32:34 do that kind of good and and they can
0:32:38 even struggle with doing what is for the
0:32:41 greater good is is is hard am I doing
0:32:43 the right thing and still do it I
0:32:48 don't maybe I'm I'm going to into my own
0:32:51 personal experience here but
0:32:54 um sometimes if a powerful person comes
0:32:57 comes into your life and sees an empty
0:33:01 vessel they will pour themselves into
0:33:04 it until you start believing that what
0:33:07 they have poured inside you is
0:33:11 you and it's very hard to extricate
0:33:14 yourself from that
0:33:15 thinking and it can take
0:33:21 some distance and time and space to pull
0:33:25 yourself apart from what they've made
0:33:27 you
0:33:29 and the
0:33:30 more worried you are about who you who
0:33:33 you are the the further away your core
0:33:36 feels the easier it is for them to pour
0:33:38 themselves into you to the point where
0:33:40 even now if they asked you to do things
0:33:42 it's hard to say
0:33:45 no as far as far as pen dragon and all
0:33:48 that is concerned um if
0:33:51 you I'm not necessarily going to
0:33:54 agree with you know you spending time
0:33:57 with and and I don't think that's a good
0:33:59 thing but it doesn't have to be a good
0:34:01 thing and it also you don't have to give
0:34:03 a [ __ ] what I have to say um what I will
0:34:06 say
0:34:07 is it is my experience and therefore
0:34:11 belief that eventually people like that
0:34:15 people who are removed from Humanity who
0:34:19 find righteousness in their own actions
0:34:22 people of
0:34:24 action who who pour themselves into you
0:34:28 um they eventually ask you to make
0:34:31 choices because it's never just
0:34:35 about eventually you don't even get to
0:34:38 be you eventually you are just a
0:34:40 reflection of them and when there are
0:34:43 outside forces when there are friends
0:34:44 and other loved ones who compete for the
0:34:47 attention of or affection of those
0:34:52 who of them of of their own well then uh
0:34:57 then eventually they they ask you to
0:34:59 make choices and they make it as hard as
0:35:01 possible to make a choice that isn't
0:35:04 them um wi has been gripping onto the
0:35:08 soap holder that's built into the shower
0:35:10 and as he speaks she grips harder and
0:35:12 harder until it crunches under her grasp
0:35:15 with a sudden chattering
0:35:17 noise and I'm not saying that's even
0:35:20 necessarily a bad thing if you do choose
0:35:22 one way or another so long as it's your
0:35:24 choice and I think at least in terms of
0:35:26 pen dragon as far as you keep in mind
0:35:29 that there is good inside of him because
0:35:31 there's good inside
0:35:33 of anyone I mean if you look deep enough
0:35:36 there is a core of understanding in
0:35:39 everyone but BR has put gently if it
0:35:44 seems that wi would be okay with her
0:35:46 hand settling there a hand at W's side
0:35:50 to be calming I I guess so long as you
0:35:55 keep in mind the danger
0:35:58 even if the danger is fun don't let the
0:36:01 fun totally silence the voice that
0:36:07 says maybe this is too dangerous maybe
0:36:10 this is a
0:36:13 mistake but again I you know neither wi
0:36:15 or I is really somebody to to judge
0:36:18 anyone for liking the wrong person it
0:36:21 feels it feels like every single choice
0:36:24 that we have is Twisted
0:36:27 and it feels like like I want to keep
0:36:31 hold of my heart and be true to it and
0:36:36 any way that I can to be true to my
0:36:39 heart to take these moments before War
0:36:43 to get to hang out with you two in a
0:36:45 bathroom and I I guess um maybe talk
0:36:49 about my sex life I guess that was the
0:36:51 original question I'm sorry is this the
0:36:54 part where you want me to leave the room
0:36:55 now cuz I don't I don't think I need to
0:36:56 be here for this don't think we asked
0:36:58 you to leave the room to start with it's
0:37:01 not it's not like you don't have a sex
0:37:03 life of some sort next time maybe I
0:37:05 don't know have more blood so you're not
0:37:07 starving the next morning
0:37:10 that's BR looks like she's been punched
0:37:13 in the face P pace yourself what did I
0:37:17 what what did I say it's like a basic
0:37:20 tip right we're talking about sex stuff
0:37:22 now instead of the emotional stuff not
0:37:24 that they're not intertwined but well I
0:37:26 don't know he looks at win I don't know
0:37:28 if they're intertwined or not for all of
0:37:29 us but it's spending blood no emotions
0:37:32 and physic you know it doesn't matter R
0:37:34 what's
0:37:35 up kind of was still talking about
0:37:38 emotional stuff oh sorry I didn't catch
0:37:42 the
0:37:44 then I didn't I didn't mean to run out
0:37:47 of blood I what was your first
0:37:50 time as far as any of us
0:37:54 know it's nothing to be embarrassed
0:37:56 about
0:37:58 but I am embarrassed you don't need to
0:38:01 be and I know you are but I I could have
0:38:05 hurt someone well that that's why this
0:38:08 is different than the gala cuz we're
0:38:10 around you're not
0:38:12 alone you've got backup that's what a
0:38:15 codery is and almost as a fancy word for
0:38:19 didn't your good instincts you went you
0:38:22 found Johnny who can you know what are
0:38:25 you going to do it's Johnny could pick
0:38:28 you up off the like hold you at arms
0:38:29 length like is you know it was a good it
0:38:30 was a good move it was a smart it was
0:38:32 smart but I'm getting pretty good at
0:38:34 wiggling out of his grip good that's a
0:38:37 good skill to have not in that
0:38:39 circumstance and then you find win or me
0:38:42 or miles BR do you want to know why I
0:38:46 said I needed you to stop being sexy
0:38:48 what and just feed the already the other
0:38:50 night what I I don't know if I do do I
0:38:55 so I went to feed the the other night on
0:38:57 the way back to the house while you and
0:38:59 Miles were still in torper mhm and I
0:39:02 popped up on this couple in the park
0:39:03 that were necking and figured I could
0:39:05 probably get a quick meal off of one of
0:39:07 them and I thought I would probably be
0:39:10 have an in by offering them a place to
0:39:12 [ __ ] what that didn't work real well no
0:39:15 obviously it didn't work well what the
0:39:16 hell's the matter with you oh like you
0:39:17 would do better I wouldn't approach two
0:39:19 people at once okay you guys have seen
0:39:21 the worst feeding that I've ever done
0:39:24 well you don't you've never come feeding
0:39:26 with me
0:39:28 so that being said I'm short on blood
0:39:31 sometimes because I'm very bad at
0:39:33 feeding feeding in a social setting like
0:39:36 that there's a reason I put all mine
0:39:37 into coins and stuff right I've been
0:39:39 short on blood for sex sometimes you get
0:39:42 excited you lose track it didn't um it
0:39:46 didn't
0:39:47 feel dull like you said it would I don't
0:39:51 I don't know if maybe that's because I
0:39:53 don't have anything human to compare it
0:39:55 to but but um I don't know when's the
0:39:58 only one here who could speak to the
0:39:59 difference between the two for me it's
0:40:01 duller than it was you know what um oh
0:40:04 God this is a terrible comparison but
0:40:07 lay it on let's do this terrible
0:40:09 comparisons Bring It On do you remember
0:40:12 when no stay here Neil we're in this
0:40:13 together she reaches out and takes his
0:40:15 hand I'm still kind of mostly not
0:40:17 talking about sex I I guess I am but
0:40:20 it's um do you remember when Ramirez
0:40:23 brought us that garbage
0:40:25 Pizza yes and and it it tasted like like
0:40:29 ash yes but still kind of like pizza mhm
0:40:33 it's part of the curse of cane is that
0:40:35 normally how sex feels like like ash but
0:40:39 still kind of yeah that's it's more
0:40:42 emotional Than Physical speak for
0:40:44 yourself I have good sex okay well you
0:40:47 only get to do like once every 10 years
0:40:48 so I don't know what to tell you oh
0:40:50 buddy oh dude I I guess what I'm trying
0:40:53 to say is that it felt really real
0:40:58 and um I I don't know if I'm getting
0:41:02 kind of distracted by look I'm trying to
0:41:07 keep and follow my heart and I know that
0:41:11 those maybe are in conflict with each
0:41:14 other but I don't know if I could do
0:41:16 either without doing both and
0:41:20 Neil maybe yours is less complicated
0:41:23 than mine maybe you really need to go
0:41:26 see Nora
0:41:28 it's something I've been wanting to do
0:41:29 for a while but the world keeps ending
0:41:31 but that's the point right like that's
0:41:34 even if my feelings and letting them
0:41:38 grow and exploring
0:41:40 them with with someone that maybe I
0:41:44 shouldn't but but I want to and it feels
0:41:47 all of it the feelings the physicality
0:41:51 it feels real it's the end of everything
0:41:54 so so it's the only time we have left
0:41:56 it's the only time that we have left to
0:41:59 talk to each other here like this and
0:42:01 for me to see if the pole that I feel
0:42:06 even if it's stupid even if it's towards
0:42:09 the same person who's done terrible
0:42:13 things to to me to us to a lot of people
0:42:18 maybe the maybe the end of the world is
0:42:22 really the only time that we have to do
0:42:26 something as
0:42:27 crazy as fall in love with someone
0:42:31 anyone to reach out to someone anyone
0:42:34 and and when I I know you're scared of
0:42:37 losing yourself but you know I I look I
0:42:41 don't know what the full blood Bond
0:42:42 feels like but I know that I I know that
0:42:45 I didn't stop loving you guys I didn't
0:42:48 stop loving my family any less when I
0:42:50 was twice
0:42:52 bound but what we thought mattered less
0:42:55 it's more like I found ways to
0:42:58 justify it's not that I
0:43:02 didn't
0:43:05 look to me right all of this and I see
0:43:09 what you're saying
0:43:10 but that's all you can't be honest about
0:43:13 doing it if you're not living in the
0:43:15 moment at least when it comes to sex or
0:43:18 love or whatever it is is very grounding
0:43:20 in the moment thing in my
0:43:23 experience and ever since the new year
0:43:28 I've been living in the future and I
0:43:30 can't
0:43:31 stop so I don't know if that's going to
0:43:33 happen for me but if it can happen for
0:43:35 you um you know maybe you're right maybe
0:43:38 he sees it for a little bit just just
0:43:39 keep in
0:43:41 mind I don't know if I've ever felt what
0:43:44 Like Love Actually is for real but um so
0:43:48 long as you keep in keep in mind
0:43:51 um the the You're right our time is
0:43:54 finite and if that's where you want to
0:43:55 spend it then it and I think that's okay
0:43:59 and whether or not people judge you for
0:44:02 it or think you're making a mistake I
0:44:03 mean people have thought I've been
0:44:04 making mistakes for 30 years and it's
0:44:07 you learn to live with it and enjoy what
0:44:10 you can um so if you're going to do it
0:44:13 and and you're going to do it um then I
0:44:17 don't
0:44:18 know stay safe I guess as best you can I
0:44:21 mean none of this is safe we're all
0:44:22 going to die inspiring words is always I
0:44:25 would say spef
0:44:28 specifically someone who says I'm
0:44:31 capable of an atrocity but I didn't do
0:44:33 it look how good I am is not actually
0:44:37 doing a nice thing and that's that's
0:44:39 sort of I guess my last piece of advice
0:44:41 in regards to that not doing an evil Act
0:44:45 is not an act of good that's
0:44:49 all if you want to go with your gut on
0:44:51 this let your heart guide you go ahead
0:44:55 have fun with him but don't get so lost
0:44:58 to it that your head can't pull you back
0:45:01 that's all I'm saying I trust him not to
0:45:04 hurt
0:45:04 you kind of yeah he's going to make a
0:45:07 lot of threats against us um to get you
0:45:10 to comply uh in the future that's just
0:45:13 on the table it's going to happen it is
0:45:15 happening I mean it literally happened
0:45:16 last night right so
0:45:19 um just just because he say just because
0:45:23 he makes a threat doesn't mean you have
0:45:25 to comply like you know follow your
0:45:28 heart but you know yours not for our
0:45:31 sake or or or his don't sell yourself
0:45:35 for his redemption or our
0:45:38 lives I'm um always trying to keep track
0:45:42 of myself it's hard to do when there's
0:45:46 not a lot I know about
0:45:48 myself a lot of it I've found with you
0:45:52 guys not just my past not just trying to
0:45:57 figure out who and what I am and where
0:46:01 I've come from but who I am now and I
0:46:07 hold really tightly on to that I I don't
0:46:11 want to lose myself I I feel like I work
0:46:15 really hard at it and I feel like it
0:46:17 just kind of keeps on getting more
0:46:19 difficult
0:46:22 it's it's going to get more
0:46:24 difficult forever
0:46:27 it's just a compounding weight the
0:46:30 stones never stop being stacked ever
0:46:34 so I guess at the end of the day I'm um
0:46:38 greedy I want to spend as much time with
0:46:41 you guys as I can and I want to try and
0:46:46 have enough good just as much as I can
0:46:49 pack in because right now miles and
0:46:52 Johnny they're in a meeting
0:46:54 that is going to pull us closer and
0:46:57 closer to a war we can't do much
0:47:01 about I
0:47:04 just I guess I'm just trying to find as
0:47:07 much happiness as I can until then then
0:47:10 why don't we get out of this bathtub and
0:47:11 go watch a movie on the
0:47:13 bed okay depending on how that meeting
0:47:16 goes we might only have one or two
0:47:17 nights
0:47:22 left miles
0:47:24 Johnny the two of you are accompanied by
0:47:29 some of the most dangerous Kindred and
0:47:31 the
0:47:32 camria and to you miles a question has
0:47:34 been posed and as you consider that
0:47:37 question you are confronted by the
0:47:39 ghastly sight of the bones of your
0:47:42 sire and the iron ciret dignitas that he
0:47:45 once carried proudly a symbol of his
0:47:48 loyalty to the
0:47:50 Venture
0:47:52 sound Fades away in that moment and and
0:47:56 becomes difficult to focus on anything
0:47:59 else gr granta
0:48:03 grandchild I have a great many resources
0:48:07 available to me and I offer them to you
0:48:10 should you demonstrate the wisdom to
0:48:12 properly use them for this
0:48:14 war
0:48:16 what what Aid do you
0:48:19 wish now I'll take that frenzy check
0:48:22 spending a willp
0:48:25 power I assume it's self-control it is
0:48:28 difficulty eat I will have one success
0:48:32 due to the due to the willpower it's a
0:48:35 good
0:48:36 spend you hold
0:48:38 on closing his eyes looking away getting
0:48:42 back to the question posed to
0:48:46 him I would be a Miss grandsire if I
0:48:49 didn't at least pose this as a possible
0:48:53 solution
0:48:54 to the rebellious acts of the
0:48:58 but they know of the army coming to New
0:49:01 York they know of our actions to defend
0:49:03 ourselves in New
0:49:05 Haven instead of attacking New York we
0:49:08 should solidify our forces in New Haven
0:49:11 and remove all of the pieces that they
0:49:14 will be sending there there are many
0:49:16 that are
0:49:17 interested and will be taken off guard
0:49:20 by our sudden and inexplicable change of
0:49:24 tactics grandchild
0:49:28 such sentiment is the flaw of the bruha
0:49:32 not the
0:49:33 Venture the only V the only
0:49:36 value that New Haven brings is its
0:49:38 proximity to New York we didn't come
0:49:42 this far for tertiary
0:49:44 prizes Johnny steps forward um and just
0:49:49 kind of quietly into miles I'm sorry for
0:49:53 giving you that ridiculous plan my my
0:49:55 prince and kind of nods and then steps
0:49:58 away as I said I was sure that it had
0:50:02 been at least
0:50:04 considered and wanted to make sure all
0:50:08 of our bases were
0:50:09 covered right anyway Connecticut has
0:50:13 multiple SWAT teams police forces
0:50:16 heavily armored and with sufficient
0:50:21 Weaponry 50% of these resources across
0:50:24 Connecticut will be redirected to you
0:50:26 you will hold the night when the day
0:50:28 comes they will begin raids on the
0:50:30 Sabbat who are attempting to hold New
0:50:32 Haven that will buy you some time it is
0:50:36 my gift to you my boy thank you grire
0:50:39 that is all I need is a little extra
0:50:42 Manpower a bit of supplies there's this
0:50:46 noise that sounds like a [ __ ] tractor
0:50:50 trailer outside and someone just leaning
0:50:54 on the horn
0:50:56 what the hell is that m g lets go of
0:50:59 your hand and steps out of the room a
0:51:02 disturbance Grand we are
0:51:04 investigating find out what it is I have

0:51:43 sound is in the room we'll go over by
0:51:45 her reading window should we find the
0:51:48 others or at least look for what that is
0:51:51 she'll go look out the window to see if
0:51:53 she can see if there's a truck outside

1:00:41 that SWAT team over to you as soon as uh
1:00:43 as soon by morning I'll keep you
1:00:45 appraised he hangs up oh that's done I
1:00:48 look around you said there's ghouls in
1:00:50 here right uh a bunch of them have like
1:00:52 split up and are going off in different
1:00:54 directions I as I'm going out and I kind
1:00:57 of get away from Luc and I I get close
1:00:59 to the fireplace I'm like can you pull
1:01:01 that out of
1:01:02 there yes your grace and they like reach
1:01:06 into and they they pause actually almost
1:01:10 like relieved that this wasn't just some
1:01:12 evil act for your amusement and with the
1:01:16 poker they will get out the slightly
1:01:19 warped pin I will grab it and I will
1:01:23 pocket it and I will go to to meet up
1:01:26 with my
1:01:31 Cod outside there's the chaos that's
1:01:34 described brida seems to be trying to
1:01:36 take it all in occasional flashes of
1:01:38 pink on her cheek if she catches sight
1:01:40 of Luca but nothing that lingers too
1:01:44 long there's way too much going on just
1:01:46 because it's a big crowd and lots of
1:01:49 things tend to gather when there's a big
1:01:51 crowd um is there anything gathering in
1:01:53 the shadowlands or the Umbra you do not
1:01:55 see anything out of the ordinary there
1:01:58 okay warlord K comes out and there is a
1:02:02 very sudden sense of unease from your
1:02:06 friends
1:02:08 and warlord
1:02:10 ksh scans the
1:02:13 group it has been indicated that the
1:02:16 sabat has attacked much sooner than
1:02:19 intelligence suggested is that true
1:02:22 Johnny checking to see if anyone's uh
1:02:24 speaking up realizes that this is
1:02:27 probably on him and squares off with ksh
1:02:30 it is really and then pen Dragon gives
1:02:35 you a
1:02:36 look
1:02:38 yes my men in New Haven just confirmed a
1:02:41 Greatful smile that BR tries to hide as
1:02:44 soon as it pops up then you know what to
1:02:47 do he steps away and there's this moment
1:02:50 where him and Xavier lock eyes ksh yes K
1:02:54 and Xavier and then just as quickly as
1:02:56 he had walked out he steps back in and
1:02:59 is gone Luca looks to the group of you
1:03:01 uh we have to go now if we're looking to
1:03:03 help people okay Johnny what are the
1:03:06 areas that are going to need the most
1:03:07 defense we'll talk about that on the way
1:03:09 down to New Haven we'll start loading up
1:03:11 I think I come out at that point I'm
1:03:13 like all right I guess hopefully you
1:03:15 have room for five more we do I'll run
1:03:18 and get some weapons and supplies stuff
1:03:20 from you guys' rooms we'll be ready in
1:03:22 five don't worry I'll look at the floors
1:03:24 and BR goes to gather people's stuff
1:03:27 doing as she says and making sure to not
1:03:30 get entrapped Johnny will look over to
1:03:33 pen dragon and kind of walk up where he
1:03:36 can kind of like talk to him a little
1:03:38 bit quiet quieter than you normally
1:03:41 would why do I feel there's a whole set
1:03:44 of tactics going on right now that we
1:03:47 haven't been let in on he leans in close
1:03:50 and says to
1:03:52 you there is no way the sabat have
1:03:55 struck
1:03:56 your friends are
1:03:59 liars Johnny kind of mols all that over
1:04:04 well thanks for saving my life back
1:04:06 there hopefully I'll live long enough to
1:04:08 return the favor sometime and he'll
1:04:11 start heading over towards the vehicles
1:04:12 to start loading up I figure BR and WN
1:04:15 are probably pretty quick to come back
1:04:18 maybe loading up first from when and
1:04:21 miles's room yep they didn't bring much
1:04:23 with them it was a pretty grab and go
1:04:26 kind of trip it was basically just a
1:04:27 duffel bag and I think really the only
1:04:30 stop is Neil can we grab your stuff or
1:04:33 do you need to um what's anything from
1:04:36 your room I didn't have any it was just
1:04:38 um it was just the clothes you brought
1:04:40 and I'm wearing them and I so do you
1:04:42 have all your fanny pack gear I didn't
1:04:44 have that in the first place weird we
1:04:46 ran from the Haven when Lucen called I
1:04:50 didn't have time my things are at Miles
1:04:53 okay let's get this show on the road
1:04:56 there's some clapping uh when miles
1:04:58 comes out Maya calls out see something
1:05:01 inspiring
1:05:03 well we've known it's coming for a long
1:05:06 time and we're as prepared as we can be
1:05:09 under the circumstances and we're going
1:05:11 to show all these weird religious
1:05:14 Fanatics that New Haven is not a place
1:05:16 for them let's go protect our
1:05:19 home kind of seeing that it's about time
1:05:22 to start piling into the car and heading
1:05:24 out br turns and goes to find Pendragon
1:05:29 when she finds pen Dragon he is being
1:05:32 fitted for his armor his red
1:05:36 coat a you recognize the case that held
1:05:40 the sword he had shown you guys earlier
1:05:43 and he is essentially getting ready to
1:05:46 fight while he is getting ready to fight
1:05:49 you notice he is standing in a very
1:05:52 complex ritual Circle and
1:05:56 his
1:05:58 vassel and some of the young trir that
1:06:03 associate with him are performing a
1:06:05 ritual brda hesitates not wanting to

1:07:30 Circle without moving a single grain of
1:07:35 salt or any of the various other ritual
1:07:39 components that were used to arrange the
1:07:41 circle and once in the
1:07:45 center the brewha that you've moved to
1:07:49 embrace leans down kind of looming and P
1:07:55 PS brda into a kiss brda kisses back

1:08:18 of lightly grabs you by the belt and
1:08:20 just pulls you up sets you down outside
1:08:22 the circle that is effectively what she
1:08:25 meant so she sends back a smile and runs
1:08:27 back out to join the war once outside

1:08:33 and rush off towards New Haven to go and
1:08:38 repel the alleged sabat incursion that

1:09:14 the cars BR is shrugging on the red
1:09:16 leather jacket that Johnny had given her
1:09:18 so long ago that she's been carrying
1:09:20 around effectively since they got back
1:09:22 to pen dragon's Mansion she sees when
