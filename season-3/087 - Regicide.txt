0:00:31 [Music]
0:00:37 last time on path of night miles
0:00:40 bloodbound Wynn as she slept Wynn awoke and
0:00:43 confronted him ultimately Wynn was bound a
0:00:46 second time when attempted to convince
0:00:48 Johnny to choose to spend gehenna with
0:00:51 his family Johnny refused choosing
0:00:54 instead the family he has now red awoke
0:00:57 starving and mutually bloodbound to pend
0:00:59 dragon and just barely managed to get
0:01:01 away Johnny found budha and they found
0:01:04 Neil just before the Cy was summoned to
0:01:06 two separate meetings forced to make a
0:01:08 choice between justicar Luc sind and
0:01:10 Prince Roman Pendragon the Cy splits
0:01:14 when alone goes to meet Luc sind Bound
0:01:16 by Blood to the justicar a second
0:01:18 [Music]
0:01:25 time she shuts the door and she'll take
0:01:27 her phone out of her pocket and look at
0:01:29 the time
0:01:30 no you lost about five minutes okay and
0:01:33 she will all right where the [ __ ] am I
0:01:36 going [ __ ] and she just starts going
0:01:38 downstairs she
0:01:40 figures last time if I wandered enough I
0:01:44 wound up near where Miles was so let's
0:01:46 just go on Instinct I'm already near the
0:01:50 [ __ ] so let's just keep wandering she
0:01:53 does say all this out loud and she just
0:01:55 starts heading for stairwells and going
0:02:00 down stairs you head for a stairwell you
0:02:03 actually will see that by one of the
0:02:05 stairwells is actually a whole ass
0:02:07 elevator that is arranged and waiting at
0:02:11 the
0:02:11 elevator is your
0:02:14 quy
0:02:16 hello wi
0:02:18 here hey oh God yeah yeah hey nice to
0:02:24 see you I'm okay I'm just really hungry
0:02:29 yep I know the look Refreshments are
0:02:31 being provided that's what they said and
0:02:33 now that we're here uh I look around for
0:02:36 the elevator guy can
0:02:38 we right this
0:02:40 way okay he slides a key into a pad by
0:02:45 the elevator and turns the
0:02:50 key Taps a few uh digits on the pad and
0:02:55 the elevator doors open this way each of
0:02:58 you get onto the elevator
0:03:00 he selects the option B2 the elevator
0:03:03 door
0:03:04 closes and you descend how many uh
0:03:07 options for basement are on this
0:03:09 elevator it looks like there are three
0:03:11 options for basement and four options
0:03:15 for uh actual floors to the building or
0:03:18 the Haven miles nods has had an
0:03:22 appreciation how far would we fall you
0:03:25 know I don't want to think about right
0:03:26 now if the elevator Falls lie down it's
0:03:29 a little crowded in here when I'll make
0:03:32 room for
0:03:35 you
0:03:37 okay Neil presses the B2 button a couple
0:03:40 more times in that way that anyone who
0:03:41 wants the elevator to hurry up just
0:03:44 mindlessly presses the button it does
0:03:46 nothing wind kind of like puts a hand on
0:03:48 his shoulder and like squeezes like it's
0:03:50 going to be okay I'm not scared of
0:03:52 elevators usually I just want us to get
0:03:54 where we're going I know all Johnny when
0:03:57 the elevator doors open you'll know
0:03:59 noticed that a lot of the walls here are
0:04:01 reinforced this is very much like a bomb
0:04:04 shelter down here and you
0:04:07 reminded that the
0:04:11 bruha in many domains have had histories
0:04:14 of building what they called castles and
0:04:17 it'd be just these
0:04:18 fortified locations that the clan can
0:04:21 rally when things at when things get
0:04:23 bad and judging by the kind of the care
0:04:26 and consideration put into this space
0:04:29 you start kind of getting the feeling
0:04:31 that when Roman Pendragon needs to
0:04:33 rally and be at a secure location that
0:04:37 he absolutely controls and can defend
0:04:40 this is it you are greeted by four more
0:04:44 of Roman Pendragons men and the
0:04:47 Coterie is escorted down these long
0:04:49 halls and into a room that is mostly
0:04:55 file cabinets a like safe set into the
0:05:00 wall that's pretty large there are
0:05:02 weapons on racks artifacts hailing from
0:05:07 various points of the Roman
0:05:10 Empire and a
0:05:12 table normally these kinds of meeting
0:05:15 like tables are arranged that the seats
0:05:17 are spaced evenly and the table is clear
0:05:21 but this time there are files everywhere
0:05:25 and it is a
0:05:27 mess and on this table Neel you
0:05:33 recognize this old looking almost
0:05:38 grimoire and you recognize this because
0:05:42 you catch a
0:05:44 word and you see the word
0:05:49 gehenna and as the group of you draw
0:05:53 near you start seeing files and these
0:05:56 files all seem to have references at
0:05:59 different parts of the globe various
0:06:01 cities and the ones that are open you
0:06:04 see sometimes unusual images reports on
0:06:08 strange
0:06:09 happenings does this almost look like a
0:06:13 combination of the files that were in
0:06:16 Yan Peterson's like safe house in New
0:06:19 York the weird [ __ ] that like Katarina
0:06:22 had in her apartment this looks like the
0:06:25 files from Yan Peter zun's location okay
0:06:29 but opened up up displayed everywhere to
0:06:31 be read like the same files like the
0:06:34 same files Neil J blurs out I've seen
0:06:38 those is Pendragon Here Pendragon is
0:06:42 looking over the table arms crossed and
0:06:46 it looks like he's
0:06:48 been pondering
0:06:51 something for maybe as long as he's been
0:06:54 awake
0:06:55 tonight where did
0:06:57 those miles those are your sire files
0:07:01 Johnny looks to the member of pen
0:07:04 dragon's Army that brought us here and
0:07:06 gives him a withering gaze and says
0:07:12 Refreshments he looks to Pendragon Pen
0:07:15 Dragon just nods and he quickly excuses
0:07:19 himself so why have we been summoned
0:07:21 heran
0:07:24 Dragon I have
0:07:27 questions and do it seem
0:07:31 the group of you might have
0:07:33 answers seeing all the files and the
0:07:36 book that said gehenna which I'm going
0:07:38 to take might be fragments of the book
0:07:40 of Nod or something like that Neil is
0:07:43 already lost in it despite the fact that
0:07:45 he usually shy away from Pendragon or
0:07:49 anyone of power like that has walked
0:07:51 over to the table and is just staring at
0:07:54 all of it like his mind going a million
0:07:57 places at once and it's just looking at
0:07:59 all of it barely seems to hear pen
0:08:01 dragon or the rest of your conversation
0:08:03 fire away we'll see what we can do but
0:08:06 we do fire
0:08:08 away how very
0:08:10 Cavalier I've been accused of that on
0:08:12 more than one occasion two young women
0:08:16 maybe a little older than brda make
0:08:19 their way into the room and they sort of
0:08:22 have their heads facing down and they
0:08:25 kneel down on the cold
0:08:27 floor and simply wait to be devoured BR
0:08:32 winces she looks over to Johnny barely
0:08:35 keeping herself together she's still
0:08:38 looking at him for help for that she's
0:08:41 almost her body is starting to like
0:08:43 Sidle towards the source I won't let you
0:08:46 drink too deep eyes wide but and nods
0:08:50 and she dips her head to Pendragon to
0:08:54 the man who brought the women in and
0:08:57 says thank you
0:09:00 she goes over to one of
0:09:03 them one moment please mhm what are your
0:09:06 willpower
0:09:07 scores um and this is for the purposes
0:09:10 of using a presence effect gotcha so

0:09:21 effects of psychic assault fra has four
0:09:24 willpower does iron will also come up
0:09:27 nope it's just straight up presence uh
0:09:29 Johnny is oblivious to what's going on
0:09:31 it does not affect him in the slightest
0:09:34 bro
0:09:35 M you frenzy on one of the nelt girls
0:09:40 rushing to devour her immediately Johnny
0:09:43 will snatch her up and hold her in a
0:09:46 lock now before we get there Johnny I
0:09:49 still need you to make a self-control
0:09:51 check against the opportunity to feed uh
0:09:55 your selfcontrol as a difficulty for if
0:09:56 you succeed on this role you can
0:09:58 absolutely snap match up BR I'm not even
0:10:00 going to have you roll for it but first
0:10:02 we have to make sure that you're not you

0:10:24 uh Johnny will snatch her up in a lock
0:10:27 BR is by no means strong but she is
0:10:31 slippery and in her frenzied State she
0:10:35 is doing what she can to get to feed to
0:10:38 get to the source to get what the Beast
0:10:40 needs why don't you give me a DEX plus
0:10:42 brawl roll oh no against Johnny's
0:10:44 strength plus
0:10:46 [Music]

0:10:51 frenzy but you could tell me I'm wrong

0:10:56 right now then I believe it is six
0:10:59 successes eight successes to hold you in
0:11:01 place with brda securely in Johnny's
0:11:04 arms when we'll step in front of her
0:11:06 Johnny will do you one better he will
0:11:08 actually take her head in hand and turn
0:11:10 her head to face you and Wynn will put on
0:11:12 her best mom voice and say stop in an
0:11:16 attempt to get her out of frenzy okay
0:11:18 spend point will power and go ahead and
0:11:20 roll uh one success right you hear the
0:11:24 mom voice you see the beautiful seagull
0:11:27 eyes that meet yours and she calms you
0:11:31 and for the first time tonight you feel
0:11:35 like your Beast is not going to just
0:11:39 throw you down and take
0:11:41 over you feel confident now that you can
0:11:43 do this R's grip on Johnny feels more
0:11:47 studied more human despite the coldness
0:11:51 that can leech out under her gloves from
0:11:54 her hands and you feel her body relax
0:11:58 you see her eyes
0:11:59 focusing in on a win not a girl Johnny's
0:12:03 grip does not change he holds you strong
0:12:07 and fast and is completely implacable
0:12:11 we're going to do this as a team
0:12:13 okay
0:12:14 okay all right Johnny bring her over
0:12:18 Johnny looks over to Pendragon what
0:12:21 kind of look is he giving all of this I
0:12:23 was actually going to ask that cuz I'm
0:12:24 like right by the table near him Ro
0:12:26 perceptions plus
0:12:28 empathy two
0:12:31 successes do either of my specs in int
0:12:34 uh intuitive or my empathy spec in
0:12:36 emotions count uh you may apply emotions
0:12:39 okay uh I have five
0:12:42 successes there is a very professional
0:12:45 air of confidence coming from him it is
0:12:48 as though he is simply waiting for the C
0:12:51 Coterie to be ready for this
0:12:53 conversation details on how the group of
0:12:55 you get there seem irrelevant Tim Johnny
0:12:59 bodily hauls you over to one of the
0:13:01 blood dolls BR is not resisting in the
0:13:04 slightest she seems to feel more secure
0:13:07 by that and in a voice and you're not
0:13:10 sure whether he's speaking to you or the
0:13:14 Blood Doll he just says gently
0:13:18 now BR checks in with Wynn it's okay you
0:13:21 got this and goes to feed the girl tilt
0:13:25 her head to the side she
0:13:28 seems
0:13:30 experienced with this sort of thing and
0:13:32 the Blood
0:13:34 Doll gives herself over to you allowing
0:13:38 you to take as much as you
0:13:40 will do to win bolstering Brea In This
0:13:44 Moment R will take three
0:13:47 blood she makes this uh nearly inaudible
0:13:52 gasp as the kiss takes
0:13:55 her and slowly she falls asleep in your
0:14:00 grasp after she's taken three Johnny
0:14:03 will put his hand on your jaw to stop
0:14:08 you from taking anym and BR immediately
0:14:10 jolts away taking only the moment to
0:14:13 make sure the wound is licked and that
0:14:15 she's not jostling the girl in her sleep
0:14:18 uh Johnny then lets you go looks at you
0:14:22 and looks at the other Blood
0:14:24 Doll just like that gently again what
0:14:28 about you Johnny just gives you a look
0:14:32 like do not disagree with me BR
0:14:35 immediately folds under the tone of
0:14:38 Johnny's dad stare and goes over to the
0:14:42 other girl she tilts her head to the
0:14:44 side exactly like the last girl did and
0:14:47 that takes BR a a moment the
0:14:52 reminder for the first girl she was
0:14:55 almost reveling in the calm the relief
0:14:58 from the drumming of the beasts and that
0:15:01 little hint of horror takes BR a second
0:15:06 yeah her her makeup is perfect her hair
0:15:08 is perfect excellent perfume she's
0:15:11 dressed very fashionably she is well
0:15:14 cared for but there is no doubt in your
0:15:17 mind this girl is cattle there's guilt
0:15:21 in the way that Brea lays her hand on
0:15:24 this girl brushing perfumed hair out of
0:15:27 the way but she will sink her fangs in
0:15:30 all the
0:15:31 same after she's taken three Vite Johnny
0:15:36 will put his hand on her shoulder thank
0:15:38 you Johnny I don't we don't have any
0:15:40 awareness that any disciplines or
0:15:43 anything were used here right it just
0:15:44 seems like BR went nuts yep out of
0:15:47 hunger okay does that include me you
0:15:49 just remember looking at them hungrily
0:15:50 and then losing control uh when watches
0:15:53 as Johnny
0:15:55 refuses The Blood Doll and there's no
0:15:58 judgment she gets it he's a dad these
0:16:01 are young girls she's still worried
0:16:06 because there's no doubt Pendragon's
0:16:08 going to say some [ __ ] because he always
0:16:10 [ __ ] does and Johnny's hungry and
0:16:14 he's going to say some [ __ ] because he's
0:16:16 got a short [ __ ] fuse when he's
0:16:18 hungry and on days that end in
0:16:22 why and so she kind of walks up to him
0:16:26 and kind of like knocks on his his
0:16:29 hipbone just one of her weird ways of
0:16:32 touching people and she kind of turns
0:16:34 her forearm out to him
0:16:37 offering Johnny
0:16:42 um Johnny just leans in a little bit
0:16:45 kind of pressing shoulder Tosh shoulder
0:16:47 against with wind and um kind of leans
0:16:52 in Taps foreheads with her and then kind
0:16:55 of goes back to standing up just kind of
0:16:57 straight she gives this a nod respecting
0:17:00 his choice but she does stay close to
0:17:03 him like in case something pops off she
0:17:06 wants to be able to be there to try and
0:17:07 grab him looks of gratitude to Johnny to
0:17:12 win she's finally okay she can finally
0:17:15 focus and she finally feels more like
0:17:17 herself Johnny looks over to Pendragon
0:17:21 and then down at the blood
0:17:23 dolls and with a quick side glance at
0:17:27 one of Pendragon's men
0:17:29 Your Grace thank you for the
0:17:32 refreshments if you would indulge the
0:17:34 humanity of your guests and allies it
0:17:39 would be appreciated that these two
0:17:41 be escorted peaceably from here he gives
0:17:46 a nod and the bruha that actually
0:17:49 escorted you guys down here heads over
0:17:52 to the two girls and he just kind of
0:17:53 Picks Them Up not like dragging them off
0:17:56 or anything but you know the lifts them
0:18:00 and he will actually leave the room with
0:18:02 them Johnny watches him go and kind of
0:18:05 frowns at that he is very concerned that
0:18:10 they will simply be cast aside once out
0:18:13 of out of view but she nods in thanks to
0:18:16 pen
0:18:17 dragon
0:18:19 now onto matters of
0:18:22 important it would seem that the Inner
0:18:27 Circle has been hiding crucial
0:18:30 information regarding ongoings across
0:18:33 the
0:18:34 globe he kind of Paces as he starts to
0:18:38 think he's normally just
0:18:41 very collected but as he starts to bring
0:18:44 this up you can feel the way this news
0:18:48 is causing his patience to wither BR had
0:18:51 been looking actually in Neil's
0:18:53 Direction um something that he had said
0:18:56 earlier seems to be kind of
0:18:59 on the edge of her mind like she's not
0:19:02 sure where that would lead but at the
0:19:05 words inner circle she looks over at
0:19:08 Miles he's paying attention but it's a
0:19:12 weird position to put in because his
0:19:14 sire was super against the stuff getting
0:19:16 out so seeing where this goes R kind of
0:19:20 tilts her head wondering if there will
0:19:23 be what's like miles's expression about
0:19:27 that phrase
0:19:29 hesitancy he's waiting to see what's
0:19:31 happening next he's still waiting to see
0:19:33 what's going on I was
0:19:36 promised when the next election came to
0:19:39 determine who would serve in the
0:19:42 position of jtic
0:19:44 car the role of Justicar of the bruha
0:19:48 would be
0:19:50 mine but it would seem that I was lied
0:19:55 to that hard to stand in his Circle
0:20:00 think they could use me as they use
0:20:04 you I don't know that I meant to return
0:20:07 from New York everything we've seen so
0:20:10 far unless more is
0:20:12 done New York is going to be
0:20:16 enveloped by something horrible and
0:20:19 Beyond imagination explain to me the
0:20:22 more that needs to be done how can it be
0:20:27 killed we don't know yet
0:20:29 so we were working on before we
0:20:32 weren't allowed
0:20:35 to before all of this and the sabat and
0:20:39 all the
0:20:40 distractions that are happening what do
0:20:43 you know so
0:20:46 far um his eye twitches at the laughter
0:20:51 I uh Neil basically from the moment he
0:20:53 was like more things are going on from
0:20:55 the moment he started talking frankly
0:20:57 Neil has tried to keep a very hard lock
0:21:02 on any form of the no [ __ ] dude welcome
0:21:06 to the club like look Crossing his
0:21:09 face I mean where do we start
0:21:15 um and he looks around at the others
0:21:17 actually specifically looking back over
0:21:19 a miles knowing that this is the kind of
0:21:21 thing that we've talked about in private
0:21:23 but he like needs a queue the last thing
0:21:26 that I remember discussing is that
0:21:29 Arabella and her cin and it looks like
0:21:31 probably Zachariah slain at this point
0:21:34 are looking into a way to utilize magic
0:21:37 to banish the eldest to outside of
0:21:41 reality last time I
0:21:43 checked except we know that at least the
0:21:47 plan to send it to the shadowlands not
0:21:50 the shadowlands would not work right so
0:21:53 they they were saying outside of all
0:21:56 reality yeah that I don't I don't know
0:21:57 what that means the shadow Lance plan
0:22:00 had already been shown that it would
0:22:02 fail that it already exists in the
0:22:04 shadow Lance same with the spirits what
0:22:07 is
0:22:09 it what it's The Shard of the oldest
0:22:14 zamit the the can we just he looks anti-
0:22:18 deluvian thank you can he looks at the
0:22:21 book of Nod fragments I mean if this is
0:22:24 here can we just use words it was a p he
0:22:28 carried over by a a ghoul servant the
0:22:32 zantosa family right the one in New York
0:22:36 I'm not entirely sure but the one that
0:22:38 exists just outside of New Haven was
0:22:40 brought here by the zantosa family the
0:22:43 one the big piece in New York was also
0:22:45 brought over by the zantosa family the
0:22:47 smaller piece in New Haven that
0:22:49 destroyed the Chantry in
0:22:52 Yale is also a piece of the eldest also
0:22:55 moved and was under the caretaking of
0:22:58 veto zantosa this is what Shaw was
0:23:01 involved in investigating yes the reason
0:23:04 that your sire wanted him
0:23:06 removed sha was making dealings with the
0:23:11 santosa this is Jan Pieterzoon stuff right
0:23:15 like his I I asking out a character yes
0:23:17 uh I look through like the fragments and
0:23:19 the book and stuff for the specific
0:23:22 Pages we got from Shaw you can find them
0:23:24 in there flip to it and I sort of tap on
0:23:27 them uh yes these were the ones we took
0:23:29 from Shaw and we sent to the
0:23:31 archon did my S give you all of
0:23:35 this no where did this come from your
0:23:39 sire so the operative word is
0:23:42 give yes was taken and it it it doesn't
0:23:46 matter right now um your
0:23:48 sire
0:23:50 okay stood in the way of the Inner
0:23:54 Circle
0:23:55 intentionally by accident
0:23:59 it doesn't much
0:24:00 matter what matters is that his
0:24:05 sire no longer had need of his
0:24:09 Services he was supposed to have
0:24:12 left he was on his way out indeed he is
0:24:15 gone wind moves away from Johnny toward
0:24:18 miles you can see brda kind of
0:24:22 shrink and that thing that was on the
0:24:25 edge of her mind when she was looking at
0:24:27 Neil earlier it's clearly that his
0:24:29 mention that this was Yan Peterson notes
0:24:33 is really the truth of the matter and
0:24:36 she makes herself smaller looking at the
0:24:39 floor it is plain to me
0:24:45 now that this
0:24:48 Siege is no true threat to the camaria
0:24:51 as a whole the Inner Circle doesn't fear
0:24:54 the
0:24:55 sabat they do not understand the threat
0:24:58 that it
0:24:59 represents but they do see the
0:25:03 opportunity to address the various loose
0:25:07 ends that have sprung up in this region
0:25:10 of their
0:25:12 Kingdom Xavier said it Neil looks over a
0:25:15 win isn't that right hardat would
0:25:20 sacrifice all of North America to keep
0:25:22 his Secrets something like that
0:25:25 something close to that yes that's what
0:25:28 he said
0:25:29 so yeah
0:25:32 Johnny has just been staring at pen
0:25:34 Dragon this whole
0:25:36 time and upon hearing this has just been
0:25:38 kind of looking at the floor and then
0:25:41 looks over to
0:25:42 Miles and just kind of stares at him
0:25:45 kind of getting an assessment of where
0:25:47 he's at what's your
0:25:50 involvement with removing
0:25:52 Yan I tore his head from his
0:25:57 body why I crushed his skull in my
0:26:02 hands I did
0:26:04 so because the camaria asked me
0:26:10 to I was
0:26:12 offered exemption for one of
0:26:15 yours and Brea looks like she's guilty
0:26:19 and scared your sire is
0:26:22 dead so that BR might
0:26:27 live but you've learned things
0:26:33 now I do not see these things as
0:26:37 connected one was a
0:26:41 transaction when I dealt with him I
0:26:44 found all of
0:26:46 this packed
0:26:48 away it would seem that he was planning
0:26:50 to flee he was planning to deal with the
0:26:53 eldest there's nothing in here that
0:26:55 represents a
0:26:57 solution he he was on his way that was
0:26:59 part of
0:27:01 it there
0:27:05 is Neil looks over at Johnny
0:27:09 actually there were steps towards a
0:27:12 solution you're right in that there are
0:27:15 much much bigger issues than the sabat
0:27:19 and the camaria going on even though
0:27:21 even though the camaria and the sabat
0:27:24 are no less dangerous or problematic and
0:27:26 even though the sabat is an issue
0:27:30 because they will Slaughter everything
0:27:31 and
0:27:33 everyone
0:27:35 but there are those with
0:27:41 foresight who believed who asked
0:27:45 me to find a way to step forward to a
0:27:51 future without the Masquerade a future
0:27:56 with a future dealing with gehenna and
0:28:00 what comes after and the steps to that
0:28:03 were were to introduce Yan Peter
0:28:07 zun and
0:28:10 someone who would know more about the
0:28:15 eldest and fighting against it and to
0:28:17 connect those two pieces together to get
0:28:20 the two irreconcilable
0:28:22 haves to see a
0:28:25 future towards fighting this thing but
0:28:28 Yan Peterson's gone now so now I don't
0:28:31 know where we
0:28:32 go but in theory there were steps
0:28:35 forward we don't have a plan to
0:28:39 defeat an anti deluvian though we know
0:28:41 they can die we saw it so you
0:28:45 know and when did we see evone die
0:28:50 raana I watched it so did
0:28:54 others Rana woke that's when the shards
0:28:58 of the eldest stirred that's
0:29:01 when other anti delians stirred when
0:29:04 raana woke I also know one
0:29:08 story where in which an anti deluvian
0:29:12 met final
0:29:15 death it is the origin of our
0:29:20 blood it is the tale of
0:29:24 troil and the annihilation she brought
0:29:26 to her sire
0:29:32 I have something he looks to one of the
0:29:35 uh members of his army retrieve the
0:29:39 weapon they nod and then they head over
0:29:42 into the Next
0:29:43 Room mere moments pass of quiet between
0:29:48 you before they return with this metal
0:29:53 case that is sat down on the table kind
0:29:57 of un ceremoniously WR over the files
0:30:00 that are strung about the tabletop and
0:30:04 he opens it it is called the blade of
0:30:08 Enoch some call it the sword of
0:30:12 troyo and when he opens it he reveals a
0:30:17 weapon that looks to be a very old
0:30:21 bronze pitted
0:30:24 shortsword it's about the size of a
0:30:26 Gladius even relatively similar in shape
0:30:30 but much more crude and old it is said
0:30:34 that the weapon hungers for the blood of
0:30:36 bruha and any who are descended from
0:30:39 Troy can be vanquished by
0:30:42 it I took it from my
0:30:45 sire when I thought she was
0:30:48 destroyed she
0:30:49 is
0:30:51 obsessed with troyal
0:30:54 Carthage and the histories of our
0:30:56 blood
0:30:59 he closes the
0:31:00 case I do not
0:31:03 know if it was truly possessed by one
0:31:06 such
0:31:08 being but I
0:31:11 admit he says struggling to form the
0:31:16 words much of this seems a bit beyond
0:31:21 me you're not the only one Your
0:31:25 Grace I mean
0:31:29 we all get there in our own
0:31:32 time and saying it outside of this room
0:31:35 is a death sentence from the Camara
0:31:38 but it
0:31:40 is
0:31:42 GNA now it's the end times so that as a
0:31:46 first step to acceptance is I find I
0:31:50 don't know comforting the wrong word but
0:31:54 how is this stopped what useful
0:31:56 information do you have on this m
0:31:58 how is Kenna stopped what
0:32:01 actionable details do you
0:32:05 have we've been taking it a piece at a
0:32:07 time when we
0:32:09 could we aware of two things at this
0:32:12 point one is the
0:32:14 eldest and it must be stopped before it
0:32:18 rises when will it
0:32:20 rise when you sech New
0:32:23 York I think these kinds of things are
0:32:26 imprecise but that's what I saw and if I
0:32:30 don't then we all die to the sabat I
0:32:32 don't know it's kind of lose lose
0:32:36 scenario well can you talk more about
0:32:40 why you think that it'll happen when the
0:32:42 siege happens is it disturbing the
0:32:46 Kindred in some way I don't
0:32:50 so I saw a fight in New York I saw his
0:32:55 grace fighting against
0:32:58 the the the Cardinal palonia and someone
0:33:02 else some other lasombra I can't
0:33:04 remember their name they were also there
0:33:07 important um I think when I saw it that
0:33:11 way I think I
0:33:15 was um the Vykos but I don't know if
0:33:19 that's I might be projecting into that
0:33:21 one I'm not sure but as the fighting was
0:33:24 happening the dragon
0:33:26 rose and that is I mean the dragon
0:33:29 Rising is a dragon Rising is one of the
0:33:33 signs of gehenna so I I don't know if
0:33:35 you can stop gehenna but if you can I I
0:33:38 would say for me my guess would be if
0:33:41 you can stop the signs from
0:33:43 happening right most of them have
0:33:45 already happened
0:33:47 some debatably what are the signs of
0:33:50 Gana oh god um Neil starts to count on
0:33:54 his fingers and then sort of like moves
0:33:56 some stuff out of the way and starts
0:33:57 pointing at the fragments of the the
0:34:00 book of Nod and like some of the things
0:34:02 that Peter was there and sort of points
0:34:04 and TAPS at them as he talks the
0:34:06 fragments are all likeing weird and in
0:34:08 different languages and and whatever but
0:34:10 there's translation notes uh and he just
0:34:12 goes okay uh
0:34:14 first uh first uh okay so the thin
0:34:18 Bloods right the time of thin Bloods um
0:34:21 when the clanless rule and those who
0:34:23 can't sire children exist um eyes narrow
0:34:28 at that for some reason that is now it's
0:34:32 actually that's why the Camara uh
0:34:35 kidnaps kills um gets rid of all signs
0:34:38 of of um you know thin Bloods and and um
0:34:43 why princes hate clanless so much and
0:34:46 that kind of thing I have a personal
0:34:48 sort of like a personal theory that um
0:34:49 it's not that there are so many thin
0:34:52 Bloods it's that thin Bloods die quickly
0:34:54 and it's actually the mass death of
0:34:55 Kindred but that's sort of a
0:34:58 I'm going to try not to editorialize too
0:34:59 much but a lot of this has to do with
0:35:01 prophecy and what are you aware of
0:35:04 regarding the war on the west
0:35:06 coast almost nothing I don't I don't
0:35:08 know why what's there are multiple jtic
0:35:11 cars deployed right now to the West
0:35:13 Coast there's multiple justic cars on
0:35:16 the west coast uh yes I don't cities
0:35:18 controlled by thin-blooded
0:35:21 rulers oh yeah that'll they're in open
0:35:24 Rebellion against the camaria which
0:35:26 makes sense they've been left out to dry
0:35:28 and they're about as far away from
0:35:29 Europe as you can get um okay well
0:35:32 that's just one that's just one of the
0:35:34 signs right that's the first one um uh
0:35:38 second right one of the other signs
0:35:40 supposedly of gehenna is uh that the the
0:35:42 Wild Ones uh like werewolves I well I
0:35:46 there's some debate but werewolves uh I
0:35:49 I think uh they will hunt Kindred um
0:35:52 even what is it quote even in their
0:35:54 strongest cities something like that um
0:35:58 I say werewolves cuz I I know we have
0:36:00 seen werewolves hunting us in our cities
0:36:02 there was a werewolf that came from me
0:36:05 just a few days
0:36:06 ago I've had eyes spot them within City
0:36:09 Limits and the saat you called that dog
0:36:13 tagging Johnny literally it's a sabat
0:36:16 tactic during this big size to throw
0:36:18 werewolves at so there you go
0:36:21 um if you look at you know the some of
0:36:25 the fragments of the book of not and and
0:36:26 like sort of The Commandments cane and
0:36:28 stuff talk about what to do with
0:36:31 werewolves what to do if like I don't
0:36:33 know fairies or whatever are there but
0:36:34 so like in context Wild Ones probably
0:36:37 means werewolves that's the um okay so
0:36:40 there's that one um Awakening of some of
0:36:42 the eldest that's that's one of them we
0:36:45 literally saw that happen in Sri Lanka
0:36:48 um and then when that happened there was
0:36:50 some sort of like resident feedback or
0:36:51 something cuz then the the eldest went
0:36:54 nuts or at least fragments of the eldest
0:36:55 went nuts uh in the Chantry and I know
0:36:59 um my clan had a little bit of a tough
0:37:01 time so to speak so there were other
0:37:04 clans who had a hard time too exactly so
0:37:07 that's happening um let's see what's the
0:37:10 other one oh the uh the Crone uh uh
0:37:16 usually means like bab Yaga right the um
0:37:18 the Crone will awaken um and uh consume
0:37:22 all so I think everybody we know about
0:37:26 the Iron Curtain we know about that you
0:37:27 you guys are we going have to talk about
0:37:29 that one why don't you tell us we just
0:37:31 sort of the so well is it different than
0:37:35 samit
0:37:36 Shard you know growing and consuming
0:37:41 everything in the shantry and to be fair
0:37:43 there's probably some debate about that
0:37:45 but the Crone is usually mean usually
0:37:47 means the Baba Yaga that's what the
0:37:49 people think and that was one of this
0:37:51 goes back into like naratu L like old
0:37:53 NOS veratu lore in theory she was sleep
0:37:57 for a very long time um but Iron Curtain
0:38:01 literally like you know you can't get to
0:38:04 Russia and then you can't get out of
0:38:05 Russia I've never tried to get to or
0:38:07 from Russia well neither have I but no
0:38:10 for you have great keep going anyways
0:38:13 you can't right that was because of the
0:38:15 rise of the babayaga
0:38:18 so that's sign of gehenna yeah yeah yeah
0:38:21 well not the Iron Curtain but the Baba
0:38:23 Yaga rising to consume Baba Yaga Rising
0:38:25 that's sort of the that's one of the
0:38:27 presumed signs of gehenna at least
0:38:29 according to he like shuffles some
0:38:30 papers around and Taps on one of them
0:38:32 let's let's go to the next sign okay um
0:38:34 let's
0:38:35 see we're all familiar with this one
0:38:38 probably the black hand will rise and
0:38:40 choke all who oppose it we've heard the
0:38:42 phrase before I remember that one so
0:38:44 that was probably you know the was that
0:38:49 Uli no no no no no that's a different
0:38:52 thing no black hand the like the sabat
0:38:55 right like the the black hand sort of
0:38:57 trting the sabat although they lost a
0:38:59 lot of their power base but apparently
0:39:01 they had so much power base in the sabat
0:39:02 that by losing part of their own power
0:39:04 base it stalled The Crusade so
0:39:05 apparently they were you know stuck in
0:39:09 there pretty high um or um rise the
0:39:13 black hand there's couple black hands
0:39:16 right so either way black hand Rising BR
0:39:18 still
0:39:19 wearing the self-consciousness and
0:39:22 horror of earlier kind of pulls her hand
0:39:23 a little closer at that mention um
0:39:28 two different signs of of of of one or
0:39:31 rather he kind of looks for the first
0:39:34 time even though like he's always
0:39:35 nervous around pend Dragon he looks
0:39:36 nervous about bringing this next one up
0:39:38 uh so one of the signs is that those who
0:39:42 drink of the heart's blood will
0:39:44 flourish uh though that one goes into
0:39:47 the the rise of her Shi and everything
0:39:49 that's changing in allot where literally
0:39:50 they are Rec claiming all the heart's
0:39:52 blood that they can you know broke the
0:39:54 trir curse and now they're going wild in
0:39:56 a way they haven't in a long time are
0:39:57 they talking about the numbers of them
0:39:59 will flourish or those who partake of it
0:40:01 will see success way I mean this is this
0:40:04 is ancient fragments of ancient texts
0:40:08 it's it's all up for I read the language
0:40:11 I wasn't sure if there was context so
0:40:13 the context can be a few things if you
0:40:16 want my opinion what's going on in
0:40:19 alamut would be one sign of it and then
0:40:21 he looks shakily a little bit over back
0:40:23 towards Pendragon again or we just open
0:40:26 the doors
0:40:28 to the flourishment of diablerie in the
0:40:31 Camara as at the same time the sabat are
0:40:35 flourishing on the East Coast either way
0:40:38 no matter who you look at or
0:40:42 blame there's more diabl ists running
0:40:44 around out in the open now than there
0:40:46 ever have
0:40:48 been next Point um so we we already sort
0:40:53 of talked about this a dragon
0:40:55 Rises um could mean a few things but I'm
0:40:58 a little stuck on the eldest um being
0:41:01 that we have now literally seen a dragon
0:41:03 unless we have another Dragon who's
0:41:05 rising to Supremacy close at hand what
0:41:09 was the symbol for the
0:41:10 colonists what there was something about
0:41:14 the konic sorcerers are coming they're
0:41:18 infernals or something like that what's
0:41:20 their Clan symbol I know they're zamit
0:41:22 adjacent well they're zitti I think
0:41:24 aren't they or it's Dragon yeah it's
0:41:27 okay so maybe that's a reference could
0:41:29 be that too I I I don't know and your
0:41:31 name's [ __ ] Pendragon let's not
0:41:33 forget that Johnny kind of says with a
0:41:35 sneer as he then pulls out a Morley pops
0:41:38 it in his lip and lights up fair PR kind
0:41:43 of like Peaks ruul at
0:41:46 Johnny and is maybe catching herself on
0:41:49 like that instinct to be like well that
0:41:52 was like like you said something
0:41:55 disrespectful but she pulling back to be
0:41:57 fair pet and dragon started that
0:42:00 train so we got dragons everywhere what
0:42:04 else uh the next two I haven't been able
0:42:08 to pin down as well uh one is a Darkness
0:42:11 moves that could be the lasombra or
0:42:14 something along those lines it could
0:42:16 just be the flourishment of the lasombra
0:42:18 it could be literally that the sabat are
0:42:20 moving up the east coast and you know
0:42:23 they're primarily made of lasra or
0:42:25 there's a lot of them at least and they
0:42:27 there are you know it could be a lot of
0:42:28 stuff mass extinguishing of Life what if
0:42:31 it was Marcus Fel he's a lamra he's a v
0:42:36 oh you're right but vent running around
0:42:39 with ob tenra that's nothing I mean if
0:42:41 the darkness might be something to do
0:42:43 tention much like the Z's flesh crafting
0:42:47 could be I I don't know that the problem
0:42:50 with something like a Darkness moves is
0:42:52 is it a physical darkness is it a
0:42:53 metaphorical Darkness information not a
0:42:55 lot of information on that one uh the
0:42:57 last one maybe less information I don't
0:43:00 know um an angel
0:43:06 dies so that one could be I mean first
0:43:09 of all do they mean an angel do they
0:43:11 mean a fallen angel do they mean it like
0:43:13 I don't know but if it's dead and how do
0:43:15 you kill an angel I don't know the
0:43:16 anwers to those questions but if an
0:43:18 angel dies or maybe it's uh like a angel
0:43:21 means pure Soul right maybe there are
0:43:23 people that we know or or you know
0:43:27 The Last Hope of whatever and then they
0:43:30 die and that's it I right I don't know
0:43:34 that one I don't know but those are the
0:43:35 signs at least from the fragments that
0:43:37 I'm aware of and and the reading I was
0:43:39 doing when that one seems to Sucker
0:43:44 Punch win a little bit like she thinks
0:43:47 really hard about that one and like it
0:43:49 hurts to think about again it could be I
0:43:53 get it we are a wash in signs of gehenna
0:43:57 as according to the book of notd they're
0:44:00 pretty [ __ ] vague prophecy that we
0:44:02 can we can point to any number of things
0:44:05 going on in the world and say that's
0:44:06 what that is what does this [ __ ] mean
0:44:09 I know gehenna is this thing that we
0:44:12 have all been scared of for as long as I
0:44:15 have understood vampire Society what
0:44:19 happens if it is gehna depends on who
0:44:22 you ask this is where we start getting
0:44:24 into philosophical and the olcal debates
0:44:28 not really we know what happens if Sami
0:44:31 Rises everybody dies we saw what happens
0:44:34 that the Chantry the spreading of that
0:44:36 orange mold the bodies folding in on
0:44:39 each other that's the only other thing
0:44:43 that we're aware of is a prophecy
0:44:47 involving damp
0:44:49 here the thin Bloods and and those who
0:44:52 who can't as create children in this
0:44:55 treatment of this one person
0:44:57 supposedly reflects back upon vampire
0:45:00 kind in
0:45:02 general guess we'll find out and that
0:45:05 saving her and preserving her will do
0:45:09 the same for us who is
0:45:12 her just like with all
0:45:15 prophecies they all kind
0:45:17 of there are
0:45:20 multiple points towards the future that
0:45:22 you could
0:45:24 find it's she's referenced is the last
0:45:27 daughter of Eve off for speculation what
0:45:30 that means how do we find
0:45:32 her what do we do with her when we find
0:45:34 her but I mean there's a lot going on
0:45:38 with all of this and you know we're
0:45:43 trying our best here we really are but
0:45:45 this is
0:45:48 the moving forward Johnny's jaw is
0:45:52 pretty much locked out at this point I
0:45:54 think it' probably be safe to say that
0:45:55 he is not good at necessarily keeping a
0:45:57 straight face about things anyone who's
0:46:00 looking at him can tell that he is just
0:46:01 kind of lock jawed and stiff
0:46:04 looking so we must fight the eldest and
0:46:08 figure out a way to take it
0:46:10 out and that
0:46:12 involves meeting with somebody that
0:46:15 knows how to fight
0:46:16 it the angel of
0:46:19 Cain the
0:46:21 Vykos yeah how maybe the angel of Cain
0:46:24 is the angel that dies I don't know
0:46:26 let's stay on topic here it
0:46:29 was for not foreseen
0:46:33 foresighted those with
0:46:35 foresight little prognostication um
0:46:39 Wanted Jan Pieterzoon specifically why why
0:46:43 him well I think I know why he sort of
0:46:46 gestures at all the [ __ ] that's on the
0:46:47 table um as a representative of the
0:46:50 camaria and the angel of cane the
0:46:54 Vykos needed to sit down and talk
0:46:57 that was that was all that sort
0:47:00 of kind of all the direction I got here
0:47:04 but um it was thought that if anybody
0:47:09 could get at least portions of the sex
0:47:13 to realize that none of this matters all
0:47:17 this sect War [ __ ] Jihad none of it
0:47:21 matters because it's SC it's the end
0:47:24 times and to get
0:47:28 there was a way beyond what we are now
0:47:30 he looks back at Pendragon if you're
0:47:32 asking what do we do how do we stop it I
0:47:34 don't know if we can for
0:47:36 me it's looking at what comes next if
0:47:41 there's
0:47:43 next and Thinking Beyond where we are
0:47:46 right
0:47:47 now for those of us who are capable of
0:47:50 Thinking Beyond what we are right now
0:47:53 and the thought was to get Beyond
0:47:55 Peterson and
0:47:57 the vi ghost to talk now how we did that
0:48:01 I don't know I know they were you know
0:48:03 originally going to both be there in New
0:48:05 York talk and agree to a
0:48:09 ceasefire yeah I know it's beyond a
0:48:11 ceasefire because the problem is the
0:48:13 sabat are also coming and they are also
0:48:16 sabat and they are also going to
0:48:18 slaughter everyone and destroy our
0:48:21 humanities and burn everything that we
0:48:24 love right we got it so it's not like
0:48:27 the camia is not going to do that too so
0:48:29 just a different way
0:48:32 hypothetically I think the plan was if
0:48:34 you can turn the sabat and the
0:48:37 camaria against the
0:48:40 eldest there can be a mutual victory in
0:48:43 that and then that will in and of itself
0:48:47 lead to a ceasefire we see what comes
0:48:49 next it has to be smaller than that
0:48:51 there's no way that hundreds upon
0:48:53 hundreds of Kindred throwing themselves
0:48:56 at the eldest is going to be the answer
0:48:58 that's not
0:49:00 but the White House
0:49:02 is the oldest zit that I'm aware of or
0:49:05 at least one of the most
0:49:07 frightening it would have to know
0:49:09 something so we need to talk to the
0:49:11 Vykos and the meeting with the
0:49:13 Vykos firstly will be treason against
0:49:16 the C more but
0:49:19 secondly more
0:49:21 importantly will not be viable until the
0:49:24 siege is resolved
0:49:27 which will'll be too
0:49:30 late why would talking to it be
0:49:33 treason because it is the Vykos one of
0:49:35 the founders of the sabat to associate
0:49:38 it with it at
0:49:40 all especially on matters pertaining to
0:49:43 the end times yeah is going to be
0:49:46 something the camaria kills you
0:49:48 for
0:49:50 or that you are sent to kill others for
0:49:55 Aron
0:49:57 she very much closes her eyes
0:50:00 and holds on to her hands like she wants
0:50:03 to point at
0:50:05 him dramatically and like announce the
0:50:10 gigantic hint that he has
0:50:12 dropped but she knows that her body will
0:50:16 seize up and she knows that it will be
0:50:20 all for
0:50:22 nothing so she just
0:50:24 stops Sor saying to get through the
0:50:27 siege Pendragon no I'm not saying for
0:50:30 you to get through the siege I am saying
0:50:33 do not attend
0:50:35 it go
0:50:38 elsewhere there are locations that can
0:50:40 be
0:50:41 arranged but if you go to The Siege you
0:50:43 will not survive to the meeting with
0:50:47 Vykos and though there are some of you
0:50:49 who already realize that to go is to die
0:50:53 you are unwilling to abandon your
0:50:56 friends
0:50:58 or so it seems br's bowing her head that
0:51:03 act of avoidance would indicate her as
0:51:07 who he's speaking
0:51:08 about what's your plan
0:51:12 then if this thing can be killed I will
0:51:15 kill
0:51:17 it but there are no efforts pertaining
0:51:20 to this matter that survive the
0:51:25 Sabbat I might have more information but
0:51:27 I haven't had time to go find it I was
0:51:31 hoping that the group of you might
0:51:34 have a bit of knowledge that could be
0:51:37 carried to New York something
0:51:40 that if we did have knowledge of of
0:51:43 something that might pertain to New
0:51:45 York then it would be used by you yes
0:51:49 that is what I've been getting at I'm
0:51:52 not sure where you stand on all of this
0:51:54 right
0:51:55 now
0:51:57 you
0:51:58 have told us that you've murdered Yan
0:52:03 Peterson you've unfurled a table full of
0:52:07 Contraband material to the
0:52:11 camaria what side are you on here the
0:52:15 side that makes me most
0:52:18 honest the one side that I can
0:52:22 trust
0:52:25 mine
0:52:27 our problem lies in when another deal is
0:52:30 made which one of us will become
0:52:32 Expendable at that
0:52:34 point all of
0:52:36 you
0:52:39 yeah I meant to
0:52:42 him four out of five of us let him
0:52:49 talk to me it is
0:52:53 simple the group of you know the most
0:52:56 about this and in theory are the most
0:53:00 valuable Assets in dealing with
0:53:04 it so long as that is
0:53:08 true I see no reason to cast you
0:53:14 aside but let's make sure it's
0:53:19 true there's a
0:53:22 place right mil in New
0:53:25 Haven that
0:53:27 we were going to go we were going to try
0:53:29 and learn more what could kill this
0:53:31 thing we haven't had a chance
0:53:34 to because
0:53:35 of know frankly because of the
0:53:38 camaria and all the things that have
0:53:40 been going
0:53:42 on building support the sabat the trials
0:53:46 the
0:53:49 conclaves we just had three damn nights
0:53:53 we
0:53:54 could we could get more
0:53:57 more but her power is going to take
0:54:01 every step she believes
0:54:02 necessary to keep you from knowing
0:54:07 more we might have a
0:54:10 way a solution that is untested an
0:54:14 unorthodox we don't have the time to do
0:54:17 it what is the
0:54:19 solution there are
0:54:22 individuals who possess powers and
0:54:25 insights that we don't completely
0:54:28 understand who are
0:54:30 hellbent on fighting
0:54:33 this who are
0:54:39 they we know of them who are they and
0:54:42 what are you going to do with that
0:54:44 information use it it's
0:54:49 um when
0:54:51 it I understand your desire to be um
0:54:55 honest
0:54:57 Prince Pendragon but in matters of
0:54:59 Espionage
0:55:01 it's there's just car upstairs I don't
0:55:03 think it's for the
0:55:05 best I'm not convinced she isn't going
0:55:07 to simply walk you to your deaths as
0:55:09 soon as we're done here she might so I
0:55:11 want that information now well it's in
0:55:13 your best interest for us to not die
0:55:15 then and honestly Your Grace after the
0:55:20 Rave I just don't [ __ ] trust you
0:55:23 Johnny I see we want an ally we don't
0:55:26 want somebody who will throw us away
0:55:28 once we're done being inconvenient this
0:55:30 meeting is done agreed closes the case
0:55:34 he collects the files he points to his
0:55:36 men escort them back upstairs they over
0:55:39 and gesture to the doorway please this
0:55:42 way Neil takes a last look at the stuff
0:55:46 on the table eyes lingering specifically
0:55:49 on those fragments that they took from
0:55:51 Shaw what feels like [ __ ] forever
0:55:53 ago and then turns and starts following
0:55:57 like sort of shuffling really
0:56:00 quietly he looks at P
0:56:03 Dragon if you want in on this fight we
0:56:06 need to know you're with
0:56:07 us not just as
0:56:11 tools he gives him a nod and leaves to
0:56:13 go with as directed bro looks she's
0:56:17 trying to hide the emotional mess she
0:56:20 looks torn
0:56:22 self-conscious she looks like she wants
0:56:25 to argue with Johnny she looks like she
0:56:28 doesn't know how clearly her mind is
0:56:32 racing a mile a minute and she doesn't
0:56:35 know how to express any of it and she
0:56:38 sees everything
0:56:40 splitting is the guard still with us
0:56:43 yeah he's going to bring you over to the
0:56:45 elevator help you on help you off win
0:56:49 purposely keeps eyes and body and mouth
0:56:54 shut eyes are focused unfocused but
0:56:57 getting her where she needs to
0:57:00 go
0:57:01 she's of her own valtion
0:57:05 and with some motivation not of her own
0:57:09 valtion had to keep quiet about an awful
0:57:12 lot
0:57:13 and there's just nowhere to trust and
0:57:16 nowhere to have an honest conversation

0:58:32 person with zero blood in their system
0:58:35 frenzy and trying to eat somebody and
0:58:36 that's just a thing that happens a
0:58:37 perfectly reasonable activity
0:58:40 yep uh
0:58:42 Wynn watches Johnny refuse the blood
0:58:45 dolls you know what have been
0:58:46 interesting about that is that had
0:58:49 Johnny frenzied and [ __ ] drained this
0:58:51 girl he would have gotten zero
0:58:54 VTE why Prey exclusion exclusion oh he
0:58:58 literally doesn't get anything out of
0:59:00 this oh I didn't realize you were as SC
0:59:02 Asus oh yeah W interesting no he's
0:59:05 opposite opposite yeah yeah yeah
0:59:07 everyone's like what the [ __ ] Johnny
0:59:08 hakum you're not feeding he like can't
0:59:10 well not only that but I mean there's a
0:59:12 reason why he won't but like it's
0:59:14 personal I did not actually know that
0:59:15 you had that on your shet yeah I thought
0:59:16 that was stylistic I didn't realize it's
0:59:18 mechanical neat very cool anyway s go
0:59:20 which would have been a [ __ ] awful
0:59:22 thing if he kills a girl and like and
0:59:24 still is just looking like hungry such a
0:59:26 great like little demonstration of why
0:59:29 you and Pendragon are so [ __ ]
0:59:31 different I like that it's 5 years in
0:59:33 we're just learning about this fall
0:59:35 that's on his
0:59:36 sheet well he's been acting it the whole
0:59:38 time but yeah
