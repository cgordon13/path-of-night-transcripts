0:00:22 same so listener discretion is advised
0:00:25 now let's walk
0:00:29 [Music]
0:00:30 let's walk
0:00:36 last time on path of night
0:00:39 Johnny win IRA and miles delved further
0:00:42 into the chain trip
0:00:44 there they discovered a safe room where
0:00:46 they found Greece
0:00:48 we used to allowed the group access to a
0:00:49 stockpile of blood so they healed and
0:00:52 prepared
0:00:54 Beretta and Eden fleeing the flesh
0:00:56 monstrosity finally found the same safe
0:00:58 room
0:00:59 the torreidor was reunited with a
0:01:01 quartering
0:01:02 the group shared Intel about Eden the
0:01:05 last daughter of Eve and the damned fear
0:01:07 they decided to keep her safe for now
0:01:09 but danger lay ahead in an upcoming
0:01:12 fight with Vito
0:01:16 foreign
0:01:18 [Music]
0:01:24 starts to sit up and is
0:01:27 wind kind of sweeps around so Eden is
0:01:30 out of sight and just kind of backs her
0:01:34 because she's standing now correct
0:01:36 yes she backs her down a bookshelf just
0:01:39 so she's kind of out of immediate sight
0:01:41 in case Reiss knows her and knows the
0:01:43 acquisition Britta shoots win a great
0:01:46 fall smile I saw everything in this room
0:01:48 upon entering it there's no need to hide
0:01:51 her from me
0:01:53 I think there's plenty of need to put me
0:01:54 between you and her though
0:01:58 you say so
0:02:00 it kind of shrugs dismissively he did
0:02:02 keep her safe for the time being I
0:02:04 realize that's a
0:02:06 uh
0:02:07 not necessarily the way we would keep
0:02:10 her safe you can't keep her safe
0:02:13 you simply can't
0:02:15 why is that
0:02:17 because your children
0:02:19 that may sound
0:02:21 condescending to hear
0:02:24 but it is the truth
0:02:27 the Sabbat already knows that she's in
0:02:29 New Haven
0:02:31 they're coming for her
0:02:32 and I don't mean the single pack
0:02:35 that has threatened this domain
0:02:38 I mean this Sabbat
0:02:42 you cannot protect her from them
0:02:45 just as you cannot protect her from
0:02:47 Miles desire how exactly did this about
0:02:50 find out about her
0:02:52 the Giovanni have allies on both sides
0:02:55 of the fence so to speak
0:02:57 the vigos is aware of the last daughter
0:03:01 of Eve wind kind of flashes back to a
0:03:04 phone call she had with
0:03:06 Amber Gino about a
0:03:08 multi-clan effort that might be able to
0:03:12 save Joey and it just kind of flickers
0:03:14 there for a minute
0:03:16 what do you have
0:03:18 for the moment
0:03:20 is a powder cake
0:03:23 your grace
0:03:24 your city is already on the brink of
0:03:27 Destruction
0:03:29 how do you think
0:03:30 all of those power hungry princes that
0:03:33 have come to your domain in search of
0:03:35 power
0:03:36 are going to react when they find out
0:03:38 that this
0:03:40 Legend
0:03:43 this danger spawned from thin Bloods
0:03:48 is being protected and hidden by you
0:03:52 oh
0:03:54 not sure
0:03:55 I mean I've got an idea but you're
0:03:58 either stupid or you have many ideas of
0:04:00 how bad that's going to be orki doesn't
0:04:02 give a [ __ ] what you're saying like it's
0:04:04 not news you're not why are you
0:04:06 pretending
0:04:08 that it isn't a problem
0:04:10 because we have a lot of problems and
0:04:12 this is pretty low on the list it is not
0:04:14 for you no pretty ugly for you stop
0:04:17 thinking about just your quartering
0:04:19 why don't you stop thinking about the
0:04:21 problem that is much bigger than me than
0:04:24 you than anyone in here you cannot
0:04:27 protect this girl
0:04:29 what were you trying to do with her
0:04:31 we are attempting to discern the nature
0:04:34 of her existence
0:04:36 what she means
0:04:38 for the future of Kindred kind
0:04:40 what conclusion did you come to
0:04:44 nothing good
0:04:47 here's the fun thing about studies the
0:04:49 results really depend on who's paying
0:04:51 for them
0:04:52 and they're interpreted by those who are
0:04:54 paying for them
0:04:56 I think you don't know [ __ ]
0:04:58 regardless
0:05:00 We're Not Gonna debate this to death
0:05:02 here for now there's no need to
0:05:05 I'll make sure your sire knows and you
0:05:07 can debate it with him
0:05:09 see if this is funny you throw are you
0:05:12 threatening the prince sure sounds like
0:05:14 it does the prince feel threatened by
0:05:16 the will of his sire
0:05:18 by the will of hardest dad in the camera
0:05:20 let's say he's not threatening me
0:05:25 he gets up
0:05:26 and heads over to the documents that he
0:05:29 had been reviewing and he starts packing
0:05:31 things up be a real shame if those got
0:05:33 out wouldn't it he just keeps going
0:05:35 about his business
0:05:37 I think we all got dirty secrets Reiss
0:05:39 and maybe you should be a little more
0:05:41 careful about who you're blabbing about
0:05:43 you again have no idea what you're
0:05:45 talking about
0:05:46 spoiler alert I'm not sure you do either
0:05:48 privilege and Reiss Let's back this up
0:05:51 so we can actually talk to one another
0:05:52 about what we know and not get into a
0:05:55 fight here
0:05:56 because as it stands right now
0:05:59 you have been the one hiding this girl
0:06:02 and protecting her if you're telling us
0:06:06 this is going to look bad with the
0:06:08 camarilla going all the way up
0:06:11 then you're the one who's in the hot
0:06:13 seat right now
0:06:15 correct
0:06:17 she is not here because I want her here
0:06:20 doesn't matter it does matter when
0:06:23 because all Kindred whether they like it
0:06:26 or not are beholden to others and it is
0:06:29 my expectation
0:06:32 that if the truth comes out
0:06:35 I will be
0:06:37 expended
0:06:39 or preserved
0:06:42 but I grow weary of worrying about which
0:06:45 of the two it will be so do what you
0:06:48 will do
0:06:51 I think my codery is already inclined
0:06:56 to protect this girl
0:06:58 what we need
0:07:01 and whether you like it or not we are
0:07:04 unlikely allies in the defense of New
0:07:06 Haven right now Reiss
0:07:08 and we need your knowledge and expertise
0:07:12 to help guide us to the right outcome
0:07:16 I hope you appreciate how difficult it
0:07:18 is
0:07:19 for me to acknowledge your expertise and
0:07:23 how much we need you right now
0:07:26 please work with us
0:07:29 so that we can do some kind of good for
0:07:31 the city and the camarilla
0:07:35 I do not believe that this girl can be
0:07:37 protected
0:07:39 in fact
0:07:42 a Mr ambrogena Giovanni
0:07:45 has grown weary
0:07:48 of waiting for her to be delivered
0:07:51 I do not know what will become of her
0:07:54 when he has her
0:07:57 but he is not a man to be trifled with
0:07:59 see Britta trying to push down the
0:08:03 instinct to bristle
0:08:04 I don't know there's a lot going on and
0:08:07 there's a lot on the line
0:08:09 and we can't make a ton of decisions for
0:08:11 now
0:08:13 we will keep her alive
0:08:15 and we need to stop the spread of veto
0:08:17 Sentosa and she can help with that and
0:08:20 it might be true
0:08:22 I know nothing about what she's doing or
0:08:25 what she can do but Vito cannot keep
0:08:29 spreading whatever this is it will
0:08:31 become a far far larger problem than
0:08:34 even Sabbat at that point
0:08:35 not to implicate your clan or yourself
0:08:39 but Giovanni amberjino Giovanni came
0:08:43 here with the understanding that he was
0:08:46 going to collect this girl
0:08:49 this girl and a set of tomes that are
0:08:52 relevant to ongoing studies which tomes
0:08:56 there's not for me to say
0:08:59 and somehow
0:09:02 this deal with the Giovanni was made
0:09:05 known to the Sabbat through the Vykos
0:09:08 yes
0:09:10 so both the Giovanni and the Sabbat know
0:09:12 about her
0:09:14 who else knows about her
0:09:16 the Treme
0:09:18 its highest echelons this entire
0:09:21 discussion IRA has been leaning against
0:09:24 a table sort of watching neither with
0:09:27 the Coterie nor with Reiss but kind of in
0:09:30 the middle Johnny uh Paces around
0:09:35 um and picks up his chainsaw off the
0:09:37 ground the vehicles had recently been
0:09:40 part of an attack on Prince works so
0:09:44 made nearby I don't know if it's
0:09:46 connected Johnny kind of sets the
0:09:48 chainsaw down on one of the tables and
0:09:51 just kind of starts inspecting it
0:09:52 IRA
0:09:54 you came here along with ambrosino
0:09:57 Giovanni
0:09:58 I met him here in the domain I'd never
0:10:01 met him before what exactly are you
0:10:03 doing in the domain here well there are
0:10:06 a lot of chantries that have been
0:10:09 attacked by the Sabbat
0:10:10 I have been asked to
0:10:14 help make sure we don't lose another one
0:10:17 and it gives like a little chuckle and
0:10:18 looks around the [ __ ] ruins of this
0:10:21 Chantry
0:10:23 and to work with
0:10:26 Mr Giovanni there was a
0:10:29 Mutual acquaintance of some higher-ups I
0:10:33 don't know much because I am but an
0:10:35 apprentice it's just not my place to
0:10:37 know can we make it a post role to see
0:10:40 how much of that Johnny believes wax
0:10:42 head motive Supply yep I imagine you're
0:10:44 gonna smoke me on this but I think it's
0:10:46 impossible I should have spoke miles on
0:10:47 it and I lost so
0:10:50 what do you mean should have got eight
0:10:52 dipole with a spec man
0:10:54 you heard what you needed to roll and
0:10:57 said uh-oh
0:10:58 what's my pool rolling against this uh
0:11:01 empathy perception I think
0:11:07 uh what's the uh what's the target
0:11:09 difficulty number six on both sides all
0:11:12 right that's uh that's three successes
0:11:13 over here
0:11:18 Johnny kind of nods along like that
0:11:21 makes sense that makes sense actually
0:11:22 why I had hoped to work with the sheriff
0:11:26 looking for Mutual acquaintance
0:11:29 you can see Johnny is looking back and
0:11:31 forth between you and Rhys
0:11:34 you can tell that his hackles are up and
0:11:38 that bruja get that look in their eye
0:11:41 when they feel like someone's [ __ ]
0:11:42 with them but you can tell he hasn't
0:11:44 decided on who it is yet
0:11:48 um but he seems to kind of believe
0:11:49 everything you're saying
0:11:50 but you can tell he's definitely in a
0:11:53 spot right now where he's kind of on
0:11:55 that weird hair trigger of maybe don't
0:11:58 push this guy his his his caveman brain
0:12:02 starting to kick in Ira was in a small
0:12:04 room with you swinging a chainsaw when
0:12:06 you weren't mad at him like yeah
0:12:08 so regardless of all this
0:12:11 night problem [ __ ]
0:12:14 there's a very angry xantosa out in the
0:12:17 hall
0:12:18 sounds like he's made of several people
0:12:20 how are we leaving
0:12:23 well
0:12:24 we found your friend
0:12:26 you can go back the way we came not if
0:12:28 he's right outside the door also we
0:12:30 can't leave without doing something
0:12:32 about santosa Brito looks intensely sad
0:12:35 frustrated and just there's been so much
0:12:40 trauma after trauma after trauma and
0:12:42 hearing all these issues about the one
0:12:44 good thing that she was hoping she could
0:12:47 do for this girl and talking about the
0:12:49 zantoso with a race in the room she's
0:12:51 holding on to arm too tightly and trying
0:12:55 to keep quiet when kind of sees Britta
0:12:59 and just kind of like [ __ ] her head to
0:13:01 tell her to come over and stand next to
0:13:03 her Bretta does sort of slowly drag her
0:13:07 feet over she just kind of squeezes
0:13:09 britta's hand how did you find this girl
0:13:12 in the first place
0:13:13 she was on the way here from
0:13:16 from the from the cell full of people
0:13:20 that the Santos had absorbed okay were
0:13:24 they thin Bloods thin Bloods and caters
0:13:28 but how did you know to look for her in
0:13:30 the first place
0:13:32 I saw Neil's name on the list and it
0:13:35 seemed like there was
0:13:37 more looking around I should do
0:13:40 the list of people to be taken
0:13:43 she's ducking her head away from race
0:13:46 you saw Neil's name there on a list of
0:13:49 people to be collected she knots wins
0:13:52 jaw Titans all right we're getting off
0:13:55 topic first off does anyone have
0:13:57 solutions for stopping the spread of
0:13:59 xantoso Ira looks over at Reiss and just
0:14:04 says region
0:14:06 would I be remiss in believing that were
0:14:10 we able to
0:14:11 restore the door and the wards at the
0:14:14 center entrance which for some reason
0:14:17 was open
0:14:19 that we might be at least able to
0:14:21 contain this thing within the Chantry
0:14:24 alive perhaps but contained he looks to
0:14:29 be considering options
0:14:31 the Chantry would hold her for a time
0:14:32 but it would not be a permanent solution
0:14:36 and
0:14:37 I realize it might sound over the top
0:14:41 it may have to be the solution used for
0:14:45 now
0:14:46 because simply killing
0:14:48 Mr zantosa hinders us much more than it
0:14:53 helps here's a better question
0:14:56 can we kill him right now
0:14:58 I do not know what have you tried
0:15:01 we used
0:15:04 um
0:15:05 when we used uh psychic methods
0:15:09 of keeping him sedated and asleep while
0:15:12 he was here
0:15:13 the Sal he was in was reinforced
0:15:16 magically and arranged so that the room
0:15:20 he was in would be completely and
0:15:22 utterly incinerated and the event that
0:15:25 something went wrong
0:15:27 however something has happened recently
0:15:31 in the East that has caused
0:15:33 a psychic backlash across the world and
0:15:37 for some reason
0:15:39 the thin-blooded who are being kept and
0:15:42 observed were
0:15:46 affected by this
0:15:48 and their Affliction caused problems
0:15:51 throughout the Chantry that escalated
0:15:54 until Mr xantosa
0:15:57 began to go free the rise of the
0:16:00 Antideluvians
0:16:04 [Music]
0:16:06 is not entirely certain if this was a
0:16:09 strange word but by this reaction this
0:16:12 is not all this gehenna talk for she
0:16:15 thought that was one of the included
0:16:16 words because of all the kind of talk
0:16:18 Britta we should have a talk later about
0:16:21 how you know that word
0:16:23 it's a lot of Elders around
0:16:26 IRA has raisin eyebrow at the word into
0:16:29 the levians and taken one step towards
0:16:31 Rhys anyway
0:16:34 there's a lot of things happening to a
0:16:37 lot of different vampires right now as a
0:16:39 result of the storm in the east
0:16:41 to the ravenous
0:16:43 yeah wait a minute is that is this
0:16:45 really what we're talking about is that
0:16:47 what is that what's going on in the East
0:16:48 yes
0:16:49 yeah it's not just a legend that's
0:16:52 that's a thing Rhys
0:16:54 I can't believe I'm asking you a
0:16:56 question and hoping for an honest answer
0:16:58 but the end of the world I guess is
0:17:00 bringing it out
0:17:01 the name ravana
0:17:03 ravana is a name
0:17:07 that the first among the ravenous has
0:17:10 gone by
0:17:12 reports against
0:17:15 our influence the camera along the
0:17:17 Tremors quite Limited in that region of
0:17:20 the world
0:17:21 some conflicts with individuals embraced
0:17:24 in the area have caused us to
0:17:28 um information is inconsistent
0:17:31 what we do know is that
0:17:34 in recent past
0:17:37 ravnos and Kindred of the East the one
0:17:42 queer
0:17:43 have come to conflict and as a result of
0:17:47 this conflict the ravenous adopted a
0:17:50 Saban war strategy and began Mass
0:17:53 embracing
0:17:55 these Mass Embrace Kindred were
0:17:57 summarily destroyed by the one quay's
0:18:00 demonic power
0:18:02 but
0:18:03 so many dying in such an area so close
0:18:07 to what must have been ravana's resting
0:18:10 place ravana is the Antideluvian
0:18:13 yes brother we're just quietly looks a
0:18:17 little relieved to hear someone else say
0:18:18 it like it might have accidentally been
0:18:20 a camarilla legal word and this monster
0:18:22 rages
0:18:24 and
0:18:25 now there are those among the one Quay
0:18:29 who challenge it
0:18:30 and battle it in a hopes of preventing
0:18:34 it from doing whatever it is
0:18:38 that vampire is so ancient and Powerful
0:18:40 too and these three bodhisattva
0:18:44 battle it oh God
0:18:47 and they have been fighting day and
0:18:49 night this is what he was talking about
0:18:51 Neil A long time ago no just just a few
0:18:55 [ __ ] hours ago
0:18:56 I
0:18:57 I saw Neil
0:18:59 in the body
0:19:01 of dashwood
0:19:03 I don't know how I don't know why
0:19:06 but it's like his Consciousness is
0:19:08 fragmented and going all over the place
0:19:10 like he's just kind of being randomly
0:19:12 scatter shot into different bodies or
0:19:14 something like that or something like
0:19:16 that
0:19:17 and for the life of me I'm trying to
0:19:18 remember
0:19:19 I was worried
0:19:21 about Kabir and I can't remember why
0:19:25 what the [ __ ] is going on lately
0:19:28 I think he called us because he knew
0:19:30 something bad was gonna happen which is
0:19:32 true and also not our main focus right
0:19:35 now I think it is is it what can you do
0:19:39 about a gigantic Storm Out East right
0:19:41 now that's not my point my point is is
0:19:44 that all this is probably connected
0:19:47 figuring out why it's connected might
0:19:49 help us solve some of these problems
0:19:52 I think we need to get out of here we
0:19:55 need to either figure out how to subdue
0:19:57 or contain veto
0:19:59 until we have a better plan for how to
0:20:01 do it permanently you said you were
0:20:03 going to incinerate it did you actually
0:20:05 try did that not work
0:20:08 we were
0:20:11 initially
0:20:15 the fire would have incinerated
0:20:17 everything in the room
0:20:19 so we could not
0:20:22 do it because the Fail-Safe would have
0:20:25 destroyed Vita zantosa and we need him
0:20:30 alive why him Peter zantosa is connected
0:20:34 to
0:20:36 um
0:20:37 something we call the eldest but is it
0:20:40 something like ravana
0:20:44 yes
0:20:45 is it in New York
0:20:47 yes
0:20:50 if
0:20:52 the reports of the zento center to be
0:20:55 believed and the information they have
0:20:57 is quite
0:20:59 out of date
0:21:01 whatever it is
0:21:03 it is playing this game on a level that
0:21:07 is beyond our understanding
0:21:11 any missteps
0:21:13 could mean Extinction
0:21:16 so we have been careful but the zantosa
0:21:21 first we hesitated
0:21:23 and in our hesitation
0:21:27 something reached out to him
0:21:30 changed him warped him a presence that
0:21:32 we could all feel
0:21:33 was this the time that the storm in the
0:21:36 Middle East started shortly after
0:21:40 service if Vito gets out New Haven's
0:21:44 gone
0:21:45 the way that he absorbed those people I
0:21:50 don't think that we can let him live and
0:21:53 have this city at all be safe if I could
0:21:58 add some potential context to
0:22:01 what you just said
0:22:03 Yale is a global University
0:22:08 and unless I'm very mistaken with my
0:22:11 dates
0:22:12 not too long from now it's going to be
0:22:14 spring break
0:22:16 so if there's an infection that gets out
0:22:19 from this location
0:22:21 whatever is doing this could go Global
0:22:25 quickly I think we're already past that
0:22:27 point if if what everything else has
0:22:30 been saying is true this thing's already
0:22:32 in New York
0:22:34 and if that's the case
0:22:35 the kid who was dating Sheila that I
0:22:38 killed was already infected so there's
0:22:40 infected already already leaving New
0:22:42 York City
0:22:43 I think we're well past the point veto
0:22:45 himself said that the peace in New Haven
0:22:49 was a piece of from New York the main
0:22:52 body of it is in New York Reiss
0:22:55 if we destroy
0:22:57 veto would fragments of things he
0:23:01 created attached to him that house at
0:23:05 123 Ogden Street
0:23:07 would that be a sufficient sample for
0:23:09 you to try and do whatever you're doing
0:23:11 he looks up Suddenly
0:23:13 not any sample would do
0:23:17 a fragment that
0:23:18 he is caretaker of
0:23:21 the Peace of the thing
0:23:24 with that the project would live on if I
0:23:28 can go and verify it's still there will
0:23:31 you help us destroy veto here
0:23:34 yes
0:23:35 yes I would how do I get out
0:23:38 just me or me and Eden I mean we're
0:23:41 fairly sure it's there it hasn't moved
0:23:43 in the 12 years this place is completely
0:23:45 sealed and I I apologize for
0:23:48 interrupting your grace but I agree with
0:23:50 you
0:23:51 I also am confident
0:23:53 that it is still there if the Sabbat is
0:23:56 moving on the area and there are there
0:24:00 are so many factors in play right now
0:24:03 there are I don't want to I'm not going
0:24:06 to sell out my word on a risk if we
0:24:10 can't get out we can't get out and I
0:24:12 guess all we have to do is take a risk
0:24:14 but
0:24:16 if there is any chance
0:24:18 this about our angling as far as I can
0:24:21 tell from that attack on the gala in
0:24:23 Rhode Island
0:24:25 that was a big show of foresight
0:24:28 a huge number of Sabbat coming to
0:24:31 terrorize and to kill like a warning
0:24:34 shot there might also be people who can
0:24:37 keep Eden safe well we're locked in here
0:24:39 now
0:24:40 the piece under New York may be
0:24:44 whatever it is and affecting it but it
0:24:45 doesn't seem to be active in the same
0:24:47 way that zantosa zantos's spread has
0:24:50 been
0:24:51 far faster far worse than anything that
0:24:53 seemed to be coming from New York and
0:24:55 not just in our realm it has to be a
0:24:57 consequence of what is going on in the
0:24:58 East it might also be attached to being
0:25:00 all with a live person also in theory
0:25:04 one of the reasons the Sabbat is in New
0:25:06 York is they might actually be fighting
0:25:09 against this thing sure
0:25:11 would you for all their faults they are
0:25:15 again Hannah call opposed to the
0:25:16 Antideluvians are they not what were
0:25:18 you saying Ira would you elaborate
0:25:21 for those of us in the room who aren't
0:25:23 aware what you mean by other Realms it's
0:25:28 it's twisting the realm of spirits
0:25:31 and he's twisting the realm of the Dead
0:25:32 the shadow dance the shadowlands so it's
0:25:37 present in the shadow Lansing surviving
0:25:38 yeah it's it's not
0:25:42 it's not surviving it's thriving it's
0:25:44 changing it it's twisting it it's making
0:25:47 it wrong and it's doing
0:25:49 look around it's doing the same thing in
0:25:51 the realm of spirits in the realm of the
0:25:53 dead and the realm of the Dead have an
0:25:54 have a Maelstrom coming but you're
0:25:56 certain you're certain that that piece
0:25:58 could survive without flesh in the
0:26:00 shadowlands how do you know that
0:26:03 the dead don't go to places where it
0:26:05 twists it it it twists it it doesn't
0:26:08 need flesh it's not it's a it's a
0:26:11 mutator it's not a
0:26:13 it's not flesh exclusive so the same way
0:26:16 that you saw that blood in the snow at
0:26:19 Hell House
0:26:20 that's how you know or something more no
0:26:23 that's it's doing it here it's happening
0:26:25 here it's because she can see it so any
0:26:29 plan that would involve trying to Snuff
0:26:32 It Out by putting it in another place
0:26:34 like that couldn't work it's like
0:26:36 launching our trash into space and
0:26:38 thinking that it won't be our problem
0:26:40 it's gonna be a problem for someone and
0:26:43 eventually look at it it's growing
0:26:46 exponentially it's growing beyond what
0:26:49 we can contain well we know zantosa is I
0:26:53 that's all all we have is the evidence
0:26:55 right now let's stick with the things
0:26:57 I'm basing this on Hell House I'm basing
0:27:00 it on here well it is growing much
0:27:02 faster here I haven't heard about
0:27:04 anything in New York I didn't see
0:27:05 anything when we were in New York okay
0:27:07 but that we are dealing with the
0:27:10 problems we have right now right now we
0:27:12 do we haven't heard anything about Ogden
0:27:14 Street spreading around we haven't heard
0:27:15 about a giant mushroom Forest erupting
0:27:17 out of North part of New Haven no but
0:27:19 we've seen it we've seen the things the
0:27:22 slow spread the slow spread has not
0:27:23 stopped the house at Ogden is still I'm
0:27:26 pretty sure still contains that thing
0:27:28 yeah uh the group of hunters never
0:27:31 managed to get a chance to move on it
0:27:33 they were gonna try I hope they haven't
0:27:35 they got delayed they did buy a lupine
0:27:39 that same Lupine that's in my car well
0:27:42 my Haven now
0:27:44 how
0:27:45 did that go you brought it to your Haven
0:27:48 I did
0:27:51 there's not many other good spots to put
0:27:52 it don't have time to drive it out to
0:27:54 the mountains and you live kind of in a
0:27:56 bunker so it's not the worst choice and
0:27:58 Sheila she's your bartender kind of
0:28:00 amazed down there anyways
0:28:03 are we working on how to proceed from
0:28:05 here right now or are we gathering
0:28:07 information we need to figure out what
0:28:09 to deal with Sentosa if to you or Fire
0:28:12 won't work throwing it into another
0:28:13 realm won't work have we tried nuclear
0:28:16 Ms Britta
0:28:18 saying we know some things about Vito's
0:28:21 Behavior like like if you were gonna use
0:28:24 me as bait it would work
0:28:26 getting it
0:28:27 one location
0:28:30 if you asked him
0:28:33 or told him
0:28:35 to undo himself
0:28:38 would he
0:28:39 is trying to I don't really know what
0:28:43 he's trying to use his vicissitude on me
0:28:46 to do but it kind of sounded like he was
0:28:47 trying to absorb me to
0:28:50 I don't know if I could really tell him
0:28:52 to do anything with even with
0:28:56 um I'm sorry for not turning this off I
0:28:59 know that bothers you but I just I don't
0:29:01 know if I have many other forms of
0:29:03 safety
0:29:05 um I don't know that he would do
0:29:07 something just because I asked him to is
0:29:09 I guess what I'm saying but
0:29:11 are you able to get him to let his guard
0:29:13 down
0:29:14 so that you can touch him
0:29:16 can you touch him
0:29:18 Britta looks horrified as that that safe
0:29:23 or will that make her none of this is
0:29:25 safe and if she's bait there's a very
0:29:27 good chance she will die but I think she
0:29:28 knew that when she offered brittle looks
0:29:30 down Reiss has successfully called her
0:29:33 out
0:29:34 will she be able to leave this place if
0:29:36 she touches him or will that spread
0:29:38 let's let's move past after the time
0:29:41 being can't can you touch him I think
0:29:44 able to if she can touch him what can
0:29:47 she do huh not a great deal
0:29:51 but I can do much
0:29:53 I will craft an amulet you will wear it
0:29:57 you will carry something with your glove
0:30:00 ramps
0:30:01 I need a glove one of your gloves if she
0:30:04 gives you glove then one
0:30:06 then I hang Magic on it Britta looks a
0:30:09 little unsettled but off of the hand
0:30:12 without the Crescent her right hand she
0:30:15 does remove that glove and when she
0:30:18 hands it over to Rhys it's still
0:30:21 extraordinarily cold in order for this
0:30:24 to work it will take a moment
0:30:27 and if it is alerted it will cast off
0:30:31 any infected flesh before and has the
0:30:34 opportunity to
0:30:36 take its toll
0:30:38 up until that moment who knows what he
0:30:41 will do to her
0:30:42 but perhaps it is for that reason you
0:30:45 should go with her and make sure that
0:30:47 she survives The Encounter of course how
0:30:51 long were you down in the tunnels that
0:30:52 were fully infected
0:30:54 um it's been a few hours and you've had
0:30:59 multiple encounters with veto at this
0:31:01 point I've always had a barrier of some
0:31:04 sort and I've managed to avoid
0:31:07 um contact
0:31:09 UM other than one of the infected caught
0:31:12 me in a grapple but I got out pretty
0:31:13 quickly
0:31:15 time
0:31:16 I think to some degree her entrancement
0:31:18 of him is still working
0:31:21 there's no reason she should be this
0:31:23 unscathed running through an area
0:31:25 completely under his control hmm
0:31:27 are you familiar with the nature of the
0:31:29 Sentosa
0:31:31 Beach family
0:31:33 the thing where they like being hurt yes
0:31:38 they are addicted to sensation
0:31:42 is obsessed with
0:31:45 experiences one might have through the
0:31:48 flesh
0:31:49 Pleasure and Pain in equal measure
0:31:53 it will make him prone to risk I could
0:31:56 offer to shoot him again
0:31:59 you need to touch him with the glove
0:32:01 if this is going to work I need to begin
0:32:04 preparations immediately Fredo if you
0:32:06 touch him with both hands your hands are
0:32:08 very cold right yeah it would disguise
0:32:11 that one of them is doing something else
0:32:13 or a knife John takes the glove and
0:32:15 actually starts heading off to prepare
0:32:18 if I can keep half an eye on what he's
0:32:20 doing with Farm sight I'm just curious
0:32:23 what he's actually planning here okay if
0:32:26 I can see what magic he's weaving into
0:32:28 it yeah I'm also kind of keeping an eye
0:32:30 on Ira to see if he's keeping an eye on
0:32:32 her face he's yeah I mean I was very
0:32:34 clearly keeping an eye on yes he does
0:32:36 look over at Britta though
0:32:40 foreign
0:32:42 if I might ask
0:32:44 an unaddressed question
0:32:47 if this fails
0:32:49 or doesn't work a backup plan is to keep
0:32:54 him tried and locked in here
0:32:57 so that makes me particularly curious
0:33:00 as to who it was
0:33:03 that opened the locks in the first place
0:33:05 and came down here
0:33:08 not
0:33:10 usual
0:33:11 that someone like yourself
0:33:13 comes down here alone and your codery
0:33:16 tells me
0:33:17 you're not to their knowledge capable of
0:33:21 leaving three inch feminine handprint in
0:33:25 the side of a steel vault door
0:33:28 so
0:33:29 who else is here
0:33:31 is it anyone we need to worry about
0:33:34 there were people here I don't know if
0:33:37 they have all been infected or if
0:33:39 they're still here
0:33:41 people who
0:33:43 want the Santos are dead
0:33:46 enemies of the samitsi she is making eye
0:33:49 contact with a wind kind of pleading for
0:33:51 her to get it and as she's doing this
0:33:53 her bare hand is lightly tracing
0:33:57 fingertips along her other Palm the
0:34:00 covered one
0:34:04 allies of yours that make a habit of
0:34:08 going into chantries
0:34:11 when kind of seems to think for a minute
0:34:14 but she just gives like a little wrinkle
0:34:17 of her nose like she doesn't want to nod
0:34:20 but she kind of gets it Britta looks over
0:34:23 at Ira then at the increase questioning
0:34:27 looking over his expression only feeling
0:34:30 more and more caged in huge narc energy
0:34:33 radio I'm ready off of iron
0:34:36 we have a saying in our codery Ira
0:34:39 that's a tomorrow night problem
0:34:41 unfortunately Sheriff if I could offer a
0:34:44 disagreement you can offer it if there
0:34:47 are people skulking around who also
0:34:50 might be having their own plans and who
0:34:54 are prone to if I can make some
0:34:57 conjecture
0:34:58 killing tremeer
0:35:00 we walk through piles of Ash to get here
0:35:03 and Vito seems to absorb the flesh
0:35:07 the further down we've gotten the less
0:35:09 Ash we've found so
0:35:12 if there are killers about
0:35:15 perhaps enemies of camarilla
0:35:18 at least Clan tramir as we are trying to
0:35:21 enact some sort of plan and one who can
0:35:24 get through Chantry defenses enemies of
0:35:26 the zumizi open because I thought what
0:35:28 she said security systems that we were
0:35:31 using to keep things locked in
0:35:34 that might be pertinent information
0:35:38 Britta
0:35:39 is there anything we should know while
0:35:42 we are making this plan
0:35:44 that we should account for are there
0:35:46 people that are going to try and get in
0:35:48 our way
0:35:49 Ira should probably take off that PIN
0:35:53 so
0:35:55 acknowledging myself as a premiere
0:35:58 confirmation that of
0:36:01 your current Associates being killers of
0:36:06 the tremeir please don't call them that
0:36:09 I don't mean to call them what the
0:36:12 [ __ ] here but twitch you're gonna
0:36:14 power through but members of my clan are
0:36:17 dead and your friend confirmed that they
0:36:20 were her Associates who brought her in
0:36:22 here and bypassed our security I think
0:36:24 it's relevant I think they were between
0:36:27 them and their actual targets
0:36:31 here big pleading eyes towards Johnny
0:36:34 tomorrow night problems Johnny it's not
0:36:36 Britta tell us what we need to know
0:36:38 to make the best plan that we can let me
0:36:41 recount this last time we known you had
0:36:44 been abducted by
0:36:46 somebody
0:36:48 we're never quite clear sure who
0:36:51 so did that end up with you being forced
0:36:56 to work with another set of individual
0:36:57 people here Ira eyes British very
0:37:01 obvious tack gear made for her at the
0:37:04 words forced Britta looks more and more
0:37:07 like she's being backed into a corner
0:37:10 and she looks kind of close to crying
0:37:14 sometimes I do things I don't want to
0:37:18 and
0:37:19 and
0:37:21 Ira puts a hand up
0:37:24 I apologize
0:37:26 it's flat when he says it but he says it
0:37:27 anyways I think you've done enough used
0:37:32 to talking
0:37:34 asking questions of
0:37:36 other clans
0:37:38 I'm
0:37:40 not here to make accusations I just need
0:37:43 to know that's why I'm asking her to
0:37:46 tell us what we need to know because
0:37:48 otherwise what you are doing right now
0:37:50 this is compromising an asset on our
0:37:53 side you're asking we leading questions
0:37:55 Sheriff you're giving her the answer I'm
0:37:58 aware of what I'm doing which is not
0:38:00 getting facts I don't care about facts
0:38:03 right now I care about details I care
0:38:05 about facts then they can wait until
0:38:07 when we can give them enough
0:38:10 one Ira what are you planning on doing
0:38:13 with this information
0:38:15 if there is a group of individuals who
0:38:17 are targeting my clan mates and
0:38:21 killing them yes that is relevant
0:38:24 information to me and Clan Premiere
0:38:26 right more than that and for our current
0:38:30 predicament they bypassed a number of
0:38:33 security systems that were designed more
0:38:35 to keep things in then out
0:38:38 and if we are trying to stop veto from
0:38:42 leaving
0:38:43 then knowing who is out there
0:38:46 doing God knows what smashing down Vault
0:38:50 doors locking things in time
0:38:53 then that is relevant information and we
0:38:55 need to know because we could have the
0:38:57 best plan in the world and that X Factor
0:39:01 could open the door inadvertently and
0:39:04 all of this could be for nothing my dead
0:39:06 clan mates included great
0:39:10 how many of those people were still
0:39:12 alive when you last saw them I have
0:39:15 reason to believe that one of them might
0:39:17 still be okay
0:39:19 and reasonably that one of them's more
0:39:22 likely to have been infected along with
0:39:24 the other one that I saw to be infected
0:39:28 there's two that I'm not sure if they
0:39:32 think that we're killing veto then
0:39:35 they'll
0:39:36 the Allies I think if they're not
0:39:39 infected great any information we find
0:39:41 on them on the way through doors to have
0:39:43 I think most of them are dead Vito
0:39:45 Sentosa does not usually leave much
0:39:48 behind the group of us managed to make
0:39:50 it down we're in the smallest part and
0:39:53 Vito likes to [ __ ] with us the region
0:39:55 has been here for
0:39:57 quite some time
0:39:59 my clan started packing up days more ago
0:40:04 before this started they're all gone all
0:40:08 dead but the region has stayed behind
0:40:10 still here Untouched by veto it's not
0:40:14 outside the Realms to make an assumption
0:40:17 that a group of individuals who can
0:40:19 bypass chantries the Regents many
0:40:23 gargoyle was infected too many gargoyle
0:40:28 the little little gargoyle that
0:40:32 um
0:40:33 oh like a servant homunculus
0:40:36 I'm sorry when you missed that
0:40:38 opportunity a little pissed off right
0:40:39 now okay the piss is overwhelming the
0:40:41 dirty mind what nothing continue we're
0:40:44 having a moment it's fine
0:40:46 so of the ones they haven't seen
0:40:47 affected anything about their abilities
0:40:49 we should be aware of most likely
0:40:51 they are separated individuals maybe
0:40:54 operating in pairs usually operating in
0:40:57 Paris
0:40:58 what is left of the abilities that
0:41:00 you're aware of
0:41:02 there's one who's very strong and
0:41:05 time doesn't really seem to matter to
0:41:08 her oh
0:41:09 don't like that another who is very
0:41:14 trained with weapons which kind of
0:41:17 weapons any all all as far as I can tell
0:41:21 um a favorite most people seem to be
0:41:24 using guns make sense hand-to-hand was
0:41:26 not a smart move on my part I'll admit
0:41:28 that freely I don't really know the
0:41:30 abilities of most of them one of them
0:41:33 would be quick like me
0:41:36 any
0:41:38 pharmacists magicians in the group hey
0:41:41 with a strong amount of empathy has that
0:41:44 narc energy radiating is strong
0:41:47 because in the room it's radiating real
0:41:49 strong
0:41:52 any close-up magicians uh it is still
0:41:56 radiating pretty hard until I can't
0:41:58 quite control that part it's the one
0:42:00 part of hidden motives he's not good at
0:42:01 hiding but ever since he said sorry even
0:42:05 though it was like very flat and he
0:42:07 still seems he's got more of an energy
0:42:09 of like he's a cop that overstepped
0:42:12 and was like okay this is not
0:42:14 technically my jurisdiction I'm gonna
0:42:16 like at least play nice if it's tough to
0:42:20 tell whether he's playing nice or
0:42:21 actually trying to be nice and just not
0:42:22 doing a good job of it but like since
0:42:24 then the narc energy is overwhelming but
0:42:26 he's at least trying to put a handle on
0:42:29 it
0:42:30 if you can give us
0:42:32 four basic drawings or descriptions of
0:42:34 them so if we run into them we know what
0:42:36 we're looking at that'd be great we're
0:42:37 gonna take a few minutes here while race
0:42:39 is doing his thing he looks at the four
0:42:41 of you maybe I should give you all a
0:42:43 minute I'll go see if the region needs
0:42:46 help
0:42:47 step out of uh out of your shot
0:42:51 promise
0:42:52 and he just turns and walks over towards
0:42:55 where Reiss is working at least seeming
0:42:58 to actually try and give you guys like a
0:43:01 minute as a codery
0:43:06 when he's some amount of distance away
0:43:09 to miles to be a bit clearer Britta
0:43:12 raises her left hand in front of herself
0:43:14 using her body as barrier between
0:43:17 herself and Ira and clearly traces out
0:43:19 the Crescent Moon on her Palm he nods
0:43:21 with caught it before Rita you're not
0:43:23 good enough with auspects too are you
0:43:25 she shakes her head okay we're gonna be
0:43:28 leaving here soon our major plan seems
0:43:30 to be going down there hoping veto's
0:43:33 obsession with Bruto yet again serves us
0:43:35 maybe you could summon her him again
0:43:37 though I very much doubt it the trick is
0:43:39 going to work twice Britta yeah you're
0:43:42 here with the people from the flashbacks
0:43:44 yeah they might help if
0:43:49 I don't know I'm really confused um is
0:43:52 that who took you from New Haven no they
0:43:55 took me from pen Dragon who took me from
0:43:58 New Haven
0:43:59 okay well it's been a very full few days
0:44:03 for you
0:44:05 um wind just kind of takes Britta's bare
0:44:07 hand and squeezes it stuff with him if I
0:44:11 live I'm probably gonna have to
0:44:12 apologize to Prince Pan Dragon but it
0:44:15 may be it's better for you guys I'm not
0:44:17 sure we can worry about that later
0:44:19 that's the very definition of a tomorrow
0:44:21 night problem okay I'll I'll do the
0:44:24 drawings great that'll help at least
0:44:26 identify them you can just give us a
0:44:28 description this you don't owe us more
0:44:31 than you want to give and that Will Keep
0:44:33 Us Alive along enough to keep you alive
0:44:35 if I'm being perfectly honest I think we
0:44:37 could probably tell if they're not
0:44:38 wearing a tie with a clandra mirror pin
0:44:41 if they're not mutated beyond
0:44:42 recognition they're probably part of
0:44:44 that team I mean honestly most of them
0:44:46 are dress like me I'm just exactly we
0:44:51 have time look at it hurt it's fine for
0:44:53 me I don't know why they're insisting on
0:44:55 asking questions though who [ __ ] Ira
0:44:58 to be fair members of his clan were
0:45:00 ashed up in the hallways yeah I'd be
0:45:03 pretty [ __ ] pissed if those are bruja
0:45:04 and his clan has ashed many members of
0:45:07 my clan or mutated them horribly we're
0:45:09 still lit we on a long enough timeline
0:45:11 we've all [ __ ] each other at a certain
0:45:12 point it just doesn't matter anymore
0:45:15 when we're talking about actual bodies
0:45:18 upstairs we're not talking about history
0:45:20 here we're talking about piles of Ash
0:45:22 that can't do anything to impact us
0:45:24 right now or not enough you need to stop
0:45:27 doing that when I get into fights you
0:45:29 need to let me fight some people okay
0:45:30 when we have the chance to fight now is
0:45:33 not the time it is no it's not that's
0:45:35 why the enough comes out that's when you
0:45:37 think it's enough I don't think it's
0:45:39 enough I see that it's my fault I'm the
0:45:42 one that's made a lot of this Scott
0:45:44 Mommy and Daddy are fighting it's fine
0:45:46 it's not your fault
0:45:48 we're not mad at each other we've loved
0:45:51 each other very much
0:45:53 but we both love you very much Which is
0:45:56 less gross should be for him okay thank
0:45:59 you not going to presume your emotional
0:46:01 state that was that was on me get some
0:46:03 blood
0:46:04 take a few minutes Bretta will grab up
0:46:07 some of the blood but before she goes to
0:46:09 drink it she stops by the bookshelf
0:46:12 where presumably they're still Eden Eden
0:46:16 is desperately minding her own business
0:46:20 Britta in support of her desperately
0:46:22 minding her own business slides in and
0:46:25 sits to be more hidden in the
0:46:28 bookshelves with her and hey I'm really
0:46:31 sorry for talking about you like you're
0:46:33 not here and all the scary stuff that
0:46:36 we're saying I
0:46:38 I know how that feels and it doesn't
0:46:40 feel good she gives like a little shrug
0:46:43 I am
0:46:45 this is
0:46:47 all really scary but
0:46:50 it seems like it seems like everyone is
0:46:56 not afraid that they're going to die
0:46:58 here and now and
0:47:00 just hearing everyone argue about
0:47:03 future and you know tomorrow problems
0:47:08 it makes me think that we're not going
0:47:12 to die today so
0:47:15 it's it's it's bad but it's comforting
0:47:19 too
0:47:21 oh
0:47:23 Hope's worth a lot it is
0:47:26 I saw
0:47:28 I saw what you did with your hand her
0:47:31 fingertips flicker Telltale sign that
0:47:33 Eden's cracked are you the last daughter
0:47:37 of Eve too
0:47:38 swallow shake away looks down and looks
0:47:42 up at Eden trying to manufacture some
0:47:45 confidence for her and
0:47:47 shrugs
0:47:49 a bit of a completely emotionally
0:47:52 exhausted and over
0:47:55 it's that kind of almost hysterical
0:47:57 smile but being offered sincerely
0:48:01 I don't know
0:48:03 um
0:48:04 I don't think so
0:48:06 why not
0:48:09 well your breathing
0:48:13 hmm
0:48:14 seems to kind of like really think on
0:48:16 that energy Twitches hearing a cracking
0:48:20 of glass coming from Rhys
0:48:27 when you look to see what Reiss is doing
0:48:30 Reiss has a window pane that he smashes
0:48:34 and he takes a big Shard of glass and
0:48:38 heads back to the table where he is
0:48:40 performing a ritual Ira uh watching him
0:48:43 you get the impression he's about to
0:48:46 do some heavy stuff powerful magic I
0:48:50 have uh thumb site up do I know what
0:48:53 he's doing yeah so the glove has uh
0:48:59 beaten being attached to it or on the
0:49:02 palm and it looks like well sorry the
0:49:05 there's the glove that is having uh
0:49:07 Magic cast on it and there's also beads
0:49:09 with an amulet okay uh the amulet is
0:49:12 prepared as a waveboarding so it looks
0:49:14 like he intends to remote cast into a
0:49:16 fight and the glove is Enchanted to give
0:49:22 off the effect seizures uh the first
0:49:26 time that it touches someone of bruja
0:49:29 blood and now he is preparing a ritual
0:49:33 called chill of the windsaber and his
0:49:35 Elder level and kind of studying it he
0:49:40 realized he's going to crack the glass
0:49:42 at some point and decapitate anyone he's
0:49:44 looking at instantly killing them and he
0:49:47 apparently plans to remote decapitate
0:49:51 Vito xantosa
0:49:54 that is the plan maybe is also the
0:49:56 thought that crosses
0:49:58 I was mine once Ira sees it just kind of
0:50:02 keeps half an eye on on Race if anybody
0:50:04 does look over he does seem to be giving
0:50:06 them their privacy he also seems to be
0:50:09 cracking open occasionally casting
0:50:11 spells or little things on himself and
0:50:13 cracking open vials and drinking blood
0:50:16 just to refresh like everybody else
0:50:17 already had and then he drinks more
0:50:19 and then he drinks more and then he
0:50:22 drinks more
0:50:23 and eventually
0:50:25 nearly 50 of those little vials like
0:50:30 truly six gallons of blood
0:50:33 have gone into Ira just consuming
0:50:36 impossible amounts of blood sitting
0:50:39 there and occasionally casting and
0:50:40 stopping and then he'll start drinking
0:50:42 again and just how his body can hold
0:50:45 that much without swelling to disgusting
0:50:48 levels is who the [ __ ] knows but he is
0:50:51 just truly like guzzling an insane
0:50:54 amount of blood when we'll probably walk
0:50:58 away from Eden and Britta at some point
0:51:01 because she's we're preparing for a
0:51:03 fight and there's going to be an
0:51:06 unarmored child so she's looking to see
0:51:09 what sort of stockpile of weapons and
0:51:12 armor so she will kind of Reiss looks
0:51:15 busy so she will kind of walk up to Ira
0:51:17 kind of just eyeballing the huge number
0:51:21 of empty containers
0:51:24 um
0:51:25 armor I thought I saw some
0:51:28 on the table with some of the guns left
0:51:33 behind but Sheriff when I was going to
0:51:37 offer
0:51:38 the tremair in general and pharmaturgy
0:51:41 seem
0:51:42 unwelcome with your Coterie which is fine
0:51:46 but if I might offer Aid your flannel
0:51:50 armor for the girl
0:51:53 whatever you happen to want we can at
0:51:56 least strengthen a bit much like the
0:51:59 prince's sword
0:52:00 if you'd like I'll go with what his
0:52:03 grace says I'm admittedly not unbiased
0:52:08 and I don't want to make the wrong
0:52:09 decision because of my own prejudices
0:52:11 there is a small like Olive Branch offer
0:52:15 of a half smile and he just looks at
0:52:18 wind and goes
0:52:20 if most of your dealings with the
0:52:23 tremeir have been with the region
0:52:26 I understand the bias
0:52:30 but I would
0:52:31 if I could offer
0:52:34 I'm not wrong the region
0:52:37 is the last one off this sinking ship
0:52:39 that's gotta say something
0:52:42 It also says something that he's not
0:52:44 infected at all neither are we
0:52:46 tentatively
0:52:48 yes Ira I'm assuming you're casting
0:52:51 because this is just a
0:52:53 frat house worth of blood
0:52:56 so I'm assuming that you're drinking
0:52:58 casting and refueling
0:53:01 I want to stay
0:53:03 prepared if we're going down because so
0:53:07 long as the trust is there I think it's
0:53:09 probably smart that I go with you I
0:53:12 think we all need to talk about what
0:53:14 we're planning on doing when we get
0:53:16 there otherwise we're going to turn into
0:53:18 chainsaw in guts again and if there's
0:53:22 blood left we should probably boost
0:53:24 ourselves with it also part of what I've
0:53:27 been doing yeah [ __ ] it I'll do that too
0:53:30 um where did you say the armor and the
0:53:32 weapons were he gestures to the box that
0:53:34 was over on the table come we're done
0:53:36 with our Kumbaya I believe so come talk
0:53:39 to us about what you your abilities in a
0:53:42 fight so we know how to plan around that
0:53:45 and so you know how to plan around us
0:53:46 Ira gets up kind of Falls win over
0:53:51 best guess for what the region has
0:53:54 planned is that he will be supporting
0:53:58 remotely don't know the Region's
0:54:01 capacity for combat but I can't imagine
0:54:04 it's nothing he [ __ ] up Johnny and me
0:54:06 pretty good in a fight once he gives
0:54:08 like a look like yeah that's actually a
0:54:10 pretty good recommendation to his
0:54:12 ability to [ __ ] people up because I've
0:54:13 seen the two of you fight
0:54:14 the glove not to spoil surprises is
0:54:18 likely to at least temporarily
0:54:22 incapacitate the muscles of the first
0:54:25 brouhad touches so so he turns into
0:54:28 pudding send a shawl maybe don't get too
0:54:31 close to uh Miss Beretta at least for a
0:54:34 bit after that probably just violence
0:54:38 which I am happy to help with I had
0:54:41 offered to the sheriff
0:54:43 to reinforce your clothing keep you a
0:54:46 bit more protected if you wished I could
0:54:49 do to your chainsaw certain shawl what I
0:54:53 did to the prince's sword despite the
0:54:55 odds Ira I seem to like you
0:54:58 let's not push it by having you use any
0:55:00 of your blood magic on me
0:55:04 no like actually pulls a chuckle out of
0:55:07 Ira just like them not expecting that I
0:55:09 thought we were gonna have a moment and
0:55:10 we super didn't all right like he gets
0:55:13 it gets a chocolate you can boost my
0:55:14 gear that's fine understood
0:55:18 you Grace if his grace is on board with
0:55:21 it I'm on board with it and especially
0:55:23 of Britta and whatever where you're able
0:55:26 to give to Eden here wind starts like
0:55:28 pulls the box down and starts pulling
0:55:30 out whatever's in there
