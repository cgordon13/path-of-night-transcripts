0:00:42 [Music]
0:00:49 last time on path of night
0:00:52 Neil sire confronted him and told him to
0:00:55 walk the path of blood and caused Neil
0:00:57 to lash out and attack his friend Fester
0:00:59 Neil ran off into the night
0:01:03 meanwhile Ritter was invited to join
0:01:05 Roman Pendragon in the shower but
0:01:08 ultimately she declined
0:01:09 Johnny arrived in Yale New Haven to
0:01:12 assist his daughter and the rest of the
0:01:14 hunters with the Furious werewolf
0:01:16 wind was attacking the Bear's hotel room
0:01:21 a newcomer Premiere named IRA West
0:01:23 received orders to go to New Haven
0:01:25 to met up with the prince miles there
0:01:29 [Music]
0:01:39 you've had a challenging few nights
0:01:43 and as you wake
0:01:45 shortly after the sun sets you find
0:01:48 yourself
0:01:49 curled up having slept in an awkward
0:01:52 position in a hotel room
0:01:55 and the company of one of the most
0:01:58 feared slash hated Kindred that this
0:02:02 entire region has ever had to endure and
0:02:05 he
0:02:06 seems peaceful and still
0:02:10 it's like the the feeling you get at
0:02:12 someone's funeral on any moment they
0:02:15 should move but they don't he
0:02:18 at least for the moment
0:02:20 it still has the grave but it's the
0:02:22 beginning of the night it's the very
0:02:24 beginning of the night in the natural
0:02:26 way of waking up Brita almost starts to
0:02:30 uncurl but as soon as she spots that
0:02:34 Roman pendragonist still out she kind of
0:02:37 connects the dots and remembers various
0:02:40 times that her code Ray members have
0:02:42 slept in especially after they didn't
0:02:46 seem so regretful for things that had
0:02:48 happened and she starts to realize that
0:02:51 he's gonna be asleep a little longer
0:02:54 than she will and unsure what to do
0:02:57 about that effect she slowly finishes
0:03:00 the motion of uncurling but remains in
0:03:04 the chair so as try not to wake him
0:03:06 what's going through but his mind right
0:03:09 now
0:03:10 Britta is so confused she feels like her
0:03:13 feelings have been put through a blender
0:03:16 on high for days in a row now having
0:03:20 taken that quick shower before bed she
0:03:23 usually tries to use that kind of thing
0:03:24 as a way to pull herself together using
0:03:27 the act of prettying up to find some
0:03:30 sort of
0:03:31 center right now she just feels
0:03:35 young and confused and vulnerable she's
0:03:40 so a little curled up in this chair her
0:03:43 hair probably still has a little bit of
0:03:47 dampness to it and she just has one of
0:03:51 those ratty uh White Hotel ropes that
0:03:54 you can find
0:03:56 right now she has a little bit of a nest
0:03:58 and there's some comfort in that but it
0:04:00 feels so artificial and she
0:04:04 feels like if she moves she'll break
0:04:07 that spell and everything will go wrong
0:04:10 she's thinking about how she feels like
0:04:12 she
0:04:13 she can't decide whether she [ __ ]
0:04:16 everything up and now her codery is in
0:04:18 more danger than they would have been
0:04:19 before or if
0:04:22 something about seeing this horrible man
0:04:26 sleeping ties in with seeing his scars
0:04:29 before
0:04:30 there's like that flicker of realization
0:04:33 that she could maybe maybe she could she
0:04:37 doesn't even know what she would do but
0:04:39 she's realizing that she theoretically
0:04:42 has
0:04:44 semi-sleep-torpored Elder here and
0:04:46 that's a weird feeling just realizing
0:04:50 some tiny amount of vulnerability while
0:04:53 feeling so much of it herself
0:04:55 and trying to pull together the
0:04:58 objectives the scattered objectives that
0:05:01 are left uh after all these days
0:05:03 as you watch him
0:05:06 thought
0:05:07 you can see the hotel door
0:05:10 and the Chrome metal knob
0:05:14 slowly turn
0:05:16 after the most subtle click
0:05:19 now your shirt should be locked
0:05:22 for whatever reason through whatever
0:05:24 sorcery
0:05:26 it opens all the same when it opens
0:05:30 Bretta immediately calls out
0:05:32 hello
0:05:34 you call out
0:05:36 and then the other side of the doorway
0:05:37 you swear you see a ghost
0:05:42 and there is Romeo
0:05:45 spotting Romeo her hands go over her
0:05:47 mouth
0:05:48 and she looks to check whether that woke
0:05:51 pendrachen
0:05:53 give me a perception empathy
0:05:58 five successes
0:06:01 I've heard you a flicker of confusion
0:06:03 from Bretta that doesn't seem quite
0:06:06 right but it's Romeo
0:06:09 so she extricates herself from her
0:06:12 little blanket nest and slowly a little
0:06:15 confused approaches the door
0:06:18 she doesn't quite go to it she's going
0:06:21 within speaking range but I mean part of
0:06:24 her there's a flicker of Hope in her
0:06:26 expression as she's
0:06:28 spotting what seems to be Romeo he seems
0:06:31 like someone that she could see during
0:06:33 all this when she was trying to keep her
0:06:35 codery away
0:06:36 but the same time it's weird as you draw
0:06:39 close
0:06:40 you notice that there's someone else at
0:06:42 the doorway who was just out of view
0:06:44 when you were further back
0:06:46 and you recognize the man by the row of
0:06:50 razor sharp teeth in his mouth
0:06:53 and you also notice one other thing
0:06:56 you hear the slightest movement behind
0:06:59 you on the couch
0:07:02 and it would seem that Roman did in fact
0:07:05 hear you and quietly sat up in the
0:07:08 meantime
0:07:09 the man with the razor sharp teeth
0:07:11 raises his index finger and presses them
0:07:15 to his lips as if to shush you there is
0:07:18 only one hesitation before taking action
0:07:21 and it is to check Romeo's expression
0:07:24 Romeo is
0:07:26 stoic like whatever's going on he means
0:07:29 business but is looking to Romeo in a
0:07:33 bit of desperation this is not a
0:07:36 combination Romeo is someone that she
0:07:38 trusts and that's the cause of her only
0:07:42 memory of her parents being what they
0:07:44 looked like when they were eaten and him
0:07:48 looking stoic is not helpful
0:07:52 and Britta takes a hesitant step away
0:07:56 you see someone Roman says eyes glancing
0:08:00 towards the doorway but unaware of
0:08:02 whatever it is that you've noticed
0:08:05 yes
0:08:07 the man with the razor sharp teeth
0:08:10 says a word maybe a name but whatever it
0:08:14 is it has immediate consequences for you
0:08:16 he says
0:08:18 Canary now
0:08:20 and when that happens you find yourself
0:08:24 overwhelmed with the urge
0:08:26 to eliminate anything that might keep
0:08:29 you from rejoining the group that is in
0:08:31 the hallway waiting and you grab the
0:08:34 nearest object and turn to smash it on
0:08:37 Roman pen drag and roll initiative
0:08:42 you will be using all of your levels of
0:08:45 Celerity that you can for the purposes
0:08:47 of additional actions so having woken up
0:08:51 I have four blood and three levels of
0:08:54 Celerity burn three Blood let's go let's
0:08:56 go all right
0:08:58 17 24. that's a Roman [ __ ]
0:09:02 bed I rolled super well you're all right
0:09:07 he will use his first action to defend
0:09:09 himself on the event you attempt harm on
0:09:11 him spoiler alert you do give me a DEX
0:09:14 plus melee uh for your attack meet
0:09:16 against him is this a graceful attack
0:09:18 yes
0:09:20 I will say that you are graceful as you
0:09:23 attempt to smash the coffee machine over
0:09:25 his head
0:09:27 if you had said bust of Scipio I would
0:09:29 have just peed my pants because they're
0:09:30 everywhere
0:09:32 because Ikea has a rush on buses they're
0:09:35 not there long
0:09:36 consolation that's why there's so many
0:09:39 for successes
0:09:42 five successes and bats the object in
0:09:46 your hand annihilating it upon contact
0:09:48 that's his turn used uh to defend
0:09:51 himself what are you doing your turn all
0:09:54 right so I have a question as to how my
0:09:56 canary command Works must I try to
0:09:59 eliminate or if it seems more efficient
0:10:02 could I attempt to disengage you could
0:10:05 attempt to disengage all right then
0:10:08 knowing what I know I'm not thinking
0:10:11 that hand-to-hand combat feels
0:10:13 particularly effective and I'm going to
0:10:16 try to close the distance between myself
0:10:18 and the doorway you run out the doorway
0:10:20 do you close it or leave it open I would
0:10:22 leave it open I'm trying to run away as
0:10:24 quickly as I can you make it out the
0:10:26 doorway and just as you go to around the
0:10:28 corner you feel his presence behind you
0:10:32 with nine successes you feel a cold hand
0:10:36 grasp you at the back of your neck and
0:10:38 yank you into the womb you are not
0:10:42 rested back down on the ground and while
0:10:44 holding you still in the air he says to
0:10:47 you stay still what is this what do you
0:10:49 who's here
0:10:51 your turn I'm certainly not getting out
0:10:53 of this grapple
0:10:55 so I guess my next move is so tough to
0:10:58 convince him to let me go which also
0:11:01 feels like a crap shoot well I've not
0:11:03 known him to be particularly easy to
0:11:05 convince so I think instead I'm gonna
0:11:06 try to dread case
0:11:08 okay uh you're at difficulty 10 and you
0:11:12 need at least two successes before you
0:11:13 count to seven gotten one
0:11:17 Linda successes you botched you may not
0:11:19 use presents on this person
0:11:21 that is the consequence of your botch so
0:11:24 umbreta increasingly desperate to follow
0:11:27 the command attempts to dread case and
0:11:30 there's a low growl deep in her throat
0:11:32 and it is pitiful uh she already looks
0:11:37 scruffed
0:11:39 and
0:11:40 um looking more vampiric and attempting
0:11:44 to intimidate this man to Let Her Go was
0:11:48 a mistake
0:11:51 you bear you're sharp Little toriador
0:11:54 Fangs at him and his eyes narrow
0:11:57 insulted by the gesture and he raises
0:12:00 his fist which seems to glow like a
0:12:02 burning coal and there's this hesitation
0:12:07 and you fear yourself dropped to the
0:12:09 floor
0:12:10 and as you make a run for it
0:12:12 you don't see or hear any move to chase
0:12:15 you
0:12:21 I'm gonna be like leaping off stuff and
0:12:24 just Landing using foreign
0:12:26 absolutely we cannot do that I will
0:12:29 hustle in my sneakers as fast as I can
0:12:31 that's okay that's why I wear them you
0:12:33 underworld leap down to the sidewalk and
0:12:35 head for your car it's edgy as [ __ ] your
0:12:38 trench coat flows in the winter Katana
0:12:40 at the ready
0:12:41 that is almost exactly how I pictured it
0:12:44 thank you so
0:12:46 I saw you do you truly leap off like a
0:12:48 second Story full like yeah it'll take
0:12:50 me multiple minutes to catch you if I
0:12:51 don't go the same way I signal for you
0:12:53 to go out the front door I'll meet you
0:12:54 there he's gonna let the car warm up all
0:12:56 right well basically I gotta get it out
0:12:57 of wherever it is and then okay yeah all
0:12:59 right I'll meet you at the front door
0:13:00 yeah it's just fast that saves me some
0:13:02 blood all right
0:13:04 Ira will hurry down to the front door
0:13:06 thinking that there's trouble as soon as
0:13:08 he's out of the Elysium we'll start
0:13:10 muttering and casting uh moving his
0:13:13 hermetically symbold gloves on his hands
0:13:16 a uh storm purple Lambo pulls up at high
0:13:20 speeds right in front of the essentially
0:13:21 where you're standing storm purple nice
0:13:23 I uh kind of admit I like the classic
0:13:26 midnight blue he says uh getting into
0:13:29 the front seat I was like let's Chit
0:13:30 Chat he's doing it as he's getting it I
0:13:33 will take off at as pretty fast speeds
0:13:36 give me a drive check I will stand two
0:13:39 blood for dexterity
0:13:42 that'll be nine successes with nine
0:13:45 successes you weave through traffic
0:13:48 every now and again you hear someone's
0:13:50 like oh [ __ ] you what's this and people
0:13:53 start freaking out but by and large I'm
0:13:55 already occasionally needing to ride the
0:13:57 shoulder you make your way
0:13:59 and as you get to the motel it's
0:14:01 actually quite quiet
0:14:03 the door to the motel room that is being
0:14:07 used by win and Kabir as a jar and
0:14:11 inside the motels like main room light
0:14:15 flickers on and off this is it this is
0:14:18 where she was inside yes oh we're going
0:14:21 would you like me to go first to Grace
0:14:23 oh I'll go you follow
0:14:26 uh Lex just so you know for the next
0:14:28 four hours I will be fifth gen sounds
0:14:31 good I just immediately opened the car
0:14:33 door and hardly follow the prince I'm
0:14:37 moving in pretty quickly miles get
0:14:39 through that door and inside you see
0:14:41 like there was a struggle of sorts the
0:14:44 TV is smashed it looks like fingernails
0:14:47 have ripped that cloth and some of the
0:14:51 furniture and laying in the middle of
0:14:53 the room as if all tuckered out from
0:14:57 having trashed the place is when her
0:15:00 eyes are open she's staring up at the
0:15:02 ceiling her mouth is a gate fangs out
0:15:05 and it seems like mentally she is frozen
0:15:11 trapped and locked away physically she
0:15:14 seems fine all right Ira this is out of
0:15:17 my wheelhouse so I hope to God that it's
0:15:21 in mine then to describe win for Ira
0:15:23 who's never seen her before when even in
0:15:27 this state you get the feeling wind sees
0:15:29 more than she should it's a little
0:15:31 offsetting her eyes are maybe back in
0:15:34 the day they looked a little bit like
0:15:36 the same color and perfect roundness of
0:15:39 a seagulls but now they are the gold and
0:15:42 focus and perfect shape of an eagles her
0:15:45 hair is stark white in a braid down the
0:15:48 middle of her head and on the sides of
0:15:50 her head where there is no hair there
0:15:52 are the patterns of various vipers it's
0:15:56 been described as you know cobras it's
0:15:58 been described as other snakes as well
0:16:00 but it is definitely snake scale
0:16:02 patterns on the sides of her head in her
0:16:04 mouth since her fangs are bared you see
0:16:06 that they are in fact rattlesnake things
0:16:08 uh there's probably some Venom dripping
0:16:11 if she's lost any control of controlling
0:16:13 the Venom that she has to say she is
0:16:16 attractive would be a lie but there is
0:16:19 good structure in Her Bones she is
0:16:21 extraordinarily pale she is of course
0:16:24 wearing her flannel and a blue and red
0:16:28 buffalo checked flannel is tied a scrap
0:16:31 of flannel is tied around her left wrist
0:16:33 her fingernails are long but not
0:16:36 manicured they look like they are not
0:16:39 meant for anyone's pleasure except her
0:16:41 own they okay I phrased that very wrong
0:16:44 but we're gonna stay with it because I'm
0:16:45 on a roll here
0:16:48 um they look like they could be they are
0:16:50 to do damage they are not to be
0:16:52 aesthetically pleasing in their length
0:16:54 her boots you can tell have been they're
0:16:57 at least as old as you she is wearing
0:16:59 jeans that don't fit right she is
0:17:01 surrounded by various books a Latin
0:17:04 dictionary a copy of the aeneids some
0:17:07 notes a notebook probably a copy of the
0:17:10 golden ass by apuleus clearly she sees
0:17:14 more than she should she is a slightly
0:17:16 feral woman and something like this
0:17:18 should not have knocked her out Ira
0:17:21 looks around uh eyes seeing a lot
0:17:23 perfectly clear and analytical then
0:17:26 looks up at miles after he looks at like
0:17:29 the sides of wind's head and the fangs
0:17:31 in her mouth thought your friend here
0:17:34 was Gangrel not a set type Gangrel
0:17:39 okay and Lex I'm gonna try and look
0:17:41 around and I guess try and figure out
0:17:44 what the hell happened before I start
0:17:45 trying to do stuff to wake her up why
0:17:47 don't you roll me an investigation I
0:17:49 will if I can spend the blood because I
0:17:51 would like to do that twice sounds good
0:17:53 I'm uh I'm just gonna keep alert since I
0:17:56 can't investigate
0:17:59 this reminded us some work the prince
0:18:01 manages
0:18:04 so on the first roll it is six successes
0:18:06 and on the second roll is four successes
0:18:08 okay with your six successes you find
0:18:12 yourself kneeling down and examining
0:18:13 wins nails and her hands and you can see
0:18:17 that there's little pieces of the TV
0:18:20 stuck in her fingers fibers from the
0:18:23 fabric she taught it looks like she is
0:18:25 actually the culprit responsible for
0:18:27 trashing the motel room it's like she
0:18:29 was struggling but whatever she was
0:18:31 struggling with wasn't there and the
0:18:34 second rule you take a look out the
0:18:36 window and outside the motel room you
0:18:38 can see that there is a pair of boots
0:18:40 and that seem to have treaded and left
0:18:44 like this the starting of what could be
0:18:47 a muddy print and you start to kind of
0:18:50 think that you know hey these curtains
0:18:53 are thrown wide open so when saw
0:18:55 something in the window and lost control
0:18:58 of herself until she blacked out and
0:19:01 whatever it is that harm to her she is
0:19:05 still under the weight of its power
0:19:07 looks around and then kind of expresses
0:19:09 some some of that to the prince frowns I
0:19:14 can I mean if it's if it's a matter of
0:19:16 like harm
0:19:18 done her body I I can try and get her up
0:19:21 but if it's all mental
0:19:23 I don't know whatever did this to her
0:19:26 seems to have I mean it was either
0:19:28 standing there and we can't see it or
0:19:30 it's [ __ ] off but something got in her
0:19:32 head I am willing to take advice on the
0:19:35 scenario
0:19:36 I'm not sure maybe your pendant might
0:19:39 have information but I don't know
0:19:42 anything about this kind of stuff that's
0:19:43 why I usually rely and win well
0:19:46 I can try I just you know before I
0:19:49 use salamaturgy on you know your friend
0:19:54 Coda roommate codery mate also you know
0:19:57 amberjinos Protege so yeah um well
0:19:59 you're the one in the room that's what
0:20:01 I'm trying to defer here give it a go
0:20:03 you good with it
0:20:05 unless I would like to try and force her
0:20:08 to spend a little bit of blood to heal I
0:20:10 don't know if it'll work if this is all
0:20:12 in her brain you reach down and you
0:20:14 manipulate the Vitae in her body and how
0:20:16 much of her blood are you going to
0:20:17 attempt to make her spent I can do 10
0:20:20 but I'm not gonna do that much I don't
0:20:22 want to wake up starving so right now
0:20:24 I'm just kind of trying Force I don't
0:20:28 know how severe this is or if it's
0:20:29 mental there's a little bit out of my
0:20:31 depth so I'm gonna do three for right
0:20:34 now just to try and like if there's
0:20:36 anything suppressing it to kind of kick
0:20:38 start it back up uh but I'm not gonna go
0:20:39 crazy on it I'm just gonna try and like
0:20:42 okay I'm a student of the blood I know a
0:20:44 lot about this kind of stuff sometimes
0:20:46 the blood knows how to heal if you make
0:20:48 it to it and I'm kind of hoping there's
0:20:50 no external injuries but if there's
0:20:52 something inside that we can't see like
0:20:54 bleeding in a brain or something that
0:20:56 it'll fix it her veins darken as you
0:20:59 call upon the blood and it attempts to
0:21:01 heal her but while it is expended it
0:21:04 does not seem to find purchase when
0:21:07 attempting to hit its Mark whatever
0:21:10 wound
0:21:11 she is suffering from is a wound of the
0:21:13 Mind in fact when you reach down to heal
0:21:17 her you notice that her pupils are like
0:21:19 wide and there's this like fluttering of
0:21:23 the eyes as if she is attempting to
0:21:27 become conscious but whatever has
0:21:29 happened to her suppresses the mind you
0:21:32 think she might actually be able to hear
0:21:33 whatever's going on around her even if
0:21:35 she doesn't completely understand it
0:21:37 well your grace that answers that
0:21:39 sometimes failure teaches as much as
0:21:43 success so her body seems fine
0:21:47 it's something's wrong in mind but I
0:21:50 think I think she might be aware kind of
0:21:52 like a coma patient
0:21:54 so if you got any encouraging words to
0:21:56 help her fight whatever the hell's going
0:21:57 on
0:21:58 I don't know her well enough most of my
0:22:01 training's about defending my own mind
0:22:03 not helping other people get back from
0:22:05 theirs
0:22:06 I'll give it a shot
0:22:08 I uh I bend down I put my hand on the
0:22:11 side of her face looked directly into
0:22:13 her eyes and go it's time for you to get
0:22:16 up wait no effect
0:22:19 maybe her middle finger Twitches a
0:22:21 little bit but
0:22:23 I were frowns no fancy Grace I kind of
0:22:26 meant more just encouraging words of a
0:22:28 friend to someone who's in a coma not uh
0:22:32 not a mental command
0:22:34 it's worth a try it's a fair point
0:22:38 we learned from failure [ __ ]
0:22:41 he moves over kneels down like so I'm
0:22:43 like all right I don't know what's going
0:22:46 on in there but I really need you to
0:22:49 snap the hell out of it
0:22:50 um whatever's going on here and I'm
0:22:52 really really need this not to be
0:22:55 something new that's happening here so I
0:22:57 need you to to fight whatever this is
0:23:01 realize that it's all in your brain and
0:23:06 um
0:23:07 come on back no there are mechanics
0:23:12 miles did not do well no probably not
0:23:15 with his words of encouragement so I'm
0:23:17 going to add a plus one difficulty for
0:23:18 this role sure that will take your
0:23:20 difficulty to 10 and I want you to roll
0:23:22 Charisma plus empathy two successes are
0:23:25 required as you attempt to nurture her
0:23:28 and help her through this this trauma
0:23:33 that has been levied against or like a
0:23:36 blunt force instrument
0:23:37 out
0:23:40 does natural leader or enchanting voice
0:23:43 play a factor into this I will allow
0:23:45 enchanting voice to play factor into
0:23:47 this natural leader is an LOL no
0:23:52 I know I know
0:23:54 I don't know what's up her brain's
0:23:56 busted natural leader expresses that
0:23:59 miles does indeed have the talent to be
0:24:02 able to lead very very well but it is
0:24:05 not a guarantee that you're applying
0:24:07 yourself that's [ __ ]
0:24:10 it's been weird I just traveled with
0:24:13 tremeer here that is already way
0:24:15 different than I'm used to I show up and
0:24:18 she's just all right I'm sweating
0:24:19 willpower
0:24:22 uh four successes plus one more is five
0:24:25 win with with five successes in the
0:24:29 deepest parts of your mind the portions
0:24:32 of you and that hide your hopes and
0:24:35 dreams your fears and the core of what
0:24:40 it is to be when you find yourself
0:24:44 trapped there crushed under the weight
0:24:47 of the wounds inflicted upon you by this
0:24:50 horde of aggressors and somewhere deep
0:24:54 in that you can feel the condescension
0:24:57 of Miles attempting to mine
0:25:00 well you've got to know your audience
0:25:02 that's all I'm saying
0:25:04 this Rouses you to anger however
0:25:09 what can you do you've been reduced to
0:25:11 torpor beaten down in one of the most
0:25:15 unfair fights you've ever fought and
0:25:17 that's when you hear miles casually tell
0:25:20 you that it's not real that the map
0:25:22 battle is in your mind and you think
0:25:25 maybe maybe this one time miles had said
0:25:29 something intelligent to you that
0:25:31 doesn't offend you
0:25:34 look he's due for a win and so to speak
0:25:37 indeed he might be as he successfully
0:25:40 convinces you that the assault you
0:25:42 endured was perpetuated with the use of
0:25:45 chemistry and it was an illusion and so
0:25:48 I require from you a self-control check
0:25:51 to not assault miles for attempting to
0:25:54 dominate you
0:25:56 I just wrote self-control it's it's just
0:25:59 self-control buddy okay okay and I can't
0:26:01 spend a willpower or I can't you can
0:26:02 okay I'm going to
0:26:05 because I really genuinely believe he's
0:26:07 doing his best but he's so [ __ ]
0:26:10 condescending
0:26:13 two successes okay with two successes
0:26:16 you Stave off the desire of your lizard
0:26:18 brain to rent him asunder your eyes open
0:26:20 blinking now you look about your
0:26:23 surroundings and you see these two men
0:26:26 one you know very very well the other
0:26:29 you don't know at all the fluttering of
0:26:31 her eyelids stabilizes her pupils narrow
0:26:34 because she's decidedly not looking at
0:26:36 anything she wants to see but to a
0:26:38 certain extent she is so maybe they
0:26:40 flash down and then flash out back open
0:26:42 a bit there's sort of a a dart back and
0:26:44 forth as she sees and then she
0:26:47 immediately jumps to her feet and runs
0:26:50 over and slams the door and just starts
0:26:52 spending blood to buff her physicals as
0:26:54 you're getting I was like whoa whoa
0:26:56 there where are they okay no one where
0:26:58 did they go no one's here nine miles
0:27:01 there were like 20 of them according to
0:27:03 our new good friend Ira here uh you're
0:27:05 the one that wrecked this room well yeah
0:27:08 yeah because the TV was pissing me off
0:27:10 but uh but there were 20 of them and
0:27:12 they were screaming for blood they were
0:27:14 all
0:27:15 they they weren't they weren't Kindred
0:27:17 anymore they were they were hungry and
0:27:20 they were screaming and they said that
0:27:22 ravana hungers
0:27:23 and they were trying I I couldn't I
0:27:26 couldn't miles I couldn't bite them off
0:27:28 I'm not sure what it was it seems very
0:27:31 similar to the things that Kabir used to
0:27:33 do as far as I can tell but you're the
0:27:37 one who
0:27:38 did all the wrecking here it seems like
0:27:40 it was some sort of mental attack as far
0:27:43 as I can tell
0:27:45 she realizes her chest is tight and she
0:27:48 kind of like takes a minute and whatever
0:27:50 calm wind can ever find she takes a
0:27:54 minute and looks for she kind of reaches
0:27:56 over and pulls the curtains shut just
0:27:58 because she needs to so I'm not
0:28:01 I'm not how do I know this is real I
0:28:04 have zero answers for that other than
0:28:06 the fact that I'm still here and
0:28:09 um I feel like I would be hard to
0:28:11 replicate yeah but solipsism is a thing
0:28:13 I don't know what that is the idea that
0:28:16 I'm the only real thing in the world and
0:28:18 everything else is an illusion well
0:28:19 that's not going to help anyone Ira
0:28:21 looks at wind and then looks back down
0:28:24 at the copy of the golden ass and I was
0:28:27 like just size to himself and that's
0:28:30 probably still oddly just goes
0:28:31 Humanity's Majors psychology actually
0:28:34 soft science sorry how many degrees do
0:28:37 you have
0:28:38 a couple that's a big number this is Mr
0:28:41 Amber Gino's friend
0:28:43 so
0:28:44 nice to meet you he helped me diagnose
0:28:47 your general problem well not much help
0:28:50 I was but it's glad to be here then I'm
0:28:54 grateful
0:28:55 for you helping my codery mate I'm win
0:28:59 and apparently I'm the sheriff
0:29:02 oh [ __ ]
0:29:04 well it's pleasure to make your
0:29:05 acquaintance then sheriff is that
0:29:11 you are Mr amberjinos
0:29:14 contact right
0:29:15 you work with Mr Giovanni yes Mr
0:29:18 Giovanni I believe you refer to you as
0:29:20 your Protege actually hmm I
0:29:24 in court in front of everyone oh boy no
0:29:28 pressure there I guess well that means
0:29:30 you and I Sheriff
0:29:32 probably gonna be spending some time
0:29:33 together I'm not sure what capacity
0:29:35 either
0:29:36 I'm willing to hear he pulls another
0:29:39 morally out of the pack and is more
0:29:41 details in his coat pops it open so one
0:29:45 slides out offers it to win like he did
0:29:47 with Miles she kind of looks at it like
0:29:50 is this some sort of magic [ __ ]
0:29:53 blood Bond trick
0:29:55 But ultimately she still feels tight
0:29:58 where she shouldn't feel tight so she
0:30:00 takes the cigarette he turns it around
0:30:02 pulls one for himself looks around yeah
0:30:04 [ __ ] I don't carry a lighter I do oh you
0:30:07 do yeah that's handy he holds this out
0:30:10 too she Pats her butt a couple times to
0:30:12 see if it's in there and she'll find it
0:30:15 somewhere it's either in her pocket or
0:30:16 in her bag the room probably smells like
0:30:18 cigarettes or weed probably more weed
0:30:21 than cigarettes but both and she that
0:30:23 was even before you and Kabir got here I
0:30:25 mean
0:30:27 when when pre-gamed the room she just
0:30:29 she knows what a guy likes
0:30:31 um
0:30:32 so when will light his cigarette because
0:30:34 she's a goddamn lady and then she'll
0:30:36 light her own so you're working with Mr
0:30:38 Giovanni fan
0:30:40 yes and he's working with Clan from here
0:30:43 I think he mentioned a couple of things
0:30:46 to you I should probably go back and
0:30:48 talk to him he we should go back and
0:30:50 talk to him probably a great idea
0:30:53 do you do you have a ride I don't I we
0:30:58 could probably call a cab I flew here
0:31:00 last time yeah there's only there's only
0:31:02 room for two in that car it's a nice car
0:31:04 I'll just get in the trunk whatever
0:31:06 there's no trunk it's basically oh is it
0:31:09 the is it the lambo yes it's fine the
0:31:12 two you probably have some catching up
0:31:13 to do I'll take a cab I also don't mind
0:31:15 walking
0:31:17 might be good to clear my head he can
0:31:18 take a cab you're coming with me let's
0:31:20 go yes sir boss man and I will call a
0:31:23 cab and have it follow the lambo the cab
0:31:26 arrives as expected and the group of you
0:31:29 head off
0:31:34 down the hall and I added to the foyer
0:31:37 you see a group of individuals that
0:31:40 stand out like a sore thumb but oddly no
0:31:43 one seems to pay attention to them the
0:31:45 first of course is Romeo and Canary lets
0:31:49 that click into her mind as the word the
0:31:53 name and you yourself start to meld into
0:31:57 a single person beside him in watching
0:31:59 you with a slight grin and razor sharp
0:32:03 teeth is the nagaraja that you recognize
0:32:05 as code name Phantom
0:32:08 but there are more with jet black skin
0:32:10 you recognize the man that taught you
0:32:12 how to fire a gun your instructor and at
0:32:15 times protector code name eagle
0:32:18 you recognize your sire shrike
0:32:22 who is watching you with an easy
0:32:24 confidence seeming comfortable with how
0:32:27 things have preceded thus far
0:32:30 and then there are two others that you
0:32:32 don't recognize right away but you know
0:32:35 all of them are tal Mahira and with the
0:32:39 invocation of the name Canary you are
0:32:42 collected and returned into the fold
0:32:45 hustling the group of you make your way
0:32:47 out you notice a few things about them
0:32:49 even Romeo the wraithly figure
0:32:52 dark-skinned very charming smile that
0:32:54 he's had in the past that smile is gone
0:32:57 and he is dressed in subtle body armor
0:33:01 and that includes the presence of the
0:33:04 strange dark steel that exists in the
0:33:07 Underworld but not in the skin Lanes you
0:33:10 recognize Phantom adorned in a black
0:33:13 cloak and robes hover around his chest
0:33:17 and arms his armor kind of tightening
0:33:20 those spaces where else where it's all
0:33:23 flowing fabric one of the figures has a
0:33:28 very very pronounced widow's peak no
0:33:31 facial hair haunting gray eyes his ears
0:33:35 come to very subtle points and he is
0:33:38 this tall thin Noble looking man Eastern
0:33:43 European features are very much so
0:33:47 pronounced on him and he is wearing a
0:33:51 long coat with what is visible
0:33:54 underneath it more of that body armor
0:33:56 that the team seems to be wearing
0:33:58 whatever they're doing or wherever
0:34:00 they're going it is already clear that
0:34:03 danger is expected another that you
0:34:06 don't quite recognize is a woman very
0:34:10 small with tan skin chest not colored
0:34:13 eyes and she is wearing what is a rather
0:34:17 simple modern hoodie again more of that
0:34:20 body armor boots simple pants even
0:34:24 though she is not dressed in any of the
0:34:29 morph gaudy Fashions common for a commut
0:34:32 there is an aura of power that radiates
0:34:36 from her Eagle is dressed as he's always
0:34:38 dressed choosing function over penash
0:34:43 form-fitting clothes a bit of a street
0:34:46 wear sensibility to them he perhaps more
0:34:50 than the rest carries a vast assortment
0:34:54 of weapons on his person
0:34:56 shrike in this instance is actually
0:34:59 dressed rather similarly to Eagle as
0:35:02 boots come up to his knees black boot
0:35:05 covers all of them are wearing so much
0:35:07 so much black they stick out like a sore
0:35:09 thumb one of them the one with the
0:35:12 widow's peak looks to you Canary you are
0:35:16 activated for a desperate Mission the
0:35:20 time is now the final nights are here
0:35:23 prepare all of these words are spoken
0:35:26 and a language long forgotten by the
0:35:29 world
0:35:30 but recognized by you
0:35:32 gamalish you understand every word he
0:35:35 says and you know that you can speak it
0:35:37 yourself
0:35:38 the group turns moving in unison
0:35:41 yourself included and heads outside to
0:35:45 one of those kind of big heavy
0:35:48 reinforced money trucks and you start
0:35:50 loading in shrike heads around front
0:35:53 your sire and gets in position to drive
0:35:55 the others you along with them load into
0:35:58 the back and there you find weapons on
0:36:01 racks armor that is prepared for you as
0:36:04 the doors close to the back of the truck
0:36:06 and it takes off and
0:36:09 find yourself quickly disrobing and
0:36:12 putting on the gear that has been
0:36:14 prepared for you the tight leggings long
0:36:17 boots that armored style of core set
0:36:20 that you'd once seen an assassin wear a
0:36:22 long coat fingerless gloves you're
0:36:25 dressed with a certain amount of appeal
0:36:27 but it is definitely meant to be useful
0:36:31 in a firefight how much am I myself the
0:36:35 canary seems to be the over layer is
0:36:38 there's no pushing back I assume there
0:36:40 is there is that's bread is first
0:36:43 sensing the longer Canary goes through
0:36:46 the motions the more you find yourself
0:36:49 aware of this automaton that exists in
0:36:53 the back of your mind why don't you give
0:36:54 me a willpower rule like little flickers
0:36:57 the emotion of putting on the guzz and
0:36:59 it feeling so natural may be seeming to
0:37:01 feel like sitting in Miles this car
0:37:03 discovering that yeah okay I would like
0:37:07 to spend a willpower by all means
0:37:12 difficulty seven
0:37:14 three successes
0:37:16 okay for the time being you are in
0:37:19 control what is the positions of
0:37:21 everyone in this truck some are sitting
0:37:24 some are leaning against the wall it
0:37:26 looks like for the most part they're
0:37:28 headed to do something really really
0:37:30 dangerous
0:37:32 and they are more or less making peace
0:37:35 with whatever it is that they're about
0:37:37 to do so as Bretta comes into herself
0:37:41 and struggles to surface Above This
0:37:44 Canary persona for a second what she's
0:37:46 gonna attempt to do is appear to be
0:37:50 continuing adjustment in this case this
0:37:53 seems like an occasion where one might
0:37:55 prefer to have a knife inside a boot
0:37:57 rather than in a holster so if she tries
0:38:01 to mimic the natural way of someone
0:38:03 giving themselves space to adjust
0:38:06 themselves and to put the knife into her
0:38:11 boot and instead is closing the distance
0:38:13 for that door to just try and tuck and
0:38:15 roll you rush for the back door put your
0:38:17 hand on it and it starts to open and
0:38:19 then you rush for the back door and you
0:38:21 put your hand on it starts to open and
0:38:22 then you rush for the back door and you
0:38:24 put your hand on it and starts to open
0:38:25 and you find yourself in a loop mentally
0:38:29 in time Bretta definitely tries a few
0:38:31 more times before it goes and goes and
0:38:34 goes whether you want it to or not it's
0:38:35 just in desperation like even maybe one
0:38:38 or two times after she understands she's
0:38:40 still just uselessly praying that
0:38:43 something she didn't try the previous
0:38:45 time but after those last Stitch
0:38:48 attempts she tries to stop herself and
0:38:52 look for the cause of whatever the heck
0:38:55 that was boy you're studying the cause
0:38:57 you realize that the truck has stopped
0:38:59 and they've arrived to where they were
0:39:00 going do I appear to have set up at all
0:39:03 where am I then you are sitting right
0:39:06 where you were before and the door opens
0:39:09 the man with the widow's peak turns to
0:39:12 you I am Peru of the old Clan you are
0:39:16 about to embark
0:39:18 on a journey
0:39:20 save your strength and know know that
0:39:23 this is who you are meant to be what you
0:39:26 are meant to do Freda looks up at this
0:39:29 man and Catholic lands sideways towards
0:39:33 his unfavorable company as you too you
0:39:37 recognize the front door of your Cafe
0:39:41 and you've been in a loop so long that
0:39:44 the group has already arrived to New
0:39:46 Haven and they
0:39:48 are getting out of the truck and heading
0:39:50 into your Haven Brita loses her words
0:39:53 for a moment as that catches up with her
0:39:56 and a sinking sense of dread Everything
0:40:00 feels useless right now she doesn't feel
0:40:02 like there's a single right decision she
0:40:03 can make but she tries with Perrin to
0:40:07 say I I don't please I don't want to be
0:40:10 here I will say this to you
0:40:13 hear what we are to do allow me to
0:40:16 remind you of your mission and then you
0:40:18 may decide
0:40:20 if you are ready to be Canary again
0:40:22 shall we Bretta does not look willing in
0:40:26 the slightest but
0:40:28 her eyes scan his and that feels like
0:40:32 maybe the best that she can get in
0:40:33 desperation so she does dragging her
0:40:36 feet follow him in
0:40:38 you are a warrior Canary
0:40:40 a woman
0:40:42 purpose
0:40:44 long ago experimentation brought about
0:40:47 Horrors
0:40:49 these Horrors came in the form of this
0:40:51 institute
0:40:53 a force that mutilates the mind
0:40:56 Body and Soul
0:40:58 also not see it as a tool my wayward
0:41:02 clan mates seen as a symbol of their
0:41:06 power
0:41:07 but we know the truth
0:41:09 we are the shadow Crusade
0:41:11 and they start like setting up in your
0:41:15 Heaven as though they've been there
0:41:16 before bretta's stomach is sinking she
0:41:20 knows more of these words than maybe
0:41:21 she's supposed to she's trying to cover
0:41:24 that she's just trying to hear if
0:41:27 there's something that gives her any
0:41:30 form of Hope but the way that everyone
0:41:32 looks so comfortable in here
0:41:35 feels gross
0:41:37 she
0:41:39 the computer's in here they're usually
0:41:41 off while you're scanning around you do
0:41:44 notice that Romeo stays by you and
0:41:48 though he doesn't try to like smother
0:41:50 you with his presence is clearly making
0:41:53 an effort to be protective of you as if
0:41:57 there might be some people among this
0:41:58 group that he doesn't personally like
0:42:00 Bretta tries to swallow down a sense of
0:42:03 hurt she can recognize that Romeo is
0:42:05 trying to help but um
0:42:08 doesn't feel good at all
0:42:10 especially since uh he seems ready to
0:42:13 protect her but not ready to I mean do
0:42:17 my attempts to leave seem at all
0:42:20 externally
0:42:22 perceivable or have I essentially come
0:42:25 to in exactly how I was I think what I
0:42:29 know you are wrestling with yourself on
0:42:31 this the truth is you don't know okay
0:42:34 you don't know if you're just going to
0:42:36 automatically come back or if they're
0:42:38 going to supernaturally compel you or
0:42:40 what have you you don't know I guess
0:42:42 what I'm trying to ask is do I have any
0:42:44 reason to believe that Romeo has made
0:42:46 any attempts you do not get the
0:42:48 impression Romeo has attempted to flee
0:42:50 them but that could just be because he's
0:42:52 being smarter so it's not much of a
0:42:55 signal in British brain trying to
0:42:58 swallow down that hurt Brita will repeat
0:43:01 the gesture in turn try to stick closer
0:43:04 to Romeo what can you tell us about your
0:43:06 interactions with zantosa in the house
0:43:09 why
0:43:11 because we intend to kill him
0:43:14 [Music]
0:43:16 that doesn't feel like the answer that
0:43:18 Brett expected you had to fight him
0:43:20 alone the last time that is our fault
0:43:22 and you have been gone for some time and
0:43:25 for that you have my apology
0:43:28 but he cannot be allowed to continue on
0:43:31 the premiere cannot accomplish what they
0:43:34 intend to do with him and what is it
0:43:37 that they intend to do
0:43:39 they believe him to be a sympathetic
0:43:41 link to What Lies Beneath New York
0:43:44 brother
0:43:45 attempts to pass back some information
0:43:48 in the hopes that this sort of stalemate
0:43:52 will continue and she says
0:43:56 seemed like the house was getting worse
0:44:00 veto was caretaking it or the thing in
0:44:04 the house has it reached a point where
0:44:08 it can communicate
0:44:09 the thou speak to you I don't know if
0:44:13 the things in that house could talk
0:44:15 other than veto perhaps there is time
0:44:19 something has happened
0:44:21 I must warn you
0:44:23 that has been a conflict
0:44:25 a dire one
0:44:27 when the talmahirah has suffered great
0:44:30 casualties
0:44:32 Enoch
0:44:33 our city in the Underworld a place of
0:44:36 power has been destroyed
0:44:38 and with it a great deal of knowledge
0:44:40 needed to carry us through the final
0:44:42 nights
0:44:43 with what little we have remaining we
0:44:47 must take action against zimitzi for its
0:44:51 Stars
0:44:52 and when it wakes
0:44:54 it will be gehenna but not the events
0:44:59 leading with Justice that we imagined it
0:45:02 it'll be the consumption of all life
0:45:07 isn't really trying to hide exactly how
0:45:11 keiji she is at this I mean obviously
0:45:14 she would be she's listening raptly
0:45:17 trying to make sense of it shrike heads
0:45:22 over to you is right you know we have to
0:45:25 put the Jihad down set it aside and take
0:45:29 this [ __ ] out
0:45:30 of all of us here you're the only one
0:45:32 that's ever actually fought the guy
0:45:34 and you're the guy that you're the one
0:45:36 that knows Rhys right you know where the
0:45:38 Chantry is
0:45:39 bretta's posture had gone more tight as
0:45:44 shrike approached she knows only vaguely
0:45:48 more about him but it's still reason
0:45:50 enough to be even more cautious and
0:45:53 these things that he's saying don't
0:45:55 really help her in that race isn't
0:46:00 exactly the kind of person inclined to
0:46:02 be helpful
0:46:03 we are not coming to negotiate
0:46:06 a woman that you don't recognize speaks
0:46:09 up
0:46:10 I'm codename Tanakh I am one of the true
0:46:14 bruja among the last of our kind
0:46:17 our mission is a direct one we are to
0:46:21 infiltrate the sanctuary bypass its
0:46:23 magical defenses eliminate any who get
0:46:27 in our way
0:46:28 and upon isolating the xanthosa
0:46:32 we are to kill him and atomize their
0:46:35 remains nothing of him can
0:46:38 survive not a single cell it is not out
0:46:43 of hatred for you that I disagree with
0:46:47 parents approach
0:46:48 I do not hate you at all but I do not
0:46:51 believe that we have the time to waste
0:46:53 on your ability to navigate your past
0:46:57 traumas I haven't been a part of this so
0:47:00 why bring me back in you are always a
0:47:03 part of it the only difference
0:47:05 is that there was a time
0:47:07 when you believed yourself someone else
0:47:09 and the time when you knew who you were
0:47:12 Bretta doesn't look like she's sure
0:47:15 which one this woman thinks is which
0:47:19 is not specified and brother does not
0:47:22 ask but Baron interjects we need you
0:47:27 and I promise
0:47:29 the life that you have
0:47:30 the one that you want it is yours to
0:47:33 keep when we are finished here
0:47:35 and
0:47:36 I suspect that preventing zantosa from
0:47:40 being used in the way that they intend
0:47:42 to use him will preserve that life
0:47:46 this mission is to your benefit brother
0:47:48 grits her teeth and she tries to sneak a
0:47:51 peek to Romeo to see if she can spot
0:47:54 what's on his mind
0:47:55 she can't fully disagree with the idea
0:47:57 that Vito santosa needs to die that's
0:48:00 that feels Perfectly Natural but the
0:48:02 idea that what they're saying makes
0:48:04 sense just
0:48:06 shakes her more and so she's trying to
0:48:10 find traction with her friend
0:48:13 Romeo is watching you with an uncertain
0:48:18 expression
0:48:20 it's clear to you that you can see that
0:48:22 this mission is important to him but so
0:48:24 are you
0:48:25 and it seems like he's he's hoping for
0:48:28 some sort of reconciliation between the
0:48:30 two but certainly is not interested in
0:48:32 pushing you towards some outcome
0:48:34 shrike does not seem
0:48:39 uh
0:48:41 shrike is a little too casual about this
0:48:43 entire situation and uh is devoid of
0:48:47 empathy for your situation
0:48:50 she seems aware of your emotional
0:48:54 situation but has decided that there it
0:48:58 is not a worthy concern at a time like
0:49:00 this perun seems actually rather more
0:49:03 empathetic to your situation and seems
0:49:06 to have been the one that has decided
0:49:09 for the group that they would have more
0:49:11 of a candid conversation with you about
0:49:13 it rather than simply using you as like
0:49:16 a puppet Eagle is simply making
0:49:18 preparations
0:49:20 where's Phantom in all this nowhere to
0:49:23 be seen oh that's disconcerting what
0:49:25 when did that start you're not sure
0:49:28 I actually had been antonian saying that
0:49:30 bretta's subconsciously about to look
0:49:33 towards his many teeth when you look
0:49:36 around he's gone great
0:49:38 that thought occurs of trying to look
0:49:41 towards those teeth and those beings
0:49:45 from the first memories that she
0:49:47 uncovered but the next first memory or
0:49:50 rather the first memory is Eagle
0:49:53 teaching her to shoe and as she finds
0:49:57 her eyes instead landing on his
0:49:58 preparations she looks back to
0:50:01 her own and she says it doesn't sound
0:50:05 like you're giving me a choice as to
0:50:06 whether I'm doing this though
0:50:09 respectfully
0:50:10 there is no choice for any of us in this
0:50:15 what must be done must be done
0:50:18 if there is a word from the Dal row we
0:50:21 could wait
0:50:23 and it could
0:50:24 see what divination had to say about the
0:50:26 matter
0:50:27 we do not have those options
0:50:29 all we can do is take action now and
0:50:32 Hope
0:50:33 hope
0:50:35 that we have averted what is to come but
0:50:38 it looks to shrike
0:50:40 at that and she asks
0:50:43 is my Amnesia factor of My Embrace or
0:50:48 was it caused by this if I do this would
0:50:51 I get my memory back or is it just me
0:50:54 being left out of this
0:50:56 mention of your amnesia
0:50:58 they kind of look between each other
0:51:01 not quite having expected you to say
0:51:04 something like that Britta is confused
0:51:06 at their confusion uh yeah sure we'll
0:51:09 figure it out that is not convincing
0:51:11 debretta hahaha
0:51:13 there's a Mile's Planet
0:51:16 yeah we'll figure that out later that
0:51:18 sounds like a tomorrow night problem
0:51:21 having a little too much experience and
0:51:23 that kind of answer at this point
0:51:26 Bretta does not find that to be a part
0:51:28 of her calculations
0:51:31 what about the thing in the house
0:51:34 it is a shark
0:51:36 of a great role
0:51:38 of course it must be eliminated but we
0:51:41 do not yet know how
0:51:44 something is happening in the east
0:51:47 and many of what remains of our
0:51:49 resources has been directed there they
0:51:51 are hoping to communicate with it
0:51:53 reminded of our place at its side
0:51:57 but while that happens there is work to
0:52:00 be done here
0:52:02 a new Canary you are skilled dangerous a
0:52:07 worthy asset of the dhamma Hera brother
0:52:10 connects eyes being called skilled and
0:52:12 dangerous feels just untrue at this
0:52:15 point
0:52:16 the way that this short beginning to the
0:52:19 night has gone it feels flattery is not
0:52:22 uh very convincing but you know she's
0:52:25 that she knows that they don't need to
0:52:27 convince her she has enough at the back
0:52:30 of her mind to keep in constant question
0:52:33 when her sense of Independence might
0:52:35 shut off but being told she's an asset
0:52:39 of the tamahara that feels true enough
0:52:43 there's one more glance to the door
0:52:45 again that like instinct to try and just
0:52:49 leave the memory of the repeating
0:52:52 attempt coming back
0:52:55 she doesn't seem to know how to follow
0:52:59 through on that and
0:53:01 swallows
0:53:02 how can I believe you that you would
0:53:04 leave me alone after this and the lands
0:53:07 of the Dead there is a mark upon your
0:53:09 palm
0:53:11 and makes you my sister
0:53:13 and makes you our sister
0:53:16 and if this is meant to be our Doom the
0:53:19 end of the Tom Mahira
0:53:21 then I am pleased to know
0:53:23 that you have an unlife worth pursuing
0:53:28 I will leave you to your peace
0:53:30 but
0:53:32 until the Santos has killed
0:53:35 until there has been
0:53:37 vengeance
0:53:40 for what the soul leaders have done to
0:53:42 my clan
0:53:43 to my blood
0:53:45 cannot rest
0:53:48 we cannot yield
0:53:50 sister I need you the first time he
0:53:53 calls her his sister empathy comes back
0:53:55 in the Brita and there's a lack of she's
0:54:00 not sure in that moment she's not short
0:54:02 he says it with so much conviction that
0:54:05 she's wondering if she's missing
0:54:07 something missing something in her
0:54:09 previous self that maybe this is a
0:54:12 family for her or would she want to
0:54:15 leave what can't she remember those are
0:54:17 the sort of thoughts that are going
0:54:18 through her and that empathy grows as he
0:54:21 describes his feelings about it she's
0:54:25 looking like she wants to ask more
0:54:27 questions about what it is his part of
0:54:30 his clan has gone through but they've
0:54:33 mentioned time and the rest of the group
0:54:36 has shown their lack of patience there's
0:54:40 a slow and then a quick two stiff nods
0:54:45 not quite agreeing to do it but
0:54:48 understanding that she
0:54:50 has no choice
0:54:53 do you need sustenance
0:54:55 very much
0:54:57 very well
0:54:58 let us prepare
0:55:00 you will need your strength
0:55:02 I'll
0:55:04 I'll go hunt and that won't be necessary
0:55:08 she looks up trying to figure out what
0:55:10 that could even mean come upstairs
0:55:12 he starts moving upstairs and the group
0:55:15 seems to leave Eagle downstairs to watch
0:55:18 over the area she goes with them
0:55:21 upstairs you find what looks to be like
0:55:24 you know 14 15 ammo cases and some of
0:55:28 them are opened up revealing a gear
0:55:30 that's been transported from who knows
0:55:32 where uh in other cases there are like
0:55:36 softball sized canopic jars and they're
0:55:39 all laid out and shrike picks one up
0:55:43 cracks the wax seal over the top and you
0:55:47 are stricken with the aroma Vitae and
0:55:50 they look like the ones that the setites
0:55:53 had it does look similar to how the
0:55:55 settides had arranged to theirs kind of
0:55:57 keeping an eye on shrike watching him
0:55:59 out of the corner of her eye in the same
0:56:01 way that one would when they're trying
0:56:03 to learn anything about someone just
0:56:05 every detail uh she's trying to take in
0:56:08 but she does go over to feed effectively
0:56:12 as you're feeding uh you're actually
0:56:15 offered what looks like um this hung of
0:56:18 amethyst take time
0:56:20 or doing yourself to it it will restore
0:56:23 your resolve
0:56:24 you will be at your very best Freda
0:56:27 hesitantly takes the amethyst a small
0:56:30 dip of the head very unsure and
0:56:34 looking over the rest of the group tries
0:56:37 to follow the instruction as You Follow
0:56:39 the instruction a lot of the tension
0:56:42 starts to wear away
0:56:44 for you as working in this fashion and
0:56:48 kind of giving in to the almost
0:56:49 automatic behavior that is caused by
0:56:53 being in their presence seems to be a
0:56:55 bit of a comfort in this time and before
0:56:57 you know it you're making preparations
0:56:59 just like everyone else an agent of the
0:57:01 tomahira
0:57:04 Johnny
0:57:09 you and Crystal the two of you rushed
0:57:11 towards the sounds of whatever Carnage
0:57:14 just happened around the corner as you
0:57:16 make your way there you can smell smoke
0:57:18 and see bits of debris like little
0:57:21 chunks of plastic that were clearly once
0:57:25 parts of a car by the time you get there
0:57:27 you can smell the blood a certain
0:57:29 detective you recognize lies pressed to
0:57:32 a stone and mortar wall portions of a
0:57:35 little sedan always once a sedan
0:57:38 crush his left leg leaving him pinned
0:57:42 underneath it Jesus Johnny Goes rushing
0:57:45 over there's blood spurting from his
0:57:48 mouth and you see he's holding up this
0:57:51 badge a badge that holds no meaning for
0:57:54 him anymore he shouldn't because he's
0:57:55 not a police officer but he holds it up
0:57:58 in the same way that a priest holds up a
0:58:00 cross and while he holds it there
0:58:03 his eyes dare not shift towards you and
0:58:07 instead stares out past the smoke
0:58:11 seeing something in the Darkness
0:58:16 of course you're here now
0:58:18 I'm holding it still
0:58:20 but I don't know how much longer I can
0:58:22 Crystal support him Crystal dutifully
0:58:25 heads over to her friend as far as you
0:58:27 [ __ ] up
0:58:29 I know once she has a hold on him
0:58:31 Johnny's going to just casually push
0:58:34 away the remains of the sedan to unpin
0:58:37 him what seems to be like a bumper
0:58:40 engine block
0:58:41 and some of the axle are just tossed
0:58:43 aside all too casually by the bruja what
0:58:46 you see underneath it is mostly just
0:58:50 blood dimmed denim
0:58:52 crushed pieces of meat and Bone his leg
0:58:56 whatever was pinned is completely
0:58:59 pulverized he should be in shock but
0:59:02 there's something about the man sense of
0:59:04 grit that has him held together well
0:59:07 beyond what a normal man would be able
0:59:10 to endure in these circumstances and
0:59:12 stairs at the monster that would
0:59:15 normally send the human mind running in
0:59:18 Terror while he sits there paralyzed and
0:59:21 bleeding out Johnny follows his uh gaze
0:59:24 and looks down through the smoke to try
0:59:28 and catch glimpse of the creature as you
0:59:30 peer into the smoke roll me a perception
0:59:33 plus investigation
0:59:36 one success you keep low and you peer
0:59:38 through the smoke and there you find a
0:59:42 beast bipedal butt down on all fours in
0:59:46 the moment it's covered in like a deep
0:59:49 storm almost bluish gray fur that is
0:59:54 matted bloodied covered in scars it's
0:59:57 missing some of its teeth
0:59:59 its lip seems to have been split in the
1:00:02 past an eye is milky white in its main
1:00:06 of fur you can see braids and bits of
1:00:11 bone and metal and little trophies that
1:00:15 this much much more experienced werewolf
1:00:18 collected during the course of its life
1:00:21 of War
1:00:23 unlike the Lupine you had seen before
1:00:26 this one
1:00:28 has a strange
1:00:31 Effigies and fetishes that dangle from
1:00:34 knots of fur and what bits of clothes
1:00:38 that seem to have been able to transform
1:00:40 with it it's claws glint with silver
1:00:43 light in the dark it Bears the Visage of
1:00:47 the mythological Destroyer wolf and you
1:00:50 can see it just looking at it you can
1:00:52 feel
1:00:53 centuries upon centuries of warfare of
1:00:57 Bloodshed of Primal Rage
1:01:00 manifested in its Visage I need a
1:01:04 courage check yeah I'll spend a
1:01:06 willpower yes sir
1:01:08 and that will counteract the uh the one
1:01:12 that I rolled so that's a wash okay you
1:01:15 find yourself unable to approach it in
1:01:17 the moment even as a creature who is
1:01:21 cursed and Damned there is just enough
1:01:25 will to live inside of you that keeps
1:01:27 you from getting any closer Suarez
1:01:29 whatever you're doing with that badge is
1:01:32 holding it at Bay
1:01:33 yeah he answers and you can see he's
1:01:37 starting to get a little pale can you
1:01:40 keep that up if we move you
1:01:42 uh
1:01:45 a try
1:01:46 Johnny his eyes Dart around for a a safe
1:01:50 way to get the hell out of here not
1:01:53 seeing it uh a particularly safe route
1:02:00 he is going to
1:02:03 I want to jump out of here with Leaps
1:02:05 and Bounds but I don't think it's a good
1:02:08 idea to be doing that with a mortal
1:02:10 especially in his condition you
1:02:12 definitely get the feeling of that kind
1:02:14 of jostling can really put him over the
1:02:16 edge but
1:02:18 says there he's no better for it as you
1:02:22 consider
1:02:23 the hand holding up the badge falters
1:02:25 just an inch or two to hell with this
1:02:28 Suarez I'm so sorry
1:02:30 he uh Scoops him up into his arms
1:02:33 Crystal
1:02:34 grab onto my back she looks at you like
1:02:37 she is about to ask what why and
1:02:42 reconsiders the choice before the words
1:02:45 quite start to come out of her mouth and
1:02:48 she's just bunching her hand into fists
1:02:51 grips your jacket as she clings onto you
1:02:55 holding Suarez you can feel and you're
1:03:00 like those like meaty hands of yours
1:03:02 that this man is like he's like holding
1:03:05 glass compared to you he is impossibly
1:03:08 frail Johnny is going to channel his
1:03:12 blood through his Limbs and leap up
1:03:15 towards the roof of the building in
1:03:17 front of him now that you're holding
1:03:18 Suarez I need you to roll a d10 and if
1:03:22 you roll anything less than an eight
1:03:24 Suarez Falls unconscious
1:03:27 he falls unconscious as you're looking
1:03:29 up to the roof and you brace your heels
1:03:32 bend your knees and get ready to jump
1:03:34 you hear the monster go loose behind you
1:03:38 and I need you to rule initiative
1:03:43 I just don't like that noise 14.
1:03:46 27.
1:03:48 the very Spirit of The Fray drives It
1:03:51 Forward hey man you wanna use that weak
1:03:53 and Nightmares to go first though I need
1:03:55 Suarez to hold it off just a little bit
1:03:58 longer I need him to remain to to cling
1:04:01 to Consciousness just a few moments more
1:04:03 so that we can break line of sight of
1:04:05 this thing for every time you burn
1:04:07 successes on that willpower roll I want
1:04:10 to let you reroll that d10 here's your
1:04:11 first one go ahead no
1:04:16 no okay something about the Hunter's
1:04:19 nature keeps its Destiny from being
1:04:21 manipulated and it lets out a booming
1:04:25 howl and you can feel its breath against
1:04:29 your back in the course of an instant
1:04:31 and it swings its meaty claws and as
1:04:34 it's it's it's massive silver almost
1:04:37 hooked Claws and as it does there is a
1:04:41 shout that comes from a voice you
1:04:45 recognize from your Haven and she wails
1:04:49 no no no no no and something about that
1:04:52 manipulates the inertia of the monster
1:04:54 swing as if even in a frenzy it finds
1:04:57 itself second guessing whether or not
1:04:59 it's doing the right thing so
1:05:01 first you may sacrifice an action to
1:05:04 dodge if you would like yeah that seems
1:05:06 reasonable to me secondly Sheila as you
1:05:09 can see her enacts an edge her almost
1:05:12 Divine sense of compassion breaks
1:05:16 through the Primal urge of this raging
1:05:19 werewolf just enough that it hesitates
1:05:21 and suffers a penalty it's going to roll
1:05:25 its attack she is going to roll her edge
1:05:27 every success she gets on her edge is
1:05:29 going to take away a success from the
1:05:31 werewolf the remaining successes from
1:05:33 the werewolf however will be counted
1:05:35 against your Dodge rule so let's get a
1:05:37 Dodge roll from you ready I'll spend a
1:05:39 point of wheelbauer uh she will risk
1:05:41 Four Points of conviction
1:05:43 so the Lupine has eight successes on the
1:05:46 attacker with the willpower spent and
1:05:49 the fact that Johnny is Swift he has
1:05:51 seven successes to dodge with the slight
1:05:54 nudge that comes from the bartender you
1:05:57 helped all that time ago the expert
1:06:00 killer the apex predator it's claws rake
1:06:06 your leather jacket splitting the
1:06:08 leather as if it were made of nothing
1:06:11 but you remain unharmed Crystal let's go
1:06:14 with you okay and jumps onto the
1:06:16 werewolf
1:06:19 she successfully initiates a grapple
1:06:22 with
1:06:24 the get offenders she does not possess
1:06:27 sufficient strength to actually hold it
1:06:29 because his strength rating is more than
1:06:32 double her it is just going to go
1:06:33 through her attempt to hold him soon
1:06:35 enough you make it to the roof well I
1:06:39 don't know that I do
1:06:40 I spent my action to dodge that is true
1:06:43 and you don't have any celebrity actions
1:06:45 I did not burn up for any celebrity
1:06:47 looks like you stay down here okay with
1:06:50 everyone having burned their actions on
1:06:52 that we go to round two
1:06:54 [Music]
1:06:57 foreign
1:07:01 to be spending on Celerity while I'm
1:07:04 holding a guy Bleeding Out
1:07:08 I'm spending three blood for Celerity
1:07:10 actions
1:07:11 okay
1:07:13 puts my initiative down to 11.
1:07:15 understood Johnny's eyes go to pin
1:07:18 Pricks as he feels the tank drop out
1:07:21 from under him and he probably takes on
1:07:24 a very even without the hunter sight
1:07:26 beastial appearance his fangs drop and
1:07:30 his mouth starts to gape with Hunger but
1:07:33 he is running hot like an engine
1:07:35 the Lupine
1:07:37 growls and it's it's such a massive
1:07:41 presence that you can feel you're still
1:07:44 heart kind of tremble in the presence of
1:07:47 just that kind of like level of bass and
1:07:49 the last thing you see before giving in
1:07:54 to your own beast and contending with
1:07:57 this monster is do I immediately go to
1:08:00 hunger frenzy by being zero or you do
1:08:02 get a self-control check but you have
1:08:03 zero dice okay oh you could spend a
1:08:05 point of willpower to have one success
1:08:06 and no dice yeah I'll do that that's
1:08:08 that that's what we do yeah absolutely
1:08:11 no no I'm not intending to lose control
1:08:13 myself okay I I just need all those
1:08:16 actions man all right so here we are at
1:08:19 the bottom of the barrel you dig deep it
1:08:22 reflexively activates a gift and will
1:08:27 attack its Grappler at difficulty three
1:08:30 with seven successes it bites into the
1:08:35 Avenger who stepped forward to fight it
1:08:37 the Lupine currently has a strength
1:08:39 rating of 14.
1:08:41 plus one bite
1:08:48 Joey's mom
1:08:50 will suffer 13 levels of aggravated
1:08:52 damage
1:08:53 and is torn asunder
1:08:56 there is a spray of blood in all
1:08:59 directions and in instant issues
1:09:02 rendered into an unrecognizable pile of
1:09:05 meat its head shakes and Shakes and
1:09:09 Shakes
1:09:10 waving the chunks of Flesh until it all
1:09:13 comes loose and falls apart on the
1:09:15 ground against the wall on your clothes
1:09:18 all over Suarez the area is covered
1:09:24 and the mother's flesh
1:09:26 [Music]
1:09:30 Johnny here go
1:09:32 I'll spend a willpower to make maintain
1:09:34 control of myself understood with the
1:09:36 shower of blood from Crystal being torn
1:09:39 apart as coolly as he can Johnny turns
1:09:42 levels the heavy revolver at the kneecap
1:09:44 of the werewolf and fires Point Blank
1:09:47 I'll spend a willpower
1:09:49 and we'll have three successes two
1:09:51 successes will carry over into damage so
1:09:54 eight dice altogether yes sir
1:09:56 two damage and that has been hamstringed
1:09:58 correct correct you have performed uh a
1:10:00 hamstring maneuver
1:10:02 your aim is true and the silver round
1:10:05 punctures through the iron solid flesh
1:10:09 and while it doesn't seem to experience
1:10:12 pain its ability to hold its weight up
1:10:14 falters and it drops down to the three
1:10:18 limbs that are still functional what
1:10:20 this will mean for you is that it's ha
1:10:22 its movement rating is halved because of
1:10:25 how long this Beast has been in the
1:10:28 throes of frenzy it's gassed in terms of
1:10:31 its ability to take multiple actions so
1:10:34 while extremely dangerous there is now a
1:10:37 limit to how much harm it can cause
1:10:39 around itself
1:10:41 Johnny who is expecting to have to dodge
1:10:44 another claw before he would be able to
1:10:46 jump away
1:10:47 sees this thing with its head now level
1:10:50 with his and his brow kind of knots up
1:10:53 his Beast wanting to break free and go
1:10:56 to frenzy and he holds it in check for
1:10:58 just a few moments longer as he uses his
1:11:01 Celerity to fire another round directly
1:11:04 into its head it's as you stare down at
1:11:06 it and looks back at you you see it you
1:11:09 see how much his daughter looked like
1:11:11 him
1:11:12 difficult D7 Point Blank yes I will
1:11:14 spend another point of willpower
1:11:17 seven successes six successes will carry
1:11:20 over into damage
1:11:23 come on
1:11:24 uh being that I'm shooting in the head
1:11:26 are there any increased difficulty for
1:11:28 uh playing or doing damage or uh you do
1:11:31 get an extra three dice of damage
1:11:35 five damage altogether you strike it for
1:11:38 another five Health levels of unsoakable
1:11:40 aggravated damage and it shakes its head
1:11:43 in the way that an animal does when a
1:11:45 fly gets too close to its eye Johnny
1:11:47 fires again
1:11:50 my second action another point of
1:11:53 willpower
1:11:54 six successes that's five though carry
1:11:57 over to damage dice
1:11:59 no there's six levels of damage
1:12:03 you hit it and for a moment you swear
1:12:06 it's heart stops
1:12:09 but you seem to have pushed it to a new
1:12:12 height of Rage
1:12:14 and the silver wounds close and it's
1:12:17 regeneration gets pumped into overdrive
1:12:20 as the monster refuses to die
1:12:24 for a moment you swear
1:12:26 it recognizes your scent
1:12:32 this is such a bad situation
1:12:35 how many actions do you have left this
1:12:37 round I have one action left I have two
1:12:39 points of willpower
1:12:42 I have zero blood
1:12:44 there's this uh moment
1:12:46 in a fight where
1:12:48 you have this choice of all right do we
1:12:51 Retreat while I've got it on the ropes
1:12:54 or do I go for The Knockout and and this
1:12:58 straight out yeah and the question is
1:13:00 like if you don't knock them out
1:13:04 you die yeah the problem is is that I
1:13:08 will not be able to take multiple
1:13:09 actions after this this is it
1:13:12 no [ __ ] it I'm putting another bolt in
1:13:13 this werewolf let's do this let's do
1:13:15 this okay
1:13:17 eat silver
1:13:20 spending another one point of willpower

1:13:29 carryover and remember plus three damage
1:13:31 for shooting in the face
1:13:34 foreign
1:13:40 successes
1:13:43 okay with four successes
1:13:46 you fire right into its open maw as it
1:13:51 moves to snap its jaws shut over your
1:13:55 head and before it can quite make it to
1:13:58 your face as it does that like lunge
1:14:01 the round enters its mouth
1:14:05 you see it hit the back of its throat
1:14:08 you hear it Ricochet off of some metal
1:14:12 somewhere behind it as there's an exit
1:14:14 wound
1:14:15 and the monster collides against you
1:14:18 slumping and breathing shallowly
1:14:22 as it begins to revert back into the
1:14:26 shape of a man
1:14:28 Johnny drops the pistol and kind of
1:14:31 catches this form
1:14:33 and it tries to push it back Aloft with
1:14:36 with that free arm while letting Suarez
1:14:40 drop to the ground Sheila rushes over
1:14:42 Johnny will spend another point of
1:14:44 willpower get Suarez out of here
1:14:47 she dies fast
1:14:49 what about the man she says looking at
1:14:51 the clear blood covered monster we have
