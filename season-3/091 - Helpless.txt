0:00:32 [Music]
0:00:38 last time on path of night the Cordy
0:00:42 rode back to New Haven with their
0:00:44 allies they made preparations for war
0:00:47 deciding first to have Neil help BR and
0:00:49 Miles through a duranki ritual to heal
0:00:52 their shattered
0:00:53 Minds the trio began their Ascent of the
0:00:56 ladder of heaven and there miles faced
0:01:00 his
0:01:03 [Music]
0:01:28 fears bro
0:01:32 you find yourself passing through the
0:01:36 Spheres borders and into the
0:01:40 world but unlike
0:01:44 miles you do not land upon its
0:01:49 surface but rather crash through into
0:01:53 the watery Caverns below
0:01:57 [Music]
0:02:00 and
0:02:06 there you find this very small
0:02:12 Sanctuary within it are
0:02:15 statues you recognize them Having
0:02:19 learned their names by heart when you
0:02:21 were just a little
0:02:26 girl salon s TR
0:02:31 you recognize the crumbled statue bruha
0:02:35 that lies Beyond troil

0:02:54 you the statue
0:02:58 says you are
0:03:03 BR tries to wipe the cold water out of
0:03:07 her face it all feels so clinging and as
0:03:11 the statues start to move she takes a
0:03:15 step back
0:03:18 smitti seeing this
0:03:20 form familiar in a memory that she
0:03:23 didn't know she
0:03:24 had but also with the Echoes of what she
0:03:27 does know of herself she
0:03:30 squeezes her eyes shut and she
0:03:34 says you're not real you're not real

0:04:09 taking steps away but she

0:08:49 hand its fingers brush along the side of
0:08:53 your cheeks from behind and sort of left
0:08:56 over your shoulder kind of dangling as a
0:08:59 decoration

0:09:03 spine your last
0:09:06 chance praim yourself
0:09:11 supplicant I saw what you did to Hell

0:09:17 Chantry
0:09:19 and and the orange the mold that's
0:09:24 coming up through the city and New
0:09:27 Haven all of
0:09:30 the rot
0:09:32 and the fungus
0:09:35 and and I I can't let the world be like
0:09:39 that I I
0:09:40 can't you can claim that it's all pain
0:09:44 that's going to go away that's whatever
0:09:46 you believe
0:09:48 but but
0:09:50 no you're going to hurt people you're
0:09:52 going to hurt people exactly like this
0:09:54 and and I don't want to be Hostage to
0:09:57 that slay her
0:10:00 and a pair of arms wrap around you but
0:10:04 they don't yank they're not forceful
0:10:06 they're actually warm to the
0:10:08 touch hey hey
0:10:10 hey you did it let's get out of this
0:10:17 cave and Romeo takes your hand and walks
0:10:21 so that you can see
0:10:22 him and he is warm to the touch
0:10:28 unharmed and and he leads you from the
0:10:30 cave BR holds on to him almost too
0:10:34 tightly and follows him
0:10:40 out Johnny when things are getting a
0:10:44 little weird you're seeing these those
0:10:48 Crimson tears starting to roll down both
0:10:51 miles and Britta
0:10:53 cheeks Neil seems pretty chill he's just
0:10:57 kind of doing his thing not really f the
0:10:59 two of them seem like they are going
0:11:02 through it and that is when you notice
0:11:07 that beyond the backyard of Miles
0:11:10 property there is the shine of
0:11:14 flashlights and hooded figures boosting
0:11:17 each other over the Back
0:11:19 Fence and it's like eight and
0:11:23 all and they've got some cheap guns
0:11:27 hiking boots torn up
0:11:29 jeans and in the dark wind particularly
0:11:34 you recognize they have
0:11:36 fangs Johnny these are uh these look
0:11:39 like Kindred coming it's readily
0:11:41 apparent that they don't quite see you
0:11:43 guys yet
0:11:45 and it's also very clear to the two of
0:11:49 you that these are not experienced
0:11:53 Kindred they're awkward they're noisy
0:11:56 they don't have any of the natural
0:12:00 predatory well I don't want to say
0:12:02 natural but the the predatory like
0:12:04 behaviors that Kindred develop as they
0:12:06 become more experienced they're just
0:12:08 people these are most likely shovel
0:12:11 heads very likely okay how many you see
0:12:15 Wynn so Wynn just pops her ganger eyes on
0:12:19 there's eight of them they they're not
0:12:21 moving like a unit they're they're not
0:12:23 all carrying flashlights right there's
0:12:24 only a couple of flashlights among them
0:12:26 only a few flashlights and they're
0:12:28 they're carrying flashlights yeah
0:12:30 there's tell you what
0:12:32 this this feels like a formality not an
0:12:35 actual attack if I'm being honest or a
0:12:38 distraction it might be but that they
0:12:41 can still cause a lot of trouble if they
0:12:43 get here while they're just sitting like
0:12:45 this and I don't think this is unique to
0:12:48 us this is happening everywhere probably
0:12:51 I'll go after the ones with the
0:12:52 flashlights you go after the ones on the
0:12:54 outskirts that I can't see
0:12:56 do here's my concern does one of need to
0:12:59 stay here in case there is another group
0:13:01 coming up that we don't know about yet
0:13:03 let's just be quick about it okay Johnny
0:13:05 will spend two blood for City when will
0:13:07 follow suit but will also pop claw this
0:13:10 does put him at a zero blood pool oh
0:13:14 okay oh buddy please so I'm going in to
0:13:17 get some blood she will try to be a
0:13:19 little stealthy as she approaches the
0:13:20 group roll me a DEX plus stealth you're
0:13:24 at a minus one difficulty because it's
0:13:26 dark
0:13:27 out once success um I will also give you
0:13:30 a stealth check to
0:13:33 approach so only two successes all right
0:13:36 I'm uh going to roll the resisted
0:13:39 rolls they have one how do the two of
0:13:42 you approach one of them goes what the
0:13:45 [ __ ] is that and they Shine the
0:13:47 flashlight right in your face when your
0:13:49 [ __ ] problem uh oh am I close enough
0:13:52 to grab one of them if you have
0:13:54 initiative they're not like right up
0:13:55 against you why don't you roll
0:13:57 initiative why don't we all roll
0:13:58 initiative
0:14:01 10 14 uh before combat starts okay you
0:14:05 may take one action at minus one diff
0:14:07 can I split that action not for a
0:14:09 surprise now okay oh and you uh gain
0:14:11 plus one die okay so minus one plus one
0:14:14 no no no so minus one difficulty oh
0:14:17 difficulty but plus one die it's dark
0:14:19 out so both of them are to your benefit
0:14:21 MH of the shovel heads is there one that
0:14:24 looks like they're mostly in charge or
0:14:26 kind of like calling shots amongst the
0:14:28 rest it's difficult to tell because
0:14:30 while there is probably someone in
0:14:32 charge they're probably not doing good
0:14:34 enough of a job that they're really
0:14:36 standing out to you do any of them have
0:14:38 any uh you said there's some weapons
0:14:40 amongst them uh what's the meanest
0:14:42 looking weapon among all of them uh one
0:14:44 of them has a uh what is traditionally
0:14:48 referred to as a nail bat uh another one
0:14:50 has a wooden steak so the person with uh
0:14:53 the shovel head with the the steak
0:14:55 Johnny thinks that seven shovel heads is
0:14:59 probably better to deal with than eight
0:15:01 even though he wants to feed from them
0:15:03 so he's just going to go ahead and try
0:15:05 to incapacitate the moment with the
0:15:07 steak immediately before going in to
0:15:09 drink leaping from the Shadows he's
0:15:12 going to put his boot knife into the
0:15:15 forehead of the one with the with the uh
0:15:17 with the
0:15:20 steak oh my god dude coming through the
0:15:23 other side of his this is a dead man
0:15:26 that's a Humanity
0:15:27 check um 1 2
0:15:31 3 10 11 12 successes 11 will roll over
0:15:36 into damage well I won't be spending
0:15:39 potent cuz I don't have it to
0:15:45 spend nine
0:15:47 damage nine lethal damage I our is two
0:15:50 stamina and it turns out he's down with
0:15:52 two
0:15:55 successes you slam the knife down into a
0:15:59 skull your fist actually concaves a good
0:16:01 chunk of it and with a single spasm that
0:16:05 rolls through his body he collapses to
0:16:07 the ground uh his body then enters a
0:16:12 torpid State and becomes this dried chol
0:16:16 body the group of them go huh and then
0:16:21 we start at the top of initiative Johnny
0:16:22 it's tears Johnny lets out a feral Roar
0:16:27 as his Beast struggles for control
0:16:30 amidst a field of blood bags Johnny will
0:16:33 split his action um and will snatch up
0:16:38 the next one with the uh with the nail
0:16:41 bat uh grabbing him by the Scruff of his
0:16:44 shirt and pulling him close to
0:16:48 Feast three successes to snatch him up
0:16:52 you grab him yank him up he will then uh
0:16:56 bury his face in his uh
0:16:59 into his shoulder and just tear out a
0:17:01 section and feed okay you take three Bud
0:17:04 a gun goes off when uh you're being shot
0:17:07 at they have plus two difficulty to hit
0:17:08 you uh because they're in the
0:17:11 dark they do not botch but they fail she
0:17:15 kind of watches the bullet go by next
0:17:18 one attempts to clobber you with a nail
0:17:19 bat
0:17:22 okay okay they will
0:17:24 miss as she's looking at the bullet it
0:17:27 Miss the bat goes sailing by her head
0:17:30 another one panics and uh will attempt
0:17:34 to Grapple
0:17:36 you okay that's not good uh they will
0:17:39 miss uh Johnny uh one of them will uh
0:17:44 actually attempt to stab you with a
0:17:46 knife they are difficulty
0:17:49 seven and they will hit let's do
0:17:53 it uh they will fail to roll any damage
0:17:57 oh my god when
0:17:59 since this is kind of a laughable excuse
0:18:02 for an attack there was a time when this
0:18:04 would have been considered an extremely
0:18:06 dangerous threat to she uh just a long
0:18:09 time ago yeah she gives a quick glance
0:18:12 back to the people she's supposed to be
0:18:13 protecting to make sure nothing has
0:18:15 crept in Neil looks perfectly fine the
0:18:18 other two look very stressed but are
0:18:22 otherwise unharmed yeah no one is
0:18:24 dragging them away no one has put a
0:18:26 bullet in them nope okay does that count
0:18:29 as an action no okay when kind of looks
0:18:32 at the one with the nail bad just like
0:18:35 guys I feel bad about this can you just
0:18:38 stop like sorry [ __ ] we're going to
0:18:41 have we have to break this curse oh God

0:18:44 little and she will like just go to grab
0:18:47 one of them by the collar of the shirt
0:18:49 she's not looking to do any
0:18:51 damage she's just oh you poor things
0:18:55 she's like oh you stupid stupid
0:18:57 boys she's honestly she she's going to
0:19:00 try and talk some scares some sense into
0:19:02 them more than anything else give me a
0:19:04 DEX plus brawl okay I'm going to use my
0:19:08 deck uh thing of Swift but I am not
0:19:11 going to be using my brawl Speck in
0:19:17 claws uh five successes to grab the guy
0:19:20 and hold him up and just look at him
0:19:22 like with you snatch him up I I'm just
0:19:25 holding him like I'm scruffing a like a

0:19:48 families I would rather be with mine
0:19:51 nobody here knows how to fix this what
0:19:55 was done to you was a monstrous
0:19:57 political maneuver to turn you against
0:19:59 us no one here can fix you but if you
0:20:03 want to we can help you get revenge on
0:20:05 the people who did this to you when she
0:20:07 says no one here can fix you with his
0:20:10 eyes like shining like a wolf Johnny
0:20:14 Roars I can oh God and I'm going to take
0:20:18 Celerity actions unless you if you're
0:20:21 done yeah do you
0:20:24 think I've still got my City action yep
0:20:28 uh is going to continue uh he's going to
0:20:31 go back into this guy's neck and
0:20:33 continue to drink three more blood okay
0:20:36 when it's your turn you're on sality if
0:20:39 you and your boys want to survive this I
0:20:41 suggest you get out of here now my name
0:20:43 is Wynn if you want to help get revenge
0:20:46 come find me later and she kind of like
0:20:48 tosses him back over the fence all right
0:20:50 give me a strength plus Athletics you
0:20:52 are not near the fence uh but this is
0:20:54 something you can do Team Rocket F off
0:20:57 again uh does unspent potent count for
0:21:00 this or just for into damage count okay
0:21:03 I want strength
0:21:07 Athletics uh that is one success you
0:21:11 launch him over the fence and he
0:21:13 disappears into the other side go on get
0:21:17 Johnny uh Johnny will now rip out his
0:21:20 throat with his teeth um and just make a
0:21:22 straight up attack so I'm assuming I'm
0:21:24 rolling a brawl uh Dex plus brawl uh the
0:21:28 bite maneuver at minus one
0:21:30 diff uh five successes four will carry
0:21:33 over into
0:21:35 damage only three damage you tear into
0:21:38 his throat for three levels of
0:21:39 aggravated damage he lets out a gurgled
0:21:42 scream
0:21:44 and they resist the rot
0:21:48 Shrek that the two of you nearly put
0:21:51 them into Johnny will uh just drop him
0:21:55 onto the
0:21:56 ground and turn to the rest of them
0:22:00 another
0:22:01 one or you can leave uh they're not fast
0:22:04 enough to uh not all of them um their
0:22:08 actions don't come for a while uh you
0:22:10 guys have more celarity actions you may
0:22:12 take them uh I just had the one okay I
0:22:14 just took two okay uh top of the next
0:22:17 round Johnny um my uh initiative does go
0:22:20 down by one because I did spend two for
0:22:22 cerity I'm spending three for celarity
0:22:24 so my issue will be a 13 as
0:22:26 well uh okay order stays the same uh
0:22:30 Johnny will uh snatch up the next
0:22:32 closest victim to
0:22:34 him uh with two successes and then do
0:22:37 you need an attack roll for me to feed
0:22:39 nope okay and he will take three blood
0:22:41 from that victim okay when when we'll
0:22:45 start oh no no oh they're hitting me oh
0:22:48 okay great great she wouldn't [ __ ]
0:22:51 lie to us and with the
0:22:53 confidence of a bloodbound man he fires
0:22:57 his gun at you
0:23:00 and
0:23:02 botches God there's a in the back of the
0:23:07 man that Johnny is currently holding and
0:23:09 he Yelps in pain as one of them shoots
0:23:13 another one of them baby all they do is

0:23:18 lying what do I gain from this a nail
0:23:21 backat comes at
0:23:23 you and Strikes true okay two successes
0:23:26 will carry over into damage okay no bad
0:23:29 is too
0:23:29 lethal he connects for six levels of
0:23:32 lethal damage go ahead and give me a
0:23:35 soak
0:23:38 roll okay so that's I got I did get a
0:23:42 one uh so that's going to take away one
0:23:44 of my tens five successes he drew blood
0:23:49 he knocks a tooth loose and you
0:23:53 realize these guys are bloodbound they
0:23:55 are not going to see reason oh uh I
0:23:58 grabbed the bat is that the first time
0:24:00 you've taken damage tonight I need a
0:24:02 self-control check all right
0:24:03 self-control it's not good guys but oh
0:24:06 no it's not bad what's the difficulty uh
0:24:10 I'm going to say a chump knocking a
0:24:12 tooth loose is a particularly irritating
0:24:15 and it's going to be diff seven okay
0:24:17 well that's no successes then all right
0:24:19 it's frenzy time all
0:24:21 right so wind just kind of gives this
0:24:24 glare at the guy who connected the bat
0:24:27 to her face with this briefest instance
0:24:30 of I gave you a chance to run in her
0:24:33 face cricks her
0:24:35 neck and I guess we're going ham I hate
0:24:38 to point this out uh you are Gangrel and
0:24:41 you're frenzy yep you have a beast
0:24:43 feature wind stares at this poor bastard
0:24:47 who should have run when he had the
0:24:48 chance Raven feathers begin to weave
0:24:52 themselves through her white braid
0:24:54 because she is a Gangrel and she is
0:24:57 frenzy and
0:24:59 regret is the game she will play after
0:25:01 the frenzy is over and she prepares
0:25:03 herself to Dage she has already spent
0:25:07 the blood for claws she raises a hand
0:25:10 and just brings it
0:25:15 down uh I will also spend the blood for
0:25:18 more
0:25:21 strength uh five successes four will
0:25:24 carry over into damage so you'll be
0:25:26 rolling strength plus five five dice of
0:25:28 damage plus an additional three rightz
0:25:32 for the fen Talent
0:25:38 Jesus uh aou Tre four egg you rent him
0:25:42 for four levels of aggravated damage and
0:25:44 he screams is that including the two
0:25:46 Auto successes that is not including the
0:25:48 three Auto successes so seven seven egg
0:25:51 my bad that's [ __ ] called PS right
0:25:54 there my you lay him low uh is he out or
0:25:58 is he dead or is he he's incapacitated
0:26:00 with aggravated damage he's basically
0:26:02 done forever
0:26:03 okay uh would it be an action to pick
0:26:06 him up and drain him yes that'll have to
0:26:08 wait for celarity okay Johnny none of
0:26:10 the goons going after me they were
0:26:11 before you they they they came and went
0:26:13 okay cool um I will use my first sity
0:26:16 action to continue drinking from the
0:26:17 poor sod that I have uh held up okay uh
0:26:21 you take three when going to pick up the
0:26:24 bastard that I knocked down and I'm
0:26:25 going to drain him uh so while you're in
0:26:27 Friends he is a Target that is no longer
0:26:30 moving it's on to the next one all right
0:26:31 then I'm going to drain the next one
0:26:32 that I find yeah you're going to you're
0:26:34 going to have to keep killing them
0:26:37 okay uh six five dice will carry over so
0:26:42 that would be eight that I'm rolling for
0:26:43 damage plus strength yes okay
0:26:47 gross op as
0:26:52 hell nine with nine levels of aggravated
0:26:56 damage you reduce one one to just a pile
0:26:59 of meat uh that one is not one that you
0:27:01 guys will be able to feed from okay
0:27:03 Johnny Johnny will with his second City
0:27:06 action take another three blood from
0:27:08 this poad so that's nine blood from this
0:27:11 current one I'm holding okay when uh is
0:27:14 this Celerity 3 or two two uh she'll
0:27:17 move on to the next one and commit
0:27:19 Another War
0:27:21 crime okay that'll be eight to hit yeah
0:27:24 that's seven carrying over okay a
0:27:27 disgusting amount of dice that I'm using
0:27:29 not to soak imagine if you were just
0:27:31 adding five successes to this I know
0:27:33 right get that point five
0:27:36 girl
0:27:38 10 another one screams and perishes
0:27:42 under uh the duress of being torn to
0:27:46 pieces at least I'm making it quick most
0:27:49 of the time Johnny has downed two and
0:27:51 snatched another one up when has downed
0:27:54 three at this point so two guys left
0:27:57 yeah
0:27:58 not being including the one who's being
0:28:00 held by John uh Johnny I believe we have
0:28:01 your final action I'll take another
0:28:03 three blood you will gain two blood and
0:28:07 he will suffer an UNS soakable level of
0:28:09 aggravated damage as you begin to draw
0:28:11 on the soul so 11 blood what what the
0:28:14 what pool is that or what generation is
0:28:16 that 12 12 if full on blood 12th to gen
0:28:20 gotcha okay interesting
0:28:22 okay done doing science over there table
0:28:25 sech looking around like uh oh uh do
0:28:28 buddy pump the brakes Johnny no no that
0:28:31 that's that's that's fun
0:28:33 um truthfully I'm not trying to go crazy
0:28:37 because I actually only take one blood
0:28:38 from him I'm actually almost full of
0:28:40 myself oh um I was I was doing that more
0:28:43 because I wanted to I was kind of
0:28:44 curious about how deep these guys went M
0:28:47 uh Johnny it's your turn as you enter a
0:28:50 new round so new Celerity expenditures
0:28:51 if you're doing it uh both hands uh
0:28:54 gripping him Johnny pulls away and then
0:28:57 we'll take a turning step and throw this
0:29:01 guy full out into one of his friends one
0:29:05 of the few remaining so I'm sorry decks
0:29:07 plus Athletics for a throw yep or might
0:29:10 that be Brawl Street Fighting uh I'd
0:29:12 accept either well then let's go Brawl
0:29:14 Street
0:29:16 Fighting
0:29:18 Jesus three successes oh
0:29:22 God two roll over and did damage I took
0:29:25 out five uh dice because of ones oh
0:29:30 God just two points of
0:29:33 damage they both take a point of bashing
0:29:35 damage as one connects into the other
0:29:40 and at this point they are attempting to
0:29:42 flee is anyone stopping them I don't
0:29:45 think I have a choice but to try and
0:29:46 stop them uh
0:29:48 Johnny uh will put a hand out and try
0:29:52 and uh restrain Wynn and let them flee at
0:29:56 this point uh when is going to have the
0:29:58 opportunity to strike at one uh and then
0:30:00 on your Celerity action you'll be able
0:30:02 to attempt to grab her yep uh when uh
0:30:05 one for the road yeah you don't get to
0:30:08 leave after I gave you the chance M you
0:30:12 stayed uh maybe the fight's taken out of
0:30:14 her because she did not roll any
0:30:17 successes you rush and Slash and the
0:30:21 fleeing Kindred uh just as fate should
0:30:25 have it they are not stricken Down
0:30:27 Johnny uh Johnny is not spent for any
0:30:29 City Johnny new round are the two of the
0:30:32 uh it's just last two right on their
0:30:34 feet maybe one that I didn't in fully
0:30:37 incapacitate so maybe three three and
0:30:41 then um one just has no blood uh two of
0:30:43 them are on the ground dead and then
0:30:45 three of them are incapacitated on the
0:30:47 ground yes okay um so those three are
0:30:50 running in in the correct direction away
0:30:52 from the place yep oh God how do you
0:30:56 pull someone out of frenzy I don't know
0:30:57 how to do this
0:30:58 I'm on the other side of this thing
0:31:01 um teach you animalism some point buddy
0:31:03 but uh now it's not that moment Johnny
0:31:06 will scoop up Wynn in a bear hug from
0:31:10 behind and just try to talk her down um
0:31:14 in fact actually he's going to try and
0:31:15 pull her away so that she's not looking
0:31:17 towards any of the goons he wants her
0:31:19 looking towards the house where uh miles
0:31:22 and uh brda and Neil are in ritual it's
0:31:26 over girl all all right calm down calm
0:31:29 down it's over do you want me to make
0:31:30 any rules for any of these things uh
0:31:32 first rule to
0:31:34 Grapple uh seven successes to Grapple
0:31:36 well you scoop her up and why don't you
0:31:39 give me a Charisma leadership as you try
0:31:42 to work with
0:31:43 when two successes with two successes
0:31:48 you know you start taking a tone that is
0:31:51 more familiar to her and start trying to
0:31:54 work her out of this rage she's found
0:31:56 herself in the midst of when why don't
0:31:58 you go ahead and give me a self-control
0:32:00 rule what's difficulty six one success
0:32:04 okay uh you're starting to calm uh why
0:32:06 don't you guys go ahead and role play
0:32:08 for a moment and I'm going to have you
0:32:09 make another self-control test I told
0:32:11 them to run I know and they're running
0:32:13 now we did some damage I need you to
0:32:16 come and be with me though all right
0:32:19 look at them over there we're protecting
0:32:21 them we're not taking Vengeance this is
0:32:24 just about protecting them look at them
0:32:28 miles and BR I'm looking they're
0:32:31 vulnerable and they need us to be with
0:32:33 it
0:32:35 clear-headed I know I know don't worry
0:32:38 about these goons worry about them give
0:32:40 me another
0:32:42 self-control uh one success sh to Cal
0:32:45 and the two of you working
0:32:46 together uh the
0:32:49 situation comes to an
0:32:51 end you have a few captives you've got
0:32:55 some bodies when begins to like unfurl
0:33:00 against Johnny um he can recognize the
0:33:04 signs of her coming back to herself
0:33:09 caging the Beast
0:33:10 again good
0:33:13 job [ __ ] good job ly I got to teach
0:33:16 you animalism
0:33:19 buddy I'll just do things the hard way
0:33:22 like usual he does not put her down um
0:33:25 he kind of just holds like does a little
0:33:28 kind of like scoop kind like like holds
0:33:31 her up like higher and just basically
0:33:33 kind of carries her kind of like just
0:33:36 like you know rubbing her back and
0:33:37 holding her in his arms and walks her
0:33:39 back towards the uh The Haven she'll let
0:33:42 herself dangle put a head on his
0:33:44 shoulder just let let the combat bleed
0:33:48 out of her don't worry about this [ __ ]
0:33:50 here I'll take care of all this I need I
0:33:52 need you to watch the three of them oh
0:33:54 I'm hungry now so I might need some
0:33:57 survivors
0:33:58 he
0:33:59 stops looks back at the uh the group or
0:34:03 I can just talk no no no you're you're
0:34:05 fine um there might be some left in the
0:34:08 bowl I don't know if that'll [ __ ] up the
0:34:10 ritual all right let's let's uh let's
0:34:13 get you fed how hungry are you I could
0:34:17 stand to go a little longer it's not
0:34:19 super dangerous but okay I'm gonna I'm
0:34:22 going to bring some of them over for you
0:34:23 to drink don't drink too deeply they're
0:34:27 a little on the younger side yeah yeah I
0:34:30 know Johnny it was killing me maybe uh
0:34:33 no more
0:34:34 than I was going to go six each I was I
0:34:38 was going to say like don't drink more
0:34:39 than three from from any of them all
0:34:42 right um okay Johnny will bring the one
0:34:46 with the knife still buried in its head
0:34:49 they're incapped but they're they still
0:34:52 have all their blood right that's
0:34:54 correct y as you doing so and feeding
0:34:58 uh when when you look back at the three
0:35:01 you will actually notice for the first
0:35:04 time since any of this
0:35:05 began Neil's eyebrows Furrow and he
0:35:09 looks
0:35:11 distressed when she doesn't want to
0:35:14 touch him but she
0:35:16 does go closer to him just sort of like
0:35:21 their positions are reversed from when
0:35:23 she was Earth melted and he was hovering
0:35:25 over her in the grass
0:35:28 just hoping that he can feel
0:35:31 closeness and not
0:35:37 alone Neil you arrive to a vast
0:35:45 cityscape hanging
0:35:48 overhead is the
0:35:51 eye of a monster whose hungers Without
0:35:54 End and everything
0:35:58 is soaked in its red
0:36:02 light sitting on the
0:36:04 roof looking down over New York is a
0:36:10 woman you
0:36:11 recognize
0:36:14 Nara
0:36:17 so you've been avoiding
0:36:20 me Neil is tempted for just a second to
0:36:24 continue lying to himself
0:36:27 but having been here
0:36:29 before kind of looks at her and
0:36:34 shrugs
0:36:36 yeah I guess I
0:36:38 have is it because you
0:36:43 know because you know that my
0:36:48 affection is uh a means to an
0:36:52 end or do you feel something for when
0:36:57 and don't know how to say
0:37:01 it
0:37:04 it's it's not be because of something I
0:37:08 know it's because of what I don't
0:37:12 know
0:37:13 and as always when I don't know
0:37:17 something I freeze up until I know it is
0:37:21 I can't act without
0:37:24 knowing and he sigh and kind of like
0:37:26 picks at his teeth a little bit
0:37:28 it and I haven't
0:37:31 known these
0:37:34 things maybe for a long
0:37:38 time and so I
0:37:41 just
0:37:43 sit in
0:37:46 inaction
0:37:48 because I don't
0:37:50 know I mean what matter is it which path
0:37:55 you walk forward if they all end in the
0:37:57 same place
0:37:59 do you know what I
0:38:00 think I would love to know what I
0:38:03 think I think it's not that
0:38:07 deep I think it's actually rather
0:38:11 shallow
0:38:13 Neil cannot stand the thought of losing
0:38:17 his
0:38:18 stuff and at the end of the
0:38:21 night I think you don't have time to
0:38:24 concern yourself with relationships
0:38:26 connectivity
0:38:28 Etc because you need to keep watch of
0:38:33 your
0:38:35 things
0:38:38 maybe that's not really the question
0:38:40 though is
0:38:42 it or the answer the statement whatever
0:38:45 you want to say the question
0:38:48 is am I
0:38:51 worried that if I reach out to bring you
0:38:53 into my Orbit that you will just become
0:38:55 another one of my things
0:38:58 and then I'll have to worry about you
0:38:59 too or is it that I don't reach out
0:39:03 because I don't see you as one of my
0:39:06 things and I that's the question I don't
0:39:09 know the answer
0:39:10 to I think you
0:39:12 do I think you know that I'm not yours
0:39:16 and as the world comes to an
0:39:19 end you know that it is
0:39:22 inevitable that everything that is
0:39:25 yours will be lost
0:39:29 you've been so prepared for the end of
0:39:31 the
0:39:32 world but haven't really put
0:39:36 thought into what that means for your
0:39:39 stuff your
0:39:41 possessions your
0:39:44 obsessions it'll be easier if I'm just
0:39:48 dead and I won't have to worry about him
0:39:50 anymore what
0:39:52 I that is the easier solution isn't it
0:39:55 and the edge of the roof top draws
0:39:58 closer to
0:40:00 you if you die you don't have to
0:40:04 experience
0:40:06 existence without your
0:40:09 things Neil kind of looks over the
0:40:12 edge feeling that pole to
0:40:16 Oblivion Hees a tired
0:40:19 sigh you're already losing win she's
0:40:23 going to be a slave to Miles within the
0:40:25 night
0:40:28 brda to pend
0:40:31 Dragon you are going to lose your
0:40:35 things but if something should happen to
0:40:38 you if you die right
0:40:42 now they won't be able to think about
0:40:44 anything
0:40:46 else you will exist in their mind
0:40:51 forever and they will never be free of
0:40:55 you you may not be able to to enjoy the
0:40:59 connection but they'd see me but they
0:41:02 would see
0:41:05 you and what's more important trying to
0:41:10 survive the death of the
0:41:13 world or to finally be
0:41:17 seen and the edge of the roof draws
0:41:20 [Music]
0:41:21 closer
0:41:23 maybe you know it's not like I haven't
0:41:27 thought about this
0:41:28 part I have at least enough awareness of
0:41:31 myself for that
0:41:34 [Applause]
0:41:35 I maybe the reason that you were my
0:41:39 beloved is because you were the second
0:41:41 person to see me
0:41:44 ever and I did like it I
0:41:49 do maybe the reason I can't really
0:41:52 escape from my sire is because he was
0:41:56 the first
0:41:58 I want everybody to see me I do I'm so
0:42:00 afraid of it but and he kind of vaguely
0:42:03 gestures up at the sky where the red
0:42:06 star is gazing down like staring
0:42:10 directly at
0:42:12 them I don't know if everyone feels like
0:42:14 they want to be
0:42:16 alone but don't want to be
0:42:19 lonely and be left alone but he looks
0:42:22 down at the edge that's gotten closer I
0:42:25 know I don't you feel a hand take
0:42:29 yours and fingers entwining with
0:42:33 yours you realize that just to your left
0:42:37 your sire has
0:42:39 arrived right on
0:42:42 schedule you will be
0:42:44 remembered as having been right all
0:42:48 along and they will feel so stupid for
0:42:52 all of those times that they didn't
0:42:54 listen to your warnings and he kind of
0:42:57 takes a step towards the edge pulling
0:42:59 you
0:43:00 along despite having been in these
0:43:03 scenarios a few times
0:43:06 before Neil for just a second lets
0:43:11 himself buy into the illusion of this
0:43:15 place before in the past last time the
0:43:18 things that chased him the things that
0:43:19 bothered him were reys getting caught
0:43:24 his Secrets being found out
0:43:27 this one is a little bit more real than
0:43:31 it ever
0:43:32 was and then he looks at his sire and
0:43:35 goes I mean I could just step right off
0:43:39 the edge with you
0:43:42 sire you're the one who taught me the
0:43:44 first steps on how not to fall in the
0:43:47 first
0:43:49 place and I then why wouldn't you trust
0:43:52 me now and he takes another step towards
0:43:56 the edge of the roof and this time
0:44:00 Nara comes to your side and she takes
0:44:03 your other hand and does the
0:44:07 same make the sacrifice Neil you know
0:44:11 it's the only way miles will ever learn
0:44:14 as soon as she says that Neil stops
0:44:18 moving forward like he has become
0:44:21 anchored to that spot in
0:44:23 reality it's not like he just digs his
0:44:25 heels in it's like nature
0:44:27 itself stops him and Roots him to the
0:44:30 place no he
0:44:33 wouldn't no he wouldn't that's a step
0:44:37 too
0:44:40 far you
0:44:42 know why am I indulging this I
0:44:45 know as much as anyone that change
0:44:50 growth this kind of thing is incremental
0:44:52 it's slow it can take
0:44:55 forever that's why I'm here here in the
0:44:57 first place Shepherd on a
0:45:00 path and he goes to try and let go of
0:45:02 both of their hands it pains you to do
0:45:05 it to his core like even to himself he's
0:45:09 putting on a front he's been in these
0:45:11 positions before and knows it costs
0:45:14 something but that doesn't mean it
0:45:16 doesn't hurt to pay the cost you force
0:45:19 your hands
0:45:20 open and they just look away as though
0:45:23 they forget you were there at all
0:45:27 and then another voice
0:45:29 speaks this one you don't totally
0:45:34 recognize I am going
0:45:38 to reveal to you a
0:45:42 burden and you are going to carry
0:45:45 it and when you look you see a figure
0:45:50 that is wearing beautiful red and gold
0:45:54 silk
0:45:55 robes and their
0:45:57 skin is like milk pale perfectly smooth
0:46:03 there are no hairs on their body
0:46:05 whatsoever their ears are simple holes
0:46:09 in the sides of their head their
0:46:11 nostrils very much the same their eyes
0:46:15 are
0:46:17 large and
0:46:20 piercing and when it
0:46:22 speaks there are rows of fangs in its
0:46:25 mouth
0:46:27 you know in your heart that this is the
0:46:31 Vykos Neil's brow
0:46:34 Furrow at this Intruder in this
0:46:39 space
0:46:41 you shall be a stepping stone for
0:46:45 others and while useful important
0:46:50 even you will
0:46:53 die
0:46:54 this is the end of your
0:46:58 Journey waves its hands and you see just
0:47:02 New York endless expansive it takes up
0:47:06 the Horizon and the heavens above and
0:47:08 everywhere is just the skyline of New
0:47:12 York replicated over and over in all
0:47:19 directions
0:47:22 regrettably what sliver of a chance you
0:47:25 provide will cost do
0:47:28 everything do you
0:47:31 accept Neil looks at the
0:47:34 Vykos and for a second looks back over
0:47:38 his shoulder to that edge that might be
0:47:43 a few inches closer than it was when he
0:47:45 last looked like he's legitimately
0:47:48 considering everything that Nora and his
0:47:49 sire said to him before this
0:47:53 moment and he doesn't cry but his voice
0:47:56 voice comes out a little
0:48:02 strangled I guess I
0:48:05 do then come and let us see to the
0:48:11 Neftali and they offer their
0:48:14 hand Neil sigh and that like
0:48:18 Supernatural weight that had rooted him
0:48:20 in spot to not get dragged off the edge
0:48:24 of the building now seems to be more
0:48:26 like a burden keeping him from stepping
0:48:28 forward rooted in
0:48:30 [Music]
0:48:31 indecision which is where he always
0:48:33 cloaks himself
0:48:36 protectively and then with what looks
0:48:38 like an inordinate amount of mental
0:48:42 effort takes a step
0:48:45 forward to take the vos's hand path of

0:49:52 time kindred
0:49:59 do you want to take a moment think about
0:50:00 what it's going to be cuz wind art just
0:50:03 changed o that's true if I can make a
0:50:06 suggestion based on thematics there's
0:50:08 been a lot of crow and Raven [ __ ] going
0:50:10 on in your story this
0:50:12 season so tom
0:50:14 [Laughter]
0:50:16 cat so a bear tummy I don't know whisker
0:50:21 uh the thing that comes to mind is her
0:50:23 braid turns into
0:50:24 feathers just to have a few feathers
0:50:26 poking out of the white hair like black
0:50:28 no just her all her her braid is braided
0:50:31 feathers now like her hair is like Downy
0:50:34 long white feathers like emu feathers
0:50:39 MH um not literally emu feathers cuz
0:50:42 that just does not sound edgy enough you
0:50:45 know what I could U are awful Birds you
0:50:47 know what I could you know what I just
0:50:49 because like I it it almost if it almost
0:50:52 sounds weird to me that like the hair
0:50:54 just magically becomes feathers in the
0:50:55 back his hair is like kind of like this
0:50:56 dead kind of stuff but it kind of like
0:50:58 growing out of your scalp it like kind
0:51:01 of like parts of it calcify into like
0:51:04 the quill at the base of a Feather so
0:51:07 like there's like like feathers kind of
0:51:09 like growing into the hair and like you
0:51:11 know qu and like I almost like the the
0:51:15 idea of it being like the kind of like
0:51:16 that like hard part of the middle of a
0:51:19 Feather almost like Echoes like quills
0:51:21 from like a porcupine so like it's this
0:51:23 like indistinct kind of Beast feature
0:51:25 almost yeah so she does have the thing
0:51:28 too where she has the she gets Beast
0:51:31 features that are
0:51:32 helpful oh what about okay building up
0:51:35 the Quil that means that you have a
0:51:37 beast feature that is helpful which you
0:51:39 have the snake FS okay you have a mix BL
0:51:43 okay that's good what were you saying
0:51:45 Rebecca oh um no I I was going to go
0:51:48 with that and try to think of of a use
0:51:49 for like like a you know like a Bianca B
0:51:54 gotcha but like a bian
0:51:57 but um I think it sounds like you kind
0:52:01 of thematically right the imagery of
0:52:04 what you're you're thinking through do
0:52:07 you want something that still moves like
0:52:09 hair or do you want something that is
0:52:13 like what is the feeling of what you
0:52:22 want well I kind of I do like the raven
0:52:27 bird crow
0:52:29 imagery um what if there were black
0:52:32 feathers sprouting amongst your white
0:52:34 hair that could
0:52:38 work yeah not like true Crow feathers
0:52:41 but just some in there yeah that that
0:52:46 they don't like stick up straight
0:52:48 everywhere because crows tend to be
0:52:50 pretty glossy like they're glossy long
0:52:53 like thick black feathers that now
0:52:56 streak your white hair like like low
0:52:59 lights yeah does that sound like what
0:53:01 you're going for yeah we can do that
