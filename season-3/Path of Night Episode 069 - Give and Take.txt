0:00:33 [Music]
0:00:42 last time on path of night
0:00:45 the quotery continued updating each
0:00:47 other despite the tension
0:00:49 they discussed plans to combat the
0:00:51 Savannah Invasion and to discover the
0:00:53 mole in the city
0:00:56 Neil received a terrible vision of
0:00:58 disaster in New York City
0:01:01 once they headed home when and Miles
0:01:03 tried to come to terms with each other
0:01:09 [Music]
0:01:14 foreign
0:01:17 [Music]
0:01:29 and Johnny
0:01:31 some nights have passed
0:01:33 and yet again
0:01:35 you have received bad news
0:01:39 this time it was a gas station it was
0:01:42 hit Shabbat rolled through
0:01:45 thoroughly violated the masquerade
0:01:48 and butchered four people
0:01:50 and the way that these people were
0:01:52 butchered it is grisly bloody body parts
0:01:56 slung around the interior of the gas
0:01:58 station
0:01:59 Glass Broken
0:02:01 the place is ransangs money specifically
0:02:05 torn from the register and left behind
0:02:09 as though they wanted to make it
0:02:11 immensely clear that they are not driven
0:02:14 by mortal ambition
0:02:16 that they came strictly for the purposes
0:02:20 of mutilating Mortals
0:02:22 taking their lives
0:02:24 and harming your masquerade
0:02:27 the place that are present war on
0:02:30 Upton's role are on miles's payroll
0:02:35 in addition to this
0:02:37 though four people were killed
0:02:39 three were left as Witnesses
0:02:42 and the things they're describing are
0:02:45 awful
0:02:46 the police officers are taking notes but
0:02:48 occasionally they look over their
0:02:50 shoulders towards YouTube baffled
0:02:53 in this case
0:02:54 the talk about a man
0:02:56 clad in Black
0:02:58 the jingle of Spurs
0:03:01 and four others that were with him
0:03:04 all four of them perfectly identical
0:03:08 dressed in musty raggedy clothes
0:03:12 and impossibly violent
0:03:15 these people are shaken
0:03:18 terrified
0:03:20 police officers approached the Tribune
0:03:22 win as the person that they are directed
0:03:26 to turn this information over to they
0:03:28 provide you with the reports
0:03:30 uh they give you a quick show of the
0:03:33 robbery and shooting that took place the
0:03:35 essentially the report that they're
0:03:37 going to be giving and they start
0:03:40 collecting the witnesses so that they
0:03:43 can be silenced
0:03:45 police officer looks to the two of you I
0:03:48 do want to handle these three question
0:03:50 so there was a total of seven yes okay I
0:03:53 just want to make sure that we're not
0:03:55 looking at three people who have been
0:03:57 embraced right there's no one embraced
0:04:00 okay
0:04:01 when kind of
0:04:03 considers for a moment
0:04:06 give me a minute she says to the cops
0:04:08 and she makes a quick phone call to
0:04:10 miles
0:04:12 miles here win here
0:04:14 so there's three Witnesses here
0:04:17 they could probably they have graphic
0:04:20 memories and details
0:04:23 I don't want the sabbat's influence to
0:04:25 spread further
0:04:27 and have to kill these [ __ ]
0:04:29 are you or someone in the clan willing
0:04:31 to
0:04:33 deprogram them
0:04:35 as to what they saw
0:04:38 yes get them on my schedule we will
0:04:42 get them payment for what they've seen
0:04:44 basically and we need to take statements
0:04:46 we'll come down and we'll
0:04:49 give them some money and
0:04:51 maybe get rid of some of that memory for
0:04:54 them I have all the statements
0:04:56 I think it would just be better if they
0:04:58 had been at Dunkin Donuts instead of
0:05:00 this place we can do something like that
0:05:02 it just gets them more pliable to come
0:05:04 to a place I just don't know if I have
0:05:06 time right now okay um
0:05:09 my initial thought was say hey we have
0:05:12 someone who specializes in this kind of
0:05:14 trauma Dr Davenport I'll make an
0:05:16 appointment for you to see him as soon
0:05:18 as possible Perfect all right I've
0:05:20 always wanted to be a doctor
0:05:22 I don't know that's a that's a lot of
0:05:24 dealing with other people I I just mean
0:05:26 that PhD ah fair enough all right thanks
0:05:29 man
0:05:31 um and she hangs up and she goes back to
0:05:32 the cops Johnny puts a hand on her
0:05:34 shoulder after she hangs up the phone
0:05:36 you know
0:05:39 I know you're a little bit new to this
0:05:40 Sheriff business
0:05:42 um and I'm not telling you how to run
0:05:44 things but miles doesn't need to know
0:05:47 about every one of these incidents miles
0:05:49 knew about this one because I thought he
0:05:51 could do something to help oh I know
0:05:53 that's the only reason I'm just pointing
0:05:54 out that uh we also can tag other people
0:05:57 Reiss and the tramir can send somebody
0:05:59 to do this I'm sure they could and
0:06:01 keeping Davenport out of anybody's ear
0:06:04 is going to be a good idea all right
0:06:06 then he will be some doctor something
0:06:07 else all right so when Taps Johnny on
0:06:11 the shoulder like okay tap put me in
0:06:13 boss so I'm ready to play
0:06:15 and she goes over to the cops and the
0:06:17 victims
0:06:18 uh thank you all for your witness
0:06:21 statements I know you've all been
0:06:23 through an awful lot
0:06:24 we have contact with a very specific
0:06:27 trauma Doctor Who is going to be able to
0:06:29 help you all
0:06:30 figure out how to move forward from this
0:06:33 um and she kind of hand takes out a like
0:06:36 a sticky Notepad
0:06:38 she probably got it from Johnny and jots
0:06:40 down okay I'm gonna have send you to Dr
0:06:43 broken handon and he used to be a
0:06:46 proctologist now he's a psychiatrist
0:06:49 and she hands whimper and not accepting
0:06:52 and I want you to know we're gonna we're
0:06:54 gonna make this as right for you as we
0:06:55 can thank you for being willing to share
0:06:57 your stories
0:06:59 the police officers run them up
0:07:01 and they're actually going to take them
0:07:02 away um she looks to the police officers
0:07:04 put a guard outside their houses
0:07:06 for the next few nights until they can
0:07:08 see the good doctor understood and then
0:07:10 when Pockets her notepad and heads in to
0:07:14 get a look at the scene
0:07:16 we don't have to get like super Grizzly
0:07:18 if it's not necessary but what kind of
0:07:21 message are they sending with this just
0:07:23 want and violence or was there some sort
0:07:26 of method to this madness
0:07:28 so for example
0:07:30 or one of the victims was held down over
0:07:33 the counter
0:07:34 and
0:07:35 treated as though they were being bone
0:07:39 crafted apart
0:07:40 but they didn't use this institute they
0:07:44 simply pulled chunks from them and
0:07:47 tossed them over their shoulder so in
0:07:49 various aisles there are pieces of a
0:07:52 person and then the counter itself
0:07:54 Remains the majority of a torso
0:07:57 some of these bodies they're so mixed up
0:08:00 and chopped up and mutilated that it
0:08:05 took a little while for them to figure
0:08:07 out exactly how many people had died was
0:08:10 the County coroner on site or anything
0:08:12 oh yeah there was like a whole crew that
0:08:14 came through and then as things winded
0:08:17 down there's there's the areas taped off
0:08:19 but as things winded down it was kind of
0:08:21 left to just a handful of police
0:08:23 officers they kept the witness probably
0:08:26 Witnesses probably way longer than they
0:08:29 ever would but that was largely to check
0:08:30 in with you and see what you wanted done
0:08:32 with them after a few moments of when
0:08:35 looking things over you hear uh Johnny
0:08:37 stepping through the the door his boots
0:08:40 crunching on some of the glass from the
0:08:43 broken windows and you hear him take out
0:08:45 his Zippo when I hear a quick clink
0:08:48 clink as he lights up a cigarette when
0:08:50 continues kind of
0:08:52 just kind of surveying the Carnage
0:08:54 appreciation is the wrong word like by a
0:08:58 long shot
0:08:59 but academically looking into like just
0:09:03 the mindset of the people who would do
0:09:06 this to another person like how how far
0:09:09 do you have to slip to be capable of
0:09:12 something like this
0:09:13 understanding but not comprehending
0:09:17 sort of situation
0:09:19 it's inhuman it is what they did and she
0:09:23 just kind of after a moment she kind of
0:09:25 crosses her arms and thinks for a minute
0:09:27 aside from the brutality are there any
0:09:31 messages left behind perhaps symbols
0:09:35 painted on the walls or things that that
0:09:37 scream Sabbat on the counter itself
0:09:41 carved into it with like a claw you can
0:09:44 see a Sabbat ankh kind of scratched into
0:09:47 it beyond that there really isn't
0:09:50 anything left there's no there was
0:09:52 clearly like it's not like they
0:09:54 performed a new writes I hear there's no
0:09:56 like sermons of Cain scrawled in Blood
0:09:58 on the wall or anything like that it's
0:10:00 it is it was basically a very strategic
0:10:04 yes they're breaking our masquerade
0:10:07 they're not actually looking to blow up
0:10:08 their own exactly they're they're
0:10:10 attempting to
0:10:12 strain local camera Resources by making
0:10:16 targeted massive masquerade violations
0:10:19 Johnny are you in contact with any of
0:10:23 Miles resources
0:10:25 yep
0:10:26 here's what how I think I want to handle
0:10:28 this all right give me the lowdown
0:10:31 my goal is to diminish the sabbat's
0:10:33 influence on this city
0:10:35 at every possible level
0:10:37 I would like this building demolished I
0:10:40 would like a sign put up outside that
0:10:42 said oops there was a spider
0:10:44 and I would like this to be treated as
0:10:46 just
0:10:47 a demolition
0:10:48 oops there was a spider yep
0:10:53 I want to trivialize this I wanted the
0:10:57 Sabbat to know people are laughing at
0:10:59 them
0:11:00 can I give you a Counterpoint to that
0:11:02 you absolutely can the Sabbat don't
0:11:04 really care what people think about them
0:11:06 they clearly care what we think about
0:11:07 them Johnny I don't think they do
0:11:10 I think this is really a targeted tactic
0:11:13 to stretch our resources then we can
0:11:15 have this building demolished absolutely
0:11:17 but that is going to be costly
0:11:20 it's going to cause
0:11:23 some amount of disquiet in the
0:11:25 neighborhood
0:11:27 especially considering the fact that I
0:11:29 uh I think I've already seen a little
0:11:31 stack of uh candles outside uh of this
0:11:34 place for uh some of the victims so
0:11:37 having a building demolished and
0:11:40 assigned put up saying oops there was a
0:11:41 spider is going to make people
0:11:44 upset were there actually candles
0:11:46 outside I don't see why not that's fine
0:11:48 okay I will say people certainly know
0:11:54 you know like the the stack of like
0:11:57 Jesus candles that always kind of pop
0:11:58 out near an accident like a local Bodega
0:12:00 you know what I mean the real problem
0:12:02 here
0:12:03 well if there's if there's people who
0:12:05 know the people who died We're not gonna
0:12:07 make a light of it yeah but we I think
0:12:09 the least amount of resources this could
0:12:11 cost us is a wrecking ball
0:12:15 regardless
0:12:17 the Sabbat they're attacking the minds
0:12:20 of the people who live in the domain The
0:12:23 Mortals
0:12:24 and that's damage that is then falling
0:12:28 onto the head of the prince what is your
0:12:32 suggestion otherwise we need to start
0:12:34 engaging the Sabbat directly that's not
0:12:37 helpful in this moment right now I know
0:12:40 okay so do you have a suggestion for
0:12:43 what to do about this Blood and Guts
0:12:44 covered building right now other than
0:12:46 what I've suggested Johnny's expression
0:12:49 kind of cracks into one of like just
0:12:51 kind of sympathy and like his shoulders
0:12:54 just kind of sink because I don't
0:12:57 disagree with you but that's not the
0:12:59 problem we're dealing with here on site
0:13:01 you are putting the cart before the
0:13:03 horse
0:13:04 no I'm just pointing out the reality
0:13:07 that there's the reason this tactic
0:13:09 works is there's not a whole lot we can
0:13:11 do about it
0:13:12 other than putting a Band-Aid on it by
0:13:14 wiping these people's minds and it sucks
0:13:16 it does I'm not gonna get bent out of
0:13:19 shape about this because if I stop and I
0:13:22 grieve every single person that's about
0:13:24 kills I'm not gonna do anything else all
0:13:26 I'm saying is
0:13:28 when you're you're trying a little bit
0:13:29 hard too hard at this job
0:13:32 the shitty thing about being a sheriff
0:13:34 is that a lot of times it's just
0:13:37 accepting that this is gonna happen you
0:13:39 want to be this job and the son of shawl
0:13:41 no then stop
0:13:44 I am willing to hear if you have actual
0:13:46 productive suggestions
0:13:49 I trust your knowledge of the Sabbat
0:13:51 tactics I will listen to you when we are
0:13:53 engaging them directly but in the
0:13:55 cleanup afterward we have to be able to
0:13:58 move on because there is a whole
0:13:59 Onslaught coming that we have to be
0:14:01 ready for and I will grieve about them
0:14:03 after that's done
0:14:07 right
0:14:09 um
0:14:10 which is why I'm just saying don't put
0:14:13 too much energy into any one of these
0:14:15 attacks
0:14:16 that's why I'm knocking the building
0:14:17 down that's more energy than it's
0:14:19 necessary when what would you suggest
0:14:21 otherwise Johnny reopen it
0:14:24 yeah leave it for Mortals to stumble
0:14:26 upon and cause and lengthen the sabbat's
0:14:28 influence no I'm not doing that either
0:14:29 the owner of the building is going to
0:14:31 clean it up we're gonna pretend that
0:14:33 this was just an unfortunate accident
0:14:35 and life is going to continue as normal
0:14:37 no we're going to pay off the owner
0:14:40 because that's the one thing we have in
0:14:41 abundance is apparently money
0:14:43 and we're gonna wipe it clean
0:14:45 we rebuild afterwards
0:14:47 if you think that's the best course of
0:14:49 action I'll stick by you I'm just
0:14:51 telling you
0:14:53 I am not I'm giving you an opposing
0:14:55 opinion that's all I agree Sheriff I
0:14:58 appreciate the opposing opinion
0:15:00 in this case I think we just need to
0:15:02 destroy it and move on
0:15:04 we're going to be destroying a lot of
0:15:05 buildings in New Haven then when
0:15:08 what is your suggestion practically
0:15:11 that's not going to further the Sabbat
0:15:13 influence that's not going to show more
0:15:14 people the monsters that are in the dark
0:15:17 ignoring this
0:15:19 I think is the better way to to diminish
0:15:22 their influence
0:15:24 taking this building down
0:15:27 and leaving a gap tooth in this
0:15:30 neighborhood
0:15:31 is going to remind people consistently
0:15:34 that this happened okay so instead of
0:15:36 demolishing we get a cleaning crew under
0:15:38 our umbrella in here I mean that's that
0:15:41 was going to be the owner is going to do
0:15:43 that regardless I don't
0:15:45 I don't really want the owner to know or
0:15:47 remember what goes on here
0:15:49 [Music]
0:15:51 pay to have a cleaning crew come in
0:15:54 um
0:15:55 you tell me which is more cost effective
0:15:57 and labor intensive paying to have a
0:16:00 cleaning crew come in and just take care
0:16:02 of this would be the more cost effective
0:16:04 than having them buying the building off
0:16:06 demolishing it and rebuilding finding a
0:16:09 new owner and tenants then let's get a
0:16:11 night cleaning crew to come in tonight
0:16:13 and clean it up so the owner can get
0:16:15 back to [ __ ] tomorrow agreed agreed all
0:16:19 right
0:16:20 then I'll get on the phone with miles
0:16:22 do me a favor give the tremeer something
0:16:25 to do and don't like it when they're
0:16:28 left to their own devices what Premiere
0:16:30 call Rhys no tell it tell Reiss to put
0:16:33 somebody on on the job to make sure that
0:16:35 the city is safe I'm not gonna do that
0:16:37 why not why why would I Johnny give me a
0:16:41 reason because what is he doing if he's
0:16:43 not protecting the city not being here
0:16:45 [ __ ] around and turning people
0:16:47 against us it's not in his own interest
0:16:50 to turn people against us
0:16:52 it is his own interest to protect the
0:16:55 Masquerade it is very much in his own
0:16:57 interest to erode my support for Miles
0:16:59 well then he can do that if he's not if
0:17:02 we don't give him a task then that's all
0:17:04 he's going to be doing I'm not involving
0:17:06 the tremair in this
0:17:08 what you do as son of shawl is your job
0:17:11 but there is nothing that I will choose
0:17:14 to bring the Premier Inn on
0:17:17 the only Premiere that I was close to
0:17:19 trusting is staked in miles's estate
0:17:22 we have to use and trust that Clan if we
0:17:26 don't they are going to be our enemies
0:17:29 I'm sorry you feel that way moving
0:17:31 forward I'm gonna go call Miles about
0:17:33 that cleaning crew
0:17:35 you do what you need to do
0:17:38 when what
0:17:41 we only have so much
0:17:44 time resource and ability and yet you're
0:17:46 standing here arguing with me about it
0:17:49 I'm not arguing with you about it I'm
0:17:51 trying to make you see that we have to
0:17:54 use all the resources we have which is
0:17:56 sometimes tapping people we don't like
0:17:58 you can tap whoever you want
0:18:01 it is not within the office of the
0:18:03 sheriff to need whatever the premier
0:18:05 have at this point if you as the Senate
0:18:07 shawl demand that I find a Premiere I'm
0:18:10 gonna go unstake the fella in our house
0:18:15 all right one
0:18:17 Johnny looks at his watch
0:18:19 I'll let you handle I'll let you handle
0:18:21 this the best way you think I got
0:18:22 somewhere I gotta be
0:18:24 then go do it he drops the cigarette and
0:18:27 puts it out with his Boot and uh walks
0:18:29 out of the uh convenience store win goes
0:18:33 and gives miles a call about the
0:18:35 nighttime cleaning service
0:18:41 January headed Johnny heads out to uh
0:18:44 the truck he uh took to get here Hopsin
0:18:47 and starts driving to a small little uh
0:18:52 section of storage units on the
0:18:54 outskirts of town he um gets there in
0:18:57 probably about like five minutes before
0:18:59 he's uh scheduled to be there
0:19:03 Parks the truck gets out and opens up
0:19:06 the uh storage unit and takes a look
0:19:08 inside revealing a small little cachet
0:19:11 that the camarilla has kind of placed
0:19:13 all around the city filled with supplies
0:19:15 looks like there's a selection of
0:19:18 weapons armor
0:19:20 briefcases that have small little drops
0:19:24 of money in them first aid supplies
0:19:27 all kinds of things that someone might
0:19:29 need in any kind of emergency situation
0:19:31 and he kind of goes through and makes
0:19:32 sure to remove anything that is strictly
0:19:35 for the the aid of
0:19:37 Kindred gets any kind of like little uh
0:19:41 you know booklets of numbers and things
0:19:43 like that privy to The Domain and kind
0:19:45 of sashes them into like a little uh a
0:19:47 little bag that he brings with them and
0:19:49 takes all of that sensitive material out
0:19:50 leaving just kind of the the emergency
0:19:53 supplies for someone to either hold out
0:19:56 or make war and and puts the sensitive
0:19:59 stuff at back in the truck and waits for
0:20:01 someone else to arrive at the uh Meetup
0:20:05 you wait for about 10 minutes
0:20:09 and eventually
0:20:12 the Jeep Blazer pulls up and
0:20:15 four people get out of the car all of
0:20:18 them mobile and healed
0:20:21 at the head of the group is Jesse Johnny
0:20:24 just kind of breaks over to her
0:20:26 immediately just Scoops her up into a
0:20:28 bear hug and just holds her tight to him
0:20:31 she returns the hug and it's as though
0:20:34 the other three really recognize the
0:20:37 importance of the moment because they
0:20:39 don't make any effort to talk not even
0:20:42 to each other or interrupt the moment
0:20:43 and they just kind of let Jessica have
0:20:47 her moment with her dad
0:20:49 as he's just kind of holding her tight
0:20:51 to him he just reflexively is has spent
0:20:56 some of his own Vitae to be able to just
0:20:59 sob
0:21:00 and he kind of just like
0:21:03 has this sucking kind of like breath
0:21:05 that it's been a while since he's
0:21:08 forgotten
0:21:09 that he doesn't need to breathe
0:21:11 and when he finally puts her down he's
0:21:13 he's wiping copious amounts of blood out
0:21:16 of his face and imagine even probably
0:21:18 some coming out of his nose and things
0:21:20 like that and he kind of like Chuckles
0:21:22 to like play off the fact that he's just
0:21:25 like a mess looking at a daughter
0:21:28 oh look at that I'd like to say it's
0:21:31 allergies
0:21:33 how you doing kid she gives a tearful
0:21:37 laugh in response to uh your manliness
0:21:41 and sheer force of Brawn is your sheer
0:21:46 force of Broad
0:21:47 and kinda goes back to hugging him for
0:21:51 just like an extra moment before she
0:21:53 really lets go he he pulls her in tight
0:21:56 and kind of takes a second while she's
0:21:58 just hugging him to look up at the other
0:22:00 three ah
0:22:02 I wasn't sure if the rest of you were
0:22:04 gonna make it
0:22:05 well
0:22:06 we have a friend who is able to uh help
0:22:11 us recover quickly as Suarez says kind
0:22:14 of a little cagey with his response but
0:22:16 for understandable reasons I would like
0:22:19 to thank you for helping us back there
0:22:20 the whatever is going on
0:22:24 it was it was felt globally
0:22:27 contacts that we have around the world
0:22:29 are talking about it even still
0:22:31 something has changed in a profound and
0:22:35 terrible way and whatever it is
0:22:38 you know the I think it's I think it's
0:22:41 the Awakening of one of the eldest
0:22:43 amongst my kind we call them
0:22:45 anti-deluvians but I should warn you
0:22:48 that in some circles they'd kill me for
0:22:51 saying that Jessica seems to kind of
0:22:53 commit that to memory Ramirez heads over
0:22:56 he's like where's mine and he gives you
0:22:57 like a hug
0:22:59 yeah Johnny kind of smiles at him and
0:23:01 like Ruffles his hair a bit my favorite
0:23:03 cabbie
0:23:05 glad to see you're still all right
0:23:06 Ramirez my favorite customers
0:23:10 just so you all know
0:23:12 that house the one that you were
0:23:14 planning on hitting
0:23:16 it houses a piece of the Flesh of this
0:23:19 eldest
0:23:20 there are pieces of that flesh all
0:23:23 around the Northeast
0:23:25 and they're starting to wake up and do
0:23:26 things that we don't understand dad I
0:23:29 saw something Johnny looks at her Square
0:23:33 in the eyes I'm not going to over
0:23:35 explain but
0:23:37 what I do has me tapped into the mind of
0:23:42 humanity the collective
0:23:45 and I think the collective showed me
0:23:47 something
0:23:48 Johnny's expression kind of like softens
0:23:51 and then maybe a little bit of sympathy
0:23:54 there is something awful that is about
0:23:57 to happen in New Haven awful
0:24:00 I saw the streets running red with blood
0:24:04 what's about to happen here
0:24:07 's about to be a war amongst my kind
0:24:11 I served the domain here
0:24:14 New Haven is under the control of a
0:24:16 group of Kindred known as the camarilla
0:24:19 they are not kind people
0:24:23 but they keep the peace
0:24:25 for the most part they ensure that life
0:24:29 amongst Mortals continues without
0:24:31 problem and that no vampire
0:24:35 oversteps its bounds in feeding off
0:24:39 Mortals
0:24:40 we are being invaded by another group
0:24:42 called the Sabbat they seem to Revel
0:24:47 in being monsters
0:24:49 they're the ones that actually made me a
0:24:51 vampire
0:24:52 Sheila speaks up Johnny these the people
0:24:54 responsible for Wolf man's daughter
0:24:58 some have been talking you have
0:25:00 yeah
0:25:02 that's what I do
0:25:03 they're the ones that kidnapped her
0:25:06 I was the one that put her down
0:25:08 all of them
0:25:10 make like an oof look
0:25:14 but kind of Nod I I brought her back to
0:25:18 the woods
0:25:19 and let him let them know that it was me
0:25:23 Sheila speaks up again
0:25:25 well at least that one
0:25:27 he's got a bone to pick with these
0:25:29 people you were going to war with and I
0:25:31 don't think he's gonna need a pickup
0:25:33 truck to get there
0:25:34 would he be willing to speak with me I I
0:25:37 don't know about that Johnny but I know
0:25:40 he's willing to hurt vampires
0:25:42 Sheila if you can talk to him
0:25:44 and let him know that I would be
0:25:46 interested in having a conversation
0:25:48 I will meet him and have that
0:25:50 conversation
0:25:51 I'll do my best tell him that I am
0:25:54 willing to direct him to a place where
0:25:56 he can hurt the most vampires
0:25:59 specifically the ones that kidnapped his
0:26:02 daughter
0:26:03 Suarez speaks up
0:26:05 I understand
0:26:07 your folk have a war
0:26:10 with their phone
0:26:12 but I'm in no rush to
0:26:15 presume one group's innocence over
0:26:17 another
0:26:19 and
0:26:21 to be frank with you
0:26:23 I haven't forgotten about hell house
0:26:25 either
0:26:27 and
0:26:28 I'm getting a little concerned listening
0:26:30 to this because it's making me start to
0:26:33 think that people are going to forget
0:26:36 about it
0:26:37 and so long as that blight is here
0:26:41 New Haven is going to just keep getting
0:26:44 sick and things are going to keep
0:26:45 getting worse you're not wrong
0:26:49 that house needs to be purged I spend
0:26:52 some time at the hospital as I'm sure
0:26:55 you're aware I'm glad that you're out of
0:26:57 it
0:26:58 well I'm glad that I went which I know I
0:27:02 sound stranger
0:27:04 but I heard things from the other people
0:27:06 that were staying there
0:27:09 there's a lot of stories that are coming
0:27:11 out
0:27:12 people are getting nervous people are
0:27:15 getting sick with infections that are
0:27:20 baffling doctors
0:27:22 her fungus
0:27:24 during my stay I overheard a
0:27:27 conversation with what I presume are
0:27:29 members of the CDC and there is a quiet
0:27:31 interest that's been taken in this
0:27:33 region not just New Haven
0:27:35 but Massachusetts Rhode Island
0:27:38 Connecticut New York
0:27:41 there's apparently some sort of
0:27:44 microbial that's been identified and is
0:27:47 causing questions
0:27:49 I think the answers to those questions
0:27:53 lie in Hell House
0:27:55 answers to those questions well
0:27:59 we're not just fighting some entity
0:28:02 that's going to brawl us until it can't
0:28:04 move anymore
0:28:05 it's a sickness and you want to study
0:28:08 this sickness
0:28:09 Jessica speaks up actually
0:28:13 Daddy I do
0:28:15 you do
0:28:16 if we destroy our house before we have
0:28:19 the answers that we need it would mean
0:28:21 that
0:28:22 we're just putting a Band-Aid over the
0:28:24 situation baby my my kind of tried to
0:28:27 study this thing I I it it defies us at
0:28:29 every step the greatest Minds amongst
0:28:32 the camarilla couldn't [ __ ] figure it
0:28:34 out it it consumed their entire Chantry
0:28:37 Eddie I'm here for a reason
0:28:40 I don't know exactly what that is
0:28:43 but based on the path that we've been on
0:28:45 this might be it
0:28:47 okay
0:28:49 he kind of looks at her
0:28:52 and the
0:28:54 the sympathy that he had for hearing
0:28:56 that she had Visions knowing all too
0:28:59 well what rampant Visions can do to
0:29:01 someone it shifts a little bit and he
0:29:04 gives her a look of
0:29:06 the look of confidence
0:29:08 kind of bites back his mistrust of of
0:29:12 why Visions come to people and the
0:29:16 occult Mysteries of the world and he
0:29:18 just kind of
0:29:19 gives her a nod all right
0:29:23 how do you
0:29:25 what do you need me to do to help you
0:29:28 get the answers you want
0:29:30 she kind of gives uh
0:29:33 a smile
0:29:34 I need access to Yale facilities
0:29:37 we can set up a lab
0:29:39 maybe some sort of a sample can be
0:29:41 contained there
0:29:43 and if I could get the time to study it
0:29:46 maybe we can figure out some kind of
0:29:48 answer to it I don't know if that's
0:29:50 actually
0:29:51 I don't think the Yale facility is
0:29:53 capable of studying this are there
0:29:55 anymore
0:29:56 kind of her face cracks a little bit at
0:30:00 the the idea that this accomplishment
0:30:03 that she's built up and pondered over
0:30:06 and over and over again is a solid Daddy
0:30:10 I
0:30:11 but Yale has labs they do and this
0:30:16 thing
0:30:18 this piece of the Elder was already
0:30:21 there being studied
0:30:23 and I don't want to
0:30:25 sound hyperbolic
0:30:28 but it grew into a beast
0:30:32 that after it was finally put down
0:30:35 engulfed the entire lab facility in
0:30:39 otherworldly flame I do not think any of
0:30:42 the labs capable of studying this thing
0:30:45 survived
0:30:46 Ramirez speaks up Jesse I don't think
0:30:49 he's making this up we gotta pivot
0:30:52 what about this he looks to the group
0:30:55 I'm not the fighter I'm not the tactics
0:30:57 guy I'm not really anything but I do
0:31:00 know he looks at Jesse every time you've
0:31:03 looked and surveyed a situation and
0:31:06 examined a monster we were dealing with
0:31:08 you've been able to figure out how to
0:31:10 beat it you've always figured out a plan
0:31:12 after some time studying and figuring it
0:31:14 out maybe you don't need a lab maybe
0:31:18 maybe we should stop relying on science
0:31:22 here and just have faith that you'll see
0:31:26 it's Achilles heel as far as looks super
0:31:29 annoyed as the notion of
0:31:33 just looking at it and having that be
0:31:36 the answer but Jesse kind of nods
0:31:39 what I can do
0:31:41 is I can give you all of the
0:31:45 all the the information I have regarding
0:31:48 this thing so far I can give you a
0:31:51 account a first-hand account of this
0:31:55 Beast what it did
0:31:58 and what it's capable of
0:32:00 and when we figure out how we're gonna
0:32:02 hit this house which we are doing very
0:32:04 soon
0:32:05 I can make sure that you are pretty
0:32:08 I don't know if I want to get you close
0:32:10 to this thing dude just God
0:32:13 I barely got out of fighting this thing
0:32:15 last time and it takes a lot
0:32:18 to put me down
0:32:20 but it didn't right
0:32:23 it didn't
0:32:25 all right she takes a deep breath and
0:32:27 looks you square in the eye
0:32:29 can you do it again
0:32:36 then we have a plan
0:32:40 Suarez looks over what you put together
0:32:43 and everything in that uh storage unit
0:32:45 is yours if you want to keep this unit
0:32:47 that's fine but
0:32:49 the camarilla knows about its location
0:32:51 I'd recommend that you move all of this
0:32:53 equipment elsewhere
0:32:55 I think it's better if me and my kind
0:32:57 don't know where you are Suarez gives a
0:33:00 nod
0:33:01 yeah I don't think I don't think we want
0:33:05 your camarilla
0:33:07 knowing that the kind have their weapons
0:33:10 that's a good instinct you aren't wrong
0:33:12 about being unsure of the Innocence of
0:33:15 either group we're all monsters I'm just
0:33:18 being honest with you about how we treat
0:33:20 The Mortals
0:33:21 the camarilla wants things status quo
0:33:24 the Sabbat wants to rule over you as
0:33:26 gods but make no mistake we are all
0:33:31 monsters I'm once you are a Johnny I'll
0:33:33 be keeping that in mind
0:33:35 but thanks and he heads over and he
0:33:37 starts [ __ ]
0:33:38 checking weapons and he's clearly a gun
0:33:42 guy because you know what I mean he
0:33:43 starts going to the immediately the rare
0:33:45 weapons the high quality stuff and
0:33:48 starts oh and Johnny actually kind of
0:33:51 starts fumbling in his jacket pulls out
0:33:53 a little necklace with a small glass
0:33:55 vial on the end
0:33:57 containing a deep red liquid
0:34:02 he puts the necklace around Jessica's
0:34:04 neck and clips it into place
0:34:07 that there on the end uh
0:34:10 that's a little bit of my vitae
0:34:12 yo what my blood
0:34:14 so she like she looks at you like she
0:34:17 immediately regrets asking
0:34:20 look I um
0:34:22 I know this is weird
0:34:25 but
0:34:26 vampire blood has properties that can
0:34:30 do all kinds of things to Mortals
0:34:32 least of which is it can heal them you
0:34:35 can give them strength
0:34:37 you can make them incredibly tough
0:34:40 blindingly fast
0:34:43 but it is not something that you should
0:34:45 be
0:34:46 it's nasty [ __ ]
0:34:48 Ramirez kind of gives a non-diam-man
0:34:51 you eat bugs
0:34:52 all that stuff right he kind of just
0:34:55 gives him a sideways glance point is
0:34:59 if you get into a pinch this could save
0:35:01 your life okay she says kind of putting
0:35:05 her hand over the glass
0:35:08 um
0:35:09 I uh
0:35:11 I have a few numbers here for you he
0:35:13 goes into his pocket pulls out a uh a
0:35:17 couple of cards I've got my uh my beeper
0:35:20 number that she makes a face that beeper
0:35:25 um and this uh this number here is for
0:35:28 the office that I uh keep charge of do

0:36:08 don't get with the times yeah don't be
0:36:11 one
0:36:13 Johnny kind of looks down at himself in

0:36:19 little bit get a cell phone my man

0:39:41 make sure that I am there to help
0:39:43 Sheila you let um
0:39:46 our mutual friend know that I want to
0:39:48 talk to him
0:39:49 and they'll uh I'll see what I can do
0:39:51 about Fester Ramirez all right good
0:39:53 meeting guys Sheila says
0:39:57 I love you Jessica stay safe
0:39:59 Johnny kind of watches them all kind of
0:40:02 like start moving some of the things out
0:40:04 of the storage unit kind of nods hops up
0:40:07 into his truck lights morally up and
0:40:09 then uh heads out to be able to call win
0:40:13 back or in fact actually he probably
0:40:14 knows where she's headed she's headed
0:40:16 back to the uh to the Elysium so he's
0:40:18 gonna head to head there to meet up with
0:40:20 the rest of the codery oh you catch
0:40:22 glimpses of them like grabbing the
0:40:23 weapons and
0:40:24 Jesse heads over and corrects Ramirez's
0:40:28 poor Trigger Discipline and like I was
0:40:31 like [ __ ] with a gun and you know
0:40:33 they seem to they seem to thrive
0:40:35 together and you head for Elysium
0:40:41 in preparation for the meeting that the
0:40:44 codery had planned Britta drives Neil
0:40:47 over to Elysium using the I'm sorry it's
0:40:50 not brown miles what color is it oh
0:40:52 that'd be Sunstone bronze thank you
0:40:55 Mouse the Sunstone bronze Beamer that he
0:40:59 had gotten her right when she had
0:41:00 arrived to New Haven and they Park along
0:41:04 the way towards the office Britta stops
0:41:07 and quickly socializes with a couple of
0:41:10 the toridor making sure that they know
0:41:12 when the training times that she and
0:41:14 Miles had set up for them are and what
0:41:16 they need to bring anything like that
0:41:18 and she meets back up with Neil is he
0:41:21 studying about any objectives quickly
0:41:23 Neil who is honestly just kind of
0:41:25 excited to be the only other person in
0:41:28 the car because it means he got to sit
0:41:30 in the front seat he did did he have to
0:41:32 be coerced that he could was allowed to
0:41:34 sit in the front seat no it's like that
0:41:35 little kid thing where you're like
0:41:37 there's only two of us that means I
0:41:38 automatically
0:41:39 no he was maybe a little too excited for
0:41:42 a grown man to sit in the front seat of
0:41:43 a car
0:41:44 as he was waiting for Britta to finish
0:41:46 talking to the Tory door because he just
0:41:48 kind of reflexively avoids big groups of
0:41:50 toriador and it might be a little worse
0:41:53 for him even because
0:41:54 Beretta seems to have put even more
0:41:58 effort in she always dresses nicely for
0:42:01 court and
0:42:02 she has a modern soft feminine style
0:42:07 that you recognize to be hers but for
0:42:09 some reason she seems to have upped it
0:42:12 lately kind of putting more emphasis on
0:42:16 being put together and even the quality
0:42:19 of what she's wearing so in a way
0:42:22 she's looking even more torridor than
0:42:26 usual while having these Toreador
0:42:27 conversations
0:42:28 Neil who had to be convinced not to just
0:42:32 wear his Ash stained tuxedo again he's
0:42:35 just wearing a pair of like black slacks
0:42:38 and a maroon sweater and just is
0:42:40 standing off of the side and while he's
0:42:41 standing off the side he's casting
0:42:43 around nervously because this is the
0:42:45 first time he's been back in a big group
0:42:46 since he got back sort of whether or not
0:42:49 they're there is seems to be assuming
0:42:51 that everybody is like staring at him
0:42:53 whether or not they are and is staring
0:42:55 back around sort of trying to place
0:42:58 faces and weird Outsiders and he's not
0:43:02 like full on eyes of chaos like let me
0:43:05 see everything but sort of the the
0:43:07 mundane precursor paranoid precursor to
0:43:10 that just kind of waiting nearby
0:43:11 occasionally throwing glances
0:43:13 specifically back at the torridor
0:43:15 waiting until Brenda gets back she does
0:43:17 her best to be confident and encouraging
0:43:20 and to
0:43:22 see if she can genuinely Express that
0:43:24 she'd like this Toyota here to
0:43:26 strengthen themselves
0:43:28 and
0:43:29 he's kind of catching one of those
0:43:30 glances from Neil she makes her way back
0:43:33 to him and starts angling towards the
0:43:37 office but seems to want to kind of talk
0:43:39 on the stairs just the words of
0:43:44 you doing okay
0:43:46 um yeah sure
0:43:48 um I'm fine everything
0:43:51 I just felt weird uh I you know spent a
0:43:54 lot of time in the city avoiding having
0:43:57 to go to this office
0:43:58 and now you know it's just
0:44:02 it's just different is all
0:44:04 well you're kinda
0:44:06 radiating nervousness in like a usual
0:44:09 way or like in a more
0:44:11 pointed way or what I'm just I feel
0:44:14 awkward I feel uncomfortable being back
0:44:18 like um I don't know if this is just me
0:44:21 or this is actually what's in the air
0:44:22 but I I feel like everyone thought I was
0:44:25 dead and it would have been easier if I
0:44:27 was so they're like weirded out that I'm
0:44:29 here but I can't tell if that's just in
0:44:30 my brain or if that's actually
0:44:33 the atmosphere the thing is
0:44:37 I get it but also
0:44:40 um
0:44:41 before you could kind of just step back
0:44:44 and expect that people weren't going to
0:44:48 look at you and I'm not sure if that's
0:44:51 the case now I don't think it is I feel
0:44:54 like an animal in a cage with nowhere to
0:44:56 hide
0:44:57 so what I'm kind of telling you is
0:44:59 um
0:45:00 I'm hoping that maybe you can be a bit
0:45:02 more confident here
0:45:06 um
0:45:06 well if you got any tips on how to do
0:45:08 that uh like like actionable things to
0:45:11 do then I'll uh try and Implement those
0:45:14 as best as as best as possible but I I
0:45:16 am
0:45:18 right now I just kind of want to get
0:45:19 behind closed doors and out of this room
0:45:21 if that yeah we can do that
0:45:25 uh I'll come back out you know I'll I'll
0:45:28 do I'll do I'll do rounds or something
0:45:30 so I don't know I don't know what the I
0:45:31 don't have a I don't know maybe just cut
0:45:34 us up wringing your hands Neil instantly
0:45:38 puts his hands to the sides way too
0:45:41 stiffly just shoots them down towards
0:45:44 the floor and then begins to walk in an
0:45:46 extremely like clearly overthinking
0:45:48 about how you use how your arms move
0:45:51 when you walk naturally and therefore
0:45:52 you are [ __ ] the whole thing up
0:45:54 because you're overthinking basic
0:45:56 autonomous function
0:45:57 Bretta holds her tongue and moves
0:46:00 towards the office Neil reaches out and
0:46:02 just sort of opens the door for her
0:46:04 because he got there first and just
0:46:05 pulls the door open to go into the
0:46:08 prince's office
0:46:09 and Bretta takes a couple steps in and
0:46:12 looks around I don't think she's really
0:46:14 been here since it was Rowlands office
0:46:18 sitting behind the desk looking at a few
0:46:21 pieces of paper that he's strewn about
0:46:23 the desk at this point and just
0:46:25 concentrating on them and then but he is
0:46:27 glaring at you as you're coming in
0:46:29 without knocking as he glares it hits
0:46:33 you
0:46:34 in his office
0:46:36 behind his desk up over his head
0:46:40 behind where he glares at you from there
0:46:44 is a painting
0:46:45 a complete painting
0:46:48 and it is a beautiful work of art
0:46:50 consisting of
0:46:52 flowing though pale colors
0:46:55 and you notice this blackness
0:46:58 that engulfs it like this dark Corona
0:47:01 and seeping from that black pitch Halo
0:47:07 are a veins that seep into the other
0:47:10 colors muting them further
0:47:12 and you find yourself
0:47:15 drawn to this painting I need you to
0:47:17 make a check to not lose yourself to it
0:47:20 yep yep this is self-control correct
0:47:22 indeed the difficulty of this rule will
0:47:24 be eat
0:47:26 no successes writer walks forward and
0:47:30 mindlessly leans on the desk put her in
0:47:33 her hand on it by the way miles and
0:47:35 gazes up at the painting lost to its
0:47:39 power the glare subsides after he
0:47:41 realizes who's coming into the office
0:47:43 Neil closes the door behind and notices
0:47:47 in order miles is glare then the
0:47:49 painting and doesn't almost seem to
0:47:51 notice Bridge's reaction yet because
0:47:53 he's too busy apologizing to miles oh
0:47:55 sorry I I didn't think about we were
0:47:58 supposed to meet I didn't no I I
0:47:59 shouldn't knock next time right it's
0:48:01 probably a good idea just the knock in
0:48:03 general I'm so sorry that's fine Britta
0:48:05 she's falling further into seeing the
0:48:09 painting and the emotions that evokes in
0:48:12 her seems to be Clinging On to the edge
0:48:14 of the desk as if like touching
0:48:17 something solid could be a comfort but
0:48:20 her grip is tight and she seems more and
0:48:24 more distraught that the representation
0:48:27 in front of her because if I'm
0:48:30 remembering from the other Scene It
0:48:32 Feels Like A uncanny certainty of his
0:48:36 diabolary and what it means in the stand
0:48:38 on his soul and despite that having been
0:48:42 covered recently this makes it feel so
0:48:46 real and she knows that it's true she
0:48:50 can't argue with the feelings that these
0:48:52 that the painting is evoking on her and
0:48:55 being Toreador she is falling falling
0:48:58 falling further into it
0:49:01 that's uh a hell of an artistic Choice
0:49:04 miles yeah it's a choice among many as
0:49:08 he walks around the desk and starts to
0:49:11 shake her a little bit because she's
0:49:12 seeming to get um weirder she's getting
0:49:15 more intense I guess is the question
0:49:17 Neil's just still looking up at the
0:49:19 painting not a hundred percent noticing
0:49:21 it there is like a reflexive half step
0:49:24 back as miles comes around the desk in
0:49:27 their Direction but he's still looking
0:49:28 up at it like that's um
0:49:31 who did that who's the
0:49:34 uh was this a commission as far as I
0:49:37 know as an artist named Vicky and
0:49:40 she wasn't originally commissioned but
0:49:43 Marcus vitel
0:49:45 paid her to finish it and give it to me
0:49:47 uh-huh anyways I start trying to like
0:49:50 move her and put myself between it the
0:49:53 painting in her does the shaking break
0:49:56 through yes I'm presuming this is
0:49:59 like hands on shoulders gentle what is
0:50:02 this it starts softer but after like
0:50:04 depending on how long this takes it
0:50:06 might get increasingly harder as if
0:50:09 she's not respondingly all right come on
0:50:11 how long to see how hard you're shaking
0:50:14 the air Tim I think he just barely
0:50:16 starts to really shake you before you
0:50:20 notice and then you you know are hit
0:50:22 with the feelings of a Diablo or
0:50:24 scrapple in you Britta wants the shaking
0:50:27 gets a little rougher and makes a small
0:50:30 sound of
0:50:32 startlement fear intimidation and the
0:50:36 way that she was gripping the edge of
0:50:37 the desk kind of transfers over to the
0:50:39 lapel of your suit and she kind of
0:50:42 shrinks before she realizes it's you
0:50:44 miles is already let go over sure she
0:50:47 manually kind of makes herself ungrip
0:50:51 his suit kind of puts her gaze towards
0:50:54 the floor and
0:50:56 says sorry I am
0:51:00 um
0:51:02 that's gonna be really hard for
0:51:05 my clan for that to to be there kind of
0:51:10 the point isn't it though miles I mean
0:51:12 your client is the one that painted it
0:51:14 in the first place what was the name of
0:51:16 the painter uh it was Victoria Summers
0:51:19 she had it out in the Elysium not too
0:51:22 long ago you don't think that maybe
0:51:25 she's the mole that we're looking for I
0:51:28 mean she could be I have no way to
0:51:30 verify these things I don't recognize
0:51:32 that name is she new is she one of the
0:51:34 princes she came with the entourages she
0:51:36 came with the princes correct from one
0:51:38 domain I believe it was DC isn't that
0:51:41 where the market Marcus Vitel is yes
0:51:43 I guess we should keep an eye on both of
0:51:45 them but yes please
0:51:48 keep looking directly at Neil
0:51:51 not so many eyes well we should find
0:51:53 some other people to help you out I I
0:51:55 can start looking at more people that
0:51:57 way that'd be good would be great
0:52:00 um I well I'll need some cover because
0:52:02 it's what kind of just as obvious when I
0:52:04 do it as when Neil does it actually
0:52:06 maybe more obvious because if I'm kind
0:52:09 of sulking at the back that's gonna we
0:52:12 can always do it from the balcony at
0:52:13 some point yeah yeah I guess people are
0:52:16 probably used to me just being a
0:52:18 Wallflower so it's easy enough to well
0:52:21 anyway miles are you keeping this here
0:52:25 like that's the intention yes brother
0:52:28 seems disquieted and doesn't really seem
0:52:32 to like that answer and chooses the
0:52:35 chair that faces the most away from the
0:52:37 desk to sit down in it's not my favorite
0:52:41 choice but you put it directly behind
0:52:43 your chair it's effective that's fair to
0:52:46 be I mean if she was showing out to the
0:52:47 whole Elysium then that's it's already
0:52:50 out there's not really I mean you can't
0:52:52 squirrel it away because that makes you
0:52:54 seem guilty but now I mean literally
0:52:56 everyone who looks at it knows that you
0:52:57 are the obvious so it's and if
0:53:00 Toyota are in here and they see it and
0:53:02 they react like me you you probably
0:53:05 should just kind of let them wait it out
0:53:07 because it's really I mean I I don't
0:53:10 mind they thank you for not making me
0:53:12 look at it any longer but you were
0:53:14 getting distressed yes but well it's
0:53:18 just you shouldn't you shouldn't touch
0:53:20 Toyota when they're like that they get
0:53:23 really mad I thought your nuts just
0:53:25 supposed to touch people in general
0:53:26 that's like a Neil do you remember when
0:53:28 I was really new and
0:53:30 well Elsa had that exhibition of Modern
0:53:34 Art and you kind of tried to get a chair
0:53:36 for me and the reaction to the toroid or
0:53:39 that moment is seared into my brain and
0:53:41 will be with me in the moments that I
0:53:43 die okay I didn't mean to bring it back
0:53:45 to the back of your eyelids but miles
0:53:47 that's kind of what I'm talking about is
0:53:49 that that could be something that would
0:53:50 be a problem
0:53:52 just just giving you an FYI
0:53:56 to play etiquette thing I guess yeah
0:53:59 here's a question miles is a busy guy
0:54:01 he's just supposed to wait or should oh
0:54:05 you should have a a designated rude
0:54:07 person to wake somebody up like a like a
0:54:10 etiquette scapegoat was that on that or
0:54:12 just let them
0:54:15 heard before she is seen because she
0:54:17 sees the portrait from the door and just
0:54:19 winds up saying dick me dead and bury me
0:54:22 pregnant what the [ __ ] is that and she
0:54:24 just kind of walks in rolling her eyes
0:54:27 at the portrait as I was telling the
0:54:29 other two it was painted by a torador by
0:54:32 the name of Victoria Summers out in
0:54:34 Elysium and where is she buried nowhere
0:54:37 because that would be not doing me any
0:54:39 favors currently I mean I could try and
0:54:42 just say hi and see what she's about you
0:54:45 should probably do that yeah that would
0:54:46 be when I was I was saying in miles that
0:54:48 there's you know and and I was saying
0:54:51 that I guess if that was being painted
0:54:53 in Elysium you know hiding it isn't
0:54:56 really like a that's not good but then
0:54:58 also whatever it'll also unsettle other
0:55:01 princes which is working in my favorites
0:55:03 you said Marcus Vitel paid to finish it
0:55:06 yeah commissioned it yes why is it in
0:55:07 here then because he paid to finish it
0:55:10 to give it to me after we had our and
0:55:12 you chose exchange here rather than
0:55:14 display it fully in Elysium I really
0:55:16 don't like him I've never met him okay
0:55:19 so what I'm gonna say about this and
0:55:21 then I'm going to be done talking about
0:55:23 this [ __ ] painting
0:55:26 the wise man when spotting an
0:55:28 acquaintance at the nude beach covers
0:55:30 his face not his genitals so I guess it
0:55:33 makes a weird kind of sense what that
0:55:35 does not strike me as nude B jennican at
0:55:37 all well no because nobody at the nude
0:55:39 beach is smart enough to cover their
0:55:41 genitals the wise person says okay if
0:55:43 they don't know it's me it doesn't
0:55:45 matter if they see my dick but if like
0:55:47 you're both at the nude beach isn't it
0:55:48 okay to be there you know I get her but
0:55:51 some people may find okay some people
0:55:54 are looking for an anime
0:55:58 I've never been to a new beach you
0:56:00 should go I'll take you where is The
0:56:03 Wraith being held not a nude I don't
0:56:06 know I guess we have to talk to Johnny
0:56:07 about that I I feel like a ray that a
0:56:10 nude beach would just be a great way to
0:56:12 protect against people I feel like
0:56:13 that's an okay thing for you but a ton
0:56:16 of naked bruja just on a beach getting
0:56:18 real angry
0:56:20 it feels Prime
0:56:21 appropriate you know it's not my Rave so
0:56:23 I don't really get to choose but I'd
0:56:24 rather not I I guess it's up to Johnny I
0:56:27 think it actually is Neil has like
0:56:29 totally lost whether or not we're
0:56:30 talking about metaphors or if this is
0:56:32 actually I'm waiting for him to call me
0:56:33 back but also the um the crime scene we
0:56:38 need to pay someone to get in and clean
0:56:39 tonight and keep them quiet
0:56:43 and then hot oh you're um your doctor
0:56:46 broken hand in the trauma psychologist
0:56:48 now
0:56:49 all right Johnny pointed out that maybe
0:56:51 you being known as Davenport isn't
0:56:53 appropriate a good point and yeah we
0:56:56 have some ghouls on retainer to clean up
0:56:59 exactly these kind of things
0:57:02 well Ray have already been planned and
0:57:04 is that a real us Maya Moore I mean I
0:57:08 my
0:57:10 this is telling you way more about my
0:57:12 dad than he would probably want you to
0:57:14 know but he did have a proctologist
0:57:15 named Dr broken handed I'm sorry what
0:57:18 it was German that wasn't the problem
0:57:21 I don't know what it's German for if
0:57:22 that's what you're asking no no I think
0:57:24 it's German for broken hands isn't it
0:57:27 you've Associated me with a proctologist
0:57:29 do you believe me specialized degree
0:57:32 it's not that anyways like do you want
0:57:35 people to think of you and cringe or
0:57:37 think of you and smile can we maybe get
0:57:40 that done tonight or that's the
0:57:44 appointment is up to the good doctor
0:57:46 here we'll get it done as soon as we can
0:57:48 I just mean that the longer they have
0:57:50 these memories the more likely it is
0:57:52 that they'll talk to their family and
0:57:53 friends about it there's already candles
0:57:55 for memorializing the victims of this so
0:57:58 I mean it's it was it's gonna be a hard
0:58:00 sell to get this one this is going to be
0:58:02 out of the brain
0:58:04 there's going to be trauma associated
0:58:06 with this regardless of whether they
0:58:08 remember it or not
0:58:09 in in the city anyways with the dozen or
0:58:13 so packs that are coming up this is just
0:58:15 going to be like a nightly occurrence
0:58:16 pretty soon the the culprits that the
0:58:19 victims were able to put eyes on they
0:58:21 left three alive seemingly on purpose
0:58:24 they were sounds like Delgado and four
0:58:27 identical [ __ ] I've seen those
0:58:30 identical [ __ ] that that that
0:58:32 that will they're so they're already
0:58:34 here then sure sounds like it because
0:58:36 they were that elevates timetables in my
0:58:40 head the the Sabbat are here here now
0:58:42 who knows what other packs are around I
0:58:45 mean you have the list you would know
0:58:47 which package I do and when I got the
0:58:49 list not that long ago they were down in
0:58:51 New York unless there's multiple groups
0:58:53 of identical [ __ ] but that
0:58:55 would seem coincidental too much belief
0:58:58 is that a thing the Sabbat does do they
0:59:00 Embrace multiples or uh
0:59:04 oh anyways uh I guess so Ravens Rave is
0:59:07 important although I also wanted to talk
0:59:10 about that because I'm having
0:59:12 second thoughts about
0:59:14 going down fighting with Pendragon after
0:59:16 uh the other night
0:59:18 so
0:59:19 what do you mean going down fighting
0:59:21 with Pendragon I saw us down there doing
0:59:24 it and then what like a vision yeah the
0:59:28 other night when you were cackling I
0:59:30 don't remember that part but I do
0:59:31 remember
0:59:32 sort of it's a touch and go but I
0:59:36 remember when I saw some of it and yeah
0:59:38 we were down there and we were fighting
0:59:40 you know side by side back to back with
0:59:42 Pendragon and and I think I think John
0:59:45 Peterson was there I I can't remember do
0:59:48 we want to pause this till Johnny gets
0:59:49 here so you don't have to go through it
0:59:51 multiple times I guess so yeah probably
0:59:52 I don't know has anyone tried paging him
0:59:55 he he always has his paper on him I did
0:59:58 a little while ago I he's got a lot of
1:00:00 things going on he'll be here or contact
1:00:03 us there's a there's a big flooding
1:00:05 knock at the door enter oh so that's
1:00:07 that's what you kind of want to well any
1:00:09 kind of knock you're not doing his
1:00:11 specific the door opens up and uh Johnny
1:00:13 Saxon comes walking through uh he has a
1:00:16 box for a cell phone that's kind of like
1:00:19 half opened
1:00:20 um that he's kind of looking at like how
1:00:22 the why the hell did he make these
1:00:24 things so damn hard to open up
1:00:26 you could see that he's still got blood
1:00:29 that's kind of dried and caked on like
1:00:32 the edges of his face that like he's
1:00:33 kind of wiped out of the way Johnny are
1:00:35 you okay yeah yeah I'm fine that I
1:00:38 figured I'd join the modern era here
1:00:41 finally gets frustrated with trying to
1:00:44 open the thing normally and just Powers
1:00:46 it open with potence and just tears open
1:00:48 the phone and goes tumbling across the
1:00:50 uh the floor it didn't kind of like
1:00:52 actively leans away from Johnny and she
1:00:55 looks at him hard and she said Johnny
1:00:57 when we were drinking at the bar what
1:00:59 were you drinking what what were we
1:01:01 drinking at the bar Johnny if that's who
1:01:03 you really are
1:01:05 Bretta winced at the big pop uh from the
1:01:08 container and had just kind of shielded
1:01:10 from the cell phone but is watching this
1:01:13 conversation like Ping Pong back and
1:01:15 forth he throws the the packaging in the
1:01:18 in Miles trash container goes over and
1:01:21 grabs the phone are you talking about
1:01:22 the night when we were getting hammered
1:01:23 on tequila she relaxes a little bit Neil
1:01:27 had also waved away at first like wait a
1:01:29 minute but more quickly recovered and
1:01:32 realized it was Johnny as soon as he was
1:01:33 like [ __ ] this goddamn packaging
1:01:34 leggings that was the mower he's like
1:01:36 okay now that's Johnny Johnny glances at
1:01:38 the painting above uh miles good God
1:01:40 that thing's uglier than I remember and
1:01:42 then goes over to the corner and grabs
1:01:43 the seat into a leather armchair it's
1:01:45 two by the that phone at a gas station
1:01:47 uh well it was more like a little
1:01:51 convenience store
1:01:52 bodega's thing he said that this one was
1:01:55 pretty adorable you know I could give
1:01:57 you a cell phone with a number you
1:01:59 wouldn't have to go through all of this
1:02:00 this one's got a number I think oh my
1:02:02 God John is like fumbling through the
1:02:04 instructions it seems more disgusting
1:02:06 than he's been the whole time
1:02:10 miles kind of made like closet for us
1:02:13 with like cell phones and pagers and
1:02:16 stuff you got a cell phone closet yes
