0:00:25 now let's
0:00:29 [Music]
0:00:30 let's walk
0:00:36 last time on path of night
0:00:40 the quotery reunited men at the Royale
0:00:43 to talk safely
0:00:45 Neil revealed that Miles diabolarized up
0:00:48 in rolands
0:00:50 the news was divisive
0:00:52 in argument's rupture the group
0:01:03 foreign
0:01:04 [Music]
0:01:13 foreign
0:01:16 [Music]
0:01:25 is still leaning against the wall arms
0:01:28 crossed Joe liffer lift her head so
0:01:30 she's not talking at the floor but
0:01:32 so
0:01:34 do we want to talk about the spot now or
0:01:37 what's the or the the problems the the
0:01:40 ripples from the rolands thing
0:01:43 because there's
0:01:44 Miles when your sire finds out he's
0:01:46 going to be obligated to to do something
0:01:48 about you he's been here already
0:01:50 when after he delivered the princess
0:01:54 Johnny gives you a look
0:01:56 he is
0:01:59 he's a part of a system that is designed
0:02:01 specifically to keep neonates from
0:02:02 devouring their Elders uh
0:02:05 he's
0:02:06 if he finds out at least in a way that
0:02:08 is not deniable and you can see it half
0:02:11 the court
0:02:12 every toroid or intramir could know at
0:02:15 least
0:02:16 um we'll just see it so if he sees it
0:02:18 and it can't be done it isn't one thing
0:02:20 it's another
0:02:21 I'm just I'm trying to be solutions that
0:02:23 this is not me I understand judgmental I
0:02:25 just we need to figure out what to do
0:02:27 because what what are they planning on
0:02:29 doing do you have any concrete ideas
0:02:30 right now yes they're going to
0:02:32 disseminate the information that's your
0:02:33 dilobitalist to the whole Court to turn
0:02:35 public opinion against you they already
0:02:36 did
0:02:37 Roland's blood didn't protect rolands
0:02:40 from you so it's not going to protect
0:02:42 you from people who all rally against
0:02:45 you what do you mean they already did to
0:02:47 the court they have made a painting of
0:02:49 me rumors have already been flying
0:02:51 because that's what he's talking about
0:02:53 they're talking about spreading rumors
0:02:55 rumors that it takes no effort at all
0:02:57 even in the midst of court to confirm
0:02:59 unfortunately but no one's come forward
0:03:02 yet and said that they saw the black
0:03:04 straight probably because they're afraid
0:03:06 of the diablarist
0:03:08 because if he's the prince
0:03:10 he has sort of the right unless the
0:03:14 camarilla decides he and your size and
0:03:17 archon that's kind of the threads I'm
0:03:19 connecting there or they said that I did
0:03:21 in retrospect if they find it useful
0:03:23 especially since this domain is going to
0:03:24 be crushed as you've told me before
0:03:26 that's the thing your sire specifically
0:03:28 said we have to keep all the princes
0:03:30 here oh and that they're trying to like
0:03:32 leave
0:03:34 um and we need to get Roman pedrama's
0:03:35 army and we'll go march on New York
0:03:36 who's trying to leave
0:03:38 the Princess where are they going not
0:03:41 here especially if they find out that
0:03:43 the whole plan is for them to get ground
0:03:44 up in a meat grinder wouldn't that mean
0:03:47 that's the same plan for us yes we are
0:03:49 and we are Grist for the mill
0:03:51 so we keep them thinking that this is a
0:03:55 prime opportunity to utilize their power
0:03:58 they love playing these games I mean I'm
0:04:01 pretty sure all of the princes who fled
0:04:03 here also want revenge against the spot
0:04:05 camera you're probably right but the
0:04:08 camarilla is not filled with Fighters
0:04:11 and living
0:04:14 is the best revenge according to
0:04:16 a lot of mentalities they would like to
0:04:18 have their territories back they would
0:04:20 like to get their territories back
0:04:21 without having to lift their fingers for
0:04:22 it yeah they want a clever win they
0:04:24 don't want to have to work for it
0:04:25 Fighters know opportunists yes yep so
0:04:29 all we have to do is present them with a
0:04:31 good opportunity well what to have their
0:04:33 goals March against the Sabbat
0:04:37 their Childer no but at least stay in
0:04:40 New Haven and we can at least have a
0:04:42 unified front against this spot do you
0:04:45 think they're gonna stay they will if
0:04:48 they keep thinking there's an
0:04:49 opportunity to do so I think you're if
0:04:52 they think there's a precarious Prince
0:04:54 the seat is very easy to topple but you
0:04:57 also already took down an attempted
0:04:59 Praxis seizure so they've got that
0:05:01 knowledge too I'm not sure how much but
0:05:03 yeah they're still probably I mean
0:05:05 aren't they still locked in a closet in
0:05:07 Elysium not the prince he's dead well
0:05:10 then that's going to be there too so
0:05:11 also if they think that it's also
0:05:13 probably one of the reasons that
0:05:15 Pendragon has both Hartford and Boston
0:05:18 they're running out of places to run to
0:05:20 I mean honestly the one is sort of in a
0:05:24 weirdly positive note uh the fact that
0:05:26 Longbow and the gala was like the site
0:05:30 of a mass Invasion by the Sabbat means
0:05:32 that you know they're not all just
0:05:34 immediately running to Pendragon for
0:05:36 safety uh because there's at least the
0:05:38 illusion that we're still doing okay
0:05:40 right and they're pushing me not to Ally
0:05:43 with him especially if I tell
0:05:45 why are we staying here if the spot
0:05:50 plan is yeah but isn't that gonna mean
0:05:53 that we die along with these princess
0:05:56 yup yup
0:05:58 so no means that's in the cards that's
0:06:02 that's and that's a sacrifice they're
0:06:04 willing to make that's assuming that's
0:06:07 the plan that the archon put forward I
0:06:09 would like to believe that my sire is
0:06:10 not willing to just let us roast I mean
0:06:14 his plan well I saw the war board Smiles
0:06:17 you would not have told us if you
0:06:19 thought that we were going to just die
0:06:21 there are people that can make it out
0:06:23 well he also to be fair he wasn't
0:06:26 thrilled that weathers and and I and
0:06:29 Amaya made it into that safe house to
0:06:31 see stuff
0:06:32 so
0:06:34 just now was meat grinder your
0:06:37 interpretation of this or did he
0:06:39 actually say that it was my
0:06:41 interpretation but there's not really
0:06:43 another interpretation of you are New
0:06:46 Haven is to be sacrificed so that we can
0:06:49 make an assault on New York and cut them
0:06:51 cut the head off the snake
0:06:53 like
0:06:54 there's not I don't see another
0:06:55 interpretation of sacrifice the other
0:06:58 interpretation
0:07:00 is that New Haven is in fact a bulwark
0:07:04 we hold out against the coming storm
0:07:07 while pen Dragon makes the strike it may
0:07:11 look Grim it may look like it's going to
0:07:13 be a meat grinder it may look like we're
0:07:15 all gonna die but that's not the case
0:07:18 part of the problem though is uh does
0:07:21 this plan work better if we die
0:07:26 no um does it work better if we succeed
0:07:29 and hold the Sabbat back and survive do
0:07:32 you think Johnny it's like hundreds of
0:07:34 Sabbat I asked you a question which way
0:07:36 works better
0:07:38 are you asking what I think are you
0:07:40 asking what I think the archon's
0:07:41 mentality is because I'm asking I'm
0:07:43 asking you a very simple question which
0:07:45 way works better I mean if we can
0:07:47 survive sure but I saw those in the
0:07:50 packs and the show but that's not their
0:07:53 goal is that we survive their goal is to
0:07:56 take out New York yes if we survive or
0:07:58 not is a moot point yeah and their goal
0:08:01 is also not necessarily to see us dead
0:08:03 no it's not their goal is for us to draw
0:08:07 all the fire us being dead is not being
0:08:10 mentioned but that's what that's a
0:08:13 sacrifice they're willing to make which
0:08:15 to be fair uh uh a linchpin complication
0:08:19 in this is that uh the archon was asking
0:08:22 um us and uh uh weather specifically and
0:08:25 basically everybody they could uh to try
0:08:28 and convince Pendragon to send his
0:08:30 troops to New York
0:08:32 the pet dragon hates your sire so I
0:08:35 don't know how we're gonna convince them
0:08:36 to do that well when bruja Rave might be
0:08:38 a good place to talk to him about it
0:08:40 okay Beretta seems incredibly doubtful
0:08:44 that this objective could ever be
0:08:46 possible
0:08:49 Neil's actually deliberately not looking
0:08:51 at Brita when he's talking about
0:08:53 Pendragon
0:08:55 um and especially does not look at her
0:08:57 wildly obviously does not look at her
0:09:00 when he's suggesting that someone around
0:09:02 here would need to convince him
0:09:09 so
0:09:10 um what happens if he doesn't go after
0:09:13 New York is uh same plan happens but
0:09:16 then we also don't take New York
0:09:18 so then everybody just
0:09:21 it's a sacrifice play with no play
0:09:25 well they're coming through New Haven
0:09:27 one way or the other they are uh eager
0:09:30 and raring and honestly the only reason
0:09:32 they're not here yet is because of the
0:09:34 Blackhand issue
0:09:35 and the only reason we've been some
0:09:37 actually receiving support
0:09:42 because they intend for us to hold all
0:09:45 those guns that got bought off the set
0:09:48 Heights and all the uh everything all
0:09:51 the reason any other extra bodies and
0:09:53 princes and retinas are being sent here
0:09:55 is both bait and arms uh and without
0:09:59 armies going down
0:10:01 to all my guess all that dries up but
0:10:05 either way do you understand what going
0:10:07 after New York entails yeah I was there
0:10:10 no no no I'm asking in terms of New
0:10:13 York's a big city do you know what he
0:10:16 wants Pendragon to take out I my
0:10:20 impression not not a specific thing
0:10:22 other than some of the heads of the
0:10:23 Sabbat just to occupy just to take a
0:10:26 huge force and the city is theirs now
0:10:28 that's my he wants to go after the
0:10:31 Archbishop probably and just to take it
0:10:33 and then turn around and then uh the
0:10:36 bulk of the Sabbat are then trapped
0:10:38 between two strongholds well they won't
0:10:41 be trapped they'll just scatter like
0:10:43 rats but to to wear without there's the
0:10:45 great lakes and there's the I mean
0:10:46 they'd be trapped in New England they'd
0:10:47 be rampaged around here that's the
0:10:49 status quo it would be the big loss for
0:10:51 the Crusade yeah they would kill Crusade
0:10:55 momentum I think that's all we've always
0:10:56 had packs of Shabbat scurrying around
0:10:58 like rats that's not changing no but
0:11:01 what would be changing is having a giant
0:11:03 horde of them crusading up the East
0:11:06 Coast which is what they're doing so I
0:11:08 think they're attempting to break the
0:11:09 momentum that's the that would be my
0:11:12 guess
0:11:13 I'm not a tactician I don't I don't
0:11:15 think it's likely we survive but let's
0:11:18 be clear I think we have a chance we've
0:11:21 had a lot of new people besides the
0:11:24 princes the asamites are now here or at
0:11:27 least part of them if if I was yeah I
0:11:30 need to is Nora here is Nora she's been
0:11:33 very helpful okay good I have thoughts
0:11:35 for how we can utilize them to prepare
0:11:37 but I think we also need to make some
0:11:38 domain changes to give us an edge that
0:11:42 might take the heat off of what the
0:11:43 Sabbat can do without our knowledge
0:11:46 I am
0:11:47 if I was the Sabbat knowing that there's
0:11:50 a mole in here along with the killing
0:11:52 spree and other little packs hiding out
0:11:54 but like a mole in the court at least
0:11:56 one I would time the entrance to the
0:12:00 Crusade the same moment that all public
0:12:04 fervor had turned against miles and he
0:12:07 had no one but us left on his side uh
0:12:10 kind of like uh when they threw the
0:12:12 werewolf into the Elysium right that's
0:12:14 the only about Arabella and then they
0:12:16 showed up an attack but like that but
0:12:18 who wants a way bigger scale right
0:12:20 that's not what's happening though
0:12:22 because
0:12:24 you said that Carmen's keeping this
0:12:26 information from the majority of the
0:12:28 support that's what it seemed like I
0:12:30 don't know Johnny I don't know the
0:12:31 politics of this about I don't know if
0:12:32 they like Curry favor the same way that
0:12:33 the camera really do but no but they
0:12:35 they like to keep amongst themselves the
0:12:37 same way that camarilla does a member of
0:12:40 the Sabbat doesn't want to be seen
0:12:41 interacting with a member of the
0:12:43 camarilla if that mole is from the
0:12:45 Camarillo it could look bad to Carmen's
0:12:49 allies if she's known to be having ties
0:12:51 with well cameras so they they I don't
0:12:54 know if it's a camarillion though and
0:12:56 the reason I say that is because Carmen
0:12:58 promised them the Archbishop ship of New
0:13:01 Haven well if if that's the case then
0:13:03 there might be a camerian who's willing
0:13:04 to jump ship and convert pausing for a
0:13:09 second what it means for sure is that
0:13:11 it's not the sabbat's plan to move when
0:13:15 news of this is spread because that's
0:13:18 Carmen's information that she hasn't
0:13:19 shared specifically others might know
0:13:22 about it by now but she's keeping it
0:13:25 let's not get too far ahead of ourselves
0:13:27 we don't actually know their plans what
0:13:28 we do know is there is a mole yeah
0:13:31 there's a mole and there's another
0:13:32 player right so we need to figure that
0:13:34 out another another player that's fine
0:13:36 at least as far as sabot when you mean
0:13:39 another player
0:13:40 um Polonia do you mean the Archbishop of
0:13:43 New York uh they were they were talking
0:13:46 about him uh Cardinal the Cardinal of
0:13:49 the East Coast something like that holy
0:13:51 [ __ ] so then he's the one who's been
0:13:53 Manning the Helm of this Crusade because
0:13:56 Polonia used to be the Archbishop of New
0:13:58 York uh now it looks like he's in charge
0:14:01 the whole damn East Coast he and the
0:14:03 vikas were there personally for the
0:14:04 assault on the gala you see Johnny kind
0:14:07 of shiver at the name of the vikos yeah
0:14:09 like good either
0:14:11 at least say if I felt the whole time
0:14:14 even being out of my mind was
0:14:16 when it looked at me Johnny gives a look
0:14:19 to the rest of the cotery
0:14:21 it's one of the beings that founded the
0:14:23 Sabbat it's old and
0:14:26 Of The zamizi Bloodline ripped off its
0:14:29 genitals and threw it into a fire you
0:14:31 told us you heard that song yeah you
0:14:33 told us uh uh the vikas and Polonia were
0:14:37 waiting on
0:14:38 someone from I was like Vermont or New
0:14:41 Hampshire or something that somebody
0:14:42 who's already up in the New England area
0:14:44 um dark Selena not a name I recognized
0:14:48 although based on some context clues you
0:14:51 said dark saline is on the way yeah
0:14:53 already here uh Polonia was waiting on a
0:14:56 meeting she's the very first of the
0:14:58 bruja to go anti-tribune
0:15:01 she's the first The Brewhouse about and
0:15:04 I thought she was dead so did a lot of
0:15:06 people miles just sire seemed very
0:15:08 surprised at the mention that she was
0:15:10 around
0:15:11 um also pretty sure Pendragon thought
0:15:14 she was dead yeah based on some context
0:15:16 it was Britta do you remember the
0:15:17 conversation we had with Knicks and the
0:15:19 whole like you know he thinks but he
0:15:22 didn't
0:15:22 deal
0:15:24 I I think it's dark Selena Neil that's
0:15:26 Pendragon sire that was kind of the
0:15:29 pieces that I thought the admin that's
0:15:30 good to know that's the well
0:15:33 yeah pendren thought he killed a sire
0:15:35 but uh he apparently did not she's here
0:15:39 somewhere
0:15:41 and and allied with the Sabbat obviously
0:15:43 and and helping to also cause problems
0:15:46 she's old school and real bad news is
0:15:49 there a chance she was the one in the
0:15:50 ghoul suit uh
0:15:52 me I I don't maybe I don't I think it's
0:15:56 unlikely that she would have stooped to
0:16:00 being inside of a mortal like that her
0:16:02 ideology is that vampires and the Sabbat
0:16:05 are gods and Mortals are nothing but
0:16:09 cattle to be feasted upon
0:16:11 she is the progenitor of that bad
0:16:14 really dark vampiric nature to just rule
0:16:19 over the Dark World well even Zeus
0:16:22 turned into a bull for the right reasons
0:16:24 they were waiting on a meeting with her
0:16:26 and uh Johnny your sire was gathering up
0:16:28 a list of who was going to come and
0:16:29 Crusade against New Haven it was like
0:16:32 like a dozen packs oh how is it possible
0:16:36 that she's alive I don't know I don't
0:16:39 know I guess I guess the better question
0:16:41 now that we're looking at it is how how
0:16:43 did we think that she would have been
0:16:45 killed it sounds like she played possum
0:16:47 it doesn't really matter
0:16:49 regardless she's alive apparently and
0:16:52 meeting with the people in New York uh
0:16:54 she's also um I guess sort of rallying
0:16:57 some ancient Clans some uh some uh
0:17:00 necromancers with skulls for faces and
0:17:03 uh like
0:17:06 some guy with a third eye and just some
0:17:09 some crazy [ __ ] either you're sorry I
0:17:11 had pictures something real weird real
0:17:13 real ancient weirdos are with dark
0:17:16 Selena and on the side of the Sabbat
0:17:19 Crusade well that might help us convince
0:17:21 Pendragon to some degree no I am
0:17:24 if she's his sire
0:17:28 I don't think that he he hated her
0:17:31 enough to try to kill her before and he
0:17:33 seemed really convinced that he
0:17:34 succeeded I would probably make him
0:17:37 angry to know he didn't yeah well
0:17:39 someone's gonna have to tell him yes
0:17:41 maybe over the phone I'm just saying
0:17:43 that that might help unless you just
0:17:45 deludes himself we can't know until we
0:17:48 either way it's one of the few cards we
0:17:50 have to play in regards to that there's
0:17:51 comes a point where you have to stop
0:17:53 thinking about what might happen
0:17:55 [Laughter]
0:17:57 no I'm gonna agreement I know you guys
0:18:00 are what it comes down to is we need to
0:18:02 find the small regardless of whatever
0:18:03 action they may take against that if we
0:18:05 can find it we can do the thing you do
0:18:09 with moles you feed them misinformation
0:18:10 we need to find the mole we need to
0:18:12 identify them all and deal with the mole
0:18:14 right
0:18:15 um that's anything that we do is going
0:18:17 to be undermined by the mole and we I
0:18:20 agree with optimism I guess that maybe
0:18:23 we can survive but if the mole is not
0:18:24 dealt with those chances slim to zero we
0:18:27 need to be in charge of the information
0:18:28 well Neil I think you just found your
0:18:30 new project I don't think I want to
0:18:32 throw up I have a different project I
0:18:34 think Neil would be good for
0:18:36 um are you showering is now the time
0:18:38 what are we I don't know I think we're
0:18:40 talking about it I also want to fix
0:18:42 miles and Brenna Rhys had a lot of power
0:18:46 he was sanish all because he could
0:18:49 manipulate he could see things he could
0:18:51 do the Magics
0:18:53 I don't think that that needs to be the
0:18:55 center shawl's job I think we need a
0:18:57 sage I think we need a new officer in
0:19:00 the court in light of this coming are we
0:19:03 still allied with the premiere that was
0:19:05 kind of what we were doing before I
0:19:07 don't think there's a lot of Premiere
0:19:08 left in the city since their Chantry is
0:19:10 gone oh God I feel like that should
0:19:12 normally feel like good news
0:19:15 no they were talked about as being one
0:19:18 of the last protections we had against
0:19:20 the Sabbat yeah regardless
0:19:23 I think that should be Neil's job he can
0:19:25 pull from
0:19:26 the other disparate magic users he knows
0:19:28 we have a whole Court full of asomite
0:19:32 magicians I can I can talk to them
0:19:35 Scholars and whatnot I'm not sure how
0:19:37 much actual magic they have in there but
0:19:39 uh Magic probably a lot uh Warriors none
0:19:42 right they describe themselves as the
0:19:45 non-combat yeah because all the
0:19:47 murderers stayed behind with ursugi
0:19:50 that's fine that's so high it's good to
0:19:52 know one way or another I just they've
0:19:53 been rather tight-lipped on it and I've
0:19:55 been waiting for you to but Neil you've
0:19:57 been doing this job all along just for
0:19:59 our codery you've been keeping an eye on
0:20:02 the [ __ ] we don't see you've been can I
0:20:04 ask for a favor then yeah don't make it
0:20:07 official it's not up to me the only
0:20:10 reason I could do all the things that I
0:20:11 could do is because no one ever looks at
0:20:13 me I've never even heard of this
0:20:14 position it's not a position it would be
0:20:16 something you create for the purpose of
0:20:19 staving off this attack and then
0:20:20 afterwards when we're all out on the
0:20:22 other side drinking beer then we decide
0:20:25 how you want to run your court from here
0:20:27 on out but I think we need someone who
0:20:29 is specifically looking at how to
0:20:31 counter the magic that the Sabbat can do
0:20:32 I hear you're saying one I think it
0:20:34 would be lovely to give him actual
0:20:36 position to like thank him for that work
0:20:38 but I also think I hear what Neil's
0:20:40 saying is this work might be easier to
0:20:42 do without an official title what if if
0:20:45 he was like they'll listen to us now
0:20:48 Johnny like they listen to you and me
0:20:50 because we have status seal needs to be
0:20:53 able to have people listen to him not
0:20:54 because he's Neil but because he's right
0:20:56 when I don't if you have status all I
0:20:59 need is for you to listen to me you guys
0:21:01 you could be like a secret scourge
0:21:05 that way you would have the authority
0:21:07 technically but not the label I don't
0:21:09 know this is all complicated I just want
0:21:11 to do the you can do the things and then
0:21:13 we'll just go from there and work on one
0:21:15 thing at a time um I I what I think we
0:21:17 need honestly is we need to stop being
0:21:20 like Oh The Gemini league and operation
0:21:22 Longbow and all we just need to be the
0:21:24 camarilla or else we're gonna die so so
0:21:27 yeah
0:21:31 Neil looks visibly like comforted by
0:21:35 being corrected
0:21:37 Brita
0:21:38 I'm trying not to look at you when we're
0:21:41 talking about Liaisons but I don't know
0:21:43 if you want to talk about it but we
0:21:46 I gotta yeah
0:21:48 that'll just looks at Neil for that not
0:21:52 a sentence I mean we're all just stuck
0:21:55 very cozy with Pendragon in a lot of
0:21:58 ways
0:21:59 um very big cozy energy uh Chinese
0:22:03 eyebrow shoots up it was very weird and
0:22:05 I know but based on some good quick
0:22:07 conversations and some context and stuff
0:22:09 like oh you know uh I'm gonna ignore
0:22:12 Neil So that Pendragon doesn't punch his
0:22:13 head off his shoulders but it was a
0:22:15 little bit more genuine than I think
0:22:16 anybody's talking about so I just if
0:22:19 anybody's gonna talk to Pendragon it's
0:22:20 uh
0:22:21 well it's not gonna be me and it's
0:22:24 definitely gonna be you wait does this
0:22:25 mean you were seen by Pendragon
0:22:28 I uh need
0:22:31 a minute to come up with an excuse and
0:22:34 Neil just stands up and walks into the
0:22:36 crowd
0:22:41 miles looks over Britta
0:22:43 you're welcome Brita does like a little
0:22:46 tiny knot
0:22:48 before I knew anything about
0:22:51 New York sire's plans
0:22:54 I mean Pence Pendragon had already just
0:22:57 offhand mentioned that he didn't
0:23:00 like archons or your Scio or
0:23:03 what was it um his plan for unification
0:23:09 true
0:23:11 but one he doesn't need to know it's my
0:23:13 size Planet Two he may relish the
0:23:16 opportunity as I've seen him do before
0:23:18 of going to battle and uh taking the
0:23:21 fight to the Sabbat
0:23:23 I am
0:23:25 if you can convince him to do that then
0:23:28 that's
0:23:29 I mean
0:23:31 we're hoping that maybe you can parlay
0:23:33 part of this conversation
0:23:35 I
0:23:38 don't think I can talk to him again that
0:23:41 the plan was to talk to him again wins
0:23:44 desperately minds her own business
0:23:47 when's had like a lot going on
0:23:50 emotionally up until this point does
0:23:53 this break through the inks or where are
0:23:55 you at
0:23:57 can't be upset too awkward
0:24:01 when
0:24:05 [Music]
0:24:08 Kyle oh she did but her face definitely
0:24:12 says that out loud and before she can
0:24:14 point it at the floor again
0:24:17 Frida you are a very skilled
0:24:20 diplomat I think
0:24:23 if anyone here is going to talk nice to
0:24:26 someone we aren't on overly friendly
0:24:28 terms with
0:24:30 I think you're our best shot
0:24:33 um
0:24:33 but if you think this would work better
0:24:36 because you know him
0:24:38 a little better than we do you if you
0:24:41 think you would respond better to miles
0:24:43 or another one of us that would also be
0:24:46 acceptable Johnny cracks a half smile if
0:24:50 you can get away with calling him Roman
0:24:51 Brita blushes and covers her face
0:24:54 something recent is a spark to that I
0:24:58 think that answers my question he's also
0:25:01 always responded well to other bruja and
0:25:03 if there's going to be a rave what is a
0:25:05 wraith a rave is a bruja Gathering
0:25:09 a little bit more formal than our usual
0:25:12 ones usual bruja Gathering is called the
0:25:16 rant
0:25:18 that's just bruja in the city at a rave
0:25:21 it's gonna be bruhoff in the whole area
0:25:23 and guests from outside the clan I've
0:25:26 come up with an excuse
0:25:28 um I mean reason I come up with a you
0:25:31 said not to get caught and I didn't get
0:25:33 caught Brita does jolt when Neil does
0:25:36 the Neil thing again of popping back in
0:25:38 he said don't get caught and I didn't
0:25:40 get caught I technically had an
0:25:41 invitation to the party that was the
0:25:42 whole point did you actually have an
0:25:43 invitation to the party yep went with
0:25:45 Fester no no that's not an invitation
0:25:47 that's going with somebody Fester was
0:25:49 invited he was working and he invited me
0:25:50 to come with him technically that's a
0:25:52 plus one technique for us the worker of
0:25:55 the party that's yeah that's the whole
0:25:56 point that's not how we're working a
0:25:58 party works you don't get to invite your
0:25:59 friends while you work the party he did
0:26:01 though he said it was fine and I was
0:26:03 dressed up that's why I asked you for
0:26:06 suit recommendations I understand what
0:26:07 you're doing I'm also giving you [ __ ] I
0:26:09 I just I want because I didn't
0:26:12 technically because I didn't get caught
0:26:14 I was supposed to be there technically
0:26:15 how close were you to Pendragon
0:26:18 uh I
0:26:20 kind of like touching distance seems
0:26:23 awfully close for being unobtrusive I
0:26:26 mean Britta was closer when raises an
0:26:28 eyebrow when he's just like touching
0:26:30 distance closer than touching this
0:26:32 closer than touching distance that does
0:26:35 remind me though I rescind any
0:26:37 implication that I think British should
0:26:39 go talk to Pendragon uh she should not
0:26:41 do that she should stay away from him
0:26:42 literally forever
0:26:45 well the rest of us have come to a
0:26:46 different agreement
0:26:48 it was it was Elsa's like literal Last
0:26:51 Wish before she died that I get her out
0:26:54 of there and away from Pendragon forever
0:26:57 and that party definitely is it seems
0:26:59 like a good idea you know it's just like
0:27:01 the the direct implication from Elsa was
0:27:03 that like pandragon was extremely
0:27:05 dangerously bad news and I needed to get
0:27:07 her away from him and back here with you
0:27:10 guys ASAP
0:27:11 like that she was going to distract
0:27:13 Pendragon to so I could get rid out away
0:27:17 from him so uh any plan that involves
0:27:19 Brita going back over there uh I am
0:27:22 against that's my
0:27:24 now I got my head on straight because I
0:27:25 had a minute to think Beretta looks
0:27:27 confused and conflicted and is kind of
0:27:30 just hiding a little bit from the
0:27:32 conversation but kind of forcing herself
0:27:34 not to completely cover herself away
0:27:38 that will most likely be up to pretty
0:27:41 we'll see what do you mean we'll see hmm
0:27:45 Neil just puts out of abused face and
0:27:48 does not just he's just hoping to ride
0:27:51 this one out what else do we need to be
0:27:54 filled in on what disciples does it take
0:27:56 to uh to ride a ghoul like you saw in
0:27:59 New York done it
0:28:01 dominate okay
0:28:02 that's it that's the one okay
0:28:05 hmm what else do we need to know about
0:28:08 this about coming or anything else I've
0:28:11 got a list of packs that means more to
0:28:13 your sire I think than it does to us
0:28:15 um but it's probably if each pack is
0:28:17 like five six people that it's probably
0:28:20 uh it's probably like 60 60 Sabbat
0:28:23 minimum
0:28:24 uh marching here coming here yeah I
0:28:27 gotcha uh when they're gonna come
0:28:30 soon it's gonna be soon a um other thing
0:28:34 we should probably talk about is the
0:28:35 rant coming up we're gonna talk to pen
0:28:38 Dragon we're needing to talk to
0:28:41 a lot of people there but more
0:28:43 importantly if we're going to do that we
0:28:45 need to get you all in
0:28:46 which means you need to be plus ones to
0:28:48 a bruja
0:28:50 I can just be a bird if that helps no I
0:28:53 feel like we should not sneak around
0:28:54 right if we're throwing a party it's a
0:28:57 you're from a a much better look if you
0:29:01 can be a plus one to a bruja can the
0:29:04 sheriff just March in you can but the
0:29:07 sheriff can also get their ass kicked by
0:29:09 a whole bunch of angry bruja if you're
0:29:11 crashing their party yes
0:29:13 um
0:29:14 so who through the brewhouse
0:29:16 um so Johnny obviously you just get to
0:29:18 go and bring somebody the centralized
0:29:22 well there's an Amaya might be might be
0:29:25 willing to offer their plus one uh Jane
0:29:29 has anybody heard from Jane I haven't I
0:29:31 haven't spoken to her but apparently
0:29:32 weather's got her out of the hot water
0:29:34 with uh the hunters okay I don't know if
0:29:38 she's
0:29:39 showing her face around City politics
0:29:42 but I can assume well
0:29:45 I'm hoping that she ends up coming to
0:29:48 The Rave if she does we might want to
0:29:51 talk to her about getting that plus one
0:29:54 well
0:29:55 no I can't do math still
0:29:58 we need we need three other bruja right
0:30:01 yeah so who who in the culture is gonna
0:30:04 have the easiest time getting a bruja
0:30:05 date any of us was that that's the yeah
0:30:09 we just have to court Johnny I feel like
0:30:12 well if weathers isn't bringing anyone
0:30:15 he might bring you when you might
0:30:18 Withers don't like you that's I'm very
0:30:21 likable yeah you can schmooza Maya since
0:30:24 you guys spend so much time in New York
0:30:25 I only remember about 30 of the time
0:30:28 that we spent you know in New York but I
0:30:30 I could I ask you yes or no questions
0:30:32 and you always go off on these long
0:30:34 because there's no they're just so hard
0:30:36 to answer yes or no to a question yes or
0:30:39 you say no I can talk to you I can ask
0:30:41 wait I'm sorry that was something
0:30:42 confusing though I mean you didn't
0:30:44 remember any of the things I mentioned
0:30:46 on the phone either or no I I don't I
0:30:50 don't I have a lot of missing time over
0:30:51 the last and how much of it is because
0:30:53 of my sire and how much of it is I don't
0:30:56 know I got a lot of missing time though
0:30:59 Amaya seemed to think that I showed up
0:31:01 and was like really confident and uh
0:31:04 well that should have told her right
0:31:05 away something was wrong I see that's
0:31:07 what I'm saying
0:31:09 um and was like I'm here to help and
0:31:11 this is what we're gonna do and we're
0:31:13 gonna fetch a book from New York and
0:31:15 what book uh this really old kind of
0:31:18 weird book uh from
0:31:21 this uh This Woman's Library who lives
0:31:23 in New York uh her name is Catherine and
0:31:26 um book title uh the ex Libras necro uh
0:31:29 Amaya needed it to give to William
0:31:31 Biltmore because he was going to give
0:31:34 them some the anarchs support against
0:31:36 the Sabbat Invasion and the set height
0:31:38 wins face kind of
0:31:41 she looks at Neil uh more than she's
0:31:44 looked at anyone for the most of this
0:31:45 conversation builtmore of Longbow yeah
0:31:49 my clan Elder
0:31:52 um that's the book that Giovanni have me
0:31:54 tracking down I was supposed to do it
0:31:56 with the
0:31:57 fella camping in the pool house what
0:32:01 long story we've got a Premiere staked
0:32:03 in the uh pool house oh God I mean
0:32:06 that's not much longer than the story
0:32:08 yeah so that's the story you gotta up
0:32:10 that fair enough I was supposed to work
0:32:13 with him to find this this book ex Libra
0:32:18 snecro uh Amaya has it and is about to
0:32:20 give it to operation Lobo for for like
0:32:23 money and guns and stuff support for the
0:32:26 anarchs in the area so that's who's
0:32:28 Biltmore
0:32:34 um yeah that Prince Pendragon brought me
0:32:36 to he was
0:32:39 you yeah some arcavian but he was
0:32:41 talking to a lot of my clan yeah
0:32:47 yeah Tori or seemed to like him for that
0:32:49 how hard do you think it would be to
0:32:50 steal from him
0:32:52 to steal something from another
0:32:53 Volcanion yep
0:32:56 no you
0:32:58 I mean that's an answer if you couldn't
0:33:00 steal a book for me you're not gonna be
0:33:01 able to steal a book from somebody else
0:33:03 I mean
0:33:05 who's older than me I meant was the
0:33:08 implication maybe it hasn't been passed
0:33:09 off yet well it might might still Pro I
0:33:11 mean we literally just dropped a mile
0:33:12 off like I think she's still here yeah
0:33:14 she's like still here I think so it was
0:33:16 just I'm gonna need to talk to her and I
0:33:19 don't think it's gonna be persuasive but
0:33:20 if we need money we can do money I don't
0:33:22 know I don't have too much in terms of
0:33:24 firearms besides what we're going to
0:33:25 need but
0:33:26 no I don't know I don't know what the
0:33:28 deal is between her I just know that I
0:33:30 went down to New York to help them get
0:33:33 it and part of the payment was me
0:33:35 stealing uh spying on the Sabbat no I
0:33:40 I need
0:33:41 that book why
0:33:44 what's up
0:33:46 very long and complicated story if we
0:33:49 want to do it here we can do it here but
0:33:51 this is
0:33:52 this is a big behind the speaker talk
0:33:56 okay
0:33:57 that's
0:33:58 yeah
0:34:00 um we should probably do that uh but
0:34:02 should we stay on Sabbat stuff first or
0:34:04 should we I don't know how any of this
0:34:06 works I don't know miles you're the
0:34:08 organized one we have been preparing for
0:34:10 it's about of his knee amount is new but
0:34:14 it doesn't overall change what we've
0:34:16 been doing in terms of preparation
0:34:19 other than that as we've stated before
0:34:21 the major thing is figuring out the mole
0:34:23 yeah
0:34:25 I can try and work on that
0:34:27 I think that is the most pressing thing
0:34:30 while
0:34:31 for now I both continue to seem
0:34:36 like I have the weakness that I have so
0:34:38 the princess stay interested in the area
0:34:40 as long as I keep doing that and being
0:34:43 kind of on a knife's edge
0:34:46 we can probably
0:34:48 keep them here how are we going to deal
0:34:52 with uh the idea of them like
0:34:56 failing for greater strength once it's
0:34:59 leaking that all this once it leaks that
0:35:01 this bottle roll here and rumors start
0:35:03 to fly that you are a Sabbat diablers
0:35:05 the infiltrator monster I mean there's
0:35:07 going to be a certain point where they
0:35:08 can't go anywhere most of them can't
0:35:10 travel safely without someone else did
0:35:12 they could go north
0:35:13 they to wear I was like without people
0:35:16 to get them there to pendragon's
0:35:18 territory I'm not sure any of them think
0:35:20 that that's a good idea what do you
0:35:21 think they could he could be a bulwark
0:35:22 if he starts showing strength against
0:35:24 this about is that as North as the
0:35:25 camarilla goes or no you could go
0:35:28 Northern we'll remind ourselves that
0:35:31 without Johnny getting anywhere was
0:35:33 would be pretty difficult for sure
0:35:35 absolutely I'm not gonna pretend it's
0:35:36 not and if there's some influence over
0:35:39 Transportation Systems we can definitely
0:35:42 slow down also for allied with Pendragon
0:35:44 there's a lot less places to go well if
0:35:46 we're Ally we're pin dragon that's a
0:35:47 move Point yeah right they don't have
0:35:49 anywhere else to go if they have a you
0:35:51 can stay here or you can go march on New
0:35:54 York those are the options those that
0:35:56 then they're gonna stay here right but
0:35:58 if it is fully leaked that they are here
0:36:00 literally just to be Grist for the mill
0:36:01 then that's you know they might risk you
0:36:04 keep using that terminology and I'm
0:36:06 gonna encourage that you stop because
0:36:08 saying that there were Grist for the
0:36:10 mill is going to be really bad for
0:36:11 morale well I'm not gonna I'm not the
0:36:13 morale guy Johnny yeah but it starts
0:36:16 with anybody so since considering the
0:36:18 fact that we're with war with Sabbat you
0:36:20 need to knock that [ __ ] off right quick
0:36:23 okay like hey you're right you're of
0:36:26 course you're right
0:36:27 yeah sorry
0:36:30 you're depending on how it is we
0:36:32 may do a lot better than we think but we
0:36:35 shall see
0:36:37 I don't wanna
0:36:39 stand in the way of the spot
0:36:41 for I mean for for for what our
0:36:45 existence stands in the way of the
0:36:47 Sabbat so
0:36:50 I think Brett and I are just maybe in a
0:36:53 position where having stood in the way
0:36:55 of of them crusading through
0:36:59 another princess territory and
0:37:02 supposedly Longbow who was the middle
0:37:04 section and everyone getting decimated
0:37:07 and seeing the Carnage we're not
0:37:09 I don't know maybe we're being
0:37:11 oversensitive but I don't want to be
0:37:13 naive to what's coming I mean
0:37:16 we're going to end up facing it one way
0:37:18 or another
0:37:19 he's right about that we're gonna have
0:37:21 to choose where that is our options with
0:37:23 this is either we flee the Northeast
0:37:26 completely
0:37:27 I have no idea where to go on that case
0:37:30 further north at this point to be fair
0:37:33 it seemed like that's where dark Selena
0:37:34 and her allies are so North might not
0:37:37 actually to Miles and Johnny's Point
0:37:40 helpful I'm pretty sure if we go to
0:37:42 Montreal that's another Sabbat holed out
0:37:45 the um
0:37:46 the other problem is
0:37:48 curing transport anywhere outside of the
0:37:51 Northeast is very [ __ ] difficult
0:37:54 I can do it
0:37:55 but it
0:37:57 I don't know how much I can transport
0:37:58 and to be perfectly honest I'm not
0:38:00 really sure where I would be headed you
0:38:03 know after six hours of driving
0:38:04 everything starts getting real dicey
0:38:06 real quick beyond that everything that I
0:38:08 care about is here in the Northeast so
0:38:12 even if I were to run
0:38:14 I would just be abandoning anything that
0:38:16 I actually cared about
0:38:18 that's
0:38:19 that's a fair Point yeah we're not so
0:38:23 there's nowhere to go our options are
0:38:25 stop the Sabbat
0:38:27 or die
0:38:29 well in positive news there's less
0:38:30 strong than they were even when they
0:38:32 attacked the gala and there is a plan
0:38:35 even if it is
0:38:38 tactically difficult to pull off
0:38:41 where we do stop the Sabbat
0:38:44 and we shatter their morale we take out
0:38:47 the cardinal
0:38:49 and perhaps
0:38:51 live long enough to deal with all the
0:38:54 problems we've caused to get there
0:38:57 produce us why yeah why would they be
0:38:59 weaker now the Schism of the children of
0:39:02 Hakeem
0:39:03 apparently uh the black hand they're
0:39:07 they're black hand is um
0:39:12 primarily made up of most of the
0:39:14 Warriors of
0:39:16 the children of Hakeem the uh but when
0:39:19 The Herald woke he called everyone back
0:39:23 to the old lays and every yeah Warrior
0:39:27 who was bolstering the numbers of
0:39:31 the black hand just bailed abandoned
0:39:34 them completely and returned to ultimate
0:39:37 that's why they haven't been attacking
0:39:39 us yet it's why they slowed a little bit
0:39:41 their momentum I do wonder when that's
0:39:43 going to be a bigger problem than it is
0:39:45 now
0:39:46 it's it's a huge problem hasn't gotten
0:39:50 here yet but well I think it has we have
0:39:53 a lot of assimites in the city you've
0:39:54 got refugees here in the city right and
0:39:57 on the one hand you know the assassins
0:40:00 from the web of knives that were coming
0:40:01 after us
0:40:03 yes
0:40:04 um
0:40:05 on the positive side not a natural born
0:40:09 asomite
0:40:11 um negative side it's my it's my side
0:40:15 the whole time every time the the woman
0:40:16 the man in the subway the all of them
0:40:18 that's my sir he's coming for
0:40:20 us well me so it's been
0:40:25 yeah uh brother you know when when the
0:40:27 bruja were like oh it's probably the
0:40:29 bike house in the sky is spying on
0:40:30 Pendragon it was not your sire coming to
0:40:34 try to get you to uh diablerize all of
0:40:38 you yeah yeah and that's why you let
0:40:42 fests are on fire he got inside my head
0:40:46 back before the trial he visited me
0:40:49 apparently
0:40:51 got in my head and
0:40:53 when the time was right the right thing
0:40:55 was said the right circumstances
0:40:57 happened and
0:40:59 I was not in control of my actions
0:41:02 dominate is
0:41:04 a hell of a thing
0:41:06 yeah miles not to that so
0:41:09 that's a whole thing I haven't processed
0:41:11 yet I've been a little
0:41:13 it's not easy to process he um
0:41:17 he tore uh the the bruja guard uh
0:41:20 pendragon's personal guard and left her
0:41:23 uh unconscious in the shower for me to
0:41:24 eat does it look like you did that
0:41:27 uh Neil's face Falls like well [ __ ]
0:41:31 probably I'm sure he's going to believe
0:41:33 that it was your sire all along
0:41:35 what um
0:41:39 pulled away by the
0:41:40 tamahara and I started acting strangely
0:41:43 all of a sudden and
0:41:45 you know um tried to hit
0:41:48 Pendragon with a coffee machine and then
0:41:50 I ran off and I when I left that's when
0:41:54 please don't laugh at me right now I'm
0:41:56 sorry I'm just enjoying the picture I'm
0:41:58 sorry yeah that yeah I love that move
0:42:01 for you
0:42:03 to defend brother here uh if again like
0:42:06 against the teasing for the second it
0:42:08 does suck to not be in control of your
0:42:10 own actions I I don't think it was
0:42:12 teasing it wasn't there was no pure
0:42:14 enjoyment it was well they were enjoying
0:42:17 yeah of Pandora
0:42:21 I see where the like
0:42:23 what I'm saying is that I'm I don't know
0:42:25 if it looks like you tore her at a guard
0:42:27 and then I left after getting weird I
0:42:31 don't know because I went into another
0:42:33 room and hid under the bed before the
0:42:35 sun came up and then that's the last
0:42:38 thing I remember until I woke up in New
0:42:39 York so I don't know I will say this
0:42:42 this entire past week has been a [ __ ]
0:42:45 utter [ __ ] show
0:42:47 I don't think that has been lost on
0:42:51 Prince Pendragon
0:42:53 so I think if there was ever going to be
0:42:57 a time he would find it within himself
0:43:00 to be forgiving for things that he might
0:43:02 otherwise not
0:43:04 this is the week that he would I tried
0:43:07 the apology thing and it didn't work out
0:43:10 okay so I don't see that
0:43:13 you try you already talked to him again
0:43:15 yeah and it didn't work he didn't he
0:43:18 didn't want to talk to you or he didn't
0:43:19 accept your apology
0:43:21 didn't work out moving right along
0:43:23 yeah it feels like there's a lot more
0:43:24 there but I'm gonna let it go
0:43:26 okay like sure
0:43:32 what else do we need to talk about
0:43:36 um
0:43:38 we need allies I
0:43:41 sent a message a while ago okay well
0:43:44 sounds like we've got asomites in the
0:43:47 city who are willing to be our allies
0:43:49 we need to make inroads with Prince
0:43:53 Pendragon to make sure that his army is
0:43:55 willing to cooperate with us
0:43:58 sounds like you also need to go have
0:44:00 some meetings with the settites that's
0:44:03 true and maybe repair some of those
0:44:06 bridges that have almost burned down I
0:44:08 mean if we're reaching out to like
0:44:09 Pendragon and stuff but you know is it
0:44:12 really that different oh they came to
0:44:13 apologize to me
0:44:14 the like understanding of talking to the
0:44:17 sides vanishes from Neil's face and he's
0:44:19 like wait they did why what do they say
0:44:21 what do they do they gave me a cool
0:44:22 magic pendant and said they were sorry
0:44:24 that feels suspicious oh totally but
0:44:27 like a pendant like they were using in
0:44:29 the back of the car when you first found
0:44:31 me in New Haven no no they told me it
0:44:33 made me an awesome swordsman so
0:44:36 that feels insulting better swordsman I
0:44:39 think it was not insulting when they
0:44:40 said it okay just leave it okay I'll
0:44:42 take your word for it
0:44:44 I don't know should one of us like look
0:44:46 at it yeah somebody should look at it
0:44:48 before I don't even know what that would
0:44:50 be great I can give it a look I guess I
0:44:52 didn't bring it with me today
0:44:53 not hauling around magic pendants with
0:44:56 me everywhere me and Brett have also
0:44:58 talked about her working with the
0:44:59 torador and also
0:45:02 to start
0:45:03 generally influence generally improving
0:45:06 the morale of the sitting they were
0:45:08 really they did seem really open to
0:45:11 training and getting ready even if
0:45:14 even if Vettel was trying to draw
0:45:17 boundaries between us this guy's name
0:45:20 keeps coming up he's everywhere
0:45:24 something else that we check oh yes
0:45:26 please everything I mean all the new
0:45:28 princes and the towel and
0:45:31 especially Vettel I just mean if we're
0:45:35 looking for a mole the new people should
0:45:37 be for some Bliss yeah I'll go through
0:45:40 everybody but I'll start with the guy
0:45:42 miles has a grudge on yeah I'm not even
0:45:44 talking about him as a mole I just want
0:45:45 to know everything about him
0:45:48 this is just getting personal
0:45:50 he seems to want to pretend to be close
0:45:53 to you yes that's the pretend to be is
0:45:56 the problem but I mean doesn't that give
0:45:58 you an end no because he's just gonna
0:46:00 sit there and needle me the whole time
0:46:03 okay so I'll look into vital
0:46:06 um that's we can that's we can end up
0:46:08 fighting him that's what's going to
0:46:09 happen
0:46:10 um
0:46:11 yeah so that's
0:46:14 what what we got I guess right is there
0:46:18 other allies that we got to look for any
0:46:20 any thoughts I mean that's kind of
0:46:22 everybody right well with animals
0:46:25 Amaya I'm imagining is the one probably
0:46:27 rallying all the rest of the anarchs
0:46:29 together
0:46:29 I can't think we can count on them
0:46:32 unless we kind of screw them over with
0:46:35 their book situation but that I trust
0:46:38 you to figure out how to deal with that
0:46:40 because manga long Longbow is already
0:46:42 getting them sort of in debtsies or at
0:46:45 least in yeah in bed so secondary it
0:46:49 also depends on where we sit with the
0:46:50 sedites I mean me and them don't usually
0:46:53 get along well so that's usually not
0:46:54 usually a problem yeah but they are in
0:46:58 opposite to the anarchs last time I
0:47:00 checked it doesn't sound like they they
0:47:02 were trying to exterminate the energy
0:47:03 that was where I think it was a matter
0:47:06 of uh territory expansion not
0:47:09 necessarily the fact that they are
0:47:12 ideologically opposed I was really
0:47:14 serious about a new blood uh like a new
0:47:17 a new um ordeal
0:47:20 no
0:47:22 well I don't know
0:47:25 okay okay I don't know miles I don't
0:47:28 know look I might mess with you time but
0:47:30 I'm not gonna go send you out there to
0:47:31 do terrible things
0:47:33 okay I'm just gonna ask you to do
0:47:36 Terrible Things occasionally
0:47:38 yeah I mean you have a choice yeah
0:47:43 so
0:47:44 a while back
0:47:47 feels like a longer time than I think it
0:47:49 actually was
0:47:50 um
0:47:51 ambrogino Giovanni brought me in on the
0:47:55 the project he's working on
0:47:58 with the premiere
0:48:01 and other
0:48:04 blood sorcerers
0:48:07 basically they're looking for a way to
0:48:11 outwit the apocalypse and regain
0:48:15 Humanity
0:48:16 like become human again
0:48:20 like
0:48:21 permanently
0:48:23 yeah
0:48:24 that was the impression
0:48:26 he gave me it's insane is it working
0:48:30 I don't know
0:48:32 I haven't been brought into
0:48:35 the inner workings of it yet I haven't
0:48:38 met everyone involved
0:48:40 but I asked about it because
0:48:43 Joey's a kid
0:48:44 he doesn't
0:48:48 he doesn't deserve to spend
0:48:51 whatever time he has in the shadow lands
0:48:54 he deserves
0:48:55 the course of a human soul
0:48:57 wait
0:48:59 I thought it would this just to turn
0:49:01 vampires back into people
0:49:03 it would no it wouldn't
0:49:07 it wouldn't do anything for Joey but it
0:49:09 is a thing that Amber Gina was willing
0:49:13 to do in exchange for my help
0:49:16 why does it need your help what what's
0:49:19 I mean he's
0:49:21 I'm in the camarilla
0:49:23 and you've got your eyes and I
0:49:27 he's not a medium
0:49:29 he's a necromancer I'm both
0:49:31 Neil mods like oh yeah that absolutely
0:49:34 makes sense to him
0:49:36 um
0:49:37 there are advantages I have that he
0:49:39 doesn't
0:49:41 and I just I
0:49:43 if this is gonna be my end defending
0:49:45 this [ __ ] City
0:49:49 then so be it but I want to go out on
0:49:52 terms
0:49:53 that at least one of the dead people in
0:49:55 that I'm leaving behind is going on to
0:49:57 is something better
0:49:59 so
0:50:01 you need this book because Amber Gino
0:50:03 wants it as part of this ritual thing
0:50:06 yeah it's not the only book he needs
0:50:10 but
0:50:12 but that's one of them Raven was going
0:50:14 after that book and so is it rubella the
0:50:17 ER codex
0:50:20 that's a different
0:50:21 okay yeah a lot of Magic books are I'm
0:50:25 needed for him should have been a
0:50:26 librarian are they connected or
0:50:30 I have no reason to suspect they are but
0:50:33 it wouldn't surprise me if they are
0:50:35 I mean it just seems like a lot of Magic
0:50:37 books
0:50:38 can I make an occult role yes you may
0:50:41 your difficulty is eight does my spec
0:50:44 and necromancy count it does not okay
0:50:50 one success
0:50:52 with one success you know that the error
0:50:54 code X is a tome
0:50:56 uh which is like a specific term in
0:51:00 portions of the supernatural Community
0:51:02 uh these things are do draw
0:51:06 from a lot of the same circles
0:51:09 and it is very likely that if the tomes
0:51:12 you're looking for are somewhere in New
0:51:15 England
0:51:16 it's very likely the people involved
0:51:18 with the co-ed at the UR codex know
0:51:21 about it
0:51:22 it was never explicitly stated they had
0:51:25 everything they had anything to do with
0:51:26 one another but
0:51:28 these things have a way of drawing them
0:51:31 closer
0:51:33 like they they're not I I don't even
0:51:36 know how to describe them I would say
0:51:38 that there's a sort of intelligence and
0:51:40 how they turn up the places that they
0:51:42 turn up
0:51:44 so I would suspect if people
0:51:48 searching for the r codex might be
0:51:52 in the know where these things are as
0:51:53 well
0:51:54 that being said the only two people I
0:51:56 know who were looking for the ER codex
0:51:59 were Arabella and Raven
0:52:02 and Raven's a demon now and Arabella
0:52:05 mate deals with them or something yeah
0:52:08 she she wielded
0:52:12 dark Thelma turkeys ones that
0:52:14 you know not to go way back to the
0:52:16 beginning of this conversation but do
0:52:17 stay in the soul and uh leave a visible
0:52:20 Mark she tracks with demons
0:52:23 yeah the the worst the worst of the
0:52:26 worst kind of stuff
0:52:29 so
0:52:32 so that's where we're at
0:52:35 I
0:52:37 I just want Joey to be safe
0:52:39 but if the domain goes to [ __ ]
0:52:43 he won't be
0:52:45 well at least um
0:52:47 at least we got some places to start
0:52:50 right we got some actions to do
0:52:54 um
0:52:57 kind of low on the list of important
0:53:00 stuff but I don't
0:53:01 my Haven last night was here was
0:53:03 destroyed I I everything was wrecked it
0:53:06 lost everything I don't know where to
0:53:07 stay is there like a safe house or
0:53:09 something until I've
0:53:11 can get back on my feet the safest house
0:53:15 where's that what's the safest house uh
0:53:18 we have a new place where everyone has
0:53:20 been staying
0:53:21 miles very own New Haven
0:53:24 can I
0:53:26 can I stay there too then
0:53:28 yes okay um
0:53:31 uh do you want some help kinda maybe
0:53:34 claiming it protecting it is that
0:53:37 is that a thing do you want me to
0:53:39 currently secret but if there's things
0:53:41 you can do to improve it that'd be great
0:53:42 well without doing a whole lot yeah I
0:53:45 can
0:53:45 Jordan get my hands on some holy relics
0:53:47 what no not offhand churches
0:53:51 yeah
0:53:54 ones that make sense to me though
0:53:56 I'll look into it I don't know what that
0:53:59 means especially like a Miles Davis
0:54:00 album depends on how much you like Miles
0:54:02 Davis
0:54:03 well anyways yeah I can I'll do the
0:54:06 that's fine no problem great
0:54:09 yeah there's I feel like you might have
0:54:14 insight into this but correct me if I'm
0:54:16 wrong
0:54:18 one of the other important books I'm
0:54:20 supposed to be looking for
0:54:22 is the ritual of the red sign
0:54:26 uh
0:54:27 okay you were fixated on the red stars I
0:54:30 wasn't sure if it was related
0:54:32 I mean the red star is known by a lot of
0:54:35 names I've been reading a lot of um
0:54:39 I guess it's okay to talk about stuff
0:54:40 I've been reading a lot of those modest
0:54:41 things that we took off of Sean them
0:54:44 isn't the red star known to be a sign of
0:54:48 Gahanna yes so the ritual of the sign of
0:54:51 gehenna
0:54:53 life's hot now I can't [ __ ] believe
0:54:55 this Johnny it's outside yeah you can
0:54:57 see it I know and I can't [ __ ]
0:54:59 believe this is where my life said now
0:55:01 yeah I don't think any of us wanted to
0:55:03 be here but I've been doing a lot of
0:55:05 it's just fragments but I've been doing
0:55:07 a lot of reading and well you know we'll
0:55:09 we'll see are you able to translate them
0:55:12 it's hard work
0:55:13 I don't always get it but you also might
0:55:17 need to meet somebody
0:55:18 hmm oh yeah what are we talking about
0:55:22 probably not here at all not even
0:55:25 you later we'll talk about it at the
0:55:28 Haven Neil looks totally confused we
0:55:32 dare not say anything else
0:55:37 I'm gone for a week and you guys
0:55:39 everything goes to hell we fought a
0:55:42 dragon
0:55:43 yeah you keep saying that and I just I
0:55:45 was inside it
0:55:47 it swallowed me just to be very clear
0:55:55 you know not it was kind of this wasn't
0:55:57 funny
0:56:01 oh you're starting to freak me out man
0:56:03 what's going on
0:56:07 Johnny reaches out and grabs in my lapel
0:56:11 the moment you touch him he
0:56:13 collapses
0:56:15 Scoops him up
0:56:17 [Music]
0:56:19 Neil
0:56:23 you're back in New York it's night time
0:56:26 there are fires in the city
0:56:28 and you hear a sound that you wouldn't
0:56:31 expect to normally hear in New York you
0:56:33 hear the sounds of clashing swords
0:56:37 you see two canines standing beside one
0:56:41 another the first you recognize to be
0:56:43 Polonia who has a sword in hand and is
0:56:46 fighting against camera insurgents
0:56:49 individuals you recognize to be bruja
0:56:52 wearing the uniforms common to Roman
0:56:54 pendragon's army
0:56:56 among these camera like Kindred is John
0:56:59 Peterson
0:57:00 Johnny Saxon
0:57:02 win
0:57:04 and you
0:57:07 next to Polonia
0:57:10 there is
0:57:12 a mitsi figure
0:57:14 who sinks into the Earth and Rises up so
0:57:18 slashing with a sword and slaying
0:57:21 Kindred with single blows
0:57:24 and you recognize him to be a lambach
0:57:27 Ruthven
0:57:28 and the two of them fight valiantly
0:57:32 against the camera
0:57:34 you sort of admire their courage in the
0:57:37 moment as though your perspective isn't
0:57:39 even that of
0:57:40 yourself or even a member of the camera
0:57:43 and that's when you notice it
0:57:46 starts with car alarms
0:57:50 the ground shakes lights flicker
0:57:54 something
0:57:56 Rises a dragon
0:57:59 Rises
0:58:04 later that night after
0:58:08 the events and discussions at the Royale
0:58:12 win is
0:58:14 almost seems to look for an excuse to
0:58:16 not go in the house
0:58:18 so she goes and
0:58:20 sits by the back of the house that faces
0:58:23 the woods and she just kind of
0:58:26 sits against the side of the house
0:58:30 she looks up to the stars because
0:58:33 there's not a whole lot else to look at
0:58:34 but
0:58:35 she looks at the trees
0:58:38 kind of kicks off whatever shoes she'd
0:58:41 put on for the day the shoes to sure
0:58:44 lets her toes run through the grass and
0:58:47 plays with handfuls of it not tearing
0:58:50 them out of the ground just letting them
0:58:51 run over her hands
0:58:53 a little while after that miles will
0:58:56 come out
0:58:57 making enough noise to make sure that
0:58:59 she hears him coming
0:59:00 and approaches where she's sitting
0:59:04 Neil's doing okay he seems to gotten a
0:59:07 hold of himself
0:59:09 that's good you put him in his room he
0:59:11 kinda
0:59:12 looks like he just needs some rest
0:59:14 probably I think we all could use some
0:59:17 I don't know how much we're gonna get so
0:59:19 we might as well
0:59:21 the dirt makes a nicer bed than you'd
0:59:24 think
0:59:25 it's a different sort of thing
0:59:27 never been much for the camping life
0:59:30 I do recall leading you out of the woods
0:59:36 sir
0:59:37 anyway out of these Woods
0:59:41 Lynn sighs very heavily and kind of just
0:59:44 like puts her head in her hands
0:59:48 nature reports a vacuum so
0:59:51 yeah things aren't gonna
0:59:54 be terrible forever there's always
0:59:55 somewhere to go
0:59:59 why didn't you tell me
1:00:01 that that was on the cards
1:00:04 it didn't occur to me really it was
1:00:08 were there all the other dealings we'd
1:00:10 ever done I didn't think it was such
1:00:14 such an uncrossable line
1:00:18 for you
1:00:21 why do you think that
1:00:24 because of the people we've had to deal
1:00:26 with that
1:00:27 do bad things to souls all the time
1:00:32 okay
1:00:34 and if I knew it was such a deal with
1:00:37 you
1:00:38 I don't know if I've gotten through with
1:00:41 it
1:00:43 I
1:00:44 probably should have asked I haven't
1:00:46 done a lot of Praxis
1:00:49 whatever you want to call this
1:00:52 all right
1:00:54 it didn't seem like something you would
1:00:56 do
1:00:57 it's not something I wanted to do but
1:01:01 our situation didn't leave me in a
1:01:03 different state if it was me just taking
1:01:05 rolands out
1:01:07 and taking over the city
1:01:09 I never would have needed to do it
1:01:12 but 13 princes coming from the Eastern
1:01:15 seaboard
1:01:17 I don't
1:01:19 I don't see how Roland's blood
1:01:22 is gonna help you with that it's not his
1:01:25 blood precise the strength that was
1:01:26 there
1:01:27 it keeps me from being dominated by
1:01:29 older Elders or at least at the same
1:01:31 level
1:01:32 keeps them from trying to dominate you
1:01:35 that's a big difference
1:01:37 it also even when that knowledge becomes
1:01:39 out there it makes them unsure it makes
1:01:41 them not know how far they need to be
1:01:46 these are not
1:01:48 Fighters for the most part
1:01:50 and if they are unsure they will not
1:01:53 strike
1:01:54 we didn't kind of takes that in for a
1:01:57 second
1:01:59 I have seen
1:02:01 ghosts spirits
1:02:03 since I was about three years old
1:02:07 and they were always just more people
1:02:10 to me
1:02:11 and they they may not have been like
1:02:13 people but they were
1:02:15 they had a spark they had life
1:02:18 in a more classical sense
1:02:22 and some of them were bad and some of
1:02:25 them were good and
1:02:27 some of them were completely unknowable
1:02:30 and then
1:02:31 the ghosts especially their
1:02:34 I have to believe
1:02:36 that as long as a soul is alive
1:02:39 it can go back to a cycle of rebirth and
1:02:43 continuation and entropy
1:02:46 and I have to believe that for a lot of
1:02:49 reasons
1:02:50 I have to believe there's a chance for
1:02:52 Redemption even for Monsters but there's
1:02:53 no chance of redeeming something that's
1:02:55 completely erased I don't know about any
1:02:58 of that I know
1:03:00 what I do know is I don't have
1:03:04 a lot left
1:03:06 and that worries me and it is just
1:03:10 you guys
1:03:12 and everything I've ever heard and
1:03:14 everything that's ever been told to me
1:03:16 from the demon from everyone else is
1:03:18 we're already Damned
1:03:20 so I will risk it all
1:03:22 to give us an ounce
1:03:24 some Iota to protect us all
1:03:27 to give us a fighting chance
1:03:29 I took it as a shield
1:03:32 I couldn't always give other people
1:03:35 and they have died
1:03:40 I don't believe
1:03:42 that anything shy of Destruction is
1:03:45 final
1:03:46 and I don't know that anyone has the
1:03:49 word on what is
1:03:51 I think we both
1:03:52 had people we couldn't save
1:03:55 and now we're getting a little desperate
1:03:57 to
1:03:59 to try and undo that in some fashion
1:04:03 maybe but
1:04:06 that is why
1:04:08 it's why on my end too
1:04:10 this may come as a shock to you but I
1:04:13 don't have a whole lot left either
1:04:16 and I think
1:04:18 it was hard knowing that I've known you
1:04:21 for so long
1:04:23 and didn't see this as something you
1:04:27 would consider
1:04:29 and it's
1:04:31 on me for being closed off of in very
1:04:35 strange places
1:04:37 not that you're ever supposed to talk
1:04:39 religion with people but I'm not
1:04:42 particularly religious minded so that
1:04:43 might make it even more difficult I
1:04:45 don't really have a
1:04:47 Dogma beyond what I could see so you
1:04:49 could say I don't really have a lot of
1:04:50 faith you see a lot more though yeah
1:04:54 so I'll do
1:04:56 I will keep you informed before any Act
1:05:00 I will just try to keep everyone more
1:05:02 informed it's I think
1:05:05 thank you I think that's the best I can
1:05:08 do at this point
1:05:10 just to be clear miles
1:05:13 I never wanted or expected an apology
1:05:16 one because that's just that's not your
1:05:19 style very true into
1:05:23 I don't know
1:05:24 maybe I just
1:05:26 maybe I just didn't like hearing it from
1:05:28 someone not you
1:05:29 that would not have been the way I would
1:05:31 have brokered it but surprise it is Neil
1:05:34 we should expect that my unexpected
1:05:37 neolis
1:05:38 sort of what we expect at this point
1:05:41 yeah I'm gonna have to give him some
1:05:42 sort of heinous task I don't know like
1:05:44 cleaning something I did he see Eden on
1:05:46 the way in no no
1:05:48 tomorrow night problem well it's rather
1:05:50 late so I believe she's asleep there's
1:05:53 no reason to make that worse she
1:05:55 probably leave a note for Eden though
1:05:56 she doesn't poke around the house during
1:05:58 the day and the ghouls yeah that's fine
1:06:00 I know
1:06:01 um
1:06:02 what are we gonna do about IRA
1:06:05 well first we move them into the
1:06:07 basement before anything unfortunate
1:06:09 happens
1:06:10 and then I don't know
1:06:13 he put us in a position that I'm not
1:06:16 completely sure what to do with them
1:06:18 I mean we've got that number just leave
1:06:20 them somewhere I'm not giving it back to
1:06:22 the premiere it's pretty much one of my
1:06:25 general Stakes to never give tremeer
1:06:27 anything ever
1:06:29 hard agree we'll talk to everyone else
1:06:32 tomorrow maybe we can come up with a
1:06:33 better thought
1:06:34 but
1:06:35 mainly I just wanted to know there is
1:06:37 some way out of this Forest
1:06:40 you know I'm terrible here
