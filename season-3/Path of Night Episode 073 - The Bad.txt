0:00:29 [Music]
0:00:36 last time on path of night
0:00:39 Britta bumped into A-Dog's C-Dog and
0:00:42 the leader of their Sabbat Pack wufio
0:00:44 Johnny scared them off and Britta raised
0:00:46 Johnny's social profile with a
0:00:48 calculated dance
0:00:50 Neil and Jane smoke together while miles
0:00:52 received a pin from Amaya in public The
0:00:56 Ventrue evaded a game of pin the tail on
0:00:58 the prince but in private miles admitted
0:01:01 his sins to Amaya that she agreed on
0:01:03 Mutual political support
0:01:05 British discovered Eden and sneaked into
0:01:07 the Rave and she and Johnny discussed
0:01:10 how to handle the dumb Fierce presence
0:01:12 they decided to gather the quotery
0:01:14 finalize their plans for the reef
0:01:16 [Music]
0:01:28 Neil
0:01:29 you're on the roof
0:01:31 enjoying the stars with your fellow well
0:01:35 with your comrades
0:01:38 colleagues right now we're just all
0:01:41 cosmonauts on a journey
0:01:44 Jane who is also at this point very high
0:01:48 and very drunk pushes you onto your back
0:01:52 it is a little jarring the ease with
0:01:56 which she does it
0:01:58 like you know what I mean like it's it's
0:02:00 like you're being shoved down onto your
0:02:02 back by like a forklift like there's no
0:02:05 give when she does it and she straddles
0:02:08 over you smoking
0:02:10 and she inhales
0:02:12 deeply from what she's smoking
0:02:16 and
0:02:17 if she takes you by your horrible
0:02:20 scraggly hair and pulls you into what
0:02:24 starts like a kiss but she exhales a lot
0:02:29 of smoke into your lungs
0:02:32 and it's right around then
0:02:34 that you see the rooftop accessed or
0:02:38 open
0:02:39 and Johnny comes out
0:02:41 right out the like corner of your eyes
0:02:43 as you reopen your eyes
0:02:45 Neil is Frozen in that way that a
0:02:50 completely socially anxious individual
0:02:53 is Frozen when things are happening that
0:02:57 he's he doesn't even know if he wants or
0:02:58 not he's just completely like unaware of
0:03:01 his surroundings and so just plays
0:03:03 possum as he inhales the smoke and then
0:03:06 turns his head over to the corner was
0:03:09 like when he sees Johnny out of the
0:03:11 corner of his eyes as any sort of like
0:03:13 sensory input to ground himself as oh ah
0:03:18 breathes out a bunch of smoke
0:03:20 that was just pushed into his mouth
0:03:22 because
0:03:24 hey Johnny
0:03:26 are you kids playing kiss spin the
0:03:28 bottle uh
0:03:32 not getting bailed out by a change of
0:03:34 topic by Johnny he just looks back at
0:03:37 Jane and then looks over at Johnny she
0:03:39 just looks at you waiting for you to
0:03:40 answer Johnny's question
0:03:42 I um where I was I was looking at I was
0:03:45 looking at the stars
0:03:46 um
0:03:49 Jane is still way stronger than him size
0:03:51 he's like being held by the shirt at
0:03:53 this point kind of like half off the
0:03:54 ground ah she lets you go but it's just
0:03:57 kind of straddling on your hips and
0:04:00 there's just
0:04:01 No Escape just classic star gaze and
0:04:04 stuff
0:04:06 um she looks over at Johnny I'm Stars
0:04:09 I can see that be careful now Jane rumor
0:04:13 has it this one's got NASA my girlfriend
0:04:15 I don't think they take too kindly to
0:04:18 this kind of stuff I uh yeah that's I
0:04:22 um you have a girlfriend yeah I haven't
0:04:24 seen her in a long time but yes I do
0:04:26 Johnny bringing Nora up like gives Neil
0:04:29 permission in his own brain to be like I
0:04:31 yeah um we we had been through we've
0:04:35 been through a lot together she's she's
0:04:37 in the city now I think I haven't
0:04:39 seen her yet I I've been
0:04:42 with me she laughs and gets up and Neil
0:04:47 doesn't say anything he doesn't like
0:04:48 know what to say he's very confused in a
0:04:52 lot of ways you uh are you all with it
0:04:55 right now
0:04:56 oh yeah I'm barely touching me follow
0:04:59 the finger he kind of like has his
0:05:02 finger go back and forth a little bit
0:05:03 Neil follows it Johnny take some puts
0:05:06 his hand down in front of Neo in a
0:05:08 motion of help you up he goes to type a
0:05:10 hand Johnny hoists him up with these
0:05:13 just sort of gangles his way up to his
0:05:15 feet I want to do a little code reading
0:05:18 before we get this uh the main event
0:05:20 underway
0:05:22 probably uh probably a good idea I don't
0:05:24 really we should probably check in
0:05:27 um you smoke all these Brew hop
0:05:29 yeah
0:05:32 Johnny kind of looks impressed Jane said
0:05:35 um the your Clan has a sort of a history
0:05:39 with Khalif and you know I had a little
0:05:42 bit Dewey
0:05:44 she looks at her wrist as though there's
0:05:47 a watch there she's like yeah like three
0:05:49 hours of it
0:05:52 impressive history right there oh I
0:05:54 thought this one it doesn't matter I
0:05:57 guess it I guess it's irrelevant we had
0:05:59 a nice time the bruh all laugh
0:06:01 uproariously like like you're a really
0:06:04 funny dude
0:06:07 oh we had a nice time it was a nice yeah
0:06:10 I I don't know if we have any left I
0:06:13 don't know if you want any but I'm good
0:06:14 I think I should probably stay a little
0:06:16 bit more on edge yeah yeah I get that
0:06:19 come on bird is grabbing the other two
0:06:20 let's meet up real quick I think things
0:06:22 are going pretty well and I don't want
0:06:25 to let this just continue on until a
0:06:28 fight breaks out I'd rather get it get
0:06:30 this in before that happens that's
0:06:32 probably a good idea he looks over at
0:06:34 Jane hey um
0:06:36 thanks for
0:06:38 you know
0:06:39 all of this
0:06:41 and he actually waves it sort of like
0:06:43 the whole pile on the rift like the
0:06:44 whole he's very clearly not talking
0:06:46 about the last 30 seconds although it's
0:06:48 probably part of it he's talking about
0:06:50 the whole like he is aware of what she
0:06:52 did having everybody come up here and do
0:06:55 this for him it kind of gave you a wave
0:06:59 and they're like you're all done man uh
0:07:03 for now
0:07:08 ready you arrive outside and you see
0:07:11 when miles and their dates all of them
0:07:16 participating in a circle of about 15
0:07:18 people
0:07:19 in this circle I really want to smoking
0:07:22 some of them have drinks and it looks
0:07:25 like there's just kind of a like nice
0:07:27 chat going on as you approach you kind
0:07:32 of hear that some of these Brujah are
0:07:34 talking about how Bill Clinton played
0:07:38 the saxophone and smoked weed and that's
0:07:42 what made him a better president and
0:07:45 they're obviously like not super serious
0:07:49 but like have extremely serious tones
0:07:52 while they explain it
0:07:54 and as they go back and forth talking
0:07:57 about whether or not he absolutely
0:07:58 sucked or was definitely the man you see
0:08:02 the people you're looking for Britta
0:08:05 comfortably slings in to the
0:08:07 conversation and makes eye contact with
0:08:10 her code remates I was hoping I could
0:08:12 steal you too for a bit yeah this this
0:08:14 game of [ __ ] Mary kill has gotten
0:08:16 completely off the rails and gone
0:08:17 political so yeah I'm out it always does
0:08:21 one of them says to you it always does
0:08:24 Doing It Wrong Britta giggles and extends
0:08:28 a hand to when when will reach out and
0:08:30 take it she'll kind of like give
0:08:32 weathers an affectionate nudge with her
0:08:35 hip as they leave the circle
0:08:37 he smiles at you and just as he does you
0:08:41 hear the clunking noise of boots on the
0:08:46 hood of a car
0:08:47 and when you turn you see a very
0:08:52 European looking Kabir who's wearing
0:08:57 very tight pants
0:08:59 a leather jacket and a very long scarf
0:09:02 wow his hair is a mess his earrings have
0:09:07 all of these like dangly bits on chains
0:09:11 and you know he saw the hip bump
0:09:15 because For the first time in a long
0:09:19 time
0:09:19 he's not staring at you
0:09:23 he's staring at your date when just kind
0:09:26 of quietly under her breath the
0:09:27 expression on her face oddly Remains the
0:09:30 Same just all for [ __ ] sake
0:09:33 brother kind of having wind in one hand
0:09:37 and looking to the situation can I have
0:09:40 a minute can we can we wait one minute
0:09:42 oh
0:09:43 um for sure and Britta kind of Trades
0:09:47 back places with win and goes over to
0:09:51 weathers to kind of nudge him with her
0:09:54 shoulder like it's a thing the Coterie
0:09:56 does
0:09:57 what are you doing
0:10:00 she sends him a bright smile to convince
0:10:02 him to go along with it he looks over at
0:10:04 your ear the [ __ ] you staring at
0:10:07 [Laughter]
0:10:09 I need you guys to know that Erica loves
0:10:11 this obviously
0:10:14 it's rain a beer
0:10:20 [ __ ] a beer she climbs up on the car
0:10:22 with him
0:10:23 what are you doing here man
0:10:26 I'm glad no I shouldn't be here
0:10:27 obviously I wasn't invited get a brew
0:10:30 hot day and you can come is that what
0:10:32 you did yes I had to come in with my
0:10:35 Coterie [ __ ] you others he points towards
0:10:37 some points at it no no we're not doing
0:10:38 that babe
0:10:40 she like pushes his arm so that he is
0:10:43 turning away Britta tries to keep a
0:10:46 temperature on weathers too as soon as
0:10:47 he's called out with a [ __ ] you and
0:10:49 tries to like I try to keep it calming
0:10:52 and like this it's a very similar motion
0:10:54 to what she did to Johnny earlier but
0:10:56 just a little less personal not getting
0:10:58 so much into space you very easily
0:11:01 manhandle Kabir and he doesn't even
0:11:03 resist no no he wouldn't however Britta
0:11:05 behind her as she's being dragged away
0:11:08 there's another Kabir and this Kabir
0:11:11 calmly cracks his knuckles and
0:11:14 gracefully hops down from the car and
0:11:17 begins striding towards Weathers
0:11:20 foreign
0:11:27 but he is probably going to attempt to
0:11:30 hoard reality Weathers
0:11:32 all right stop
0:11:34 babe I just got you back please stop
0:11:36 maybe it's not really there babe I went
0:11:39 home can I possibly do to this man a lot
0:11:42 remember I told you about when your
0:11:45 magic did something to me and it
0:11:48 incapacitated me until someone could
0:11:50 call me back yeah peanuts
0:11:52 that was harmful don't do that to people
0:11:54 Britta kind of steps forward to the
0:11:58 illusion not do I think that there's two
0:12:01 cabers right yeah you see very clearly
0:12:03 that there are two of them she steps
0:12:05 forward to the illusion looking between
0:12:07 the two not really certain which one
0:12:09 she's dealing with but kind of trying to
0:12:12 peace make and say
0:12:15 hey please if we can all just be chill
0:12:18 about this the Kabir that is standing in
0:12:20 front of you
0:12:21 very definitely ready as a butterfly
0:12:23 knife weathers says simply imma make you
0:12:27 eat that
0:12:30 honey can you please drop the illusion
0:12:33 I'm here doing sensitive Coterie
0:12:35 Sheriff's [ __ ] tonight and this would
0:12:37 really [ __ ] [ __ ] up for me he looks
0:12:40 stressed
0:12:42 as though you cannot possibly fathom
0:12:46 how difficult restraint is for him she
0:12:49 puts a hand on his like the space
0:12:51 between his shoulder and his chest
0:12:53 please
0:12:55 no
0:12:56 we can talk about us he's
0:12:59 I don't think he is but it doesn't what
0:13:04 hey there is enough and not everybody me
0:13:07 having affection for other people you're
0:13:09 of affection for him not like romantic
0:13:11 stick off no you're not gonna cut his
0:13:13 dick off you eat it he points at
0:13:16 weathers Kabir I know you're not
0:13:20 familiar with the seven Greek types of
0:13:21 love but what I feel what I feel for you
0:13:24 is not the same as what I feel for him
0:13:26 mine
0:13:28 all right
0:13:29 here's what we're gonna do I'd kill him
0:13:32 anyway I know you would she clearly does
0:13:34 not believe him but she's going along
0:13:36 with it verbally
0:13:38 so here's what's gonna happen provided
0:13:40 everyone survives tonight which
0:13:43 I don't even [ __ ] know anymore
0:13:46 we'll talk
0:13:48 we'll talk about what you want to be in
0:13:49 my life
0:13:50 though there wasn't one there before
0:13:53 he pulls a hood up over his head and
0:13:57 turns and skulks away
0:14:01 don't leave me like that
0:14:03 he turns to you
0:14:04 we're not we're not slips you the bird
0:14:07 you have quotery business and he slinks
0:14:10 off really sad looking and moves around
0:14:14 into an alley what does the illusion do
0:14:17 it is backing away as though it is a
0:14:19 member of the cast of the dance crew in
0:14:21 the music video for Beat It
0:14:25 and then it too slinks away
0:14:28 Britta kind of turns back to weather
0:14:31 since says sorry about all that you
0:14:34 shrugs it's a rave riddle looks a little
0:14:37 confused but gives a nod and kind of in
0:14:40 her confusion but it's genuine cracks a
0:14:43 smile I'm just gonna stand over here and
0:14:45 not draw attention to myself
0:14:47 desperately minding your own business
0:14:49 yeah I'm just like yeah eating chips you
0:14:52 can't get stressed out every time
0:14:53 there's almost a fight
0:14:55 you do you're going to be too tired when
0:14:57 something really does need your
0:14:58 attention that's that's probably true
0:15:01 but when as Kabir walks away flips the
0:15:05 bird but turns it sideways and says
0:15:07 that's for the horse you rode in on and
0:15:09 walks back he's being a petty little
0:15:12 [ __ ] and she's not gonna give it a
0:15:13 whole lot of time so wind jumps off the
0:15:16 car and walks back
0:15:18 approaches weathers I am so sorry for
0:15:21 that another shrug I get it all the time
0:15:24 I bet you do
0:15:26 I think that's what he's worried about
0:15:27 it's actually a much more genuine giggle
0:15:29 he nuts
0:15:31 touch base with you later okay at this
0:15:34 point Britta looks over to find miles
0:15:35 again who is desperately minding his
0:15:37 business pretty much
0:15:43 kind of motions hey
0:15:46 this is not my show it's not my Pony
0:15:50 um not your circus not your monkey yeah
0:15:52 that's the term that's what I'm looking
0:15:53 for yep look however we're trying to
0:15:55 convene a circus and we're all pretty
0:15:58 much monkeys in the [ __ ] show I'm just
0:16:00 trying to make sure that Kabir doesn't
0:16:01 get itself killed but okay let's go very
0:16:04 good honestly if he didn't die when he
0:16:07 was in New York in a semi-comatose and
0:16:10 semi-orratic state he'll probably be
0:16:12 okay it doesn't help me either way
0:16:14 they're both capable I know miles not
0:16:17 finding an easier way to extricate
0:16:19 himself uh does a small bow it says uh
0:16:21 duty calls
0:16:25 peace out Cub Scouts
0:16:28 remember on the flip side proceeds to
0:16:31 follow them
0:16:33 I'm not drawing any more attention
0:16:35 tonight weather's kind of gives you a
0:16:37 look we don't do that here which part ah
0:16:41 just go very good don't bow to people at
0:16:44 a rave come on man I don't know how to
0:16:46 get out of a conversation otherwise a
0:16:48 little hand flourish it was very awkward
0:16:50 and I just
0:16:51 I just left you could just walk away
0:16:53 without bowing I need to feel
0:16:55 appropriate at the time
0:16:57 it's wrong
0:16:59 you say so but I feel okay
0:17:02 if you feel okay I love that for you
0:17:04 let's go
0:17:06 after five minutes of Miles subtly
0:17:10 leaving the conversation
0:17:13 uh a group makes it back to the VIP room
0:17:16 to reconvene
0:17:20 [Music]
0:17:23 oh and guys if you can just eat and got
0:17:26 here so we're gonna keep an eye on her
0:17:28 all right when makes a very surprised
0:17:32 and angry face I know I know I know but
0:17:34 one of the goals is watching her so yeah
0:17:37 I feel like that's not enough yeah which
0:17:39 car did they take miles with the
0:17:41 important questions over [ __ ] there
0:17:43 it is which car do they take it's very
0:17:46 important what are you worried about
0:17:47 airbags or something
0:17:49 well if they're deployed yes
0:17:51 Johnny yes your phone rings Johnny
0:17:55 fumbles it a little bit kind of like a

0:19:57 never forget about you okay hey he hangs
0:20:01 up
0:20:02 Johnny looks at win with the most
0:20:04 accusatory stare possible what did you
0:20:07 do to Kabir no
0:20:09 I didn't ask him to be my date to the
0:20:12 Brujah Rave okay
0:20:14 that's fine he seems to think I'm
0:20:16 [ __ ] weathers oh that kind of I would
0:20:20 but I'm not whoa you can't say [ __ ] like
0:20:24 that because he's obviously gonna take
0:20:27 that he's European win what does that
0:20:31 like give him a pass to be jealous no
0:20:33 but he's gonna be crazy about things
0:20:35 which usually did you like do a hip bump
0:20:37 or something yeah oh my God God it's
0:20:41 like you [ __ ] know Neil when he might
0:20:44 have misunderstood what you said he
0:20:46 might think that you
0:20:47 um date multiple people or [ __ ] multiple
0:20:50 people or I would but not without
0:20:52 everyone knowing oh my God you can't
0:20:55 talk to him you're not in front of
0:20:56 people like that conversation yet or
0:20:58 y'all need to like get off the
0:21:00 puritanical [ __ ] and understand that
0:21:02 people [ __ ] yeah and it has nothing to
0:21:05 do with my affection for people and this
0:21:06 isn't puritanical thing this this is
0:21:08 just a matter of like old world if you
0:21:10 find out that somebody's [ __ ] in
0:21:12 front of everybody else you're gonna
0:21:13 start stabbing
0:21:14 yeah but you said you would which for a
0:21:17 guy like Kabir look think about it Kabir
0:21:20 has been maybe you know I don't know him
0:21:21 as well as you guys do but you know
0:21:23 there's a surprise really big dick
0:21:27 yeah you know them a little better we
0:21:28 don't have to talk about it
0:21:30 you know forget it it's I'm not really
0:21:32 surprised actually when have you guys
0:21:34 ever established like whether or not
0:21:36 you're committed or open no but I sat
0:21:39 with him for a goddamn week for trying
0:21:42 to protect him from The Nightmare magic
0:21:44 that was killing him fear is a committed
0:21:46 kind of guy then he needs to be
0:21:48 committed then he needs to talk to me
0:21:51 about it I think he's committed enough
0:21:53 to pick a fight with weather it sounds
0:21:54 like he wants to throw down with weather
0:21:56 sounds like he's just being jealous that
0:21:58 I'm spending time with people not him
0:22:00 because he flipped me off when I said I
0:22:02 had Coterie business you put it like that
0:22:04 yeah I mean he is being jealous but
0:22:07 that's fine yeah no no it's not people
0:22:10 are allowed to be jealous yeah but they
0:22:12 can't pick fights about it and have the
0:22:13 people
0:22:15 over be okay with it I know sometimes
0:22:17 it's nice
0:22:20 this is just come
0:22:23 okay but
0:22:25 did you how did you tell him not to pick
0:22:27 a fight though yeah I asked him not to
0:22:29 do it because it would make me upset if
0:22:31 there was a fight and it would
0:22:33 complicate things for me when I don't I
0:22:36 said that I cared about him and if we
0:22:38 want to talk about us we can do that but
0:22:40 right now I have worked did you say talk
0:22:42 about a weekend talk about us that's
0:22:45 breakup words oh it's not breakup words
0:22:47 it's I need to have a discussion about
0:22:48 experience yeah I don't think when did
0:22:51 anything wrong she just didn't really
0:22:54 look it wasn't a great communication the
0:22:57 things that you said they still matter
0:22:58 they're still true is this more that
0:23:00 subtext [ __ ] yes yeah I don't
0:23:02 respond to that I know but it can help
0:23:05 with communication it seems to have done
0:23:07 nothing but complicate the communication
0:23:09 here no matter whether you choose to or
0:23:11 not there is always subtext present I
0:23:13 know that you don't want to [ __ ] with it
0:23:14 but it's always there I mean come here's
0:23:16 a ravnos isn't his whole thing subtext
0:23:18 and like his whole thing is Illusions
0:23:20 what things look like I didn't say
0:23:22 anything to to implicate that I didn't
0:23:25 want to be with him subtext is the
0:23:26 illusions of language well you have that
0:23:28 on a [ __ ] pillow somewhere what the
0:23:30 [ __ ] is that
0:23:31 when again I don't think you didn't
0:23:34 anything wrong I think that there's
0:23:35 miscommunication and I think if you want
0:23:38 him to understand you're gonna have to
0:23:40 offer a method for him to understand so
0:23:43 I just have to suck his dick what no
0:23:45 decidedly staying out of this
0:23:46 conversation also
0:23:49 I'm a you look smug as hell right now
0:23:51 I'm just looking out over this see I've
0:23:54 adopted an attitude of everything goes I
0:23:58 am here as Prince miles
0:24:01 there we go
0:24:03 and they yelled [ __ ] the prince and you
0:24:04 didn't yell that they couldn't handle it
0:24:06 so clearly they don't think highly of
0:24:09 you what see right there you actually
0:24:10 nailed it right in the head you got us
0:24:12 you gotta say [ __ ] in front of people so
0:24:15 that they see things about how they are
0:24:17 I was standing ending on a car in front
0:24:20 of a crowd of Brujah playing [ __ ] Mary
0:24:23 kill what kind of car
0:24:24 I don't know some kind of Buick it's
0:24:26 important not for who is that more that
0:24:29 subtext [ __ ] he's just checking
0:24:31 which car the cool if I'm standing on a
0:24:33 Toyota does that somehow make the
0:24:34 commitment more valid yes
0:24:37 really yeah
0:24:39 oh that's some lame money people
0:24:40 [ __ ] no it's because Toyota's have a
0:24:43 good one I'm just saying
0:24:44 if Kabir showed up and made some kind of
0:24:47 grand over-the-top admittedly uh you
0:24:51 know absurd gesture about the fact that
0:24:53 he's gonna start a fight with weathers
0:24:55 over you you can't just shoot him down
0:24:57 in front of public you have to like
0:24:58 eggnog I didn't I didn't say no I said
0:25:03 not he sounded awfully blubbery on the
0:25:05 phone how many women has he had
0:25:07 committed to him
0:25:09 you might be the first yeah that's why
0:25:11 and he needs to figure out that I can
0:25:13 still talk to other people and still
0:25:14 want to be with him above the others no
0:25:16 no I'm not saying that like he's a
0:25:18 virgin or anything like that I'm just
0:25:19 saying oh I know this is the first time
0:25:20 that he's actually gone in on things so
0:25:22 this was it sounds like this was an
0:25:25 attempt to him to show like a big Grant
0:25:27 what what would to him maybe be a big
0:25:29 Grand romantic gesture it came off a
0:25:32 plane and made a beeline and started
0:25:34 kissing me in front of people how could
0:25:36 I not read that as he wants to be with
0:25:38 me when it's okay yeah he didn't do a
0:25:42 great job of expressing himself I also
0:25:44 think that you probably want him to
0:25:46 understand where you're at right
0:25:48 I thought I made myself clear on that
0:25:50 wind like grabs a shot from a tray
0:25:52 that's going by and just pounds it like
0:25:54 she peeks out of the curtain and
0:25:56 sometimes they just you know part of it
0:25:58 is proving themselves to fight and you
0:26:00 eat food no okay later
0:26:04 spending a little blood spending a blood
0:26:05 to keep it down done oh when no um it's
0:26:08 fine you can your blood can help you
0:26:10 keep it yeah I kind of forgot all right
0:26:13 everyone we need to we need to stop
0:26:15 talking about this [ __ ] because
0:26:17 greed we have a lot more going on
0:26:19 tonight agreed agreed Britta do you agree
0:26:22 Britta is kind of giving miles a sideways
0:26:25 look for him jumping in at the end of
0:26:27 things to just be like yeah the other
0:26:30 stuff that's what britta's doing she's
0:26:32 ignoring mildly sassing miles it slides
0:26:36 off me
0:26:40 sure um
0:26:41 okay
0:26:42 Johnny are people what happens next
0:26:46 damn it when takes out her phone and
0:26:47 starts texting
0:26:50 thank you
0:26:53 it's uh I don't I think any of you guys
0:26:55 have been to a little Brujah gathering on
0:26:57 a rooftop before but things can get kind
0:26:59 of heated people have been known to
0:27:02 eject themselves via another angry Brujah
0:27:06 if you get my drift it seems like people
0:27:09 are really ready to fight yeah
0:27:11 but what we want to try to accomplish
0:27:14 here is trying to get some sense of
0:27:16 unity amongst the Brujah in the area
0:27:20 because we got a whole bunch of [ __ ]
0:27:21 coming down for the defense of New Haven
0:27:24 is that what we're rallying them for
0:27:26 well I was that's what I was thinking is
0:27:27 that is there anything that I'm that I
0:27:29 need to be aware of that we really
0:27:31 needed to try and push up on that roof
0:27:34 we know that there's probably a bunch of
0:27:36 different objectives the spa are here to
0:27:39 try to grab people I imagine the anarchs
0:27:41 are going to want to grab people too and
0:27:44 I don't know that anyone aligned with
0:27:46 Longbow is I mean they might now be good
0:27:49 with defending New Haven but I'm not
0:27:51 sure
0:27:51 so my thoughts are if Amaya is willing
0:27:55 to take up residence in the Middletown
0:27:57 area like you were offering her I'm
0:27:59 totally fine with people going deciding
0:28:01 with the anarchs because that
0:28:03 effectively is people in our camp
0:28:05 looking to stop the Sabbat we got to
0:28:08 stop people listening to the the
0:28:10 [ __ ] and the lies the Shabbat try to
0:28:13 push
0:28:13 as far as Longbow goes or I I think if
0:28:17 they get anybody it's gonna be heading
0:28:20 towards New York as long as the plans go
0:28:23 ahead there's a real energy here and I
0:28:26 think whoever wants to come out top
0:28:29 needs to be in the Forefront and leading
0:28:31 that energy regardless of where it's
0:28:33 going do any of you considered how
0:28:36 you're going to uh undercut the lies the
0:28:39 Sabato telling when some of the lies
0:28:41 they're going to be using aren't lies
0:28:44 what do you think like what what things
0:28:46 aren't lies the eldest and all that
0:28:49 stuff I mean the spots whole whole deal
0:28:51 right is [ __ ] the elders [ __ ] the answer
0:28:53 to libyans and and like
0:28:56 that's if I mean if they step up there
0:28:58 and go hey Johnny uh you were just
0:29:01 talking about how there are definitely
0:29:02 Antideluvians rising and we all need to
0:29:04 Rally around the Sabbat to go kill them
0:29:06 like what's your what's your counter
0:29:07 play I'm gonna deflect that okay I think
0:29:09 it's the best play we got
0:29:11 I think getting into a conversation
0:29:12 about whether or not that thing in Hell
0:29:16 House is or is not an Antideluvian or
0:29:19 whatever else there is that's that's
0:29:22 just gonna bring the whole conversation
0:29:24 Screech into a hole I know I I just be
0:29:27 anticipatory of that I'm ready just to
0:29:29 deflect that and point out the fact that
0:29:31 the Sabbat are looking to deflect the
0:29:34 fact that them coming through here is no
0:29:36 good for the life of anybody how do we
0:29:39 support you Johnny
0:29:40 I'm not sure I have two things I want to
0:29:44 bring up one I think we need to be ready
0:29:46 for people to use the fact that what
0:29:48 miles did with Rowlands and have an
0:29:51 answer for that and also who are some
0:29:54 faces that we haven't seen tonight that
0:29:56 should have shown up and do we wait for
0:29:58 them to show up that's a great question
0:30:00 Alex who are some of the people that
0:30:02 we've should have been expecting but
0:30:04 have not seen the only
0:30:07 Brujah who of like
0:30:10 Fame there's a handful that have been
0:30:12 through the area in the past that are
0:30:14 not here one is archon Bell he is likely
0:30:17 still engaged in operations in New York
0:30:20 another Brujah that is known is a man by
0:30:24 the name of bug Jackson pug has not been
0:30:27 through this area in years doesn't
0:30:29 actually seem super weird that he's not
0:30:31 here right now
0:30:32 Jacques is the child of Roman Pendragon
0:30:36 and he is not here
0:30:38 and usually he's a little bit of a
0:30:40 rabble Rouser who loves showing up to
0:30:43 places like this to instigate but he's
0:30:46 not here
0:30:47 and then of course there is Roman
0:30:49 Pendragon who has not made an appearance
0:30:52 and tangential to that who are some
0:30:55 people we've seen that we didn't plan on
0:30:57 and may have to accommodate on the Fly
0:30:59 the Blackhand uh well kind of
0:31:02 anticipating we kind of anticipated they
0:31:04 might show up probably not as they did
0:31:05 that's their um Selena yeah and
0:31:09 Sullivan's here actually but he's not
0:31:13 really like so much a problem but he is
0:31:15 a member of Boston's court and you guys
0:31:18 actually did have some interactions with
0:31:20 him in the past right it is largely
0:31:22 actually been present pretty supportive
0:31:23 and just kind of using the opportunity
0:31:25 we got along up in Boston so yeah
0:31:28 Arabella left and he wasn't on fire so
0:31:30 he was pretty happy yeah no that worked
0:31:32 all good all good additionally I I saw
0:31:36 weathers passing out some incendiary
0:31:39 rounds to other Brujah so that could be a
0:31:41 factor we're dealing with he is also
0:31:43 when I asked for some he said that my
0:31:46 job is to look pretty so yeah for those
0:31:48 of us non-Brujah sounds like we can
0:31:50 defend but not attack Johnny is more or
0:31:54 less that the gay case just uh don't be
0:31:56 the first to swing let's put it that way
0:32:00 um if weather is just passing out send
0:32:01 Dairy rounds I trust the old man's
0:32:03 decision no I do too but we should be
0:32:05 prepared for the fact that things could
0:32:07 be on fire if uh if somebody comes that
0:32:09 uh comes at the prince for accusations
0:32:12 of whatever uh I'm not gonna say yes or
0:32:15 no but I am going to point out the fact
0:32:17 that all the Brujah here have benefited
0:32:20 from the prince so far they've received
0:32:22 money to stabilize their own uh Havens
0:32:27 and all their own own goings on and
0:32:30 that's for the first time in years I
0:32:33 cannot count this city has seen a brew
0:32:36 high in position of sun ashol and that
0:32:37 means this city is doing well for the
0:32:39 clan I've also had a discussion with
0:32:41 Amaya already so well weather's also
0:32:44 asked questions and I said I wasn't
0:32:45 gonna air your dirty laundry and he took
0:32:47 that to me and exactly what you'd think
0:32:49 it would mean so I don't know that not
0:32:52 answering is gonna help us any more than
0:32:54 being direct about it I don't
0:32:56 necessarily know if this is going to be
0:32:57 about me it's going to be a factor
0:33:00 someone's going to say something
0:33:02 people have said something
0:33:04 I think I have an idea the way I want to
0:33:06 play this
0:33:07 is there anything else you guys can
0:33:08 think of that I should keep in mind do
0:33:11 we have Eden stay down here I think we
0:33:13 have her on the roof where we can see
0:33:15 her maybe just keep your ghoul up there
0:33:17 with her or put her behind me that's
0:33:19 also a good spot I I feel like the vibe
0:33:22 I've been sort of getting from
0:33:23 everything is uh you know show strength
0:33:25 and stuff is good do you instead of
0:33:29 behind win so the wind can be up closer
0:33:32 to you Johnny do you want me to keep an
0:33:33 eye on her I actually win I think that
0:33:35 might be even a better idea and if
0:33:37 things go sideways you just disappear my
0:33:39 boy that's kind of what I was that also
0:33:41 works well keep an eye on Eden to one
0:33:43 degree or another yeah I mean it yeah
0:33:45 more eyes is better rise right all right
0:33:48 let's not uh keep everybody UPS up uh up
0:33:51 top waiting too long I think I hear
0:33:53 things getting moving
0:33:55 Johnny Cal looks up and hears the
0:33:57 vibrations from the roof you all ready
0:34:00 yep let's do it let's go and you head
0:34:04 upstairs
0:34:09 you make it to the roof
0:34:11 and there is already a Rowdy Crown but
0:34:15 it kind of quiets down a bit as the
0:34:18 Coterie that is now at this point made
0:34:20 of name for itself gets a bit of the
0:34:23 respect that has been long time due
0:34:26 Johnny pauses at the a little bit of
0:34:30 quiet and kind of like takes the morally
0:34:32 that he's been smoking out of his out of
0:34:34 his lip looks around and says come on
0:34:37 now aren't you all having a good time
0:34:38 yeah and the crowd erupts he kind of
0:34:42 lifts his arms up and kind of like eggs
0:34:43 them on a little bit
0:34:46 takes a long dragon on the morally
0:34:49 now there's a few things to note here
0:34:51 one
0:34:52 everyone has a red light cast over them
0:34:57 because the brightest star in the sky
0:34:59 that shines even through the typical
0:35:02 city pollution that New Haven is known
0:35:04 for is a male full red star and tonight
0:35:09 it seems particularly bright
0:35:12 come and secrete the quotery are two
0:35:14 women who have both changed their
0:35:17 outfits before this stage of the Rave
0:35:20 and are now clad mostly in white
0:35:24 the first to kind of put an elbow over
0:35:27 Johnny's shoulder and greet him with a
0:35:30 big like sideways hug is Jane and Jane
0:35:35 is now wearing like this very spiky
0:35:38 white leather jacket that is a patch
0:35:40 this is just wise on it she's wearing a
0:35:44 t-shirt that is tied up to be more like
0:35:46 a midriff shirt and on it is the face of
0:35:50 the rapper Nas but done up as a golden
0:35:54 pharaoh and tribute to the album I am
0:35:58 she is wearing these incredibly baggy
0:36:02 cargo pants that are all white safe for
0:36:06 this bright sparkly golden thong that
0:36:10 rides up the sides of her hips
0:36:13 and with very dramatic deep dark makeup
0:36:16 on she gives Johnny a kiss on the cheek
0:36:19 and Amaya who is wearing a kind of baggy
0:36:25 almost too big for her but within the
0:36:28 style of the time pleather trench coat
0:36:31 on her she's wearing a t-shirt that just
0:36:34 says kick start my heart and she also
0:36:37 gives Johnny a big half hug and kisses
0:36:40 him on the cheek and as though this was
0:36:43 the conclusion of some ceremony and
0:36:45 Johnny is given the floor now
0:36:48 in addition to this on one side of this
0:36:53 meeting is what definitely seems to be a
0:36:58 group of individuals that are recognized
0:37:00 as a Blackhand kumut and they are given
0:37:03 their space and while most Brujah won't
0:37:06 like outwardly demonstrate that their
0:37:09 presence makes them nervous you can kind
0:37:11 of feel a bit of that in the air these
0:37:13 guys are dangerous and are known to
0:37:17 Siege multiple cities over the course of
0:37:20 the past year or so on the other side of
0:37:22 them
0:37:23 are individuals that unlike many of the
0:37:26 other Brujah aren't wearing leather
0:37:28 jackets or tacky or anything like that
0:37:30 but are wearing uniforms and these
0:37:33 ladies and gentlemen belong to Roman
0:37:36 Pendragon and are a dozen members of his
0:37:39 army
0:37:40 all of them have claws that are ready to
0:37:44 go in case things escalate with the
0:37:46 Sabbat
0:37:48 amidst this tension kind of watching The
0:37:51 Space Between and
0:37:53 quietly positioning himself to be a
0:37:56 clear authority figure in terms of
0:37:58 security as weathers who looks very
0:38:01 handsome bright chain hanging around his
0:38:04 neck and a shotgun that he is just
0:38:07 gripping in his hand it is not holstered
0:38:09 it is not settled he is a man with a
0:38:13 shotgun and is ready to use it now next
0:38:17 to Johnny
0:38:18 Amaya and Jane are carrying weapons of a
0:38:22 different sort and what you see are
0:38:25 paintball guns
0:38:28 each of them has one and examining them
0:38:31 you can see that they're very much so
0:38:33 loaded with bright hot pink paintballs
0:38:36 okay
0:38:37 and quietly once the Uproar dies down
0:38:42 everyone looks to Johnny
0:38:44 Johnny takes a few moments to walk
0:38:47 around and look at everybody present on
0:38:49 the rooftop
0:38:51 warms my dead heart to see all these
0:38:53 badass [ __ ] on the roof tonight
0:38:56 he looks around at all the present Brujah
0:38:59 he points at pendragon's army he points
0:39:03 at the commut he points at all of the
0:39:05 other Brujah I think we can all agree
0:39:09 it's been a long time since we've seen
0:39:12 our bloodline enforce anywhere
0:39:14 but looking around this roof tonight I
0:39:17 think we can all agree that there is no
0:39:20 bloodline like the Brujah
0:39:22 let's give it up there's of course the
0:39:25 positive response that Chinese looking
0:39:27 for but then the question kind of starts
0:39:31 to manifest which becomes
0:39:36 why are we here
0:39:38 I called this rave
0:39:41 because I wanted to talk about the
0:39:43 well-being of our home
0:39:46 I think we all can agree that this
0:39:48 little neck of the woods we call New
0:39:51 Haven is in one way or another our home
0:39:54 some of us here might just be neighbors
0:39:57 this place is ours
0:40:00 before we get to the heavier business
0:40:02 I think we can all thank
0:40:04 former primogene weathers for all he has
0:40:08 done for everyone present on this
0:40:09 rooftop
0:40:11 most seem to agree there's like an
0:40:14 Applause and some some voices offering
0:40:17 support when gives a yell but there's
0:40:19 also a handful of those bruh that were
0:40:21 tight with Shaw and Loyalists to the old
0:40:25 Nosferatu cause but when one of them is
0:40:28 like eh in response to what Johnny says
0:40:31 Jane or the quick snap fires the
0:40:35 paintball gun hits him squaring the nuts
0:40:39 and splashes his outfit with bright pink
0:40:42 there's like a little accidental giggle
0:40:45 from Britta at the perfect day and the
0:40:49 revelation of the purpose the bra
0:40:51 threatens her calls her a [ __ ] and
0:40:54 everything he says just can't be heard
0:40:56 over the laughter and his rage gives way
0:41:00 to humiliation and those who would have
0:41:03 spoken out against weathers are too
0:41:05 afraid of the embarrassment they just
0:41:08 watched to continue speaking of a
0:41:11 [ __ ] outstanding I gotta imagine that
0:41:14 like the reflexive laugh nothing just
0:41:17 from everybody like specifically from
0:41:18 [ __ ] Britta who has spent the entire
0:41:20 [ __ ] party being like look how cool
0:41:22 life of the party is like it's [ __ ]
0:41:25 horrible nail in a coffin Johnny kind of
0:41:27 puts out a like a consultory hand and
0:41:30 goes no no I get it I get it none of us
0:41:33 always make to make decisions that
0:41:35 Everyone likes in fact weather's over
0:41:38 here thought it'd be a smart [ __ ]
0:41:39 move to put a bullseye on my goddamn
0:41:42 back and named me primagen I don't
0:41:44 [ __ ] like that move but here we are
0:41:48 anybody got problems with that and want
0:41:50 the bullseye on their back speak up now
0:41:53 Johnny looks around the rooftop for the
0:41:56 first time since Johnny made it to the
0:41:58 roof he is met with silence
0:42:00 I thank you all for your voter
0:42:02 confidence
0:42:04 as primagen of New Haven
0:42:06 I would also like to extend thanks
0:42:09 to the baron turns to Amaya Amaya gives
0:42:12 a feigned curtsy and a bunch of the guys
0:42:16 clap for her and you kind of tell like
0:42:18 there's there are the Brujah that people
0:42:22 love because they're total badasses but
0:42:25 there's also the Brujah that are popular
0:42:28 In This Crowd because a lot of the guys
0:42:30 are kind of sweet on them and Amaya is
0:42:35 very clearly one of them and you know
0:42:38 she gets her attention and after the
0:42:40 curses she gives you nod and says thank
0:42:42 you Johnny
0:42:43 it's a pleasure to be here with you
0:42:45 hopefully no one gets thrown off the
0:42:47 roof
0:42:49 Johnny cast a glance over at the Brujah
0:42:53 that made an unfortunate exit last time
0:42:56 there was a rant I don't think anyone's
0:42:58 going off the roof tonight he puts his
0:43:00 hands up as though indicating he's not
0:43:01 carrying a weapon and doesn't want any
0:43:03 trouble
0:43:04 Johnny flashes him a smile and kind of
0:43:07 nods back I'd also like to extend my
0:43:10 thanks to all of our neighbors up in
0:43:13 Hartford in Boston for coming down he
0:43:15 kind of gives motion over to Sully the
0:43:18 uh members of pendragon's army who've
0:43:21 arrived uh the members of pendragon's
0:43:23 army are kind of met with this I want to
0:43:26 say lazy but half-hearted Applause so
0:43:29 like they're they're kind of not well
0:43:31 liked by the crowd them being all
0:43:34 squared away and instruments of war
0:43:37 and I don't think anybody here could
0:43:39 miss our guests from New York kind of
0:43:42 Johnny gives a kind of smug shit-eating
0:43:45 grin with like a half cocked head over
0:43:48 to the kamut that's here there is an
0:43:51 excitable Boo that is extended to them
0:43:55 hey hey everybody chill
0:43:57 I know the rumors float around that well
0:44:00 I might be a Shabbat myself he kind of
0:44:03 gives like this kind of like clown walk
0:44:04 a little bit but that's the guy right
0:44:06 there that started those rumors my sire
0:44:09 ladies and gentlemen boo more booze and
0:44:12 it was around then
0:44:14 veteran gets this wave and anxiety
0:44:19 and you can feel a certain
0:44:23 nervous sensation the way the doe feels
0:44:27 when confronted by the wolf
0:44:29 and
0:44:31 one
0:44:33 of these black hands not your sire
0:44:36 begins to take off the tactical gear and
0:44:40 he
0:44:41 becomes she
0:44:44 and over the course of moments
0:44:47 the group now sees a smaller almost
0:44:53 diminutive woman who is
0:44:56 rather beautiful
0:44:58 but you can feel this dangerous
0:45:02 sensation radiating from her
0:45:05 and someone in the crowd you're not sure
0:45:08 who Whispers
0:45:10 dark Selena
0:45:12 Johnny puts his arms out and becomes
0:45:14 very serious for a moment
0:45:16 all joking between sex that should be
0:45:19 enemies I thank you for coming here and
0:45:22 respecting the Rave and respecting the
0:45:24 bloodline
0:45:26 and he nods towards dark Selena
0:45:28 the corner of her lip twists into a
0:45:32 smile or smirk
0:45:34 so what Clan has a choice and I think
0:45:37 we're all well aware of
0:45:39 these coming nights we all got to decide
0:45:42 where we're gonna stand
0:45:43 and where we're going to be
0:45:45 and I'm going to encourage all of you
0:45:48 to make the choice to stand here in New
0:45:52 Haven
0:45:54 with me
0:45:56 with the baron
0:45:57 to stand against the lies that things
0:46:02 are going to be all right once the
0:46:04 Sabbat wipes this place clean
0:46:07 because that's not going to happen
0:46:10 what they're promising
0:46:12 this is all just a power grab for their
0:46:15 newly anointed Cardinal of the Northeast
0:46:19 Polonia
0:46:21 they say they're against the elders
0:46:23 they're not
0:46:24 they're just grabbing power for the
0:46:27 canines the top of their ladder
0:46:29 they do not care
0:46:31 about the vampires the Kindred that live
0:46:34 here
0:46:36 in this land
0:46:38 and their main weapon is fear
0:46:42 if Clan Brujah decides to fear the Sabbat
0:46:45 they'll roll through just like they're
0:46:48 saying but if you want to stand up stay
0:46:50 here and and put a stake on your home
0:46:53 they ain't gonna do nothing
0:46:58 so I'm asking you all to answer a call
0:47:01 to Arms
0:47:03 I want you all to stand with me
0:47:06 and reject this [ __ ] coming up from
0:47:09 New York just as you'd hope the vast
0:47:12 majority of the bra present yell
0:47:14 incoherently and excitably in support of
0:47:18 holding their ground and meeting the
0:47:22 threat of the Sabbat head-on
0:47:25 so much so
0:47:27 that
0:47:28 for a moment your hearts are uplifted
0:47:32 like hey
0:47:34 maybe this is the victory we needed
0:47:37 maybe it will all go according to plan
0:47:43 and then she takes a single step
0:47:47 toward the group
0:47:49 and gestures as though she intends to
0:47:52 speak
0:47:54 the excitement the thrill that these
0:47:58 Brujah have
0:48:00 in support of standing up to the Sabbat
0:48:03 dies
0:48:06 and they become quiet again
0:48:09 and she begins to speak
0:48:12 but not to the bruh who are gathered
0:48:16 she instead turns
0:48:19 and the looks directly
0:48:23 to Johnny
0:48:24 [Music]
0:48:28 first things first
0:48:32 Johnny
0:48:33 in order to disagree with her in any
0:48:36 capacity I need a courage test at
0:48:39 difficulty nine
0:48:40 her being dark Selena presumably her
0:48:43 being duck celino
0:48:45 should I make this now or should I make
0:48:47 this reflexively as we talk the moment
0:48:49 she looks at you you have to make the
0:48:51 roll alright so right now yep and I'll
0:48:53 spend the point of willpower
0:48:56 two successes with two successes you
0:49:00 don't wither away just being looked at
0:49:03 by her
0:49:04 first I wish to commend you
0:49:07 for your bravery
0:49:10 you are
0:49:12 demonstrating a certain goal
0:49:17 that most of our clan
0:49:19 lost a long time ago
0:49:22 when they decided to bend to the ventru
0:49:26 and their masquerade
0:49:29 but that call comes at a price Johnny
0:49:33 I know
0:49:34 that you are dissatisfied
0:49:37 Where You Are
0:49:40 I know
0:49:42 and you've seen the signs of gehenna
0:49:46 I know that it frustrates you
0:49:49 the time is being spent
0:49:53 bending to the whims of canine politics
0:49:57 when your daughter needs you to stand up
0:50:00 and use the strength of your blood to
0:50:03 save her
0:50:05 I know that this entire Crusade is a
0:50:07 waste of your [ __ ] time Johnny takes
0:50:11 a step an aggressive step towards her
0:50:14 and kind of levels his gaze at hers in
0:50:18 the back of his mind his Beast is trying
0:50:21 to desperately to just claw its way out
0:50:23 and get the [ __ ] off this rooftop but he
0:50:25 locks it down
0:50:27 Gahanna or not
0:50:29 he points at the sky and the baleful red
0:50:33 star above none of us are blind we can
0:50:37 see that the times we are in are unlike
0:50:41 anything else why some of the Brujahh
0:50:44 look kind of surprised and unsettled
0:50:46 that this conversation has become so
0:50:49 apocalyptic so quickly
0:50:51 and respectfully my daughter is none of
0:50:55 your goddamn concern
0:50:57 do not presume to decide what is my
0:50:59 concerned child
0:51:01 your blood is my blood
0:51:03 not in that we are just both Brujah
0:51:07 you come from my line
0:51:11 what animates your course is my power
0:51:16 what tethers you
0:51:19 to your daughter even beyond death is my
0:51:24 power
0:51:26 be frustrated be angry it's good I love
0:51:30 that
0:51:32 but don't deny yourself the truth
0:51:35 the comfort you exist in this camarilla
0:51:39 it is a fading joke
0:51:42 do you have any idea how many Rants and
0:51:45 Raves and meetings and monologues from
0:51:49 the princes of various domains have
0:51:51 promised an end to the Crusade
0:51:54 do you have any idea how many Johnny's
0:51:56 came before you insisting that the
0:52:00 Sabbat will go no further
0:52:03 this is the most decisive moment of your
0:52:06 entire existence as a canine
0:52:10 but to us
0:52:12 to the Sabbath
0:52:14 this is a routine step in the process
0:52:19 Johnny
0:52:21 summoning up all his courage
0:52:24 cracks a smile at her face
0:52:28 he pops immorally into his mouth and
0:52:31 lights it
0:52:33 see that's the problem
0:52:35 with Elders like you
0:52:39 you think you've seen it all
0:52:43 but I can promise you
0:52:45 there ain't no other [ __ ] Johnny
0:52:48 Saxon and his little Cur Coy smile
0:52:52 breaks into a full wolfish grin and he
0:52:55 caught a grand stands in front of her
0:52:57 and kind of like spreads his arms out to
0:53:00 the crowd around she dominates down her
0:53:03 generational line and you find yourself
0:53:05 approaching her with that grin and you
0:53:08 give her your lit cigarette
0:53:11 she accepts it and you go back to
0:53:13 grandstanding and no one in the crowd
0:53:16 seems to recognize that it was not your
0:53:19 choice to do so
0:53:22 she takes a drag
0:53:24 savoring the taste of the Morley
0:53:27 and she says to you
0:53:30 again I admire your bravery
0:53:34 but this is a conversation that we've
0:53:36 already had
0:53:37 perhaps not this Johnny
0:53:40 but so many of the journeys who have
0:53:42 come before
0:53:44 and every time
0:53:46 I make the same offer
0:53:50 but you seem to be particularly smart
0:53:52 Johnny
0:53:54 I think
0:53:56 you crave freedom from the limitations
0:54:00 that are pressed down upon you by the
0:54:02 camera
0:54:03 and I believe that you are not the only
0:54:05 Brujahh here that feels that way
0:54:08 I didn't come here to
0:54:10 Menace you
0:54:13 I didn't come here to make you afraid
0:54:16 that you're completely wrong about
0:54:20 I came to uplift you
0:54:23 the thought of one of mine bending me to
0:54:27 the Elders of the camarilla disgusts me
0:54:31 the thought that you cannot have all
0:54:33 that you deserve because of their laws
0:54:37 disgusts me
0:54:40 the fact that they would use you
0:54:43 to make war against the Sabbath and die
0:54:46 against the sabbaths that they might run
0:54:49 another night
0:54:50 disgusts me
0:54:53 I would see you become what you were
0:54:55 meant to be
0:54:56 I would see you stand in defiance of
0:54:59 Ghana
0:55:00 just the way you want to
0:55:03 enriched by our ways
0:55:07 your prince he's already halfway there I
0:55:11 don't know what the debate is
0:55:14 why are we disagreeing
0:55:16 Johnny um who plays it off to the crowd
0:55:20 like the pass of the cigarette was
0:55:22 nothing at all
0:55:25 gives her a stare that is halfway
0:55:28 between what the [ __ ] are you
0:55:31 and how dare you
0:55:34 perhaps leaning a little bit more into
0:55:36 the terror of what the [ __ ] are you
0:55:39 extends a hand
0:55:40 asking her to pass the cigarette back
0:55:44 for the sake of the crowd as his Coterie
0:55:47 has Johnny ever shared his morally like
0:55:49 that I'll put it to you this way if he
0:55:52 did it wasn't with the Sabbat
0:55:54 I don't think it's a move you've ever
0:55:56 seen Johnny make yeah I didn't think so
0:55:58 either and in fact I think his
0:56:01 performance might be
0:56:04 um working for the crowd you can
0:56:07 probably see the shaken Terror in his
0:56:09 eyes of having been casually dominated
0:56:12 as such
0:56:13 when gives miles a look and kind of just
0:56:19 starts casually moving around the circle
0:56:21 she is not moving with any intent at
0:56:24 this point only to establish that she is
0:56:25 moving but eventually she intends to
0:56:28 land closer to Johnny but not so close
0:56:30 that be subtle about it sure as subtle
0:56:33 as wind can be you have a lot of leeway
0:56:35 right now because a lot of the people
0:56:38 talking are presence oriented and a lot
0:56:43 of loud shouting and grain standing and
0:56:45 roaring and hissing and she will move
0:56:48 so that her pattern of movement
0:56:50 Falls between being able to see dark
0:56:53 Selena's face not necessarily in her
0:56:55 line of sight directly but keeping an
0:56:57 eye on Johnny's face kind of making him
0:57:00 aware of the fact that she has his back
0:57:03 if things start to go this environment
0:57:06 is raucous would I be able to heighten
0:57:10 Vision on the cigarette or at least
0:57:12 rather could I hide my vision and then
0:57:14 watch the cigarette yeah I'd like to
0:57:16 Brett is feeling suspicious about it
0:57:18 passing lip to lip I suppose Rita will
0:57:21 actually notice that well she's taking
0:57:24 the drag on the cigarette she's
0:57:27 examining it absorbing it and you kind
0:57:32 of realize that she's using the spirit's
0:57:34 touch on the cigarette to learn more and
0:57:37 more about Johnny
0:57:39 and there is a much more clever
0:57:42 undercurrent to what's going on than her
0:57:44 just talking
0:57:46 if I were to attempt to use telepathy to
0:57:49 knock on Johnny's mind would it be
0:57:51 disruptive to him
0:57:53 no then I'd like to Johnny you feel a
0:57:56 presence press against your mind is it a
0:57:59 familiar presence it is
0:58:01 what's going on kid hey Johnny I started
0:58:05 watching the cigarette because I don't
0:58:06 know I I got scared that maybe I would
0:58:09 have blood on it but I think she's doing
0:58:11 the same thing that I was doing when I
0:58:13 touched your jacket earlier and I felt
0:58:15 everything she felt it seems like she's
0:58:18 learning about you it's a
0:58:21 learning about me she means she's not
0:58:23 gonna kill me out of hand
0:58:25 just seems like this is part of the plan
0:58:27 all right
0:58:28 I'll keep an eye out
0:58:30 girl at this point this is all just
0:58:33 theater
0:58:34 do you mind if I stay here so that we
0:58:36 can talk please
0:58:38 if she ends your cigarette
0:58:40 and says
0:58:42 there is no need for us to fight
0:58:45 there is no need for any of you
0:58:48 to remain in the sect that uses you as
0:58:50 Canon father
0:58:53 unless
0:58:55 his grace has something different in
0:58:57 mind she kind of looks at Miles kind of
0:59:00 appraisingly
0:59:03 miles who has been mostly trying to not
0:59:05 be noticed
0:59:07 um
0:59:07 [Music]
0:59:08 in the back here
0:59:11 I don't plan on using any Kindred as
0:59:13 cannon fodder
0:59:14 what does your sire plan
0:59:17 he has his own plans I have mine
0:59:21 what's the difference because his plan
0:59:24 relies on Canon fodder doesn't it
0:59:28 sires and their children don't always
0:59:30 have the same plans Johnny looks
0:59:33 menacingly over at Delgado and relishes
0:59:36 the fact that he can give scared daggers
0:59:39 at another Kindred without feeling
0:59:41 absolute Terror so he leans into that
0:59:45 Delgado On Cue stares right back
0:59:49 menacingly and also kind of appreciating
0:59:53 a sense of normalcy for what happens
0:59:57 when the camera ends the Sabbat bruh and
1:00:00 not like I feel like in a weird way they
1:00:02 share a moment where they're like thank
1:00:04 God we can just be angry at somebody and
1:00:07 like like I think I feel like it it's as
1:00:10 they're like staring daggers there's
1:00:12 also like a sense of like thank you
1:00:13 thank you you are both
1:00:16 hostages
1:00:18 to the Methuselah from who you're whom
1:00:21 you are descended while this is all
1:00:23 going on Neil is much like miles
1:00:26 standing in the back probably right next
1:00:28 to miles in that like both of them sort
1:00:31 of naturally go into that like nobody's
1:00:32 really looking at us right here spot
1:00:33 because this is Johnny's show keeping
1:00:36 half an eye on Eden and keeping her way
1:00:39 the [ __ ] back now that shit's popping
1:00:40 off but also there is a violent powder
1:00:45 keg of potential energy on this roof and
1:00:48 as a mulcavian and you know a Seer just
1:00:53 trying to whether it's her eyes of chaos
1:00:56 or not keep an eye on the thermostat to
1:00:59 make sure the pot doesn't boil over give
1:01:01 me your eyes of casserole
1:01:04 seven successes with seven successes
1:01:07 everything looks right it smells right
1:01:10 it seems right
1:01:13 scary for all the right reasons yeah but
1:01:17 you hear something under the nervous
1:01:20 quiet
1:01:21 of this rave
1:01:24 and it's this
1:01:26 deep
1:01:28 draconic rumbling like something is
1:01:33 waking and whatever that is it is the
1:01:39 type of conflict
1:01:41 that changes every part of the world
1:01:45 that it touches maybe a weird question
1:01:48 maybe not with every Rumble and pulse
1:01:53 underneath if there's any sense of
1:01:55 pattern to that
1:01:56 Neil's gonna look up at this star which
1:01:58 is way brighter today than it has been
1:02:00 in a while
1:02:01 is there any synchronicity to the
1:02:05 pattern and pulse so
1:02:08 this star seems particularly bright and
1:02:11 you are high as hell so it is like
1:02:13 really really bad super true
1:02:16 um but not exactly this rumbling waking
1:02:21 draconic noise is coming from Below
1:02:25 and is rising
1:02:28 Leo that he's just doing that he's not
1:02:30 going to interrupt the Methuselah and
1:02:32 Johnny talking to each other right now
1:02:34 but just gonna keep an eye on that for
1:02:37 now but the moment she has turned to
1:02:40 Miles and has encouraged him to speak of
1:02:44 his plan
1:02:46 as those in New Haven are aware I don't
1:02:50 leave Kindred out to dry
1:02:52 we are here to take care of each other
1:02:54 to support each other to raise the city
1:02:57 up to be better than it was before
1:02:59 to find a path together in cooperation
1:03:02 with not only Kindred and the Camarilla
1:03:04 but those that are around us and our
1:03:07 neighbors we are striving to make this
1:03:09 better not just to wage war and die
1:03:14 I will give you the credit you are due
1:03:16 miles
1:03:18 you have proven to be vicious
1:03:21 and your supportive allies
1:03:24 and how can I
1:03:26 judge you for what you did to Upton
1:03:29 ruins
1:03:31 when I have committed the deed myself
1:03:35 the truth is Miles
1:03:39 you represent a form of leadership that
1:03:41 the camarilla doesn't accept
1:03:44 you absolutely encourage camaraderie
1:03:48 you encourage
1:03:50 deprivity
1:03:51 on behalf of your loved ones
1:03:55 what is it
1:03:56 you did what you needed to
1:03:59 you're already halfway into the Sabbat
1:04:03 and announcing that the reason that they
1:04:07 should stay beside you is because you
1:04:10 behave as Saban isn't quite the argument
1:04:14 that I think you think it is
1:04:16 you just said it
1:04:19 he is the kind of leadership this city
1:04:21 needs he stands by loved ones he fights
1:04:26 for them he deposes princes that care
1:04:30 not for this domain all you're offering
1:04:33 is another Elder who says yield or
1:04:38 perish
1:04:39 were miles
1:04:41 Your Leader with no strings attached
1:04:44 you would have a very valid argument
1:04:46 Johnny
1:04:47 but miles
1:04:49 serves his clan
1:04:51 particularly his sire
1:04:55 and his sire does not think the way
1:04:57 miles does
1:05:00 and when push comes to shove
1:05:02 because miles has not been set free by
1:05:05 the Sabbat
1:05:06 he will be obligated
1:05:09 to obey his sire I don't think you're
1:05:13 nearly as free as you purport
1:05:16 it has been centuries
1:05:18 since I've been made to obey anyone win
1:05:22 finally chimes in and how free are those
1:05:24 that follow you
1:05:26 ask them are they going to give an
1:05:28 answer you want or the answer they feel
1:05:31 it kind of gives the Blackhand come what
1:05:34 that's with her look
1:05:36 and how is that different from me
1:05:38 following miles you know how it's
1:05:40 different I've never been made to tell
1:05:43 Miles that he's great your entire Clan
1:05:45 has left the Camarilla because of the
1:05:47 people that your friend miles is
1:05:49 beholden to but not because of my friend
1:05:52 miles who is the one in charge of this
1:05:54 city so Miles you will refuse your sire
1:05:59 if I do not believe in his decision and
1:06:01 I think it is the wrong move then I will
1:06:05 not do it
1:06:06 Smiles in a way that is pleased that
1:06:11 you've sworn in front of these people to
1:06:13 disobey your sire
1:06:16 well
1:06:18 I'm sorry we'll come to that
1:06:21 I wish your quarterly good luck
1:06:24 and the rest of you she looks to the
1:06:25 Brujah
1:06:27 and
1:06:29 they are looking pretty hopeless about
1:06:32 the idea of contending against dark
1:06:36 Selena Owen kind of rolling over
1:06:39 apparently comes with all these perks by
1:06:42 the way what's with the Dragon Under New
1:06:44 York
1:06:47 Johnny physically blanches when she says
1:06:51 that
1:06:52 and kind of like nods like all right
1:06:55 we're going there down stories
1:07:00 of beings from Before the Flood
1:07:03 the great flood the deluge
1:07:07 and it is said that they will rise and
1:07:10 consume all of canine kind
1:07:13 the Sabah has pledged to oppose this
1:07:15 then why are you protecting it nonsense
1:07:19 and furthermore
1:07:21 before we continue with this
1:07:23 conversation I wish to make sure your
1:07:25 grace is comfortable with this topic
1:07:29 being broached at a rave
1:07:35 of discussing antediluvians miles looks
1:07:39 at her and goes I mean are any of these
1:07:42 Brujah snitches are like oh what no no no
1:07:46 no no no no no then how is he ever going
1:07:49 to find out Johnny lets out an audible
1:07:52 like
1:07:56 smiles then let's discuss
1:07:59 the Shabbat do not support these
1:08:02 antediluvians nor do they protect them
1:08:04 then why are you marching on another
1:08:07 city rather than take cleaning your own
1:08:09 house
1:08:09 do you think that this thing extends
1:08:12 merely to New York oh I know it doesn't
1:08:14 and so the Sabbat must sees all
1:08:16 territory that it holds but maybe start
1:08:18 with the big chunk and stop it from
1:08:20 reproducing that's not how that was
1:08:22 going to work but
1:08:24 you see that it is here
1:08:27 and you know
1:08:29 that your Camry is not going to do
1:08:31 anything about it my camarilla is going
1:08:35 to be doing something about it the
1:08:36 camarilla on the whole I have no control
1:08:38 over that that's why my clan left Johnny
1:08:41 takes a look around the roof to see if
1:08:44 what the [ __ ] reaction is from all
1:08:46 the Brujah present about some things now
1:08:50 being discussed that are probably big
1:08:53 the crowd is largely looking at you guys
1:08:55 like you're insane but there's some who
1:08:58 are experiencing bits of this
1:09:01 existential horror Johnny lifts up his
1:09:04 arms and goes whoa whoa whoa
1:09:07 let's get something right here
1:09:09 are all our guests dark Selena is thrown
1:09:12 around terms that I think is making
1:09:15 everybody a little bit
1:09:16 gun shy
1:09:18 wouldn't kind of gives him a look
1:09:19 because she clearly started that
1:09:21 discussion
1:09:24 yes of course she laughs I threw these
1:09:28 words around
1:09:29 well let's get something straight there
1:09:32 is something in New Haven that I have
1:09:36 never seen the likes of
1:09:38 it is I think a lot of you you find
1:09:41 yourself all quiet when as she speaks
1:09:44 and you like interrupt her Johnny it is
1:09:48 a short a piece of a greater whole
1:09:52 and
1:09:54 were we to destroy even the greater
1:09:58 portion of it
1:10:00 s Essence it's mind what have you would
1:10:05 simply awaken
1:10:06 and whatever part of it that lives on
1:10:08 elsewhere
1:10:11 you
1:10:13 know that this has to be stumps I just
1:10:16 want to catch everybody here up because
1:10:19 judging from some of your faces
1:10:21 I think he needs to be reminded that
1:10:23 there was once a Nosferatu who sent a
1:10:26 lot of you
1:10:27 to go try and take this thing out I
1:10:29 think you'll remember the house you all
1:10:31 went to someone actually says the
1:10:34 molotovs didn't work right yeah and they
1:10:36 start kind of like people's minds are
1:10:38 now racing
1:10:40 whatever this thing is
1:10:42 and I appreciate the information
1:10:46 that dark Selena has given us about it
1:10:48 whatever it is
1:10:50 this is something that everyone here
1:10:55 needs to deal with
1:10:57 I am in agreeance on that
1:11:01 when I'm not in agreeance on
1:11:04 is the Sabbat holding the Brujah gum
1:11:08 Point saying you need to abandon
1:11:10 everything else that you've been living
1:11:12 for and join us because that's the only
1:11:15 way to solve this
1:11:17 and if you he points at dark Selena
1:11:21 actually want to beat this thing
1:11:24 then I would appreciate an olive branch
1:11:27 and a way that we might be able to work
1:11:29 together to defeat that if that's a
1:11:32 discussion you want to have then I think
1:11:34 we're all ears but demanding obedience
1:11:38 That Ain't Gonna Fly
1:11:40 and you misunderstand no I think I do
1:11:43 not cut me off or I will tear your head
1:11:45 off
1:11:46 this is your one and only warning
1:11:49 Johnny gives her a look of yes ma'am I
1:11:54 understand
1:11:55 but outwardly for the crowd kind of
1:11:58 Stands Tall and lifts his chin up I will
1:12:00 tear your head off and her head off she
1:12:03 points at Britta and his head off and she
1:12:05 points at Neil and her head off and she
1:12:07 points at uh when and looks back towards
1:12:12 you
1:12:13 don't act as though you might die
1:12:15 recognize that everything you care about
1:12:17 might disappear
1:12:21 God accuse me of putting my foot on your
1:12:24 neck because I will
1:12:27 I have come here
1:12:29 to warn you
1:12:32 that you are being used as resistance to
1:12:34 Sabbat and frankly the Sabbat is the
1:12:37 only chance you have at eradicating this
1:12:40 and I say to you
1:12:43 that the camarilla would rather silence
1:12:45 you than deal with this because that has
1:12:48 been the approach that the camera has
1:12:50 taken for centuries it will not change
1:12:53 just because a handful of you have seen
1:12:56 the truth
1:12:58 the Gangrel knew this and that is why
1:13:01 they left not just because they
1:13:03 discovered some truth out there as to
1:13:06 what exists and what Waits this this
1:13:09 creature this being this is why they
1:13:12 left
1:13:13 Xavier knew that the camera would not
1:13:16 help him
1:13:18 and for whatever reason you have
1:13:20 convinced yourselves that the grandchild
1:13:22 of harderstan is going to speak of
1:13:25 antediluvians and Galvanize his domain
1:13:28 against this threat and not be quashed
1:13:31 by his elders
1:13:33 you are idiots to think that the
1:13:35 camarilla is not going to kill you in
1:13:38 order to keep their secrets they don't
1:13:39 care about New Haven they don't care
1:13:41 about the East Coast they don't care
1:13:43 about North America
1:13:45 the domains that matter to them are the
1:13:47 ones that they live in everything else
1:13:49 is a means by which they insulate
1:13:52 themselves
1:13:54 stop
1:13:55 pretending
1:13:57 that there is some hope you can hold out
1:13:59 for that the Camarilla will care they do
1:14:02 not I offer you this chance at survival
1:14:06 it is not a demand I am not stepping on
1:14:09 you I am not breaking and bending you to
1:14:12 my will because I can if I so chose
1:14:14 I am offering you your out take it leave
1:14:18 it I don't care
1:14:20 so here's what I'm gonna offer you
1:14:22 because I think there's a fundamental
1:14:23 misunderstanding here
1:14:25 I think the camarilla doesn't care about
1:14:28 anything but their own circle jerking
1:14:30 party
1:14:31 I think you are correct when you say
1:14:33 that there is a wave of demoralization
1:14:37 that hits this crowd of Brujah
1:14:40 and that being said they still need us
1:14:44 they still fancy their egos
1:14:47 and that means they still need us which
1:14:50 puts us in a position to make some
1:14:52 demand
1:14:54 and here's what I am proposing
1:14:56 I am proposing that we stop playing into
1:14:59 their plan
1:15:00 I am proposing
1:15:02 that the Sabbat stops scheming about how
1:15:05 to acquire more property for the moment
1:15:07 and take the Olive Branch we've offered
1:15:09 which is hey we also want to [ __ ] this
1:15:12 giant thing up
1:15:14 we will not be consorting with Servants
1:15:16 of artisan who [ __ ] serves hardistat
1:15:19 you do no I don't we have offered you
1:15:21 the only offer you are getting I
1:15:23 understand if no is your answer your
1:15:26 grace
1:15:28 when the Ripple of demoralization goes
1:15:31 through Neil watching terazi Castle but
1:15:34 I can see that happen right oh yeah and
1:15:36 the sound of the Dragon grows louder
1:15:39 Johnny's like kind of standing in the
1:15:41 middle of everything right yeah Neil is
1:15:44 going to shaking like a leaf is going to
1:15:47 just go up kind of behind Johnny and
1:15:49 like tap him on the shoulder Johnny
1:15:51 looks back
1:15:52 he's doing this partly because like the
1:15:54 old there's no way he can drag himself
1:15:56 to like talk in front of dark Selena in
1:15:57 this whole [ __ ] crowd so still
1:15:59 probably loud enough for most people to
1:16:01 hear he's going to bend in to talk to
1:16:03 Johnny's ear and be like
1:16:05 um
1:16:06 so all the points have been made here
1:16:08 are seem
1:16:09 you know reasonable I I can see how they
1:16:12 would seem reasonable
1:16:13 but you've seen and and I've seen
1:16:16 what
1:16:18 what life when you sign up with this
1:16:20 about is like and and I think you know
1:16:23 and I know that anyone in this domain
1:16:25 anyone at all on the East Coast who
1:16:27 still has friends still has family still
1:16:30 is
1:16:32 clinging to their humanity is
1:16:35 in the warmth of connection to the city
1:16:37 into the people here
1:16:39 whether or not it's Gahanna whether or
1:16:41 not if you go with the spot right then
1:16:43 that'll get snuffed out
1:16:45 because we've seen what life is like you
1:16:47 know she may even think she has a point
1:16:50 she may have a point and like he when he
1:16:52 says she he doesn't look anywhere near
1:16:54 Dark Soul and it can't bring himself to
1:16:55 do it
1:16:56 but I think a lot of people might be
1:16:58 missing the bigger point in the bigger
1:16:59 picture of what they lose out on by
1:17:02 hey yeah the the elders in the Camarilla
1:17:04 might be jerks but
1:17:06 there's there's connection under
1:17:10 the system as it is that disappears with
1:17:14 the Sabbat anyone who has a
1:17:16 you know a friend or somebody they talk
1:17:19 to somebody who makes them feel human
1:17:21 again gets snuffed out Johnny hearing
1:17:24 Neil's words kind of like grabs him or
1:17:28 gently takes him by the shoulder and
1:17:31 kind of squares up with him a little bit
1:17:33 as he's talking and shields him a little
1:17:36 bit from the The Gaze of dark Selena and
1:17:39 his posture kind of like becomes
1:17:42 infectious to kneel and as he begins in
1:17:46 a whisper like Johnny kind of like
1:17:48 encourages him to speak louder and let
1:17:51 those words that Neil is offering carry
1:17:53 amongst the rooftop I think uh I think a
1:17:56 lot of us uh have more connections to
1:17:59 human Humanity to the people that we
1:18:01 were to the people we want to be then
1:18:04 then even the most hardened of us might
1:18:05 actually even admit to ourselves but all
1:18:09 of that dies under the Sabbat I mean
1:18:11 they they can pretend that they want to
1:18:13 fight the Antideluvian they can even
1:18:16 believe that they want to fight the
1:18:17 antediluvians as much as they want to
1:18:19 but what are they even fighting for at
1:18:21 that point
1:18:23 Freedom under a crueler system
1:18:26 and and we've seen I've seen not not
1:18:29 secondhand not hearing about it we've
1:18:32 seen an antidology and die
1:18:34 so we know they can die
1:18:37 and it wasn't the Sabbat who killed them
1:18:41 so just
1:18:43 food for food for thought
1:18:45 any like kind of Withers a little bit
1:18:47 again Amaya very visibly puts her hand
1:18:50 over her heart and like
1:18:52 wounds as Neil preaches about
1:18:56 essentially Humanity Britta from her
1:18:59 presence within Johnny's mind I don't
1:19:01 really I guess I'm checking if this is
1:19:04 something I might be able to do if she
1:19:07 could try to hone in and focus and
1:19:10 provide
1:19:11 a stream of calm if she might be able to
1:19:14 try to find it within herself to reach
1:19:16 out and make a form of Touchstone that
1:19:20 he emotionally might be able to access
1:19:22 even if that's just flavor
1:19:26 thank God for my cotary
1:19:28 he looks up at dark Selena
1:19:31 I wish you had a Coterie like I have one
1:19:34 kind of looks around the whole rooftop
1:19:36 I wish you all had people like that to
1:19:38 rely on I hope you do
1:19:41 these two just reminded me
1:19:44 that we have so much more to live for
1:19:49 than the Jihad
1:19:51 it's eternal struggle
1:19:54 yeah we're ready to stop whatever is in
1:19:56 that house
1:19:57 we're ready to stop that Shard that came
1:20:00 from New York
1:20:02 but we're not going to be doing that
1:20:05 in service of this eternal struggle
1:20:08 because that's just putting snuffing out
1:20:10 one eldest
1:20:12 in favor of another
1:20:14 he kind of pointedly looks at dark
1:20:16 Selena
1:20:19 can I help you understand that
1:20:22 crowd kind of listens and one of the
1:20:26 Brujahh very young actually one that was
1:20:29 embraced to be turned over to Roman
1:20:32 Pendragon but hadn't before there was a
1:20:37 change in who was Prince this very very
1:20:41 young neon name kind of stands up and
1:20:44 says
1:20:46 we can't
1:20:48 beat the Shabbat and a Siege
1:20:52 half the people that are in this domain
1:20:54 are already planning to run
1:20:57 so what do we do
1:20:59 the crowd starts to look at miles
1:21:04 we don't expect everyone to fight
1:21:07 we want to
1:21:09 Empower and strengthen those that can
1:21:12 find people that they can rely on
1:21:14 develop skills for them also but for
1:21:19 those that are unable unwilling it's
1:21:22 just not their place in the society we
1:21:25 will do our best to protect them to
1:21:28 Shield them from this and moreover we're
1:21:31 not planning to fight a Siege we've got
1:21:33 other plans he offers the cigarette back
1:21:36 to uh dark Selena she accepts it takes a
1:21:39 drag
1:21:40 speaks
1:21:42 I think that's very brave
1:21:44 I can't even say that
1:21:46 I can respect it
1:21:49 it's like when hurricanes come by and
1:21:52 people don't want to leave their homes
1:21:55 they stubbornly set by the world they
1:21:57 know and hope that the world is still
1:21:59 going to be
1:22:00 when the storm blows over
1:22:03 but we're your neighbor
1:22:05 The Siege is never going to stop
1:22:09 you will never rest
1:22:11 you will never have a way out
1:22:14 I've accepted that existence a long time
1:22:16 ago and I just hope you're ready to
1:22:19 accept that yourselves
1:22:21 you may fight
1:22:24 for something other than service to the
1:22:27 eternal struggle
1:22:29 but that's no escape from it
1:22:33 no one
1:22:36 and I mean no one is turning the fight
1:22:39 back against us so this only goes one
1:22:42 way
1:22:43 and I hope you figure it out before
1:22:45 people you love disappear
1:22:48 so what you're saying is no one's free
1:22:49 from you
1:22:51 is that it
1:22:52 he shrugs
1:22:54 I'll let you come to your own
1:22:56 conclusions
1:22:57 and the door to the rooftop opens just
1:23:01 as the draconic starring that kneel is
1:23:05 hearing reaches this deafening Apex
1:23:10 and Roman Pendragon steps out onto the
1:23:12 roof with this look on his face like he
1:23:18 is ready
1:23:20 to kill every member of the Sabbat he
1:23:24 can get within Arm's Reach
1:23:26 and quietly and almost
1:23:30 unusually driven even by his standards
1:23:34 he simply approaches the circle
1:23:37 and starts to listen
