0:00:30 now let's walk the path of night
0:00:33 [Music]
0:00:40 last time on path of night
0:00:43 the cordery discussed Neil's Visions the
0:00:46 need to return to Hell House and plans
0:00:48 to fight the Sabbat
0:00:50 Johnny managed to convince the hesitant
0:00:53 Buddha to attend the rave
0:00:55 gave the group a rundown on who to
0:00:57 expect and how to behave the upcoming
0:01:00 Gathering
0:01:01 the following night the Corey arrived
0:01:03 with their dates miles with Amaya win
0:01:06 with weathers kneel with Jane and Britta
0:01:10 with Johnny
0:01:14 [Music]
0:01:21 thank you
0:01:23 [Music]
0:01:30 one at a time the group of you are
0:01:32 invited over to the VIP section
0:01:34 goals and service to Peru Hawk keep an
0:01:37 eye on it but it's got like a nice
0:01:39 casual feel the music isn't so loud that
0:01:41 you can't hear each other but you can
0:01:44 still kind of feel the thump and pulse
0:01:46 of the bass in a way that makes you feel
0:01:49 like you're still part of the party
0:01:50 that's going on when you get up there
0:01:52 there are some blood dolls that are
0:01:55 present
0:01:56 and as you pass by they each kind of
0:01:58 make a small pass that you hoping that
0:02:00 you'll give them a bit of the Ecstasy of
0:02:02 the kiss
0:02:03 but eventually you arrive to the couches
0:02:06 and the couches offer a view over the
0:02:10 thong of Mortals and Kindred
0:02:13 intermingling on the dance floor and
0:02:16 listening to the music
0:02:18 as the man of the hour
0:02:21 Johnny this space is largely yours
0:02:24 anyone you want is here anyone you don't
0:02:27 want is not
0:02:29 Johnny uh Paces around the area a little
0:02:32 bit
0:02:34 surveys out across the uh crowd and just
0:02:38 starts to kind of clock all of the
0:02:40 arrivals to the Rave what kind of
0:02:42 turnout are we looking at here turnout's
0:02:44 looking pretty heavy and there's a
0:02:47 number of bruh that have arrived from
0:02:50 some of the surrounding towns some of
0:02:53 the Kindred of over in Rhode Island
0:02:56 Providence you have Kindred from
0:02:59 Hartford Boston it's uh it's a bit of a
0:03:02 turnout it's pretty good seeing the
0:03:04 collection of bruja Johnny kind of nods
0:03:06 stands up on the balcony of this little
0:03:10 VIP area pop some morally into his mouth
0:03:13 lights up takes a long drag and then it
0:03:16 kind of turns back leaning against the
0:03:19 balcony to review the other other guests
0:03:22 in the VIP area who would you have
0:03:25 selected besides the codery dates of the
0:03:28 codery absolutely there's obviously
0:03:30 prominent bruja from the domain Amaya
0:03:33 the baron the former Sheriff weathers
0:03:36 Jane
0:03:37 through his position I think within the
0:03:40 city is a little bit questionable it
0:03:41 seems like she may have even gone anarch
0:03:43 at this point obviously
0:03:46 um there is uh there has been provision
0:03:48 made for other prominent bruja to be
0:03:51 able to come to the VIP area without any
0:03:53 problem uh like throw the pen Dragon if
0:03:56 he decides to show up brujov status from
0:03:59 the other nearby domains Hartford
0:04:02 Providence Boston
0:04:06 what do you think so far kid
0:04:09 I think if I mean it almost
0:04:13 it would be a lot of fun if I weren't
0:04:16 still kind of scared
0:04:18 yeah that's part of what makes it fun
0:04:20 lean into that
0:04:21 what do you want the play to be a Johnny
0:04:23 a plane have a good time make everyone
0:04:27 else feel like they're having a good
0:04:28 time
0:04:29 these things can get out of hand real
0:04:32 quick
0:04:33 my main job here is to keep the peace
0:04:36 if we can have even just a couple
0:04:38 conversations towards
0:04:41 this whole [ __ ] in the Northeast
0:04:43 trying to stop the Crusade this thing
0:04:45 will be a rip roaring success
0:04:48 but if uh bruja do like they do and this
0:04:52 thing breaks out into a riot before we
0:04:54 even get a chance to talk to anybody
0:04:57 well
0:04:59 Let's uh
0:05:01 let's try not to think about that
0:05:02 scenario I think the best that I can do
0:05:05 is go out and dance with people if
0:05:07 anyone gives you a hard time you just
0:05:10 give me a little away from down there
0:05:11 all right well like I said I was
0:05:14 thinking of pulling you down there with
0:05:15 me for a bit do you want to be the first
0:05:17 sense
0:05:18 I don't really damn
0:05:20 that was part of the agreement for me
0:05:22 coming
0:05:23 actually true
0:05:24 yeah that's fair deal kind of pipes up
0:05:27 in the wall and then like leans back
0:05:28 into the wall Johnny points a finger at
0:05:30 you and opens his mouth like he's gonna
0:05:32 say something and then kind of just
0:05:34 shuts his mouth
0:05:36 nice Neil
0:05:37 just let me all honest let me finish
0:05:39 this morally and then we'll go we'll go
0:05:41 have a dance all right friendly
0:05:43 conversations we're looking to cultivate
0:05:45 allies here
0:05:46 um
0:05:48 ultimately we wanted to see if we can at
0:05:51 least gain the support of some locals to
0:05:54 form a few strike teams I don't know if
0:05:57 there's any coderies as powerful as ours
0:05:59 but there's certainly some people who
0:06:01 have allies that can form small groups
0:06:04 that can be as as effective as we are
0:06:07 I'm hoping that at least the anarchs can
0:06:09 provide
0:06:10 I'm hoping that at least
0:06:12 some of the princes that have come up
0:06:14 from the uh East Coast might be able to
0:06:18 provide a couple of uh
0:06:20 groups
0:06:22 I don't know if there's any uh locals we
0:06:24 can help out with that too but make
0:06:26 friends establish Goodwill get Rapport
0:06:29 yeah exactly goes a long way speaking of
0:06:33 which you guys seen any of the uh
0:06:34 non-bruja in the area I I've been so
0:06:38 shoegazed that I haven't really looked I
0:06:41 haven't noticed anyone specifically I
0:06:43 can look but I I don't what else maybe
0:06:45 you take a look out to see if you see
0:06:47 any other princes who maybe uh got an
0:06:49 invite here I can take a look most the
0:06:51 time I just have people approach me
0:06:53 though and I'm not here as much well I
0:06:57 mean our how have people been treating
0:07:00 you here miles no they've been you know
0:07:03 generally just making fun of me in a
0:07:06 semi-good-natured way and I hear people
0:07:08 chanting [ __ ] the prince yeah I believe
0:07:10 so just tell them that they couldn't
0:07:12 handle it it was a large crowd I don't
0:07:14 think I could have been heard well not
0:07:16 with that attitude it's it's fine it
0:07:18 doesn't bother me he looks at wind like
0:07:20 I I I think I think it's not a bad
0:07:22 response if you get a little bit more
0:07:23 individualistically yeah we'll see what
0:07:25 happens do you try to keep things
0:07:26 good-natured yeah I feel like the crowd
0:07:29 here is uh at a good Pace right now but
0:07:32 things could start to get a little bit
0:07:33 out of hand if we are if we're not
0:07:35 careful speaking of good nature and
0:07:37 keeping his good natured you said this
0:07:38 was a a big sometimes crossed the sex uh
0:07:44 thing what happens if our um other
0:07:47 people show up and we'll have to play
0:07:49 that by ear won't we well I was asking
0:07:51 for some pointers now try to keep the
0:07:53 peace
0:07:55 tries to peek out at the crowd and see
0:07:59 if she can spot any big names either way
0:08:01 Wynn has kind of been hanging by the
0:08:03 curtain like yeah I I realize it's
0:08:06 important that we have a game plan but I
0:08:08 there's a lot of music playing it sounds
0:08:10 like a lot of fun and I really want to
0:08:11 go dance but she's waiting patiently but
0:08:15 she peeks out the curtain to kind of see
0:08:18 if there's any familiar faces from
0:08:20 across party lines Define a cross-party
0:08:23 lines known to be anarch or Sabbat give
0:08:27 me a perception alertness difficulty
0:08:29 nine does this count as a detail
0:08:32 uh no
0:08:33 [Music]
0:08:34 two successes
0:08:37 two successes now next I need you to
0:08:41 make a willpower rule of difficulty each
0:08:43 of you can we spend for it yes
0:08:50 one success two successes
0:08:52 okay
0:08:53 so you two spot something uh the vast
0:08:56 majority of people who are enjoying
0:08:57 their time don't notice a thing but
0:09:00 shouldering their way through the crowd
0:09:03 dressed in all black all tech gear with
0:09:08 skeletal Moz depicted on face masks that
0:09:12 are covering their mouths is a crew of
0:09:17 Kindred four of them in all and it seems
0:09:21 as though the every single person they
0:09:24 bump into did not see them as they
0:09:28 approached and there is this aura about
0:09:31 the space around them that forces the
0:09:35 worlds to largely ignore their presence
0:09:37 this is not obfusky Johnny they are
0:09:41 headed to you there's some people coming
0:09:44 uh skull masks people don't seem to
0:09:47 notice them but it's not like when they
0:09:48 don't notice Neil any thoughts she kind
0:09:51 of motions for with her head for Johnny
0:09:53 to come over and Britta moves out of the
0:09:55 way to trade places Johnny uh walks up
0:09:58 next to the two of you takes a lookout
0:09:59 oh you'd have to make the same two rules
0:10:01 Johnny just glances out at the crowd
0:10:04 and goes you know there's a lot of
0:10:06 there's a lot of danger out there
0:10:07 something's coming here they can find me
0:10:09 well looks like that's what they're
0:10:11 trying to do Johnny goes and takes a
0:10:13 seat facing the entrance to uh to the
0:10:15 VIP and keeps smoking is morally
0:10:18 hey Neil uh yeah you do me a favor of
0:10:22 course remember about a month or so back
0:10:24 you uh you did something to help keep me
0:10:27 a little bit cooler than I usually am
0:10:30 you you want me to dude that was I need
0:10:36 to keep my wits about me
0:10:37 you can uh
0:10:39 you can help just take the edge off I
0:10:41 think it's gonna be in everyone's
0:10:42 interest tonight I I guess new looks
0:10:45 totally surprised that Johnny is asking
0:10:47 him to do that or seems at all
0:10:49 comfortable with that idea but nods
0:10:52 quickly like a couple sharp nods and
0:10:53 then goes and sort of Johnny's sitting
0:10:55 in a chair right right now yeah he goes
0:10:57 and sort of like crouches down so that
0:10:59 he's kind of eye to eye with Johnny and
0:11:02 just starts talking slowly and smoothly
0:11:04 it's like so all you really have to do
0:11:08 just remember that you are you and
0:11:12 you're in control and don't worry about
0:11:15 everything that's coming don't worry
0:11:17 about the potential chaos of tonight
0:11:19 just one foot in front of you and just
0:11:21 don't get mad okay just just don't get
0:11:23 mad
0:11:24 so Lex with those words I'm going to use
0:11:28 the passion to try and keep Johnny calm
0:11:31 go ahead
0:11:32 two successes you'll be under its effect
0:11:35 for the next hour
0:11:37 that's kind of all we need right they
0:11:40 don't know release in the next hour
0:11:43 so yeah Neil's voice starts to get
0:11:46 inside Johnny and your emotions are
0:11:51 deadened Johnny kinda reaches out and
0:11:54 gives Neil light kind of like punch on
0:11:56 the shoulder thanks man oh did it not
0:11:59 work oh it worked beautifully
0:12:02 I feel centered uh good okay good great
0:12:05 win kind of takes a position parallel
0:12:08 with the entrance of the curtain that
0:12:10 way people walking in won't see she's
0:12:11 immediately there but she's not
0:12:13 attempting to hide Britta sort of
0:12:15 counters taking a position that looks
0:12:19 like she's kind of adjusting her heel
0:12:21 but in reality she's keeping an eye out
0:12:23 towards the crowd and where The Mortals
0:12:25 are in case there's an effect kneel's up
0:12:28 against the wall like it usually is
0:12:30 now I'm just hanging out waiting to see
0:12:32 what happens next
0:12:33 for those of you who are keeping track
0:12:37 of these Mass figures they get to the
0:12:40 point where they have arrived to the
0:12:43 pathway to the VIP section and there's
0:12:46 like these uh these small metal
0:12:48 structures that are kind of meant to
0:12:49 kind of guide people around and make
0:12:51 sure that they're not you know trying to
0:12:54 slip into the VIP area
0:12:56 and they kind of hop them one at a time
0:12:59 and
0:13:00 when the fourth one hops
0:13:03 and they land you hear the sound of
0:13:07 Spurs
0:13:12 and from there they enter the VIP
0:13:16 section and whatever it was that had
0:13:19 concealed their presence moments ago
0:13:22 fades
0:13:24 and there are four individuals
0:13:26 dress and tackier armed but not overly
0:13:31 sewn there's no like assault rifles or
0:13:34 anything like that where they each
0:13:36 clearly have like a sidearm that they're
0:13:38 carrying with them
0:13:40 and the gear they're wearing has some
0:13:44 variation to it along all in all you
0:13:46 kind of get the vibe that they are some
0:13:49 sort of unit together
0:13:51 one of them
0:13:52 not the one with Spurs
0:13:55 takes a step forward
0:13:57 pulls the mask off his mouth
0:14:01 to speak
0:14:03 and
0:14:04 addresses the group of you
0:14:08 he turns to Johnny Johnny
0:14:10 seated in a large chair legs spread
0:14:15 apart and kind of just lounging in it
0:14:17 like Conan in the Throne of aqualonia as
0:14:20 they actually approach him to talk he'll
0:14:23 actually stand up and actually come down
0:14:26 walking towards them so that they're not
0:14:28 addressing him on a throne but actually
0:14:30 speaking person to person
0:14:33 he says to you my name is Envoy
0:14:36 and I represent the interests of the
0:14:38 Black Hand
0:14:40 and you would pulse a glove off of his
0:14:43 right hand and reveals a black crescent
0:14:46 moon tattoo that curves around the line
0:14:49 of his palm
0:14:51 Johnny glances at the black moon
0:14:53 tattooed to his hand and then glances
0:14:56 over at the individual wearing spurs
0:15:00 he uh offers a hand to Envoy while
0:15:04 maintaining eye contact on the on the
0:15:07 one wearing spurs if you come in peace
0:15:09 and you're here to party and talk you're
0:15:12 all welcome
0:15:13 he shakes your hand
0:15:14 we are here to speak
0:15:16 we have arrived in peace we believe in
0:15:18 peace but we are here to Parlay
0:15:21 regarding War
0:15:22 okay
0:15:24 I'm all ears we have been sent here to
0:15:27 discuss terms of peace
0:15:30 once the bruhar gathered for Rave
0:15:33 are you going to introduce me to the
0:15:34 rest of your uh your party here
0:15:37 aside from one my companions have not
0:15:39 arrived with names
0:15:40 but he gestures to the man in Spurs who
0:15:46 steps forward and as he removes his mask
0:15:50 the obfuscate neck and seals his
0:15:54 identity drops and you clearly recognize
0:15:58 your sire
0:16:00 I think you know who I am I remember you
0:16:03 I don't think I'll ever forget you
0:16:06 Welcome to The Rave
0:16:09 curious to be here
0:16:12 I see your quarter is still intact he
0:16:14 kind of looks at each of you one at a
0:16:17 time this lingering leer
0:16:20 that passes from one to the next Bretta
0:16:23 tries not to brush her glove too much
0:16:25 against her skirt but there's that
0:16:28 little moment like she's just
0:16:30 remembering that she's wearing it Neil
0:16:32 tries to merge with the wallpaper behind
0:16:36 him unsuccessfully wind just meets The
0:16:39 Gaze with equal amounts of whatever he's
0:16:42 giving off he's like I don't know what
0:16:45 this is but you're looking at me so I'm
0:16:47 looking at you and looking at each other
0:16:48 I acknowledge that you're trying to
0:16:50 assert some sort of dominance but no I'm
0:16:52 also dominant I'll Stand ready where I
0:16:54 am and give him a little smirk
0:16:56 laughs
0:16:58 I'm sorry that yours isn't your pack
0:17:00 whatever you want to call it he gives
0:17:04 a shrug and says
0:17:06 kind of casually
0:17:10 I think they'll be proud of what happens
0:17:12 next
0:17:13 so I'm not really too worried about them
0:17:15 being gone
0:17:17 well what's gonna happen next
0:17:20 I'm curious I guess what happens next is
0:17:23 we wait for the rest of your guests to
0:17:25 arrive
0:17:26 and then you decide when it's time for
0:17:29 us to get down to business
0:17:31 I even liking New Haven so far Delgado
0:17:35 well it's kind of [ __ ] hole
0:17:39 I'm not gonna miss it
0:17:41 will you
0:17:42 hmm
0:17:43 I've even been exploring the uh
0:17:46 everything the city has to offer
0:17:48 some that's some great sites he might
0:17:50 have missed
0:17:51 and then you guys must have been hanging
0:17:53 out at Dunkin Donuts
0:17:54 is that what you call it
0:17:57 well
0:17:59 that's right that's where we find you
0:18:01 most of the time I don't know if that's
0:18:03 a brag you should be making what the you
0:18:05 hang out at Dunkin Donuts that's the
0:18:07 only time you ever find us no
0:18:10 no I was just curious if you've seen any
0:18:12 of the uh the weird things that uh
0:18:17 have been coming up from New York I mean
0:18:19 beside yourselves
0:18:21 what are you trying to get it
0:18:24 bicycle it
0:18:25 do you know uh do you know what street
0:18:28 that's over on uh the South End Ogden
0:18:32 Street
0:18:33 there's uh a bit of a pause that happens
0:18:36 between the group and it's hard to make
0:18:39 out these
0:18:41 semi-quick glances subtle gesture a
0:18:44 meeting of the eyes
0:18:46 and
0:18:48 in unison
0:18:50 there's a single nod
0:18:52 so you are aware of one two three Ogden
0:18:55 Street that house that stands alone
0:18:59 filled with that thing
0:19:02 piece of something that's been spreading
0:19:06 out from New York
0:19:08 be so what Johnny
0:19:10 a piece of an anti-diluvian
0:19:14 Johnny he's his eyes are boring in to
0:19:17 see if that gets any kind of reaction
0:19:19 out of him give me a perception plus
0:19:23 empathy check
0:19:25 difficulty six you are making a
0:19:28 contested rule would serve Sabbat
0:19:30 Survivor give me any edge here I will
0:19:34 call it defy for you
0:19:41 two successes with two successes you
0:19:45 don't really get a read aside from this
0:19:48 kind of instinctual contempt for the
0:19:51 word
0:19:52 not that like oh how dare you say it no
0:19:55 no no no no
0:19:56 it is the look someone gives before
0:20:00 spitting on the ground like someone
0:20:01 cursed but then he looks at miles
0:20:04 into the living huh
0:20:07 apparently
0:20:08 are you not sure
0:20:10 I haven't met it personally
0:20:12 that's not true
0:20:13 we cut down a huge piece of it
0:20:16 John it seems like your Camarillo
0:20:18 friends aren't really back in your play
0:20:20 here
0:20:20 you want to regroup
0:20:22 no they're just not as uh Devil May care
0:20:25 with tossing around stupid words
0:20:28 also trust Johnny to make his own
0:20:30 decisions
0:20:31 that thing had spread to the uh Chantry
0:20:35 here in New Haven what do you think the
0:20:37 Joe scenes are going to prioritize I'm
0:20:39 not talking about joseon's I'm talking
0:20:41 about this thing well you're in a room
0:20:44 where the prince who is the head of the
0:20:47 joseon's child stop deflecting about the
0:20:50 conversation do not talk and what to say
0:20:53 and not say I don't give a [ __ ] what
0:20:55 Rave you're ahead of I will step on your
0:20:58 [ __ ] neck and kill everything you
0:20:59 care about including your daughter
0:21:02 [ __ ] interrupt me
0:21:06 Johnny takes a step towards him your
0:21:09 [ __ ] Prince
0:21:10 is the child of a joseon the [ __ ]
0:21:14 leader of them
0:21:15 do you think your boy sire is going to
0:21:19 do what's right for your town or do you
0:21:22 think he's going to shut you the [ __ ] up
0:21:24 for saying that word Bretta puts a hand
0:21:26 on Johnny's bicep just a gentle touch to
0:21:30 say hey metaphorically take a breath he
0:21:33 glances back at her and kind of gives
0:21:35 her a quick smile nod Envoy kinda is
0:21:39 like giving this look as though he is
0:21:42 checking on Gabriel in the very same way
0:21:45 we can Circle back to the politics
0:21:48 involved with this
0:21:50 but what I'm curious about
0:21:53 is what the [ __ ] are you planning to do
0:21:55 about this thing
0:21:58 anything that's done to address him
0:22:01 happens once the city is secured
0:22:04 if you'd like to get that done by all
0:22:06 means step aside isn't New York secure
0:22:11 I thought that's firmly in your grip
0:22:13 New York is secure because that's where
0:22:16 this thing is coming from
0:22:18 so these little pieces
0:22:20 are just parts of that greater hole
0:22:22 that's in your [ __ ] backyard
0:22:25 that's a bit of an oversimplification
0:22:27 how so
0:22:29 well in the book of Nod how many inter
0:22:31 deluvians were born and raised New
0:22:33 Yorkers
0:22:34 none
0:22:35 I mean so maybe there's a little more at
0:22:37 play
0:22:39 than you think and maybe you're right
0:22:42 something needs to be done a wholesale
0:22:45 business handled where that business
0:22:47 gets handled when the camera steps aside
0:22:51 goes back to Europe and plays tea party
0:22:54 over there where [ __ ] doesn't matter
0:22:57 have your politics have your elders have
0:23:00 all of your games over in the countries
0:23:04 that aren't [ __ ] War zones it's funny
0:23:06 because I'm the one trying to talk to
0:23:07 you about a serious issue here and
0:23:09 you're the one that told me not to talk
0:23:11 when you had politics you had to mention
0:23:13 bringing up [ __ ] like the joseon's
0:23:15 and all that make warning me about
0:23:17 politics you're the one that's worried
0:23:20 about politics they're not apart from
0:23:22 each other
0:23:23 you think I want to be here putting down
0:23:26 some young blood kindred
0:23:29 if you think that's a good use of my
0:23:31 [ __ ] time
0:23:32 you're absolutely right Johnny there are
0:23:34 more important things to do but until
0:23:37 these things he kind of gestures to the
0:23:40 camera La bruja are done
0:23:43 my time is being wasted if I'm being
0:23:46 honest
0:23:46 I think you love being bossed around to
0:23:50 pick on other people
0:23:52 who doesn't want to be a bully sometimes
0:23:54 he kind of like gives a shrug
0:23:57 we don't whine and complain about our
0:23:59 system we're not Camarillo yeah you
0:24:02 double talk like the best of them though
0:24:04 that's all canines
0:24:06 um
0:24:08 so what game exactly is the black hand
0:24:11 playing here
0:24:12 for now a polite request to go away seed
0:24:17 the territory
0:24:19 you know the math is against you
0:24:21 you know
0:24:23 that a good chunk of this domain will
0:24:26 betray your cautery the moment they can
0:24:28 Japan okay
0:24:31 us being a looming threat is enough to
0:24:34 ensure the eventuality we don't even
0:24:36 really have to attack
0:24:39 just quicker and more fun that way
0:24:42 see
0:24:43 the guy you just got to it you are
0:24:45 having fun here aren't you
0:24:47 I already told you Johnny
0:24:49 it's a lot more fun than this about but
0:24:51 I think you know that
0:24:53 um
0:24:54 well I'm glad you're living up to your
0:24:56 potential old man you too Santa Shawn
0:25:01 so
0:25:03 you've got Envoy here it's a clever name
0:25:07 who are your other two friends they got
0:25:09 fun aliases as well not tonight you want
0:25:12 to introduce us
0:25:14 nope
0:25:15 someone interjects I'm kind of heads
0:25:18 over
0:25:19 and they kind of slip out from behind
0:25:22 this group of black hand agents
0:25:25 and when they do
0:25:27 you realize you hadn't really noticed
0:25:30 them through this conversation until
0:25:32 they make a point of revealing
0:25:33 themselves
0:25:35 and with a shotgun and hand
0:25:38 wathers gives you a nod
0:25:42 your deadbeat side giving you a hard
0:25:43 time
0:25:45 oh he's just telling me all the fun
0:25:47 things he's been up to since we last
0:25:48 caught up it's kind of uh
0:25:51 it's almost like a rule of the eyes
0:25:54 and after a moment of considering he
0:25:58 lowers his weapon
0:26:00 together well if you've ever had a
0:26:02 chance to meet uh
0:26:04 weather's here
0:26:06 there's a lock between the two and
0:26:08 Delgado says we know each other
0:26:12 Envoy speaks up as much as
0:26:15 it is interesting to see this
0:26:17 interaction I think
0:26:20 we should spend a little time mingling
0:26:22 and avoid keeping the host away from
0:26:25 this party
0:26:26 he says to Delgado now gotta gives him a
0:26:30 look like he might overrule him
0:26:32 it decides not to
0:26:34 who gives a nod looks at you looks at
0:26:37 weathers it's not really sure what your
0:26:39 view he kind of gives a dirtier look to
0:26:41 Johnny Johnny gives this shit-eating
0:26:43 grin and kind of steps forward and gives
0:26:46 like a friendly Pat on envoy's shoulder
0:26:50 maybe a little bit too hard but
0:26:52 definitely of intended to look like a
0:26:55 friendly gesture
0:26:57 well look at that this whole Rave could
0:27:00 have gone tits up it wasn't for the
0:27:01 political Brilliance of the black hand
0:27:04 here thanks for uh for making that
0:27:06 suggestion Envoy you guys go uh have a
0:27:08 fun time he kind of like pulls him close
0:27:10 and kind of like grips his shoulders and
0:27:12 like gives him a good Shake
0:27:15 seems to hug you and you can feel him
0:27:18 smile
0:27:20 there's a light Pat and he turns and
0:27:24 gives his fellows a nod and they start
0:27:27 heading off question did on voice voice
0:27:30 sound familiar at all
0:27:33 no no it sounds like a pretty generic
0:27:36 person hmm
0:27:39 once they're fully out of line of sight
0:27:43 Brita from where she was standing and
0:27:46 Johnny had walked forwards kind of comes
0:27:49 up now behind him and says hang on and
0:27:53 she wants to kind of look at his jacket
0:27:56 she would have seen a smile on envoy's
0:27:58 face and she's
0:28:00 just feeling paranoid about that hug
0:28:02 like like if I guess it's too modern a
0:28:05 thought of whether a Tracker would be
0:28:07 placed but she's having that kind of
0:28:08 what did he do feeling okay I suppose it
0:28:14 makes sense to try out spirit's touch I
0:28:17 want to investigate what has happened
0:28:18 with this object that seems like a
0:28:20 natural time that that would like
0:28:22 manifest
0:28:23 so if I'm rolling for Spirits touch with
0:28:27 strong emotions
0:28:29 again I think the first question I have
0:28:31 to ask is is this detail oriented so the
0:28:35 special I'm going to say yes the spec
0:28:36 will apply uh you reduce the difficulty
0:28:39 by your aspects rating to a minimum of
0:28:41 three okay so difficulty three then
0:28:47 10 successes
0:28:51 [Music]
0:28:54 the first thing you know is that the
0:28:56 last person
0:28:58 to touch the jacket doesn't matter the
0:29:00 most powerful emotion is that of envoy
0:29:04 an Envoy
0:29:06 gives an emotion of secret Glee
0:29:10 of joy
0:29:12 a desire for Ultra violence and
0:29:16 long-term intentions for the man wearing
0:29:19 the jacket
0:29:21 like like a new obsession
0:29:24 and underneath all of this
0:29:26 is an unspeakable
0:29:29 earth-shattering rage
0:29:32 I need you to make a frenzy check at
0:29:34 difficulty nine I'm gonna spend a
0:29:36 willpower and if you succeed
0:29:38 you'll get the rest of the information
0:29:40 if you fail you'll be too busy
0:29:43 self-control right yes
0:29:48 good thing I spent a willpower one
0:29:49 success with one success you managed to
0:29:53 not give in to her age
0:29:56 and your spirit's touch warns you that
0:29:59 Johnny was just in the embrace
0:30:03 of dark Selena
0:30:08 you feel Britta come up and say hang on
0:30:12 and there's a light touch again this
0:30:14 time to the back of your shoulder and
0:30:16 she seems like she intends on being
0:30:18 investigative
0:30:19 but something in her focuses that you
0:30:22 haven't quite seen before it reminds you
0:30:26 of when she is otherwise using her
0:30:29 aspects to delve deeper into what she
0:30:31 can see and what she can perceive but
0:30:33 there's something more emotional more
0:30:35 connective than before and as she delves
0:30:40 deeper into that feeling there's a
0:30:43 tension at first in her fingertips then
0:30:46 a trembling and bird a just barely
0:30:50 manages to pull back in what might have
0:30:54 been an explosion of rage and as she
0:30:56 processes that her eyes go very very
0:30:59 wide and she takes her hand away from
0:31:03 your jacket and
0:31:06 holds it very tight to herself
0:31:08 and double checks whether or not they
0:31:11 were really out of line of line of sight
0:31:13 even though she checked that before and
0:31:16 once she's feeling more certain how loud
0:31:19 is the music
0:31:21 does it provide any buffer like at the
0:31:23 club it's actually almost to the point
0:31:26 uh-huh it is it works exactly as you
0:31:29 would hope it would for the sake of
0:31:31 preventing eavesdropping this is the VIP
0:31:34 section there is currently no one else
0:31:36 that is not an ally of the codery that
0:31:39 is correct this is a now that Envoy has
0:31:42 left this is a perfectly safe Zone okay
0:31:46 despite that Britta still grabs Johnny's
0:31:49 arm and this is likely to fail due to
0:31:52 Johnny but is looking to try to drag him
0:31:54 to a corner of the VIP to tell him A
0:31:58 hurried and immediate secret Johnny
0:32:00 remains where he's standing the hell are
0:32:03 you doing
0:32:04 Johnny that wasn't that's not I'm I know
0:32:07 I'm fine I know on voice sounds like a
0:32:09 fake name that is a fake name I I
0:32:11 understand it's a fake name but that
0:32:13 that was
0:32:14 yeah it's a fake name and it's a a fake
0:32:16 persona the fact that they were all kind
0:32:18 of moving in sync I thought it was the
0:32:20 the people what are you trying to get to
0:32:22 that was Sark Selena Johnny goes very
0:32:25 stiff as you mentioned that name again
0:32:28 and his eyes immediately cast over
0:32:31 towards Neil Neil's eyes are wise not in
0:32:36 shock but in like proximity dark Selena
0:32:39 is dead no she is not back Johnny that
0:32:43 was her and she she took a really strong
0:32:46 interest in you Polonia was waiting on
0:32:50 her so was the vicos that Jenny's
0:32:52 eyebrow kind of lifts a little bit in
0:32:54 his head [ __ ] she took an interest in
0:32:56 me Neil also looks a bit at that she
0:33:00 um like like she I could feel what she
0:33:04 was planning maybe for New Haven or for
0:33:07 the area or for the violence that she
0:33:09 wants to do here or
0:33:10 that kind of thing that rage and all
0:33:13 that but undercurrent that was yeah she
0:33:16 she Johnny stares at Bretta
0:33:20 [ __ ] you actually saw that like you saw
0:33:23 saw that I don't know I haven't I
0:33:26 haven't done that before I just it I
0:33:28 felt it through your jacket but Dr
0:33:30 Selena took a shine to me he kind of
0:33:32 like Smiles a little bit Johnny no now
0:33:34 that's [ __ ] crazy yup that's how it's
0:33:38 described I don't think that's a good
0:33:40 thing
0:33:42 but like this is the day the dangerous
0:33:45 side effect of that by the way is not
0:33:46 reacting with the intensity that maybe
0:33:48 you should react to news like this no
0:33:50 it's just you know it's kind of weird
0:33:51 When someone tells you the Grim Reaper
0:33:53 just shook your hand and that they kind
0:33:56 of liked you oh she I feel a little bit
0:33:58 Invincible okay let's go dance okay all
0:34:01 right hold on hold the phone so what do
0:34:04 we do with this information other than
0:34:06 take it as a compliment or Panic about
0:34:10 it find Roman and tell him that his sire
0:34:12 is here before he [ __ ] gets here and
0:34:14 things go really crazy uh also the
0:34:16 knowledge that we have that she's back
0:34:18 doesn't leave this room I feel like
0:34:19 somebody as old and powerful and taking
0:34:22 pains to hide her identity as dark
0:34:24 Selena is not gonna be cool with us
0:34:26 walking around being like hey do you
0:34:27 guys know dark Selena's here no Johnny
0:34:30 looks over at weathers he's gone oh okay
0:34:33 I'm gonna turn the cell phone on Greta
0:34:36 hasn't turned on the cell phone since
0:34:38 you look around and realize at some
0:34:43 point in this conversation weather's
0:34:45 left
0:34:46 and you take out your phone
0:34:49 there is a missed message
0:34:51 and that's it Brita doesn't seem to know
0:34:54 whether to listen to that right now or
0:34:57 not does it show a time I does not okay
0:35:01 your phone was off Brita turns the
0:35:04 volume lower and plays it for reference
0:35:06 I'm putting hiding senses up I am
0:35:07 entitled to this information too
0:35:10 did you do this for any of the weird
0:35:12 people that just came up by the way
0:35:14 yeah yeah just wanted to make sure
0:35:17 I can't bust dark Selena's [ __ ] man but
0:35:19 like there's a there's a there's a uh a
0:35:22 balcony and a roof if you want a better
0:35:24 spot where you can actually hear that
0:35:26 above the music
0:35:28 um if I go and I hear that above the
0:35:30 music other people might too
0:35:33 of us could step out of the room and
0:35:35 give her some privacy no I it's it's you
0:35:39 guys I'm just gonna
0:35:41 can you not guys just not be weird about
0:35:43 it I guarantee they cannot I don't know
0:35:46 what you're talking about being weird
0:35:46 about you'll know all right I'm gonna go
0:35:49 I'm gonna go out and mingle okay um I'll
0:35:51 be too far behind Dan Slater okay
0:35:55 is there anyone else that we're telling
0:35:57 that you guys could tell instead of
0:35:59 looking at me like that Johnny is
0:36:01 already walking out of the VIP down to
0:36:03 the uh to the dance area miles he
0:36:06 probably shouldn't be alone huh
0:36:07 are you asking me to go or volunteering
0:36:10 to go I was just making a comment I'm
0:36:12 gonna go this is getting weird okay Neil
0:36:15 doesn't make any movements to leave
0:36:16 Bruno do you want me to go it's you're
0:36:19 not gonna hurt my feelings if the answer
0:36:20 is yes and if you did they grow back I
0:36:23 have fortitude I still don't think
0:36:25 that's how that works but
0:36:27 um this is
0:36:28 Johnny is the priority right now okay I
0:36:31 just opens and starts playing it you're
0:36:34 a woman's voice and she says
0:36:37 call your cell phone number when you get
0:36:40 this she hangs up okay that's fine who's
0:36:43 that I mean I presume that's Maria who
0:36:46 is Maria the Pendragon school oh do you
0:36:50 want this to be a question and answer
0:36:51 session Britta I am just trying to
0:36:55 guys is this like a text Oracle
0:36:57 situation the lady said call you should
0:37:00 call Great cool and she she calls it
0:37:04 goes to voicemail
0:37:07 I am leaving this voicemail British Just
0:37:09 Gonna Leave This voicemail did it sound
0:37:12 like Maria's I'm not picking up did it
0:37:15 sound like Maria's voice yes the person
0:37:19 that had called you was Maria hey it's
0:37:21 Bretta and
0:37:23 it's an emergency I I just
0:37:26 Prince Pendragon should know that
0:37:28 that dark Selena is alive and she's at
0:37:31 the right what did we just talk about
0:37:32 the wind collapsed her hand over Neil's
0:37:35 mouth and motions for Brita to hurry up
0:37:37 we
0:37:39 that's all if you could please pass on
0:37:41 that message bye
0:37:43 and she hangs up when uncovers his mouth
0:37:46 I thought we talked about not telling
0:37:48 anyone that you talked about that we we
0:37:51 all agreed that he should know but I
0:37:54 thought you meant no one else outside
0:37:56 the room after we all made the agreement
0:37:57 and said it I said nobody should we
0:38:00 shouldn't talk about it directly after
0:38:03 because
0:38:04 she's like a should he know that he's
0:38:07 walking into a room with someone who
0:38:08 might try to kill him or not probably
0:38:11 then here we go that's what we talked I
0:38:14 don't know I just I thought I got
0:38:16 I thought we weren't telling anyone and
0:38:19 like a phone call well you thought wrong
0:38:21 because then Maria would know Neil you
0:38:24 can freak out over here I'm gonna go and
0:38:27 do the whole thing that we're here to do
0:38:28 that I didn't even want to be here and
0:38:30 I'm just gonna go and do that and Bretta
0:38:33 like takes her phone and she kind of
0:38:36 Clips it onto the top of her boot so
0:38:38 that it's out the way and she goes off
0:38:40 to join the dance floor as soon as as
0:38:42 she walks out the room Neil looks at
0:38:44 Wings she I feel like she's mad at me
0:38:46 when kind of looks
0:38:49 for the words for a minute to say the
0:38:51 situation with Pendragon was tense would
0:38:54 be an understatement I saw it no you
0:38:57 didn't see all of it what did I see I'm
0:39:00 not telling you that's for her to know
0:39:01 that's for her to share when and where
0:39:03 didn't I see it though when probably
0:39:04 when you were flipping your beanie in
0:39:06 New York City
0:39:08 she made a phone call it didn't go the
0:39:11 way she planned like by a mile and if
0:39:15 she wants to talk about it with you you
0:39:17 can you are a free man to bring it up
0:39:19 with her and see what she says
0:39:21 maybe I'll do that that's up to you man
0:39:25 but know that it is something she is
0:39:27 struggling with emotionally it is not
0:39:30 information that she wants to share
0:39:33 what does it matter it does no no yep
0:39:36 when
0:39:38 all information is relevant to us to
0:39:41 keep us safe
0:39:42 you never know what details are
0:39:43 important I see where you're coming from
0:39:45 I'm not gonna let a little slip up of me
0:39:50 hesitating and not paying attention hurt
0:39:52 us again so I'm gonna go talk to Britta
0:39:55 maybe looks at Neil very heavily
0:39:59 she is here doing the job for the codery
0:40:02 and the domain that she is here for if
0:40:04 you distract her from that because you
0:40:07 somehow think you are entitled to all
0:40:09 the details of her life then what do you
0:40:11 think she's going to be more mad about
0:40:13 spoiler alert that
0:40:16 she can be mad and alive just like the
0:40:19 rest of you okay I'm gonna go because
0:40:21 we're supposed to be mingling you're
0:40:23 supposed to do that too I was going to
0:40:24 and I had to stay here to babysit you
0:40:26 because you somehow just go why are you
0:40:28 interrupting me because we've got stuff
0:40:31 to do we do have stuff to do and one of
0:40:33 your things to do is gather information
0:40:34 not about Brita because we can do that
0:40:37 later
0:40:38 because if you do your job right here
0:40:40 you will be able to talk to her later if
0:40:43 I do my job I know I I agree I agree
0:40:47 that's why when gives him another stern
0:40:50 look
0:40:52 do what I need to do
0:40:54 okay
0:40:56 somebody's gonna watch out for everybody
0:40:57 it's funny that you think none of us do
0:40:59 I think everybody does
0:41:02 in our own ways and I think I'm gonna
0:41:05 I don't think this conversation is going
0:41:07 the way I want it to go so um
0:41:10 balcony and I'm gonna go just look
0:41:13 around good plan I'm gonna
0:41:15 yep
0:41:17 and he does not move at first like just
0:41:20 waiting for her to move first and not
0:41:22 really sure what he's supposed to do 100
0:41:25 breaks first and then goes and walks
0:41:27 over onto the balcony
0:41:32 when follows him out closes the curtain
0:41:35 and heads to the dance floor she's kind
0:41:37 of got an eye peeled for weathers but
0:41:39 looking for groups that seem fun you go
0:41:42 and search of weathers and actually you
0:41:45 find him
0:41:47 talking to Jane and a couple of the
0:41:49 other bruja and he is passing them these
0:41:55 shells like the shells of like a shotgun
0:41:58 and you recognize them and they are the
0:42:03 same type of shells that Johnny had used
0:42:06 quite some time ago to unleash a fire
0:42:10 instead of pellets
0:42:12 when firing a shotgun and it seems like
0:42:16 for whatever reason he has decided that
0:42:18 he wants his crew loaded up with
0:42:21 dragon's breath rounds for the Rave
0:42:23 meeting
0:42:24 [Laughter]
0:42:26 shots I was anticipating doing tonight
0:42:28 but Count Me In he looks over his
0:42:30 shoulder at you and he's like nope
0:42:32 you're a guest your job is to look
0:42:35 pretty dance and have fun well I can do
0:42:37 a couple of those he holds his hand out
0:42:40 and he's like show me she takes his hand
0:42:42 and brings him to the dance floor wind
0:42:45 does not dance well but she dances with
0:42:47 commitment
0:42:49 her basic moves seem to be just kind of
0:42:53 moving she doesn't really have a
0:42:56 choreography in her mind she's just kind
0:42:58 of like letting the music decide which
0:43:00 parts of her body are moving almost like
0:43:02 she's trying to be back at Woodstock had
0:43:05 circumstances ended differently weathers
0:43:09 is a talented dancer but he doesn't
0:43:11 really show off he's not like trying to
0:43:14 like impress a crowd or anything like
0:43:16 that he's just a very very close
0:43:19 confident dancer and is very good about
0:43:23 making you just kind of feel very
0:43:25 comfortable
0:43:26 and while you're dancing he asks you
0:43:30 how Sheriff she kind of moves in closer
0:43:34 nominally under the guise of having him
0:43:36 show her how to be a better dancer um
0:43:39 it's
0:43:41 I think if we weren't staring down this
0:43:43 particular Barrel I think it would be a
0:43:45 good place for me but I think I'm
0:43:47 suffering from the same problem as you
0:43:49 what's that
0:43:51 we care too much hmm
0:43:54 and the people who don't care have us
0:43:56 over a barrel I think that's the problem
0:43:58 with Sheriff
0:44:00 I'm gonna be honest with you you have to
0:44:02 care enough but not too much well I
0:44:05 don't think there's a balance
0:44:07 you're either a good sheriff and you
0:44:09 burn out because of how Shady the
0:44:10 situation always seems to be oh you're a
0:44:13 bad sheriff if not a damn thing gets
0:44:15 done
0:44:16 which one you want to be he kind of
0:44:19 gives a shrug and dances with you
0:44:23 I want to be me
0:44:25 I want to find I want to find a way to
0:44:28 keep everyone safe
0:44:30 I think that's you picking which one
0:44:32 yeah probably how do you get your hips
0:44:35 to move like that
0:44:36 stop thinking about him I've been told
0:44:39 you should try to write your name with
0:44:40 your ass but I've never found that works
0:44:42 who the hell told you that I don't know
0:44:44 it was probably someone out of thing
0:44:46 what kind of thing a gang girl thing
0:44:49 like one of these are these gang girl
0:44:51 things we do a lot of [ __ ] at these
0:44:53 things we just do whatever we want well
0:44:56 obviously because yours is a lot better
0:44:58 I'll write your name with your hips okay
0:45:01 whose name should I write with my hips
0:45:03 no one's name you should write my name
0:45:06 get away from my girl
0:45:10 staff Taps happen whether it's your
0:45:16 [ __ ] whether she ignorant [ __ ]
0:45:20 so how do you know Delgado
0:45:22 Delgado and I have the same sire
0:45:25 who's that
0:45:27 I probably shouldn't say he kind of
0:45:30 gives you like a smile and Twirls you
0:45:33 I can respect that
0:45:35 are you the older brother or the younger
0:45:37 brother
0:45:38 which one do you think you got big older
0:45:41 brother Vibes man
0:45:42 I appreciate that
0:45:44 [Laughter]
0:45:47 I never had either one
0:45:49 sure
0:45:50 never had it that I don't know
0:45:52 messiah's Dad can't ask him
0:45:55 so what's your relationship like with
0:45:57 your quotery
0:45:58 who's your big brother and who's your
0:46:00 little brother well I'm Mommy so none of
0:46:03 them are my brothers yeah I bet
0:46:06 I don't know miles and Johnny kind of
0:46:09 probably take my brother rolls
0:46:11 we trade off who's older who's younger
0:46:15 Rita and Neil are the babies that I feel
0:46:18 like I need to take care of what's up
0:46:21 well every time I look away Neil is
0:46:23 somewhere he shouldn't be possibly dying
0:46:25 I need to get a holster for him honestly
0:46:28 saw a collar on him yeah I'm very
0:46:31 curious whose decision that was
0:46:33 his or someone else's
0:46:36 Jane was his date right yeah he kind of
0:46:38 like points off to her and she's like
0:46:40 she had she was bragging something about
0:46:42 that
0:46:43 honestly it probably makes him feel a
0:46:45 little better
0:46:47 it's a
0:46:49 it's good for him to know someone wants
0:46:51 him around
0:46:52 he always knows that we want him around
0:46:54 and that we miss him when he's gone but
0:46:56 he's still very quick to run away
0:47:00 Hey sir
0:47:02 I think he has a similar relationship to
0:47:04 his sire than I had with mine
0:47:07 and he's [ __ ] batshit
0:47:09 no offense I think he knows he
0:47:13 what flavor of batshit did he show you
0:47:17 nervous kind of like
0:47:19 with one word and gives a nod like in
0:47:22 one word nervous
0:47:24 Neil is the only one of them who knows
0:47:26 my
0:47:28 [ __ ] [ __ ] that I can't say
0:47:31 I think everybody has
0:47:34 this thing they've carried with them
0:47:37 from before the Embrace after everyone
0:47:40 has this thing they can't say so
0:47:44 I get it
0:47:45 yeah it's uh
0:47:48 it's driven a lot of who I am
0:47:51 and it was decidedly a bad thing but I
0:47:54 don't think that the path that put me on
0:47:56 turned me into a bad person
0:47:59 that's what I hope anyway
0:48:02 if you don't mind mask and there's a
0:48:04 rumor going around oh
0:48:06 it's about miles
0:48:08 um
0:48:09 the story has it that is Grace uh
0:48:14 committed a pretty heavy sin
0:48:17 and
0:48:19 this is true
0:48:21 why are you asking me and not him
0:48:24 well there's miles will say
0:48:27 what's best for Miles no offense he's
0:48:30 eventually
0:48:31 but I know that if I look you in the eye
0:48:34 you're not gonna [ __ ] me
0:48:37 he looks you in the eye
0:48:39 she looks back at him
0:48:41 what I will say
0:48:43 what miles does or doesn't do is not my
0:48:47 story to tell
0:48:49 I think that's answer enough
0:48:52 probably
0:48:54 there's another twirl it doesn't really
0:48:57 like break his interest and dancing with
0:49:01 him he's not offended by your preference
0:49:03 why um
0:49:06 Where Have You Been who have you been
0:49:08 running with all the good bruja in the
0:49:10 city or somewhere else now
0:49:13 I have been spending my time figuring
0:49:18 myself out
0:49:20 I think I did the camera thing for a
0:49:22 long time
0:49:23 I think I lost a lot in the process
0:49:27 and I hit this point where there wasn't
0:49:31 really anything left that was me
0:49:34 so that's what I'm trying to figure out
0:49:37 I think authenticity is probably one of
0:49:39 the most important things we've got
0:49:41 um
0:49:43 who we are beyond the beast that's true
0:49:47 and you lose it bit by bit
0:49:52 trying to look out for others
0:49:55 but eventually
0:49:57 you kind of realize that
0:50:00 you don't really have anything left to
0:50:02 help them with you depleted
0:50:04 can't serve from an empty bowl
0:50:07 that's right
0:50:09 so I'm trying to look out for Amaya
0:50:13 figure out what these anarchs are all
0:50:15 about I'll be honest I still don't
0:50:17 really get it
0:50:19 I Think It's oddly enough it's human
0:50:22 nature to want to put people into neat
0:50:24 little piles but real honestly nobody
0:50:27 can be so easily defined yeah yeah
0:50:31 I asked her to explain
0:50:33 why do you want no rules
0:50:36 and what she said to me was I do want
0:50:40 rules well of course I gave her [ __ ]
0:50:43 look for that
0:50:44 yeah the name would indicate otherwise
0:50:46 ma'am yeah
0:50:48 but she said that
0:50:50 her movement at least in her eyes isn't
0:50:54 about the elimination of rules
0:50:57 it's about acknowledging that the rules
0:50:59 as are don't work
0:51:02 she hasn't so much focused on tearing
0:51:05 the system down but figuring out what to
0:51:07 build when it's done
0:51:09 in some ways that makes sense to me
0:51:12 you know
0:51:14 Kindred have existed a lot longer than
0:51:17 the camera
0:51:19 and people look at the camera like it's
0:51:22 some final evolution the big solution to
0:51:26 the problem that is
0:51:28 the risk of being revealed but
0:51:32 there was a before the camera
0:51:36 there will be an after
0:51:38 ideally
0:51:40 why does that happen what form does that
0:51:42 take
0:51:43 I mean
0:51:45 talking to one of two Clans with change
0:51:47 as an innate part of their Beast
0:51:51 I don't think you change but from
0:51:52 without
0:51:54 oh I think a good chunkier clan went to
0:51:57 go make something else I
0:52:00 think a good chunk of my clan probably
0:52:02 had the right idea but poor execution
0:52:04 but I don't know what better choice they
0:52:07 had hmm
0:52:10 I think that the right answer
0:52:13 doesn't lie behind lying to people
0:52:16 or making certain
0:52:18 verbiages taboo
0:52:21 or we don't talk about that not in
0:52:23 polite company yeah
0:52:26 he's looking you in the eye
0:52:28 yup
0:52:31 you'd laughs
0:52:34 but there's also not sharing other
0:52:35 people's [ __ ]
0:52:37 I mean that's what everything is isn't
0:52:39 it kind of
0:52:40 would it bother you if this terrible
0:52:43 thing maybe miles did maybe he didn't
0:52:47 were true or false
0:52:49 well
0:52:50 see it like this
0:52:52 all we really are
0:52:55 are the things we believe in
0:52:58 because the truth everything outside of
0:53:00 that isn't great
0:53:03 what we do how we work how this happens
0:53:06 it's all bad the only thing we really
0:53:10 have is our ideas
0:53:13 and if we don't have that what am I
0:53:17 fighting for
0:53:19 after that it's just violence
0:53:22 for the sake of violence right
0:53:25 you can lose in the name of winning
0:53:28 and I don't want to do that
0:53:30 I'm right with you
0:53:33 you smoke
0:53:34 what
0:53:36 pulls out a pair of cigars yep
