0:00:24 you to feel the same so listener
0:00:26 discretion is advice now let's walk the
0:00:29 path of night
0:00:32 [Music]
0:00:39 last time on path of night after much
0:00:42 information sharing threats and conflict
0:00:45 between all parties Reiss detailed the
0:00:47 deal with the Giovanni and the tremeir
0:00:49 involving the trade of Eden
0:00:51 questions are raised about Ira's
0:00:53 presence in New Haven the change in veto
0:00:56 and other manifestations of this
0:00:57 institute Buddha's infiltration of the
0:01:00 Chantry and the anti-diluvian ravana
0:01:02 powering the storm over Sri Lanka
0:01:07 bonded as a Reiss prepared magic to
0:01:10 assist the quartering taking down Vita
0:01:13 the group began to prepare
0:01:18 [Music]
0:01:30 it's been a long night
0:01:33 and the group of you and knowing that
0:01:36 the hardest work is ahead
0:01:38 are already to the point of exhaustion
0:01:42 Rhys toils
0:01:44 waiting to see what the cautery will do
0:01:46 next
0:01:47 and one at a time as each of you have
0:01:50 made those final
0:01:53 preparations with just a few Deeds
0:01:57 remaining to be done
0:01:59 start finding yourselves inching more
0:02:01 and more closer to the exit
0:02:06 sharing silent looks with each other
0:02:08 kind of considering the road that has
0:02:11 brought you to this point
0:02:13 and as you
0:02:15 steal yourselves for what is to come
0:02:18 you notice that those sounds that echoed
0:02:22 for a while beyond the entrance point
0:02:25 beyond the vault door that has kept you
0:02:27 safe
0:02:28 those sounds have gone quiet
0:02:31 and whatever was there
0:02:33 either lies in wait
0:02:35 or is gone
0:02:37 Bretta is finishing up feeding when
0:02:40 she's about to drink something she hands
0:02:42 it off to Miles first to see if it might
0:02:45 be one that he would need
0:02:47 but presuming he gives it a little sniff
0:02:49 and hands it back starting a little
0:02:51 taste she lets him have the first sip of
0:02:53 her soda before going in
0:02:55 once she has done all that she can think
0:02:58 of physically she's been keeping the
0:03:00 dangerous glove kind of tucked under one
0:03:02 arm as if to be extra careful that it's
0:03:04 nowhere near Johnny but
0:03:07 she extends both hands looking at Reiss
0:03:10 as she faces The Amulet kind of asking a
0:03:13 silent permission should she be picking
0:03:15 that up there's a nod and she picks up
0:03:18 the amulet and carefully puts it on
0:03:21 arranging it outwards with that sense of
0:03:24 perfectionism as if that could help the
0:03:26 upcoming battle over the battle corset
0:03:28 she looks to the group
0:03:30 um the weather was fighting to get away
0:03:33 from that thing I noticed that I
0:03:36 wouldn't have any way out if we were
0:03:38 fighting in a hallway
0:03:41 um Ira or Orvis
0:03:45 um do you know of anywhere nearby that
0:03:47 would be a larger space that we could
0:03:49 fight in so we could surround it at
0:03:51 least so that we could have some amount
0:03:53 of movement
0:03:54 I mean I realize we might not
0:03:57 necessarily be able to get there so the
0:03:59 path there would have to be as safe as
0:04:01 well possible but oh
0:04:04 how certain are you that it'll come when
0:04:07 you call that we can even set the stage
0:04:10 I can summon him but he'll still have
0:04:13 that time to prepare and if he prepares
0:04:18 um it seems like any of the fungus is
0:04:21 kind of bioavailable to him the same way
0:04:24 that flesh would be and there's so much
0:04:26 of it and it seems to be growing so I
0:04:29 don't think that would really put too
0:04:30 much of a dent in his ability to grow
0:04:34 and become stronger
0:04:36 I'm also not sure how aware he is
0:04:41 through that fungus
0:04:43 he might well be able to see or hear us
0:04:45 depending I'm not I don't know if it's
0:04:47 an omnipresence or whether it has to be
0:04:50 activated but it's possible that he as
0:04:54 soon as we leave this place
0:04:56 can hear us see us that kind of thing
0:05:01 taking that into account Ira looks a
0:05:04 little alarmed by the idea that like
0:05:06 this guy could have sensory organs
0:05:08 everywhere or whatever the [ __ ] he
0:05:10 furrows his brow and well
0:05:13 then perhaps it's best if you think so
0:05:18 to head to seem to be heading to a
0:05:21 location that way
0:05:24 stops looks over at Reiss for a second
0:05:26 and then looks back at Bretta if there
0:05:29 was a location for us to head to and one
0:05:32 that has a little bit more open space
0:05:35 it would be
0:05:37 probably the central Hall one that
0:05:39 overlooks the high ritual room it's a
0:05:42 little bit more verticality and um not a
0:05:45 place I would have initially thought of
0:05:47 considering that it's got a lot of
0:05:50 entrances holes that come in and out but
0:05:53 it is a central location right over the
0:05:56 uh was a powerful area for us would that
0:06:00 be nearby Ira at this point looks back
0:06:03 over at Reiss because he obviously is
0:06:05 aware of high ritual rooms and and the
0:06:08 layout of most premier chantries but he
0:06:11 he does not actually know the layout of
0:06:13 this one I don't have floors here and
0:06:16 around beneath where we are now
0:06:19 the GPU would go on the closer into the
0:06:21 heart of the node that you'll be there
0:06:23 is the high ritual room it is
0:06:26 a point where the fungus broke through
0:06:29 and entered the shamshi
0:06:31 somehow whatever it is that has attacked
0:06:35 this Chantry New World could find veto
0:06:38 Mr xantosa was sought out by an outside
0:06:42 entity
0:06:43 Fredo looks quietly Disturbed but not as
0:06:46 surprised as she might like to be and
0:06:48 it's infiltrated this node he raises his
0:06:51 hands and gestures around
0:06:53 the Chantry is built on the Node
0:06:56 sounds like a good idea I think the only
0:06:58 thing is that if it can hear and see us
0:07:00 as soon as we leave this room then from
0:07:02 here on in our mission can never be
0:07:04 discussed again and we should only speak
0:07:05 about going to this room to gather
0:07:08 something important maybe a book or a
0:07:12 spell or a relic or something like that
0:07:13 that would be used by maybe Rhys to
0:07:16 defeat whatever is going on it's a
0:07:18 betamen to at least give some element of
0:07:21 surprise to us I don't know if we're
0:07:23 gonna need to honestly if Brita is
0:07:25 leading the way I'm if we're not sure
0:07:27 what he perceives I would pretty much
0:07:30 guarantee he can just perceive her but I
0:07:32 am in agreement with win win looks a
0:07:35 little surprised by that but for once
0:07:38 decides to not comment on a thing just
0:07:41 kind of takes the win well then we might
0:07:44 be able to go while we're where we're
0:07:46 trying to go in silence
0:07:48 Reiss you said this thing got into the
0:07:51 Chantry from the center of this node yes
0:07:55 whatever it is it can sense places of
0:07:58 spiritual power but it also it sounds
0:08:00 like it came in from somewhere other
0:08:02 than the physical world I don't know
0:08:05 that it comes from a metaphysical place
0:08:08 I more suspect that this Shard of the
0:08:13 eldest
0:08:14 grows like a fungus and has spread to
0:08:18 various portions of New Haven perhaps
0:08:21 beyond that
0:08:23 it grew in the direction of veto
0:08:28 as Reiss talks when kind of does a long
0:08:31 blink and then opens her eyes to kind of
0:08:35 see the she knows the spiritual
0:08:37 landscape is going to be bad what she's
0:08:39 looking for is any sense of direction
0:08:43 where it's coming from going to
0:08:46 locations where it's strongest the
0:08:49 spirit wards that protect this
0:08:50 particular place that you're in right
0:08:52 now makes it very hard to see anything
0:08:54 that would be out of the ordinary you'd
0:08:56 have to get out of this room she kind of
0:08:58 blinks again and makes a note to herself
0:09:00 to check once they're out apart from
0:09:02 knitting or while wanting a location
0:09:05 like that it sounds like if I can get
0:09:08 into contact I I'm a range fighter he
0:09:11 knows that but I think that I'll
0:09:14 probably have that chance
0:09:15 but he's going to be more inclined to
0:09:19 I think you guys might need to try to
0:09:22 keep it ranged more than me here's a
0:09:24 better question how the hell do we kill
0:09:26 this thing it seems like fire was
0:09:29 working against some of it I don't know
0:09:31 that that does anything except I
0:09:34 I don't know that this thing can be
0:09:36 killed in any way that matters it can
0:09:38 just be
0:09:39 kept unsentient and contained but like
0:09:44 shy of like a nuclear warhead I don't
0:09:46 know that there's anything that's gonna
0:09:48 truly destroy it hypothesis
0:09:51 it cannot get into this room at present
0:09:54 neither veto nor the fungal infection
0:09:57 this room specifically is warded so that
0:10:01 those not of Premier blood cannot get in
0:10:05 specifically Kindred meaning it at least
0:10:10 follows some of the rules of Kindred
0:10:12 still
0:10:13 so assuming that it's a vampire
0:10:17 we just gotta find its heart veto's
0:10:19 heart or take off its head do enough
0:10:22 damage as possible and just obliterate
0:10:25 the absolute hell out of it that's my
0:10:28 problem is when we fought things like
0:10:31 this before it just results in the
0:10:33 spread of the fungus even when it's
0:10:35 burned the ash just grows but Vito is
0:10:38 the target here because he seems to be
0:10:39 accelerating whatever this is I agree
0:10:42 with you Sheriff that the sentience is
0:10:45 the present issue so when I think you're
0:10:49 right the fungus here is older and more
0:10:53 dangerous than we have the capability of
0:10:55 dealing with presently unfortunately or
0:10:59 rather I should say fortunately for us
0:11:02 veto is the one that is operating that
0:11:05 fungus
0:11:06 so if we kill veto I think we got a
0:11:10 chance of getting out of this place
0:11:11 alive
0:11:12 we'll have to figure out how to deal
0:11:13 with that fungus later my concern is
0:11:17 that they are now so intertwined that if
0:11:20 we kill veto it's just gonna be a more
0:11:22 powerful puppet for whatever is driving
0:11:24 this fungus and I know we're we're
0:11:27 throwing carts before horses and we
0:11:29 gotta pick a problem but cynical you had
0:11:33 mentioned that you had seen something
0:11:34 like this before
0:11:36 something that came out of New York yeah
0:11:39 a mortal man who had been infected by
0:11:43 whatever this is and you killed it put
0:11:47 it down stomped it into the pavement
0:11:49 until it stopped moving and then burned
0:11:52 the remains as much as I would love to
0:11:55 study this along with my fellow clan
0:11:58 mates rather got present to support that
0:12:01 hypothesis we have some evidence that
0:12:04 liberal application violence can at
0:12:06 least do something well
0:12:09 couple of things
0:12:10 I did have to burn the Mortal man
0:12:13 because even after stomping it into
0:12:17 jelly it didn't stop moving so that
0:12:20 supports what the sheriff is saying
0:12:22 secondly
0:12:24 you didn't get a chance to see what this
0:12:27 thing Brit is talking about is I saw the
0:12:30 thing in the hallway when we let her in
0:12:31 did you get a full look at it no I was
0:12:34 crazy big
0:12:36 it's so big we're gonna have to apply
0:12:40 not a liberal amount of violence we're
0:12:42 gonna have to apply a goddamn ocean of
0:12:44 violence to get this thing to stop all
0:12:46 right as far as I know as far as what we
0:12:49 know we have to stop veto one way or
0:12:51 another and currently this is the only
0:12:54 plan we have even if he does come back
0:12:56 in a different way it stops it for now
0:12:59 and that is the current goal it'll give
0:13:01 us time to further research talk to
0:13:04 other people see if there's other things
0:13:06 we can do but if nothing else it'll stop
0:13:07 the spread from any more college
0:13:10 students right now and that's our goal
0:13:12 the destruction hopefully the slowing at
0:13:16 least with that Berta suggested we go
0:13:19 fight in a bigger area it seems pretty
0:13:21 good especially since it seems to be
0:13:24 nearby where all this started here we go
0:13:27 out we apply violence liberally and we
0:13:29 try to get there quickly
0:13:31 Ira you mentioned that this room
0:13:34 specifically is awarded against
0:13:37 Kindred who are not premier of a fashion
0:13:40 is there a way to reverse that and
0:13:44 modify it so that if we get him in an
0:13:47 area he can't leave not quickly yeah
0:13:49 that was that was a shot in the dark I I
0:13:52 just watching too much Star Trek
0:13:54 honestly it did not hold when it was
0:13:56 done that makes sense oh
0:13:59 well
0:14:00 you should probably use your red eyes
0:14:04 the ones that help you see in the dark
0:14:06 because they'll probably turn the lights
0:14:07 off again and I don't know if you two
0:14:11 might want to use all specs to see
0:14:14 better as well I can help keep the
0:14:16 lights on again as well Sheriff having
0:14:18 forms of light at the ready that might
0:14:21 be helpful I
0:14:22 I have some flare guns as well I suggest
0:14:25 everyone get their final preparations
0:14:28 what are we doing with Eden Eden become
0:14:30 be part of this I was hoping actually
0:14:32 that um I don't know if we could leave
0:14:34 her here or win if you might be able to
0:14:36 protect her I can protect child or I can
0:14:40 fight monster I'm not going to be able
0:14:42 to reliably do both I understand that I
0:14:45 am not in the greatest position of trust
0:14:47 amongst the codery but if you do not
0:14:50 feel comfortable leaving her here with
0:14:53 the region
0:14:55 I don't plan on getting anywhere near to
0:14:58 the heart of this monstrosity and I can
0:15:02 split my attention between her and it
0:15:05 Eden what do you want to do she looks at
0:15:07 Reiss and then back at the group of you
0:15:09 I want to go with a group of you then
0:15:11 Ira if you're going to be further away
0:15:15 Brita is debating it she still hasn't
0:15:19 forgotten the way that iro is calling
0:15:21 Eden demonic earlier Iris seems
0:15:24 perfectly aware of like like these
0:15:26 people have no reason to trust me here
0:15:28 like I know I'm being on the level but
0:15:31 does not seem offended by the hesitation
0:15:33 if if you would keep her safe
0:15:37 I can Endeavor to do my best
0:15:41 Johnny gives Eden a hard look she wins
0:15:44 this don't get anything nasty on my
0:15:47 jacket
0:15:48 uh okay okay
0:15:53 final preparations before we head out
0:15:57 I know that the center shawl has
0:15:59 expressed a lack of Desire
0:16:02 for thermaturgical aid but anyone else
0:16:04 who would like some assistance
0:16:07 I mean what does it do Harden your
0:16:10 clothes to protect you from harm Harden
0:16:13 the molecules of the things you're
0:16:15 carrying to do additional harm I can
0:16:18 provide Clarity in the moment that sort
0:16:20 of thing
0:16:21 how long does it take just a few moments
0:16:24 then sounds like a whole lot of tremir
0:16:26 mumbo jumbo to me it is and in this case
0:16:29 helpful and what else aren't you telling
0:16:33 us about it
0:16:34 it would require the expenditure of
0:16:36 blood on my behalf he like doesn't know
0:16:38 what to say he's like I explained
0:16:40 everything I don't know why you're
0:16:41 likely
0:16:43 um if you could make my armor better of
0:16:46 course unfortunately if you're going to
0:16:48 be using guns primarily I could affect
0:16:51 bullets but that would take quite a bit
0:16:53 question I can potentially provide
0:16:56 answers my claws are a part of your
0:16:58 hands I am not a biotherma church all
0:17:01 right I apologize
0:17:03 it's probably for the best I'm all for
0:17:05 whatever you can add I think Brita if
0:17:07 you can get eaten into whatever
0:17:09 protective equivalent we have here yeah
0:17:11 that as well and um Bretta Pats herself
0:17:14 down
0:17:15 she gives Eden her knife
0:17:18 Eden accepts the knife and clenches it
0:17:21 and like both of her hands is so tight
0:17:25 that you can see like her knuckles go
0:17:27 white if you could do that as well IRA
0:17:31 and Lex I'm gonna start casting for the
0:17:34 outer clothes of Johnny said no so
0:17:37 everybody but Johnny and the knife uh
0:17:39 and actually for Johnny win and Miles
0:17:43 you will see because he's in the zone
0:17:46 and trying to do things quickly to get
0:17:47 stuff done he doesn't actually reach out
0:17:50 to touch any of the stuff he just like
0:17:52 looks at it the thing with the sword
0:17:54 earlier apparently was just performative
0:17:56 to make you think he was doing like
0:17:58 extra special stuff yeah it was
0:18:00 theatrics yeah I can appreciate that oh
0:18:02 it was theatrics to be like look I'm
0:18:04 helping
0:18:06 so I'm Gonna Roll those out real fast
0:18:08 holy [ __ ] win gained five extra Health
0:18:11 levels in your clothes
0:18:13 miles gained three extra Health levels
0:18:16 in your clothes
0:18:18 he likes me better unacceptable he also
0:18:21 did your sword uh and Brita game four
0:18:24 extra Health levels in her clothes
0:18:29 Tim is so
0:18:32 Eden gains four Health levels son of a
0:18:35 [ __ ] are you sure you cast it on Eden
0:18:38 wearing Johnny's jacket does she only
0:18:40 gain the health levels on her uh shift
0:18:43 on her regular clothes John just goof up
0:18:46 for my trap card she's also wearing
0:18:48 chainsaw time we're also putting armor
0:18:50 on her so it could be on that yeah it's
0:18:51 yeah it's and it is plus four levels of
0:18:55 damage on the knife
0:18:59 yes Queen
0:19:01 seeing Ira kind of turn his magical gaze
0:19:04 towards Eden Johnny will actually kind
0:19:07 of like just inch closer to her and at
0:19:09 some point in the lull of conversation
0:19:11 he just kind of gives her a quick wink
0:19:13 and he goes tell you what you can keep
0:19:15 that jacket all right this is because he
0:19:17 touched it Johnny kind of gives her a
0:19:19 look and like nods without nodding she
0:19:22 will not either way I don't want to see
0:19:25 you get in touch with it all right let's
0:19:27 steer clear of anything dangerous should
0:19:29 you guys cover your mouth what she means
0:19:32 so that way don't breathe it in right I
0:19:35 said it doesn't get inside of you
0:19:37 probably not a bad idea but we don't
0:19:38 Breathe No but this is what I meant [ __ ]
0:19:41 nobody gives this she I see you're
0:19:44 looking at the chainsaw
0:19:45 yeah Johnny kind of nods smart kid hell
0:19:50 of a lot smarter than I am here is there
0:19:52 any fabric I can find is fabric gonna be
0:19:55 enough or do we need like a mask sort of
0:19:57 thing I don't think we'll have that
0:19:58 what's around this room boxes metal
0:20:01 shelves there's like leather over the
0:20:04 seating on the the various like like
0:20:06 little couches and what have you a lot
0:20:08 of Rosewood but it will gesture to Eden
0:20:11 could I borrow that back for a second
0:20:13 holds the knife out careful I did Magic
0:20:16 on it I'll be careful smart girl and
0:20:18 Bretta will there's like a hesitation
0:20:20 because they're probably nice couches
0:20:22 but no longer they are so nice they're
0:20:26 not gonna be much longer unless I have
0:20:27 to pause for it no no no it would be
0:20:30 weird for you to stare at a seat but the
0:20:34 couch is in a Trimmier place they're not
0:20:35 that nice they're functional
0:20:38 yeah they're super well made they're not
0:20:41 up to par in terms of stuff very
0:20:43 functional yeah I'm thinking like
0:20:45 overstuffed leather Brita will
0:20:47 effectively skin the couch to hand
0:20:50 everyone a mouth covering is she hands
0:20:53 one to Eden she's not entirely certain
0:20:54 if the Mortal will do okay with a
0:20:57 leather face covering but she makes hers
0:20:58 a little looser not hard on a smaller
0:21:01 person and she does lay one in front of
0:21:03 Reiss although she's not entirely
0:21:04 certain if he's leaving that room if you
0:21:06 have laid it before him he does not seem
0:21:09 to notice that's fine but she kind of
0:21:12 crafts a little face covering for people
0:21:18 while she's doing this I go over towards
0:21:21 Eden my name is Miles you met the rest
0:21:23 of us
0:21:25 yeah this is my domain nice place thank
0:21:28 you Bretta comes back and hands Eden the
0:21:31 knife uh and tries to give the knife
0:21:35 back in a way of kind of smiling to
0:21:38 encourage that yes Smiles is good even
0:21:41 if he's being aware it's that kind of
0:21:43 like she accepts the knife we're about
0:21:45 to go out and do some big scary stuff I
0:21:48 saw that you were able to heal my friend
0:21:50 win here is there anything else you know
0:21:52 how to do
0:21:53 she kind of gives you like a little bit
0:21:56 of a cagey look no okay I'm just
0:21:59 checking because
0:22:00 it's gonna be dangerous for all of us
0:22:02 out there and just knowing what you can
0:22:04 do is helpful we just want to make sure
0:22:06 that you're safe and we don't want to
0:22:08 waste resources if we don't have to so
0:22:10 knowing what you can do already is
0:22:13 helpful so we can put things where they
0:22:15 need to be but if if you don't think you
0:22:18 can do anything in combat don't worry
0:22:20 about it it's okay I don't think I'm a
0:22:22 good fighter
0:22:24 she like eyes the bottles of blood
0:22:27 but if
0:22:28 you already
0:22:30 drink all you're going to drink
0:22:33 may I yeah drink your Phil she goes and
0:22:36 she starts [ __ ] chugging containers
0:22:38 of blood chocolate baby girl she has
0:22:40 like little nubby fangs
0:22:48 while uh they're treating with Eden I'm
0:22:51 gonna give that a wide berth I know
0:22:53 where I'm gonna bring the energy down
0:22:54 but I'm gonna go over to Rhys he is
0:22:57 staring at the girl watching her feed
0:22:58 like eyes narrowed pondering the secrets
0:23:02 of her existence as though she's like
0:23:04 case study and not a person region
0:23:08 Apprentice you've had Vito zentosa in
0:23:11 your custody for a bit I presume his
0:23:14 name is his
0:23:16 capital N name
0:23:18 or if not that you have it in your
0:23:20 possession means you're not what we know
0:23:23 is that the original name of the zantosa
0:23:25 family is Santa which and he is a
0:23:28 sandovic as far as his actual name goes
0:23:33 uh what we pulled from him
0:23:37 um was not terribly useful when
0:23:40 leveraged against him I have reason to
0:23:42 believe that he is not totally him
0:23:45 and in this circumstance his flesh may
0:23:48 not be his flesh precisely unfortunate I
0:23:51 was hoping that we could inscribe it
0:23:52 upon paper before leaving
0:23:54 it will be advantageous to make the
0:23:56 attempt but in the past we weren't
0:23:59 unsuccessful
0:24:00 you wouldn't happen to have logs of
0:24:02 which names were attempted takes a look
0:24:05 at you and then looks around and heads
0:24:07 towards like stacks of files that he had
0:24:09 been going through previously
0:24:11 and he pulls out a collection of
0:24:14 identities that have been used going
0:24:16 back to the 17th century this list was
0:24:20 used
0:24:21 various identities is
0:24:24 maintained Through Time so far none of
0:24:28 them wielded anything but you're welcome
0:24:30 to make an attempt Johnny calev has been
0:24:34 keeping an ear out on the tremeer
0:24:36 watching them talk about names and stuff
0:24:39 like that out of these true names work
0:24:41 Ira doesn't answer he just looks at
0:24:43 Reiss
0:24:44 in the West
0:24:46 there are the names that are given to
0:24:48 you upon your birth not Embrace birth
0:24:51 when leveraged against you
0:24:53 they symbolically represent your truth
0:24:56 it's symbolic though yes yes and the
0:25:00 Embrace doesn't matter it can as in the
0:25:03 past certainly have you tried Saxon
0:25:06 Ira looks at Rhys honestly the way that
0:25:09 we just were at the table I assume
0:25:10 Maurice looks at Ira the exact same time
0:25:12 yep it may be worth a shot do it
0:25:15 Apprentice
0:25:16 well done Mr Saxon surgical how do you
0:25:19 spell your last name Ira seems like
0:25:20 excited by the prospect of s like ooh a
0:25:24 puzzle S A
0:25:28 x-o-na Lex
0:25:30 what is the over the course of the list
0:25:33 of names
0:25:35 [Laughter]
0:25:39 uh over the list of names that Rhys
0:25:41 showed me is it Ben Vito most of the
0:25:44 time like what is the earliest first
0:25:46 name that we have Vito is probably the
0:25:49 one that's been used the most so that it
0:25:50 is the one most representative of who he
0:25:52 is right now yes okay Ira will pull some
0:25:56 like a stylus but like a pen without ink
0:25:58 in it and prick his own finger with the
0:26:01 tip and then start slowly and like very
0:26:05 carefully
0:26:06 inscribing the name Vito Saxon on a
0:26:11 piece of paper it takes him like way
0:26:12 longer than you would think to it would
0:26:14 take to like just write a pretty simple
0:26:16 name out and then he will fold up the
0:26:19 piece of paper and put it in his pocket
0:26:21 miles is standing by the vault door
0:26:23 waiting to see as as Rip that paper
0:26:26 preparations he takes it back out and
0:26:29 then rips the paper Vito his name then
0:26:33 draws from Italian
0:26:34 and it originates from the Latin word
0:26:37 for life
0:26:39 Vito
0:26:41 is likely a man hailing from Ukraine
0:26:46 Russia this region what is their name
0:26:50 for Life Romanian the language
0:26:53 romanian's pretty similar to Italian
0:26:55 isn't it he paces
0:26:58 there are similarities yes would I be
0:27:01 able to roll academics for names you can
0:27:04 roll intelligence academic before we
0:27:06 gloss over it Ira was clearly listening
0:27:09 to Rhys but he's a man who's capable of
0:27:11 drawing his attention in a couple
0:27:12 different places when the sheriff speaks
0:27:15 the Latin word for life and shows a
0:27:18 knowledge of Latin Ira immediately looks
0:27:21 over and there's no like suspicion or
0:27:22 anything he just like recognizes the
0:27:24 fact that wind speaks Latin when kind of
0:27:27 sees the look and she just kind of
0:27:29 shrugs says omnisomnium but
0:27:33 the quote seems to hit Ira weirdly hard
0:27:37 in this moment but then he split you
0:27:39 know he quickly splits his attention
0:27:41 back to trying to figure out Romanian
0:27:44 translations
0:27:46 two successes
0:27:48 also two successes uh does my analytical
0:27:51 my analytical spec would not apply to
0:27:53 this right for linguistic stuff it would
0:27:55 okay oh do I get any bonus for knowing a
0:27:59 different language yeah same what
0:28:01 languages do you know Latin yes give a
0:28:04 leash no yeah I don't think so what is
0:28:07 the bonus for knowingly
0:28:14 six successes the
0:28:17 like like Italian but Victor like
0:28:22 the Romanian word for life just the
0:28:25 direct translation to something like
0:28:26 viacha something along those lines
0:28:31 so it's still we're still working with
0:28:33 avit Vito to me is sort of a childish
0:28:38 truncation of the name like a nickname
0:28:40 almost so an expansion on the name of
0:28:43 veto would make sense
0:28:45 vitory like victory
0:28:49 uh it was a romance based language for a
0:28:53 masculine Vittorio so that would work
0:28:56 it's a name I've seen before an art I'll
0:28:58 take your word for it I work yeah it
0:29:00 does not know art [ __ ] it is perhaps
0:29:03 worth a shot worth a try the worst that
0:29:06 happens is it causes me a hesitation
0:29:08 when we actually see him Ira glances
0:29:13 between the two women once again like is
0:29:16 this what we're trying devily has like
0:29:18 group project energy like he's like
0:29:21 weirdly energized by is this what magic
0:29:24 is
0:29:25 you [ __ ] come up with
0:29:27 cockeyed theories about names and just
0:29:30 try it all day there's a baby born
0:29:32 without eyelids and they used the
0:29:34 circumcised part of his penis to create
0:29:37 eyelids well that's fine he's just a
0:29:39 little cock-eyed
0:29:41 I'm sorry
0:29:43 [Laughter]
0:29:46 Johnny gives a very concerned look like
0:29:49 a like a parent who's just found out
0:29:51 that their child is playing Dungeons and
0:29:54 Dragons
0:29:56 something along the you know like you
0:29:58 know they just told them that they want
0:30:00 to go buy a Creed album you know well
0:30:02 that's a little bit anachronistic but
0:30:05 um no late 90s that's that's about right
0:30:07 oh that is that is actually it works all
0:30:09 right
0:30:10 it's a concerned look okay so Lex I will
0:30:14 use a bit more of my blood and I will on
0:30:18 a piece of parchment inscribe the name
0:30:21 slowly but surely Vittorio Saxon okay
0:30:25 then fold up the parchment put it in a
0:30:28 pocket ready to go as Ira finishes and
0:30:31 puts the paper in his pocket he stands
0:30:34 up uh kind of brushes his coat back off
0:30:36 and goes
0:30:38 if I had and he looked sort of guiltily
0:30:40 towards win actually who he was
0:30:43 disparaging of like soft sciences and
0:30:46 stuff before we wouldn't have to take
0:30:48 these Chances with true names if I had
0:30:50 any autistic talent but I don't so here
0:30:53 we are bread and Mike does it have to be
0:30:56 you that trusts him yes I have to do the
0:30:59 ritual does it count if you trace
0:31:03 huh
0:31:04 I don't know
0:31:06 if we're willing to take a little bit of
0:31:08 time I'm willing to give it a shot so we
0:31:11 can have a second unless we want to go
0:31:13 now Jenny looks at his pack of Morley's
0:31:15 I still got three left you got that much
0:31:18 time okay
0:31:21 does it have to be
0:31:23 oh you're tracing it so no it doesn't
0:31:25 have to be in Blood and Bretta just like
0:31:28 takes one of your papers as he is
0:31:31 presently in the representation of his
0:31:35 truest self if you could oh
0:31:38 um
0:31:39 I don't I don't know that the
0:31:42 symbolically representative of his
0:31:43 truest self
0:31:45 um
0:31:46 I could either draw what he looks like
0:31:48 as a person or I usually use name so I
0:31:53 I'll admit I don't know it sounds like
0:31:55 we should stick with the name part here
0:31:58 well I'll try the name one first
0:32:00 and if it doesn't work we'll have a
0:32:02 backup okay I'm gonna just try and draw
0:32:05 his face and we'll call that good just
0:32:07 fine and Bretta will do a quick sketch
0:32:10 of the last time that she saw Vito
0:32:13 raising his hands trying to flesh craft
0:32:15 her mommy Dex plus crafts
0:32:21 eight you find yourself drawn into the
0:32:23 details and with your hand you recreate
0:32:28 the image and your mind you recreate the
0:32:31 event and eventually your quarterly
0:32:34 finds that you are completely lost in
0:32:36 what you have made Reiss
0:32:39 can't help but smirk with amusement at
0:32:43 the toroid or weakness made manifest ah
0:32:47 it's all we'll do Britta hey she like
0:32:51 puts her hand on the hand holding the
0:32:52 pencil once the drawing is complete
0:32:55 um
0:32:56 you good just have to get it out of here
0:32:58 soon okay
0:33:00 does this work Ira who basically until
0:33:04 today only really spends his time around
0:33:06 Premier doesn't really spend his time
0:33:07 around toriador looks at the art that
0:33:10 she has wrought with eight successes and
0:33:13 has this expression on his face like
0:33:15 what the [ __ ] I'm supposed to trace this
0:33:17 like no this is impossible
0:33:22 well now we have that I'll try Dex plus
0:33:27 crafts God damn it
0:33:29 now my Dex is currently a 10 so that
0:33:32 will be helpful not to brag or anything
0:33:34 no flex
0:33:35 on diff if you don't have crafts
0:33:39 there's your stem field now
0:33:42 [Music]
0:33:43 failing me it's plus one diff I'm just
0:33:45 seven
0:33:46 uh Lex uh not wanting to [ __ ] this up
0:33:50 like an idiot uh after she put that much
0:33:52 effort into it I'm going to treat my one
0:33:54 track minding myself I will be cheating
0:33:56 with magic
0:33:58 um because I don't live in Magic
0:33:59 [ __ ] I'm gonna get [ __ ] if I
0:34:02 don't do this uh the thing that I'm
0:34:03 going to be centering on is
0:34:05 appropriately tracing this work of art
0:34:07 yeah a bunch of successes so it's up
0:34:09 okay uh so that's minus one diff plus
0:34:11 the minus two diff that I've got uh plus
0:34:14 one yeah minus one therefore did five uh
0:34:16 yeah ten dice to five
0:34:18 I got
0:34:20 six successes two less than the toriador
0:34:22 by cheating with [ __ ] tons of magic
0:34:26 I I tried to trace by focusing my mind
0:34:31 to the point where I was incredibly like
0:34:34 sharp and uh detail-oriented and still
0:34:37 came up too short and I will slowly
0:34:40 attempt to use that to cast the ritual a
0:34:43 second time just in case I got the true
0:34:44 name wrong no realize that the name will
0:34:48 only work if it is the correct name the
0:34:50 image will only work if that is how he
0:34:52 looks
0:34:52 bring both be prepared of course region
0:34:56 this is really thank you for your
0:34:59 artistic assistance Brita is definitely
0:35:01 very disquieted by feeling that in a way
0:35:06 that she best understands her own
0:35:09 feelings and is so vulnerable and
0:35:11 inescapable through ART and her weakness
0:35:13 but she's Gathering herself and looking
0:35:16 towards that batteredin door getting
0:35:19 a little bit more iron in her spine
0:35:21 before looking back to the codery and
0:35:24 Company is everyone ready
0:35:26 I suppose so ready as ever
0:35:29 and I think it's time to go Johnny pulls
0:35:32 the last few drags off the Morley drops
0:35:34 it on the floor of the trebier Sanctum
0:35:37 squashes it out with his Boot and nods
0:35:40 when grabs a clip for her gun pulls her
0:35:44 gun from the back of her jeans where she
0:35:46 stores it safely
0:35:52 and just kind of makes herself ready
0:35:55 all right
0:35:56 first I are gonna need you to undo that
0:35:58 lock there and then let's go be ready to
0:36:02 take out whatever this horrible flesh
0:36:04 ball thing is uh wind takes one last
0:36:07 Blood vial activates protein eyes slams
0:36:10 The Blood and now has protein eyes
0:36:13 remember team we're here to try to
0:36:15 prevent The Apocalypse of mushrooms so
0:36:18 uh yeah we really can't fail here so all
0:36:21 right everybody best behavior we already
0:36:23 we already killed the Weeping bear we've
0:36:25 been through Hell House this is just
0:36:27 Vito santosa again again we're gonna
0:36:31 crush this Johnny will spend oh [ __ ] for
0:36:36 uh iron heart to make sure everybody has
0:36:40 um extra bonuses one will for everybody
0:36:42 or per person uh one will per her
0:36:46 you could probably keep me you can keep
0:36:48 me out of it yeah it's okay so too well
0:36:51 see he'll spend the two wheel for that
0:36:52 thank you sir remind me what that does
0:36:54 please
0:36:55 uh dominate presence mind affecting
0:36:57 voluntary are all that plus one
0:36:59 difficulty to affect you you feel that
0:37:02 aura of badassery that Johnny tends to
0:37:04 have you feel a little bit over you
0:37:08 you know what they say third time's a
0:37:10 charm
0:37:11 wind just kind of casually unbuttons her
0:37:13 flannel uh because she has buffed her
0:37:16 shoulders to such a point that she can't
0:37:17 really close her arms in front so she
0:37:20 just kind of gives herself a little
0:37:21 extra room in the shoulders
0:37:24 and cracks her neck cracks her Knuckles
0:37:26 Ira goes to the door Pats his jacket
0:37:30 down real quick just to make sure he's
0:37:31 got all the things and little
0:37:33 instruments that he needs and then looks
0:37:35 at the group clanks The Electric
0:37:37 lockdown hang on let me be the one to
0:37:40 open it just in case he's right there as
0:37:43 as it clanks down the chainsaw Roars to
0:37:46 life of course and he steps back Brita
0:37:49 heightens her hearing and her vision
0:37:51 make sure that the impromptu-face
0:37:53 covering is on securely and opens the
0:37:56 door
0:37:58 foreign
0:38:01 s you see that same Hall that you were
0:38:03 chased down except this time a veto is
0:38:06 not there well you do notice is that
0:38:09 these veins of fungus have grown
0:38:13 throughout the hall they kind of smell
0:38:15 like old ham and there's this kind of
0:38:20 like sweetness to the aroma there's this
0:38:23 white film that has grown over sections
0:38:27 of like thick fleshy points and that
0:38:31 those when you guys kind of open that
0:38:34 door and really get a look the
0:38:37 web-like white material parts and these
0:38:42 like fleshy mushrooms start to bloom
0:38:45 throughout the whole moving from closest
0:38:49 to you all the way down the hall as
0:38:52 whatever this system of you know mucousy
0:38:57 Eerie fungus is reacts
0:39:00 to the awareness that the group of you
0:39:03 are back on the move when we get out
0:39:05 there when will once now that she's out
0:39:07 of the room she's gonna look and see if
0:39:09 she can get a lay of the spiritual
0:39:10 landscape Brita keeping in the real
0:39:12 world is gonna take Point checking each
0:39:15 way before they go you you get the
0:39:18 impression that the spiritual stuff of
0:39:20 this location has been metabolized
0:39:22 consumed digested and replaced by spongy
0:39:28 fungal matter uh so even the spirits
0:39:30 that would normally be dormant you've
0:39:32 seen it before traveling through like
0:39:34 cities where there's this webbing that
0:39:37 grows over Spirits a lot applied by
0:39:40 other spirits and as it happens spirits
0:39:44 and like cities and refined areas kind
0:39:47 of fall asleep and become dormant the
0:39:49 even the dormant aspects of the spirit
0:39:52 world here have been devoured and
0:39:55 replaced by this fungi where is Romeo
0:39:57 Romeo is in the hall from the looks of
0:40:00 it he has been pacing frightened nervous
0:40:03 but he seems to find his resolve when he
0:40:07 sees the group of you emerge from this
0:40:09 doorway that he had not even known was
0:40:12 there she kind of gives him a look of
0:40:14 apology like we didn't realize you
0:40:16 weren't with us until the door was
0:40:17 closed but she isn't going to say
0:40:19 anything because she doesn't want to tip
0:40:21 off but she kind of also motions for him
0:40:23 to join them he does so over the noise
0:40:26 of the Chainsaw Ira will first motion to
0:40:30 Brita who has taken the lead he said
0:40:33 the node and thus the grand hall will be
0:40:37 that way and I point down the hall and
0:40:40 then he looks at Eden and says
0:40:43 promise to
0:40:45 be safe within the group so stay close
0:40:49 what if I start to Glow don't touch me
0:40:52 for your own safety she gulps and nods
0:40:55 and Britta starts leading the group with
0:40:57 Iris help over to the place that they're
0:41:00 hoping to confront Vito Wynn kind of
0:41:02 puts a hand on britta's back and just
0:41:05 kind of puts pressure with fingers on
0:41:08 one side fingers on the other side to
0:41:10 kind of indicate that if there's
0:41:11 something she can't see or doesn't think
0:41:13 she sees she'll try and Signal by
0:41:15 touching one side of her back I don't
0:41:17 know how much of that's going to come
0:41:18 across Freda gives win an odd look and
0:41:21 isn't sure why Wynn is trying to comfort
0:41:23 her in this way when puts her head next
0:41:25 to birdo's ear if there's something I
0:41:27 can see that I don't think you can see I
0:41:30 will signal the direction it's coming
0:41:32 from
0:41:33 same
0:41:34 you're directed
0:41:36 deeper down
0:41:38 stairwell is found a lot of it is like
0:41:40 kind of Steel grating handrails but it
0:41:43 kind of spirals down to an even lower
0:41:46 section of the Shane tree as you head
0:41:48 there even from the top of the staircase
0:41:51 you can hear this cacophony
0:41:55 of whimpers and screams and a myriad of
0:42:01 sounds of suffering as much Terror as
0:42:04 Brita was expecting hearing individual
0:42:08 voices makes it much more real so that
0:42:11 does stop her for a few moments she
0:42:14 finds herself trying to figure out if
0:42:16 she recognizes any of those voices from
0:42:18 where you are it's unclear but as the
0:42:21 group of you head deeper down you find
0:42:23 along the walls protruding like organs
0:42:27 of a greater whole there are portions of
0:42:31 people pressed into the walls mouths
0:42:35 gape Eyes Wide Open tongues out and very
0:42:39 softly screaming as whoever they are
0:42:43 they are still very much aware of their
0:42:45 surroundings and their senses are being
0:42:48 used to feed information to a greater
0:42:51 whole
0:42:52 Brita tries to collect herself and to
0:42:55 look less afraid and she'll continue on
0:42:58 with the group wind pauses at one of
0:43:02 them for a moment she's kind of like
0:43:04 holds the gun in her hand
0:43:06 a little tighter like she's not sure she
0:43:09 should let this continue how many of
0:43:11 them are there as you head down the
0:43:13 stairwell it's not more than like four
0:43:16 or five people strung into this like
0:43:19 thin mesh that exists over the walls but
0:43:23 you can definitely tell their nerves are
0:43:26 interweaved with the fungus in that case
0:43:29 Bretta will tighten her own grip on her
0:43:32 gun look to win and Nod and when will
0:43:36 level her gun at the head of someone
0:43:37 Johnny will um stand up next to you and
0:43:41 just quietly go save the ammo and using
0:43:44 his massive strength just crush the uh
0:43:47 the heads of these Unfortunate Souls as
0:43:51 we're passing by one by one as you find
0:43:54 them you crush the skulls that are
0:43:56 lining the walls down the stairs and
0:43:59 eventually you make it to the floor
0:44:01 where you expect Vita will come
0:44:08 but as you look into the Hall you
0:44:12 realize that he is already here waiting
0:44:16 for you
0:44:17 and you know this not because you see
0:44:19 him
0:44:20 but you see what has become his most
0:44:25 treasured prize at least
0:44:28 until he gets his hands on Brita
0:44:31 and you see
0:44:32 the vampire perum of the group of you
0:44:37 only brother recognizes him
0:44:40 but he
0:44:42 is in the middle of this of this kind of
0:44:45 a open Concourse space it's a whole but
0:44:48 it's like a very wide roomy Hall with
0:44:51 lots of seats for those who might wait
0:44:53 to get an access to the next room he is
0:44:55 in it laying on the ceiling pressed into
0:45:00 this like fatty orangey substance very
0:45:05 reminiscent of the fungus that was
0:45:07 growing outside of Wynn's house or her
0:45:11 Haven and you can see that perun is
0:45:14 conscious gritting his teeth and
0:45:18 fighting the urge to scream as their
0:45:23 nerves operating his body slowly but
0:45:26 surely ceased to be his own
0:45:29 Beretta takes in a deep breath trying
0:45:31 not to let it shake and she using her
0:45:34 heightened Vision examines Peru
0:45:37 sympathetic horror but she's trying to
0:45:40 figure out how stuck to the ceiling he
0:45:42 is or whether he seems prepped to drop
0:45:45 it's like he's been stuck there for
0:45:48 years and years and this fungus has kind
0:45:51 of grown into his flesh portions of his
0:45:54 face are cracked revealing like a soft
0:45:57 fungal tissue beneath and summons
0:46:01 instances his teeth have been replaced
0:46:05 by these like a wispy threads of fungal
0:46:10 tissue does he seem conscious of our
0:46:13 entry his eyes shift over to you and
0:46:16 though it is very evident that he is in
0:46:19 absolute agony he recognizes you
0:46:22 brother looks sorrowful but she raises
0:46:26 her gun like an author
0:46:29 ity
0:46:32 I see you
0:46:35 you must
0:46:37 finish
0:46:40 on the mission
0:46:43 once he says You must finish the mission
0:46:46 brother looks down and covers her ears
0:46:48 scared that he's going to order her
0:46:51 no
0:46:54 this is no comment
0:46:58 this is
0:47:00 a plea
0:47:02 a final request
0:47:05 chill look back up and she looks to the
0:47:08 group taking in the friendly faces and
0:47:10 the new
0:47:12 and she gives a
0:47:14 hard swallow and a solid nod
0:47:21 uation
0:47:24 it said you're our greatest chance
0:47:28 I believe that
0:47:31 it's the people with me that count
0:47:40 whatever
0:47:41 awareness he has is drained from him as
0:47:47 this this force that has him captive
0:47:52 drains or remains of his Essence and all
0:47:57 that is left is his ability to feel the
0:48:00 pain he is trapped in when looks to
0:48:02 Brita do you want to do it or do you
0:48:04 want me to
0:48:06 I'll do it
0:48:08 okay
0:48:09 and she shoots
0:48:14 there is a brief deafening noise
0:48:18 as the round connects with his forehead
0:48:22 and
0:48:24 causes what remains of his face to
0:48:27 become all the more malformed but it
0:48:30 stops moving
0:48:31 and
0:48:32 whatever remained of Peru is gone the
0:48:36 automatic posture that Bretta has it's
0:48:38 so
0:48:39 easy for her to pull a gun in that
0:48:42 disquieting way
0:48:43 she collects herself back into her
0:48:46 purpose and looks to the group to
0:48:48 continue
0:48:49 Johnny doesn't say anything
0:48:51 but she sees him
0:48:53 give her a look
0:48:55 that is full of Suspicion and seems like
0:49:00 he wants to ask what the [ __ ] is going
0:49:03 on
0:49:04 but you can see he's he is conceded to
0:49:06 the fact that they have a job to do and
0:49:09 now is not the time to be questioning
0:49:10 her about all this nonsense Bretta hangs
0:49:14 her head but is looking to continue
0:49:17 when kind of just squeezes her shoulder
0:49:20 let's do what he asked what shoulder
0:49:22 good question she uses her whole hand
0:49:25 she looks over the shoulder that you
0:49:27 squeeze okay it's probably the one
0:49:30 directly between them but seeing nothing
0:49:33 in particular in that particular
0:49:35 direction I assume correct Bretta just
0:49:37 keeps on kind of she nods a little bit
0:49:39 but she's kind of shrinking into herself
0:49:42 ready to keep going keeping her hand
0:49:44 tucked away especially not in Johnny's
0:49:47 Direction but just trying to finish this
0:49:50 not really ready to get into the
0:49:52 emotional vulnerability of it all
0:49:55 let's go
0:49:57 Ira pulls questioning eyes from this
0:50:02 Intruder bound to the ceiling and then
0:50:04 Bretta back focused forward uh when
0:50:07 miles says let's go keeping it to
0:50:10 himself and his face all business as
0:50:13 much as he can what is Romeo doing right
0:50:15 now
0:50:16 Romeo looks like he has tears in his
0:50:19 eyes looking up at this now destroyed
0:50:22 figure
0:50:23 when
0:50:24 kind of looks over at him with
0:50:27 a
0:50:29 it's clutching her knife and kind of
0:50:31 like trying to wander away from like the
0:50:35 signs of this fungal fleshy presence but
0:50:40 can't seem to find a space where she
0:50:43 feels safe and is just kind of very very
0:50:46 nervous about the situation it's about
0:50:49 well no Reiss has not joined you and he
0:50:52 is hanging back where he was left in the
0:50:54 first place
0:50:59 did you guys enter the next space what
0:51:03 you see is a larger area
0:51:07 in this room it is a large circular room
0:51:12 set into the ground is kind of a space
0:51:16 that drops almost like a full floor down
0:51:18 and in the middle of that there looks to
0:51:22 be a series of uh this something akin to
0:51:27 a pentagram but much much more complex
0:51:30 and it is inlaid with silver and gold
0:51:36 and this room is would have been
0:51:41 gorgeous with the way that is on this is
0:51:43 clearly the space in the chain tree that
0:51:45 has had the most attention given to its
0:51:48 design
0:51:49 now down below in the middle of the room
0:51:52 that that space that drops that is the
0:51:56 high ritual room uh Ira you recognize
0:51:58 that this higher space within it is more
0:52:01 meant to actually observe the
0:52:03 performance of rituals than participate
0:52:05 in them
0:52:06 now it's got a tall ceiling because
0:52:09 there are actually Rafters up about two
0:52:13 floors back all the way up towards that
0:52:15 first level of the uh Shane trade that
0:52:18 overlook this area there is a hole to
0:52:22 the right wing a hall to the left wing
0:52:25 and the ceiling above the rafters there
0:52:28 seems to be a lot of like pipe work a
0:52:31 lot of it it looks like a lot of the
0:52:34 utilities for the location are
0:52:37 intentionally designed to crisscross and
0:52:41 intersect here at this point it's like
0:52:44 uh it is like symbolically designed to
0:52:47 be this this conflux of you know piping
0:52:51 wires Halls Etc like everything is meant
0:52:54 to lead ultimately here now some of
0:52:58 these pipes they have clearly burst
0:53:01 there is like a fungus that has grown
0:53:05 and hangs like massive Vines and
0:53:07 branches from those pipes and you can
0:53:11 hear the water see the water like kind
0:53:12 of rushing the water pools down into the
0:53:16 the actual ritual Circle and it's about
0:53:19 like maybe half a foot of water that's
0:53:21 already filled in that space now that is
0:53:25 about how the room looks but there are
0:53:28 things within up in the rafters gathered
0:53:32 in this Clump in the same way that
0:53:35 newborn spiders would Clump together
0:53:38 from like an egg Sac that they've just
0:53:40 been born from are these like
0:53:42 spindly-legged skull face tick-like
0:53:46 things and from the floor you guys are
0:53:49 on it just kind of looks like a
0:53:52 thrumming gray Mass
0:53:54 now in the ritual Circle kind of hanging
0:53:59 from these long thick tendrils of fatty
0:54:03 orangey flesh is veto
0:54:06 however
0:54:08 veto seems to have done something to
0:54:10 himself where in which everything below
0:54:14 his torso has been unceremoniously torn
0:54:18 off by his hands and he just kind of
0:54:21 hangs there with intestines dangling
0:54:23 from his torso caught in the Rapture of
0:54:29 his pain his left arm
0:54:33 Blitz open in various places opening and
0:54:36 closing moving in a fashion that's
0:54:38 similar to like lungs opening and
0:54:40 closing and he seems lost in the
0:54:45 pleasure slash Agony of his current
0:54:49 condition
0:54:51 and when he realizes that the group of
0:54:55 you are there
0:54:57 his eyes Focus where then in previously
0:55:01 rolling to the back of his head
