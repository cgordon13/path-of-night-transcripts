0:00:24 [Music]
0:00:27 last
0:00:28 time nine
0:00:30 zolfiel's deception led neil and miles
0:00:32 to bargain separately for the orcodex
0:00:34 [Music]
0:00:36 johnny staked kneeled once zophiel had
0:00:38 accepted neil's offer of his own body as
0:00:40 a vessel trapping the demon within the
0:00:42 malcavian however miles agreed to let
0:00:44 the demon have a minority share in his
0:00:46 decisions until the next full moon
0:00:49 the quarter he gave the er codex to
0:00:51 arabella in exchange for her faking her
0:00:53 final death
0:00:56 after arriving home to new haven miles
0:00:58 awoke to find his trusted retainer
0:01:00 marcos dead
0:01:06 [Music]
0:01:09 neil
0:01:10 you find yourself starting to stir
0:01:12 immediately you can sense that you're in
0:01:14 an unfamiliar place
0:01:17 you can smell
0:01:19 the scent of oil and morley's
0:01:22 the room you're in is
0:01:24 a very simple
0:01:26 cold
0:01:28 concrete
0:01:30 box
0:01:31 it
0:01:32 has this feeling of being a
0:01:36 utility room and it feels damp kind of
0:01:40 like you'd expect out of something far
0:01:42 underneath the ground
0:01:44 you do hear
0:01:46 the sounds of some gentle music playing
0:01:49 with just a subtle skip to it
0:01:52 some
0:01:53 jazz playing on vinyl
0:01:55 as you become more aware of his
0:01:57 surroundings
0:01:59 you see that johnny
0:02:01 is finishing having put a ring of salt
0:02:04 around you
0:02:05 and has
0:02:07 kind of rolled up his sleeves and looks
0:02:09 a little bit concerned and worried
0:02:12 he's got a
0:02:14 half burned cigarette hanging out of his
0:02:16 lip
0:02:17 removes it and kind of licks his lips
0:02:20 and then slowly reaches across the ring
0:02:22 of salt that he's poured
0:02:25 grips the steak that's been planted into
0:02:28 your chest
0:02:29 and with a quick tug yanks it out
0:02:33 you with me
0:02:35 that hurts real bad
0:02:38 neil sort of sits up rubbing his chest
0:02:41 spending some blood to heal the wounds
0:02:43 johnny did yesterday
0:02:45 uh
0:02:46 not a uh
0:02:48 it worked right i don't feel him inside
0:02:50 my head so i think it worked
0:02:54 um if you're you
0:02:56 break the circle
0:02:58 oh
0:02:59 okay so in the interest of honesty
0:03:01 he says like reaching out and sweeping
0:03:03 some of the the salt away johnny looks
0:03:05 really concerned for a second um
0:03:09 so
0:03:10 how much will did you apply when
0:03:11 creating this circle
0:03:13 what
0:03:15 when you when you ward against intrusion
0:03:18 or or sort of extrusion as the case may
0:03:20 be what it doesn't matter johnny i'm me
0:03:23 it's fine uh good job good thoughts good
0:03:26 good instinct all right
0:03:29 where are we oh this is uh
0:03:32 this is my haven um this is right
0:03:34 where's all your stuff what are you
0:03:36 talking about my records are right there
0:03:38 he points over to a couple of milk
0:03:39 crates of of records
0:03:42 sitting next to a small little end table
0:03:44 where there's a record player on the
0:03:46 opposite side you can see there's a cot
0:03:48 and a foot locker and right at the foot
0:03:51 of it oh right right right cool cool
0:03:54 cool cool um
0:03:56 so we're back in new haven yeah i mean i
0:03:57 heard you guys talking yesterday so i
0:03:59 just good choices good choices all
0:04:00 around yeah
0:04:01 this this is a set of uh of old bunkers
0:04:05 from
0:04:06 back in the uh cold war oh yeah city
0:04:08 city underground is filled with them
0:04:10 yeah the sherwood cafes up top oh i know
0:04:13 what that is okay
0:04:14 i feel like we should probably
0:04:17 talk about everything that just went
0:04:19 down up in boston and salem
0:04:22 yeah i mean not just you and me like
0:04:24 everybody
0:04:25 there's there was a lot of
0:04:27 how much of the conversation did you
0:04:28 catch on the way back oh i heard all of
0:04:31 it
0:04:31 all right
0:04:32 i am um
0:04:35 i'm pissed at miles and i also can't be
0:04:36 pissed at miles because it's a it's
0:04:38 literally a demon he uh johnny walks
0:04:41 over and sits down on his cot
0:04:43 puts out the remaining butt of his
0:04:45 morally into his into a little uh
0:04:47 ashtray that's uh sitting on top of the
0:04:50 foot locker
0:04:51 you know
0:04:52 he uh pulls a a beeper off the foot
0:04:55 locker that was sitting next to the uh
0:04:57 ashtray
0:04:59 miles hasn't contacted me yet what time
0:05:01 is it late enough that it's worrying
0:05:04 yeah because you guys talked about
0:05:05 meeting up
0:05:07 with usually he's already he's already
0:05:09 knocking this thing off before i
0:05:10 actually wake up
0:05:12 [Music]
0:05:13 did you drop him off at his place no you
0:05:15 didn't he just took his own
0:05:18 huh
0:05:19 should we go check it out or do we know
0:05:21 that i think i mean i know we were all
0:05:22 supposed to meet up at his place anyways
0:05:24 we should by the way yeah
0:05:26 um
0:05:27 he gets up walks over and pulls his
0:05:30 jacket off the uh the back of the door
0:05:32 reaches through and pulls out a few
0:05:34 pages
0:05:36 these were still in my jacket they never
0:05:38 made it to uh
0:05:40 our mutual friend those pages of the air
0:05:42 codex he kind of
0:05:44 gives us a slight nod
0:05:47 like he doesn't want to actually say yes
0:05:50 okay
0:05:50 okay so i mean we'll have to get those
0:05:52 into wins hands well i want him out of
0:05:54 mine he shoves them into your chest oh
0:05:57 um
0:05:58 how okay
0:05:59 uh
0:06:00 great sure i will and he sort of rolls
0:06:02 them up and like slides them into his
0:06:04 fanny pack do you want uh do you want a
0:06:06 new shirt yeah that's probably smart
0:06:09 he goes rifling through his foot locker
0:06:11 and finds uh find some johnny clothes
0:06:14 that
0:06:14 look like they might fit you
0:06:18 it looks like a child you you actually
0:06:20 find that johnny's shirts are tight
0:06:22 enough that well
0:06:25 a little loose on you uh it's actually
0:06:27 not too bad oh man
0:06:31 you don't quite have like the pecs and
0:06:33 like everything going on like johnny
0:06:34 does this is a cool shirt for somebody
0:06:36 who could fill it out yeah
0:06:38 i think we should probably uh go over
0:06:40 the park see if we can grab when collect
0:06:43 the group and
0:06:45 see what see why miles hasn't contacted
0:06:48 us yeah i mean things have been so
0:06:50 hectic lately and there's a demon in his
0:06:52 brain
0:06:53 what yeah when he made that deal to i
0:06:55 mean okay so
0:06:57 the demon was changing things no no no
0:06:59 you you made a deal and you tricked it
0:07:01 yes i did i 100 and now it's back in the
0:07:04 circle right i didn't get to thank you
0:07:06 for doing that it's supposed to be based
0:07:09 on the deal that i made however
0:07:12 miles indicated he also made a deal
0:07:14 because he was seeing things that were
0:07:15 different he
0:07:17 if i heard things right and to be fair i
0:07:19 had a demon in my brain and a stake in
0:07:21 my chest so i might have heard it wrong
0:07:23 wait so it was doing deals with both of
0:07:25 you yeah that's not fair no i know it's
0:07:27 not fair it's a demon that's what they
0:07:28 do ah
0:07:30 look
0:07:31 miles made some sort of i mean i want to
0:07:33 talk to him about that because i am very
0:07:34 concerned but it is in his durian what
0:07:36 for the next month or something like
0:07:37 that couple of weeks which i made a deal
0:07:40 for six hours now he had the best of
0:07:42 intentions from what he had said he
0:07:44 thought brita was making a deal so he
0:07:46 did it to preempt a deal all right all
0:07:48 right all right all right no no we got
0:07:49 to talk you're making me nervous
0:07:53 welcome to my world
0:07:55 johnny uh
0:07:56 puts uh pulls out the peck of morleys
0:07:58 and and uh puts a new one in his mouth
0:08:00 and offers neal one oh uh
0:08:03 no thanks
0:08:04 looking kind of skeptical that someone
0:08:06 would turn a cigarette down in a moment
0:08:08 like this he returns him to his pocket
0:08:10 and lights up his all right
0:08:14 let's go get in the truck

0:08:29 the next night comes when you awaken you
0:08:32 can kind of almost feel the cool touch
0:08:35 of a little boy's hand holding on to
0:08:37 yours which for you comes as a sensation
0:08:40 of relief after all the hardship of last
0:08:42 night and
0:08:43 sitting beside you is joey who
0:08:46 has this look of
0:08:48 concern
0:08:50 you kind of immediate just with the look
0:08:52 in the little boy's big ol eyes you get
0:08:54 the impression that he had been waiting
0:08:57 for you
0:08:58 just as you were waiting to check in on
0:09:00 him

0:09:21 can
0:09:23 i could feel the breeze of it already
0:09:24 and
0:09:26 um
0:09:27 some of the others that i've met are
0:09:29 saying that

0:09:44 i don't know buddy
0:09:46 there is a storm coming and
0:09:48 some bad things are probably gonna
0:09:50 happen
0:09:52 but i'm gonna do my best to protect you
0:09:54 from it okay
0:09:56 okay
0:09:58 um
0:10:00 okay
0:10:01 you're
0:10:02 you're in a scary place right now
0:10:05 i am
0:10:06 this place
0:10:08 i found out that
0:10:09 all of the stuff
0:10:11 all of the stuff that's here is made out
0:10:13 of people
0:10:15 yeah
0:10:16 yeah it is
0:10:19 and
0:10:20 the people don't stop being people they
0:10:22 just
0:10:24 joey
0:10:26 look at me buddy
0:10:27 yeah
0:10:29 i'm learning how to make sure that
0:10:30 doesn't happen to you
0:10:32 okay all right
0:10:34 and i'm gonna do my best to protect you
0:10:36 from it okay okay
0:10:39 i saw
0:10:41 i saw mr perfect
0:10:43 and he told me that
0:10:44 if i was bad
0:10:46 that
0:10:48 he would make me
0:10:49 an ashtray
0:10:51 or a cigarette and he would smoke me
0:10:54 can he do that
0:10:55 mr perfect can go pound salt up his ass
0:10:58 he kind of looks like a weird face when
0:11:00 you swear like that
0:11:01 but is
0:11:02 kind of cool with it too
0:11:05 i'm gonna figure out how to protect you
0:11:06 from mr perfect okay
0:11:08 but listen to me yeah
0:11:10 you're not a bad boy right
0:11:14 i
0:11:15 i think sometimes i have bad thoughts
0:11:17 but do you act on him i don't know i
0:11:19 think that's me too and he tells me that
0:11:23 he tells me that everyone's going to die
0:11:26 and that
0:11:28 and that you all hate me
0:11:31 no i don't hate you buddy
0:11:34 there's nothing you could do that would
0:11:35 make me hate you
0:11:36 even if i mess up
0:11:38 joey you could
0:11:39 i don't know i can't think of something
0:11:41 bad enough for you to do
0:11:43 to make me hate you

0:17:45 johnny kind of follows behind at a pace
0:17:48 looking up at the
0:17:50 upper floors
0:17:51 that look down on the foyer of the
0:17:54 interior of
0:17:55 miles haven
0:17:56 miles is coming back downstairs
0:17:59 he has shed his blood soaked shirt and
0:18:02 he's now essentially wearing
0:18:04 a smoking jacket whatever happened to be
0:18:07 convenient he just didn't feel like
0:18:08 dealing with it anymore
0:18:10 he had not time to put his hair together
0:18:12 he is
0:18:13 without his glasses currently
0:18:16 he moves down the stairs
0:18:18 he sees you all he looks at you all and
0:18:21 then he moves to a hallway and stands
0:18:24 there in the shadows and looks
0:18:27 for about a minute or so and then it
0:18:29 comes back
0:18:30 brita will
0:18:32 sing that reaction
0:18:33 she'll hold up her hand to indicate not
0:18:35 to follow her
0:18:36 she'll go to the bathroom she'll get the
0:18:38 book and the note she'll pass it first
0:18:41 to
0:18:42 when
0:18:43 wynn
0:18:45 kind of cautiously almost opens the note
0:18:47 and
0:18:48 looks at it
0:18:50 that son of a [ __ ]
0:18:53 that son of a
0:18:55 hey please please please okay
0:18:58 i know
0:19:00 i know i know you're not it's just
0:19:03 she looks at the note again does this
0:19:06 look whose handwriting does this look
0:19:08 like
0:19:08 it looks like handwriting okay she
0:19:11 passes
0:19:12 the note to johnny who's standing next
0:19:14 to her johnny takes it from when
0:19:17 glances down at it doesn't really seem
0:19:20 to
0:19:22 notice or care about anything about it
0:19:25 and does make a grimace
0:19:27 and just passes it right onto neil
0:19:29 neil takes the note looks down
0:19:32 reads it looks at the book
0:19:35 and gives a
0:19:36 sigh i'm not good at this kind of thing
0:19:39 brenda what does he need right now well
0:19:42 there's
0:19:42 more so
0:19:44 she holds out her hand and takes the
0:19:47 book
0:19:48 and
0:19:49 she goes and returns it to its place uh
0:19:52 in in the bathroom again indicating not
0:19:54 to follow her
0:19:55 every time that she exits the bathroom
0:19:57 there's a new weight to her
0:20:00 she comes back to you all and she says
0:20:03 okay
0:20:04 i've got it from here you've got it all
0:20:06 right
0:20:08 so he walks back over
0:20:10 marcos was tortured and murdered and
0:20:13 then embraced Reiss embraced him no i
0:20:16 embraced
0:20:18 him neil gets a panicked look on his
0:20:22 face
0:20:23 just
0:20:24 running through the all the
0:20:26 ramifications of that
0:20:27 johnny reaches out and puts a hand on
0:20:29 your shoulder
0:20:30 and gives you kind of like a smile and a
0:20:32 nod
0:20:34 like i get it wynn is kind of overcome
0:20:36 for the moment by the conversation she
0:20:39 just had with joey
0:20:40 and
0:20:42 kind of realizes that yeah this was this
0:20:44 was a stupid thing to do but
0:20:47 there's nothing she would do to protect
0:20:48 someone she loved
0:20:50 did it take
0:20:51 unsure
0:20:53 i have some
0:20:54 guests
0:20:56 that have hopefully drunken themselves
0:20:58 into inebriation but
0:21:00 i can deal with any fallout later in
0:21:02 case i have to provide blood to marcos
0:21:04 so
0:21:06 i don't know what he's going to
0:21:08 [Music]
0:21:09 possibly develop as a problem
0:21:11 so for now he can only feed on my blood
0:21:14 i know i'd rather not kill somebody
0:21:17 regardless
0:21:20 this
0:21:21 has been
0:21:22 a series of violations and i currently
0:21:26 have a demon trying to sell me on
0:21:28 bringing him back
0:21:29 you didn't take it did you
0:21:33 i said currently trying to sell me
0:21:36 i know i
0:21:38 miles
0:21:39 i'm going to be very precise right now
0:21:41 so i need you to stick with me okay
0:21:43 because i am on a razor's edge and i'd
0:21:46 rather not kill someone
0:21:48 understood i
0:21:50 okay
0:21:52 so
0:21:53 just
0:21:54 can you worry about you please tell us
0:21:57 the details of the deal that you made
0:22:00 he has a 49 share
0:22:03 in everything i do right now
0:22:05 which means he gets to call a vote
0:22:08 he doesn't get to determine what i do
0:22:09 and he also cannot torture or torment me
0:22:12 for the next 30 days
0:22:14 what happens at the end of 30 days he
0:22:16 returns to a circle or his home plane
0:22:18 which worked out because his circle was
0:22:20 broken
0:22:21 when you were staked
0:22:23 arabella is going to fix it i made
0:22:25 another deal
0:22:27 but you made the first seal with a demon
0:22:30 because you thought you were going to
0:22:32 broke her a deal
0:22:33 and seemingly i could hear different
0:22:35 things than what you guys could hear
0:22:37 so you made it
0:22:39 to protect me
0:22:41 yes
0:22:43 i thought it was the right thing to do
0:22:45 at the time
0:22:47 i'm sorry i
0:22:49 i can deal with the demon it's
0:22:51 unfortunate that these other
0:22:52 circumstances have come up it is
0:22:55 becoming trying
0:22:57 miles i've
0:22:58 seen this
0:23:00 scenario before i've been this scenario
0:23:02 before
0:23:04 with
0:23:05 someone being embraced and
0:23:07 not having permission to do it from the
0:23:09 prince and
0:23:11 you saved me then and you saved me now
0:23:14 and i just um
0:23:16 i don't
0:23:17 want it to go back on you now i'll
0:23:20 figure it
0:23:21 i always do it's okay to not have the
0:23:24 answers right now oh i don't have the
0:23:25 answers right now okay
0:23:27 i
0:23:28 sometimes have the answers but
0:23:31 i can generally figure it out as we go
0:23:33 along my
0:23:34 strengths of unadaptability
0:23:36 take a situation and live in it
0:23:39 but we know that rhys knows
0:23:42 what he did and if marcus i need you to
0:23:45 make sure that rhys is the one that did
0:23:46 this
0:23:48 what
0:23:50 it is very easy to make me a loaded gun
0:23:53 and i'm not smart enough to know
0:23:54 otherwise
0:23:56 so i need to make sure Reiss is the one
0:23:58 to do this you do what
0:24:01 murdered and tortured marcos he brings
0:24:04 up a really good point
0:24:06 we're not short on enemies right now
0:24:09 and
0:24:10 turning the most capable ventrue in the
0:24:12 city against the leader of the gemini
0:24:15 league
0:24:16 is actually a really good move
0:24:19 i can
0:24:20 i can look if you want at some point but
0:24:23 today is not the day tomorrow hopefully
0:24:25 but uh
0:24:26 sorry not when i was
0:24:28 if it is race if it's completely
0:24:30 definitely race
0:24:32 whether or not it's rhys acting against
0:24:35 you or whether it's somebody trying to
0:24:37 play you
0:24:39 the actions that you take next are
0:24:42 the fallout is kind of the same
0:24:45 behind you but
0:24:49 i just worry about
0:24:50 shooting from the hip right now
0:24:53 i think that's why we're figuring out
0:24:55 where our target is first neil is there
0:24:57 anything you can do to know more about
0:25:01 this i can
0:25:03 i'm not gonna go in there without your
0:25:05 permission miles but i can go take a
0:25:06 look
0:25:08 just be careful
0:25:09 you might
0:25:11 i need to sleep at that okay sure um
0:25:16 neil do you want some backup
0:25:18 if miles is okay with it
0:25:20 that's fine
0:25:21 okay
0:25:23 when stands behind neil and waits for
0:25:26 his move neil sort of steps backwards
0:25:29 out of the circle of the cuttery and
0:25:31 bread is it the bathroom that you just
0:25:33 came out of yeah
0:25:36 okay
0:25:37 and he starts to walk down the hallway
0:25:39 i go stand nor the sliding doors just
0:25:42 kind of looking out in the lawn
0:25:44 brita just lingers
0:25:46 within sight of miles
0:25:48 not close but just nearby johnny slowly
0:25:51 approaches
0:25:53 stands off on the side of his shoulder
0:25:55 i appreciate the caution and restraint
0:25:58 you're showing but when you're ready to
0:26:00 ride and rain hell down these bastards
0:26:02 i'm [ __ ] ready
0:26:06 it is so easy for some of them to do
0:26:08 such stupid things
0:26:12 they're going to regret it
0:26:14 not for long
0:26:16 but they will
0:26:18 [Music]
0:26:24 when follows neil
0:26:26 neil
0:26:27 slowly and
0:26:29 almost like he's afraid
0:26:30 not of what's inside the bathroom but
0:26:32 just the general atmosphere and and
0:26:35 everything going on
0:26:37 and goes to open the door
0:26:39 to the bathroom that
0:26:41 miles said he could enter and bruta said
0:26:43 was the right place just to take a look
0:26:46 a lot of it's cleaned up now
0:26:49 but marcos is there
0:26:51 and the book is there and
0:26:54 is the knife still in the bathroom yes
0:26:56 but he looks around these definitely
0:26:58 look like suicide ones right like he
0:27:00 slid his wrists yes it looks like
0:27:02 someone killed themselves
0:27:05 i mean
0:27:06 so the way i would do this
0:27:08 neil says and there's like a weird sort
0:27:10 of tone in his voice like a chill goes
0:27:13 up a spine when he says it as i would
0:27:15 just get inside marcos head
0:27:17 and have him kill himself right before
0:27:19 miles woke up
0:27:20 nothing violated no domains no issues he
0:27:23 just takes his own life that's kind of
0:27:25 what i was thinking too ain't no rule
0:27:27 against doing that against a ghoul it's
0:27:29 impolite but i just
0:27:32 god and he takes a look around trying to
0:27:36 take in the patterns of what happened
0:27:38 here neil zones out and it seems like
0:27:40 he's probably going to be at this for a
0:27:41 while
0:27:45 [Music]
0:27:48 miles sort of
0:27:50 takes a seat and
0:27:51 whatever's going through his head is
0:27:53 going through his mind quickly
0:27:54 and
0:27:56 johnny steps outside for a cigarette
0:27:58 brita takes a second ascending a nod to
0:28:02 miles and follows johnny outside she
0:28:05 is doing that same behavior of
0:28:08 writing her fingertips along the glove
0:28:11 on her palm she's approaching johnny
0:28:14 slowly
0:28:15 not really looking at him
0:28:18 you all right in that kid
0:28:21 johnny
0:28:23 with everything that's
0:28:26 happened
0:28:27 this
0:28:29 feel so much like
0:28:32 me
0:28:34 but we
0:28:36 everything that happened in salem
0:28:38 and what
0:28:40 what zee said
0:28:42 it's it's about about me
0:28:45 i am
0:28:47 and
0:28:48 she lifts her hand
0:28:50 and
0:28:51 still not really looking at johnny she
0:28:53 takes off her glove
0:28:56 and
0:28:57 she's shaking uh her hand is shaking and
0:29:00 she's not really successful at first
0:29:02 like unballing her hand from the fists
0:29:05 and she holds her hand out
0:29:07 to johnny
0:29:09 and forces her fingers to straighten to
0:29:12 show
0:29:13 that there is a black crescent moon on
0:29:15 her palm
0:29:17 johnny
0:29:18 looks over
0:29:20 johnny stares blank and for a moment
0:29:22 johnny you recall the sounds of a shovel
0:29:26 digging a hole in the ground
0:29:28 and a big meaty hand gripping you by the
0:29:31 neck and dragging you
0:29:34 as the blood of
0:29:37 a bruja flows through your veins and
0:29:39 starts to change you
0:29:41 damning you and this figure tosses you
0:29:44 casually down into this pit where other
0:29:47 bodies are being collected and you
0:29:49 remember see looking up as the embrace
0:29:51 just started to take you
0:29:53 and seeing that same
0:29:55 cold black crescent moon right in his
0:29:58 palm
0:29:59 and for a moment your blood boils
0:30:02 johnny's eyes
0:30:04 suddenly widen and focus
0:30:07 they snap up to you
0:30:09 and i should probably make a frenzy
0:30:11 check right
0:30:12 you're rolling at a difficulty 10
0:30:15 how about a difficulty nine thanks to
0:30:17 neil's passion
0:30:19 sounds good to me you will absolutely
0:30:20 spend a point of willpower
0:30:24 and have two successes johnny maintains
0:30:27 control but as the rest of this
0:30:29 conversation his fangs are out as soon
0:30:31 as his fangs show britta
0:30:35 actually looks like she's just
0:30:37 readying to let johnny attack her
0:30:40 she's shaking and she's still
0:30:43 and
0:30:43 she
0:30:45 looks frozen
0:30:47 the
0:30:48 balcony the two of them are standing on
0:30:53 is corralled by a small
0:30:56 stone railing
0:30:57 and you hear
0:30:59 the
0:31:00 edge of it crack a little bit under one
0:31:02 of his hands
0:31:04 and with shocking speed he grabs your
0:31:07 hand
0:31:09 and then very slowly
0:31:11 turns it so that the moon is facing down
0:31:14 and puts your hand
0:31:16 onto the railing as well
0:31:18 he lets go
0:31:20 and calmly brings his hand back
0:31:23 so that you're both just
0:31:25 leaning and looking out into the night
0:31:30 did you keep doing that to yourself
0:31:33 doing what
0:31:34 the moon
0:31:36 when i when i went with wynn
0:31:39 when she saw the giovanni they
0:31:41 i don't know what he did it just um
0:31:44 one of the giovanni there he did
0:31:46 something and
0:31:48 it must have
0:31:50 it must have been there all along i
0:31:52 don't
0:31:53 know why johnny i'm sorry i you don't
0:31:56 have to be sorry for anything kid
0:31:58 that symbol
0:32:00 it's got a history with me
0:32:02 one of the worst nights of my life
0:32:05 i think uh
0:32:07 i think you know what it's like to have
0:32:09 a night like that
0:32:11 i didn't
0:32:12 mean to of course you didn't
0:32:15 hey i'm sorry if i scared you
0:32:18 my beast
0:32:20 doesn't let me be calm like i used to
0:32:24 when i just drove trucks for a living
0:32:26 i could handle myself
0:32:29 you know i was a big guy i could i could
0:32:31 get into fights and i but i never lost
0:32:33 control
0:32:34 ever since that bastard with the moon on
0:32:36 his hand found me
0:32:40 i i i
0:32:43 i don't know what
0:32:45 it's just
0:32:46 it's that thing inside right it rattles
0:32:48 the cage
0:32:50 it makes me wanna
0:32:52 kill something
0:32:55 and tonight we're all on edge
0:32:58 i just needed to
0:33:00 show you i wanted to show you ever since
0:33:03 that
0:33:04 ever since the demon mentioned it
0:33:06 because
0:33:08 you guys
0:33:09 i haven't tried to remember everything
0:33:11 and
0:33:12 i
0:33:13 don't know what i am i don't know if i'm
0:33:16 like the people that did that to you and
0:33:18 i don't want to be i don't want to be
0:33:21 like them at night
0:33:22 hey
0:33:24 we were all a lot different
0:33:27 before we were made like this
0:33:30 the thing inside of us
0:33:32 is not our friend
0:33:34 it never is going to be our friend
0:33:36 and we need to remind ourselves
0:33:39 that all this [ __ ] goes back to that
0:33:43 so whatever that symbol on your hand
0:33:45 means
0:33:46 wherever it came from
0:33:48 it's not you
0:33:51 that's not the man i was before this
0:33:54 it's not
0:33:55 miles
0:33:56 it's not marcos it's not neil it's not
0:33:59 win
0:34:02 thank you
0:34:03 thank you johnny i
0:34:06 thank you
0:34:08 now you need to keep it together
0:34:10 because
0:34:11 miles in there
0:34:13 needs someone like you
0:34:15 to help guide him through this with
0:34:17 grace
0:34:19 cause i'm only gonna [ __ ] it up
0:34:21 you do better than you think johnny
0:34:23 so do you
0:34:29 [Music]
0:34:33 we pick up with
0:34:34 anil alone in the bathroom with a
0:34:37 cadaver and that's just sort of sitting
0:34:40 laying in the tub
0:34:42 bled out and when outside the door kind
0:34:44 of keeping watch
0:34:46 as neil conducts his investigation
0:34:50 neil
0:34:51 walk me through the process tell me
0:34:53 about how you start
0:34:55 what actions you take in order to pursue
0:34:57 knowledge
0:34:58 the first thing that neil does
0:35:00 is he looks at wynn outside the door
0:35:03 he says hey i am
0:35:06 i need a minute here uh
0:35:08 he's probably not gonna
0:35:10 get up right now it's it's i'll probably
0:35:12 be okay but if he does i
0:35:14 you'll hear me yell right and he goes to
0:35:17 put a hand on the door and just close
0:35:19 the door to the bathroom
0:35:20 so he's completely alone in here wind
0:35:23 kind of gives a nod
0:35:24 it's
0:35:26 it'll just be a minute um and you'll
0:35:28 hear me yelling if if i need
0:35:31 i just i got you man
0:35:33 thanks one
0:35:34 and he looks and for a while
0:35:36 all he does is just
0:35:38 look at the corpse in the bathtub
0:35:41 looks at the obvious
0:35:43 wounds on its on on its wrists
0:35:47 realizes for a second that
0:35:49 he thinks of the corpse as in it rather
0:35:51 than marcos
0:35:53 for just a second
0:35:54 so that catches him off guard and he
0:35:56 sort of ponders the ramifications of
0:35:58 that line of thought
0:35:59 and realizes that miles wants some
0:36:01 answers he wants some some knowledge
0:36:04 looks at the notebook whether the note
0:36:05 that was left in the handwriting
0:36:08 and just sort of gets a a quick
0:36:10 once-over
0:36:11 sees the red ring like in the tub where
0:36:14 the water had drained
0:36:16 gives a sigh and then looks
0:36:18 maybe strangely over at the toilet
0:36:21 has a lot of thoughts of you know people
0:36:23 don't really use this bathroom
0:36:26 bathrooms in a haven particularly miles
0:36:27 house are mostly for show
0:36:30 except for guests
0:36:32 probably flashes back to a time when
0:36:33 like he and miles got into like a weird
0:36:36 debate about toilet seat etiquette that
0:36:39 has not applied to either of them in
0:36:41 decades
0:36:42 and then goes over and looks directly
0:36:44 into the water
0:36:46 in the toilet
0:36:49 gives a sigh and then
0:36:52 sort of whispers to
0:36:54 spirits that not even he can see
0:36:57 just um
0:36:59 show me what happened here i need to see
0:37:01 it
0:37:02 go ahead and give me a roll for bath
0:37:04 activation
0:37:08 successes
0:37:09 with three successes
0:37:11 the water
0:37:12 kind of uh
0:37:14 not ripples it
0:37:16 just that little bit of motion that
0:37:18 usually exists
0:37:20 kind of stops and it becomes as though
0:37:22 you're looking at this completely flat
0:37:25 smooth surface and the water is
0:37:28 reflection begins to show things that
0:37:32 are not currently happening images of
0:37:34 the past what you see
0:37:37 is
0:37:38 marcos uh
0:37:40 zipping up his fly
0:37:42 and
0:37:43 pulling out his phone with like this
0:37:44 panicked expression and he kind of like
0:37:47 leans against the wall and he's kind of
0:37:49 talking for a bit
0:37:50 he then goes to like wash his hands
0:37:53 and
0:37:54 kind of like does this thing where he
0:37:56 like slaps the sides of his face trying
0:37:58 to kind of keep things
0:38:00 together
0:38:01 he seems to be uh stressed
0:38:05 about the phone call not frightened
0:38:08 it's not like he received like a threat
0:38:10 or anything like that
0:38:12 but as he like
0:38:14 finishes washing his hands us face
0:38:16 swipes off kind of like
0:38:18 stares in the mirror for a little while
0:38:19 and then
0:38:21 some
0:38:22 thing settles over him that is unseen
0:38:25 and rather abruptly he kind of stands
0:38:28 straight his body language completely
0:38:29 changes
0:38:31 whoever it is that is now in control
0:38:32 steps out of the bedroom
0:38:34 and comes back sometime later
0:38:38 with
0:38:39 the
0:38:40 items needed in order to complete or
0:38:43 create the scene that you are now
0:38:45 looking at in in real time it starts to
0:38:49 kind of become clear
0:38:51 that
0:38:52 while he's laying in the tub
0:38:55 slowly bleeding out
0:38:57 there's this smile on his face
0:39:00 like he's experiencing an oddity
0:39:03 as if death was like something that
0:39:05 existed to amuse him
0:39:07 a passing interest
0:39:09 and he
0:39:11 talks
0:39:12 to no one in the room having kind of
0:39:14 this like monologue
0:39:17 to an empty bathroom
0:39:18 and right before
0:39:21 he dies
0:39:23 you can see
0:39:24 whoever is was in control
0:39:28 returns
0:39:29 marcus
0:39:31 uh his body
0:39:33 and it's marcus's eyes going wide with
0:39:35 realization of where he is and what he's
0:39:37 doing
0:39:38 and with this
0:39:40 terrified look
0:39:42 he passes on
0:39:44 hopeless and afraid
0:39:48 watching all that play out
0:39:51 uh
0:39:52 sort of
0:39:53 horrified by the entire scene for the
0:39:56 sake of knowledge and for the sake of
0:39:58 his friend uh neil
0:40:01 watching
0:40:02 the
0:40:02 looking at the note that was presumably
0:40:05 written when he was not in control of
0:40:07 himself
0:40:08 watching all the moments the way he was
0:40:10 acting when he was not in his control
0:40:12 himself
0:40:13 neil opens his eyes further
0:40:15 and
0:40:16 tries to
0:40:18 see
0:40:19 the invisible hand
0:40:21 puppeting this entire sort of stage play
0:40:25 in front of him
0:40:26 uh so we're trying to use eyes of chaos
0:40:28 just to kind of get an idea of who's
0:40:29 doing this just to be sure for miles of
0:40:32 sick uh difficulty okay
0:40:36 it is on marcos not marcus i thought i
0:40:39 just said markus you said marcus
0:40:41 six successes
0:40:43 uh with six successes
0:40:46 it is the red
0:40:47 of the tub that kind of stands out the
0:40:49 most
0:40:50 you kind of like frantically move the
0:40:52 body and
0:40:54 to kind of get an understanding of of
0:40:56 this this
0:40:57 tub and
0:40:59 the the pool of blood that was in it and
0:41:01 some of it's still kind of
0:41:03 reddening the tub
0:41:06 when you move marcos's body
0:41:09 you see a
0:41:10 cross
0:41:12 and a field of red
0:41:15 and you
0:41:16 think of
0:41:18 the rosy cross
0:41:21 and
0:41:22 when thinking of the rosy cross
0:41:25 what comes to mind is
0:41:27 the hermetic approach
0:41:30 you know as above so below
0:41:33 miracles were worked in order to see
0:41:35 this man die
0:41:39 crouch down
0:41:41 already having touched the body
0:41:45 neil considers
0:41:47 touching more opening his senses more
0:41:49 looking for more information and then
0:41:51 decides
0:41:53 maybe wisely maybe just out of fear
0:41:56 not
0:41:57 to try and glean the final impressions
0:42:00 of death
0:42:01 from
0:42:02 marcos's corpse
0:42:05 and he looks at him for a while and is
0:42:07 just
0:42:08 quiet
0:42:10 until he finally says
0:42:13 marcos
0:42:15 i know
0:42:17 i know you had a family and i know how
0:42:19 much
0:42:21 you meant to miles
0:42:24 he was willing to
0:42:27 to break the laws of the domain
0:42:30 to throw away the loss of the camarilla
0:42:32 just for a chance that you might come
0:42:34 back
0:42:36 but if you
0:42:38 care about him
0:42:41 if you love him
0:42:45 the way that i do
0:42:50 i need you
0:42:52 to stay dead
0:42:56 please stay dead
0:43:00 i'm so sorry
0:43:04 i'm so sorry
0:43:08 but you can't come back
0:43:13 and i need to do what i have to do
0:43:15 [Music]
0:43:17 to protect miles
0:43:20 because he
0:43:21 protects us
0:43:24 and somebody has to watch out for him
0:43:32 and
0:43:33 neil
0:43:34 will
0:43:35 move his hand
0:43:37 sort of inside marcus's shirt like
0:43:39 between the buttons of the button down
0:43:41 and put a hand directly over his heart
0:43:45 and then with one last sigh
0:43:47 like trying to steal himself to do it
0:43:51 will
0:43:53 summon an effort of will
0:43:55 and transform
0:43:57 the vitae
0:43:59 that miles gave him
0:44:01 the last bit of blood in his body that
0:44:03 might animate him and give him the gift
0:44:06 of on life to water so that he never
0:44:09 gets up
0:44:11 you don't see very much of an effect his
0:44:12 body remains lifeless
0:44:15 but you know that the magic was
0:44:16 successfully enacted
0:44:18 he just
0:44:20 sits there for a while
0:44:22 with a hand on his chest
0:44:28 gives another little shaking sigh
0:44:30 and then
0:44:31 puts his hand on the edge of the tub to
0:44:33 like help himself stand up
0:44:36 goes and washes his hands
0:44:38 in the sink
0:44:39 sort of in an unconscious parallel to
0:44:42 the way he had just seen marcos
0:44:44 washing his hands
0:44:46 dries them off on his pants
0:44:48 and then opens the door
0:44:50 to see when
0:44:51 wayne is just standing against the door
0:44:53 frame arms crossed kind of head low
0:44:56 just kind of contemplating things she
0:44:58 occasionally lifts her head and
0:45:01 looks around
0:45:03 looking for things that
0:45:05 may or may not come
0:45:07 it sometimes takes a while for wraiths
0:45:09 to appear
0:45:11 neil looks
0:45:13 not okay
0:45:15 when he opens the door
0:45:16 like he's trying to shake off
0:45:19 the ghost of whatever he saw in there
0:45:23 uh
0:45:24 he went um
0:45:25 hey
0:45:27 so
0:45:28 um
0:45:29 yeah i think
0:45:31 i mean first hunches were right it was
0:45:33 definitely
0:45:35 probably uh
0:45:37 race
0:45:38 uh gives a nod like she's
0:45:41 not surprised
0:45:43 just
0:45:44 she doesn't even really have the energy
0:45:46 to be angry at him at this point she's
0:45:47 just she spent so much time angry at
0:45:50 Reiss
0:45:51 i think um
0:45:53 i mean i don't know for a fact but i i
0:45:55 watched it i watched i watched it all
0:45:57 play
0:45:59 in out
0:45:59 time
0:46:01 he
0:46:03 miles drained the tub but
0:46:05 nobody flushed the toilet
0:46:08 and you can see in the water
0:46:10 there are spirits of water that hold
0:46:13 those kind of memories
0:46:15 so
0:46:16 i watched all of it
0:46:19 but i watched him die um
0:46:22 i think rhys possessed him
0:46:24 made him do those things
0:46:27 and then left him to die right at the
0:46:28 end
0:46:29 i couldn't hear what he was saying
0:46:32 but
0:46:34 i think
0:46:35 and i think they were right i think it
0:46:37 was definitely rhys
0:46:39 which makes sense
0:46:41 based on the other context clues but
0:46:49 i don't um
0:46:51 i don't really want to be near this
0:46:52 bathroom anymore okay can we no let's go
0:46:56 [Music]
0:47:02 out in the main area
0:47:04 um johnny has
0:47:07 convinced
0:47:08 miles to maybe come out in the balcony
0:47:10 and share a cigarette with him and uh
0:47:12 britta
0:47:14 you want to tell me where your head's at
0:47:17 figuring out the next steps mostly
0:47:21 one way or another
0:47:23 there will be a price that needs to be
0:47:24 paid
0:47:26 well
0:47:27 if i can make a single recommendation
0:47:29 i'm listening
0:47:31 you are technically sheriff
0:47:33 and there are
0:47:35 a couple other bully boys in the city a
0:47:37 few people who i might actually trust to
0:47:39 come at least help clean up around here
0:47:41 i don't think that you need to
0:47:43 necessarily be the one getting things
0:47:46 patched up
0:47:47 i can help oversee that
0:47:49 if he doesn't come back
0:47:51 we need to do it in such a way that his
0:47:53 family is
0:47:55 left without questions i understand
0:47:58 that's uh that's something me and the
0:47:59 bully boys can handle possibly something
0:48:01 to put them at ease but
0:48:04 death is never
0:48:05 especially in its final form easy to
0:48:07 take i hate to say this won't be the
0:48:09 first time i've disposed of a ghoul that
0:48:11 hasn't made it all the way
0:48:14 all right
0:48:16 oh we adventure territory right now
0:48:19 where in my domain correct well we might
0:48:22 be able to
0:48:24 do something politically
0:48:26 i know that that probably tastes bad
0:48:29 right now but
0:48:30 it's one of the forms of power you could
0:48:32 have as sheriff right i mean
0:48:36 i know that he's
0:48:37 race is powerful too but
0:48:41 if he invaded well hold on now we don't
0:48:44 necessarily know for certain that that's
0:48:46 you made this attack i think it's likely
0:48:50 but i want to keep you
0:48:53 on your toes before we start getting too
0:48:55 obsessed with
0:48:57 revenge
0:48:58 that's true
0:49:00 what's the most important thing for you
0:49:02 to take care of right now miles
0:49:04 the next step whatever happens by the
0:49:06 end of this tonight
0:49:08 and from there we'll see how things
0:49:10 play out
0:49:12 i have some thoughts but
0:49:14 we need to find out exactly
0:49:16 who did this and possibly why
0:49:19 so does that mean that we're heading to
0:49:21 court not tonight
0:49:23 all right
0:49:24 miles what i'm going to do is i'm going
0:49:26 to go call some people and i'm going to
0:49:28 get this
0:49:29 process started
0:49:30 i hope
0:49:32 that we don't have to deal with marcos
0:49:35 but i'm gonna be ready to do what we
0:49:37 need to do
0:49:38 if he doesn't get back up
0:49:40 right
0:49:41 stay here with brita
0:49:43 i want you to think about what our next
0:49:45 steps are his eyes flash over to brita
0:49:48 you good to be out here with him
0:49:50 yeah he reaches out and kind of puts a
0:49:52 hand on both of your shoulders and gives
0:49:54 you guys a kind of a tight squeeze on
0:49:55 the shoulders
0:49:57 a nod and then walks in to go presumably
0:50:00 call some of the other bully boys of the
0:50:01 city to start getting arrangements made
0:50:04 he's not waking up
0:50:06 i felt it
0:50:08 he has passed on miles
0:50:10 and
0:50:13 what a terrible fate awaits the man
0:50:16 who would abandon his children for
0:50:18 immortality
0:50:21 what suffering
0:50:24 awaits him and the realms beyond
0:50:29 thank you z
0:50:30 um sorry what
0:50:32 i'm sorry the demon was talking to me
0:50:34 again uh
0:50:36 has he been
0:50:37 off and on yes what's he saying to you
0:50:40 look at the fear in her eyes
0:50:42 he's telling me that marcos is
0:50:45 passed from this world and
0:50:47 that his soul will be in some sort of
0:50:49 hell or torment there are not words for
0:50:51 what he will suffer so i will never
0:50:54 waste my time
0:50:55 trying to describe it
0:50:57 marcos was good
0:51:00 all right i don't know
0:51:03 anything about
0:51:04 i guess what we're supposed to believe
0:51:06 about the afterlife for us but i don't
0:51:09 think you have to be afraid for him i
0:51:11 don't know i don't usually concern
0:51:13 myself with that kind of
0:51:14 thought it doesn't really lead anywhere
0:51:17 he kind of
0:51:18 puts the cigarette out on the banister
0:51:20 moves to go inside
0:51:22 let's see if they found anything yet i'm
0:51:25 the demon may be telling the truth it
0:51:27 may not i
0:51:29 i expected this kind of deal
0:51:31 when i took it
0:51:32 okay
0:51:33 just um
0:51:35 check in with us
0:51:37 milesight
0:51:39 i understand the hesitation
0:51:42 but
0:51:44 it is not usually
0:51:46 the way i operate to check in on all my
0:51:48 actions before i perform them that's
0:51:50 that's not it miles said this is very
0:51:52 true
0:51:53 it's because
0:51:55 you did this to help me
0:51:58 and i
0:51:59 i don't want you hurt because of me i
0:52:02 don't i don't want that i don't want you
0:52:03 to do anything to you because of me
0:52:05 because you stepped in to try to make
0:52:07 sure it didn't happen to me
0:52:09 so that's that's why i'm asking you to
0:52:10 check in not because i think that you're
0:52:12 gonna do anything weird it's i just
0:52:15 i appreciate it but it was also my
0:52:17 choice
0:52:18 and i get that
0:52:19 part of that choice was influenced upon
0:52:21 you but
0:52:22 it was my choice and i don't
0:52:26 for a second regret it
0:52:27 and that's the thing
0:52:29 we have to make these choices
0:52:31 britta looks down and she's like
0:52:34 nodding like slowly deeply uh it clearly
0:52:37 affects her quite a bit to hear that and
0:52:39 she
0:52:40 says quietly just
0:52:42 thank you
0:52:43 miles
0:52:44 i yeah
0:52:47 there was my own hueverse in this to
0:52:49 come to play but
0:52:51 nothing i didn't expect
0:52:53 all right
0:52:54 let's go check in
0:52:56 yes
0:52:58 let's see if neil's found anything else
0:53:00 and then
0:53:02 i don't know
0:53:03 yeah i need to cleo
0:53:06 i feel like
0:53:07 i should make clear marcos story if this
0:53:10 is the end of it
0:53:12 whatever
0:53:13 helps
0:53:14 and then
0:53:16 we need to figure out what's next but
0:53:19 we can take it step by step and
0:53:22 johnny knows what he's doing he really
0:53:24 can help
0:53:25 right
0:53:26 right
0:53:27 there's kind of a hand on the doorway
0:53:29 and it's
0:53:30 kind of
0:53:31 crushing the wood but not in the same
0:53:33 way that johnny's does
0:53:36 um not nearly in the same capacity but
0:53:39 it's like there will be
0:53:41 other prices that need to be paid
0:53:44 brita gently reaches out and
0:53:46 places a hand on miles shoulder
0:53:50 he nods
0:53:52 i'm moves in
0:53:54 she follows
0:53:55 miles seems a bit lost in thought for a
0:53:58 moment
0:53:59 miles
0:54:01 how do you intend to compete
0:54:03 against our medic former turkey
0:54:07 i'm going to answer this one in my brain
0:54:08 instead of out loud um
0:54:12 mostly because i've noticed it started
0:54:13 freaking people out um
0:54:14 [Laughter]
0:54:18 i haven't
0:54:19 figured that out yet i might not go
0:54:22 direct can't imagine that the termier
0:54:25 never mind rhys has invaded quite a few
0:54:27 enemies by being
0:54:29 the unapologetic dick that he is
0:54:32 rhys
0:54:34 Reiss
0:54:37 is powerful
0:54:39 within the limited scope of his world
0:54:43 he will defeat you
0:54:46 every time
0:54:48 because while you experiment
0:54:51 an indirect means of striking at your
0:54:54 enemies
0:54:55 he has mastered it
0:54:58 and every time you maneuver
0:55:00 you will lose someone
0:55:03 and in this game of attrition
0:55:06 rhys will break you
0:55:09 he is already halfway there
0:55:12 i can feel
0:55:14 the way you mourn your pawn
0:55:17 you will lose
0:55:20 so what are you trying to offer me
0:55:22 i'm simply going to make observations
0:55:26 until you ask
0:55:29 and i will do what none of your
0:55:31 quarterly mates are willing to do
0:55:33 and be honest
0:55:35 about what it is
0:55:37 that you can expect
0:55:40 they're young and hopeful
0:55:43 they do not understand that they are
0:55:45 already dead
0:55:46 and that they have already lost so much
0:55:49 said they will say kind words
0:55:51 they will hold your hand they will hug
0:55:53 you they will tell you that he has gone
0:55:55 on to a better place and that you will
0:55:57 go on to a better place when you meet
0:55:59 final death
0:56:00 but you will not
0:56:03 they will encourage you to play this
0:56:04 game
0:56:06 to be swept up in the illusion of
0:56:08 civility
0:56:10 or at the end of all kindred conflicts
0:56:13 the resolution comes only from death
0:56:18 avoid death oh you will but Reiss will
0:56:20 not
0:56:22 he will kill those who love
0:56:24 and you know it
0:56:26 i hear you
0:56:28 though i do feel like
0:56:30 there's quite a bit of
0:56:32 cynicism in there but
0:56:36 i imagine that comes from living forever
0:56:39 there are those who believe they will
0:56:40 live forever
0:56:42 and there are those who do so
0:56:44 that cynicism you feel
0:56:47 what you hear
0:56:48 that is the difference between the two
0:56:51 i'll take your words under advisement
0:56:52 for now
0:56:54 i look forward to the next show
0:56:56 miles then shakes his head with a ruffle
0:57:00 kind of smile thing and
0:57:02 moves towards the couch
0:57:04 waiting for
0:57:05 neil to finish whatever he's doing in
0:57:07 the bathroom
0:57:11 [Music]
0:57:14 neil and wyn
0:57:16 come back from the bathroom towards the
0:57:18 main room
0:57:20 neil sort of looks around and
0:57:21 gives a
0:57:23 tired uh nod to miles
0:57:27 so um
0:57:28 as always i i need to sort of put the
0:57:30 disclaimer that there are no certainties
0:57:32 in the world but
0:57:35 the
0:57:36 marcos was possessed and
0:57:39 the puppet master that did it
0:57:41 uh left the telltale signs of someone
0:57:46 basically someone versed in hermetic
0:57:49 thaumaturgy so that
0:57:51 i mean if it looks like a tremere and
0:57:53 smells like it's from here
0:57:55 that's um but you don't have a definite
0:57:58 as definite as i
0:57:59 can be
0:58:00 that it was
0:58:02 a percentage
0:58:03 oh um
0:58:06 90 to 95.
0:58:08 that's actually much higher than i
0:58:09 thought
0:58:10 well
0:58:11 are you saying 1995 that it's jamia or
0:58:13 that it's rhys
0:58:14 that it is a tremeer
0:58:17 but context clues you know say it was
0:58:20 rhys the reason
0:58:21 i always say there's not
0:58:23 uh certainty
0:58:24 in the world is because i'm not
0:58:27 arrogant enough to think that i can't be
0:58:28 wrong about things but
0:58:30 all signs point to race at least the way
0:58:32 i see them
0:58:34 i watched it play out and i
0:58:37 yeah i think it was race
0:58:40 the fact that we haven't really
0:58:42 pissed off a hermetic
0:58:44 user enough to do this kind of deal does
0:58:46 other than him
0:58:48 the only ones we dealt with now that
0:58:50 doesn't mean
0:58:51 it was rhys
0:58:53 it might have been a rhys cat's paw he's
0:58:55 sort of in charge of the premiere
0:58:58 in the area but
0:58:59 it seemed
0:59:01 it was like clearly dancing around like
0:59:04 describing how he died to miles but
0:59:07 i'll just nod basically to allow him to
0:59:10 move past it
0:59:11 there seemed to be a sense of personal
0:59:13 satisfaction to it
0:59:15 like
0:59:16 like death was an amusing oddity
0:59:19 that the person doing it doesn't usually
0:59:22 get to experience first hand
0:59:24 if that
0:59:26 makes sense
0:59:28 miles face kind of flattens at that and
0:59:30 becomes way more cold
0:59:33 yeah
0:59:34 just
0:59:36 trying to be
0:59:37 i know this puts us in a really tenuous
0:59:40 position
0:59:41 but
0:59:42 in regards to what
0:59:46 it's not like we can go kill rhys
0:59:48 so i i just
0:59:50 not at the moment no also we can't
0:59:52 really do much planning if he can float
0:59:54 around my haven at will what do you mean
0:59:57 i mean
0:59:58 kill him i assume that's kind of what
1:00:01 was in your brain
1:00:02 he will pay
1:00:04 here's
1:00:07 are you looking for
1:00:07 [Music]
1:00:09 sympathy or opinions right now
1:00:11 i don't know okay
1:00:13 i totally get that
1:00:14 we can discuss some of that later sure i
1:00:17 just needed information we're not doing
1:00:21 anything in regards to most of that
1:00:23 tonight for various reasons never mind
1:00:25 the fact that we have
1:00:26 just had a long
1:00:29 journey to boston
1:00:31 and we are not in the position to do
1:00:32 much good i'm not going to start flying
1:00:36 off the handle here i understand that
1:00:39 also
1:00:41 you can't get proper vengeance by just
1:00:43 flying off the handle
1:00:44 and we don't know if marcos might get up
1:00:48 so that's part of the next steps isn't
1:00:50 it
1:00:51 we shall see there's a knocking on the
1:00:54 uh frame
1:00:57 entrance of the kind of main sitting
1:00:59 area uh where johnny has kind of
1:01:01 re-entered and just wanted to let
1:01:03 everyone know that he's back in the room
1:01:05 he looks over at miles
1:01:07 i got some guys in the way
1:01:09 you good
1:01:10 yes well has marcos
1:01:13 no and our
1:01:15 hangar on believes that he is passed
1:01:18 johnny kind of nods like he doesn't
1:01:21 quite understand but doesn't look like
1:01:23 he's gonna press you on that do you
1:01:25 think he knows
1:01:27 for sure
1:01:28 that's hard to say i don't know what
1:01:29 demons lie
1:01:31 so what's the on the agenda for tonight
1:01:34 i'm gonna need to go
1:01:36 hunting for real can i make some
1:01:38 recommendations
1:01:39 sure
1:01:40 neil you need to go back to your haven
1:01:43 and make sure things are okay there
1:01:45 if
1:01:46 miles haven was hit i want to make sure
1:01:49 that your haven was
1:01:51 you've gotten you've got delicate things
1:01:53 there
1:01:54 he gives you kind of a knowing look i i
1:01:56 do and if i'm being totally honest uh
1:01:59 there's a there's a package i i gotta
1:02:01 look for that's what i'm talking about
1:02:03 oh i thought you meant all the other
1:02:04 stuff i have there there's a lot of
1:02:06 delicate things you have there and the
1:02:08 demon showed me
1:02:09 all my stuff getting wrecked when
1:02:12 i think you should see if you can track
1:02:14 down raven because a conversation needs
1:02:16 to happen there do you have the pages
1:02:19 i do should we make copies
1:02:21 i'll leave that up to you do you want
1:02:23 them
1:02:24 i'll take them johnny reaches inside his
1:02:26 jacket and hands some
1:02:28 nasty looking pages over to win i'm more
1:02:31 than happy to get those off my person i
1:02:33 figured you would be
1:02:35 britta
1:02:36 i think feeding is a good idea
1:02:39 miles i think you should go with her the
1:02:41 two of you can get some food and then
1:02:43 maybe start
1:02:45 making some inroads with other members
1:02:47 of the court not necessarily at alesium
1:02:49 but maybe you can get a hold of nyx and
1:02:52 see about having a uh a conversation
1:02:55 maybe at a nightclub where you can find
1:02:56 some musicians for uh the big guy here
1:03:00 there are some here i'm not going
1:03:02 anywhere tonight i think it might be
1:03:04 good for you to do so
1:03:07 no it will not
1:03:10 while i am in control currently i will
1:03:12 not continue to be so
1:03:15 how about this then
1:03:16 if the musicians are willing i could
1:03:19 feed from them
1:03:21 if they are okay with that and
1:03:23 that way there's someone with you
1:03:25 and we can go back to court so we'll
1:03:28 operate either way but
1:03:30 i feel like court will be best tomorrow
1:03:32 night i cannot risk
1:03:34 i'm just talking about having you go
1:03:35 downtown and get out of your haven for a
1:03:37 couple of hours miles this phone rings
1:03:40 what's the number
1:03:42 Reiss
1:03:46 [Music]
1:03:50 i think we're gonna need a self-control
1:03:52 check
1:03:53 and you know what you need to do
1:03:58 what is that a six up one stick away yep
1:04:00 that phone breaks
1:04:02 well did you if you oh i failed so
1:04:04 you're frenzied oh yeah okay the object
1:04:06 of my frenzy then gets destroyed
1:04:11 fangs bear and he makes a completely
1:04:13 inhuman sound crushing the phone in his
1:04:16 hand
1:04:17 johnny's just gonna see if he can get
1:04:19 people out of the room
1:04:21 just let him spend his anger and just
1:04:23 tear apart the place because these
1:04:24 possessions all need to go and actually
1:04:26 getting that out might help him rather
1:04:28 than trying to restrain him in this
1:04:30 moment the subject of his frenzy is not
1:04:31 any of you so you guys are actually able
1:04:32 to kind of like back out as long as you
1:04:34 don't do anything to draw attention to
1:04:36 yourselves brita is about to talk so you
1:04:39 know that brita's habit is to try to
1:04:41 talk people at a frenzy i think you have
1:04:44 enough experience to be able to preempt
1:04:46 that but you might want to describe if
1:04:48 you think to preempt that
1:04:50 i think what he's going to do is spend
1:04:52 blood for solarity and just usher people
1:04:54 out with celerity
1:04:56 so he will
1:04:57 physically remove you from the room
1:04:59 rather than have a conversation about
1:05:01 let's
1:05:02 not you know get in his way so you see
1:05:05 bretta like habitually
1:05:07 take that unnecessary human breath to
1:05:09 center herself and to start to reach out
1:05:12 to my aisles
1:05:13 and before she can start to verbally
1:05:15 reach out to miles johnny johnny hooks a
1:05:17 hand around her arm and just gets her
1:05:20 out the group of you can hear the sounds
1:05:22 of miles
1:05:23 smashing mirrors
1:05:26 ripping up our paintings
1:05:28 and just completely
1:05:30 savagely trashing the place johnny it
1:05:33 actually sounds like you know pretty
1:05:35 standard bra stress relief
1:05:37 but by the time miles comes out of it
1:05:40 you can
1:05:41 feel the exhaustion
1:05:44 radiating from the other room where
1:05:46 miles is and miles you kind of find
1:05:48 yourself
1:05:49 slumping down and dropping to your knees
1:05:51 completely tired wind makes her way back
1:05:55 inside brita
1:05:57 spotting when holds up a hand doesn't
1:05:59 pause before the noise might occur to
1:06:02 her i'm just gonna check on him all
1:06:04 right he's probably on his knees in the
1:06:06 middle of the wreckage of the room just
1:06:08 kind of staring out the probably
1:06:10 slightly damaged doors to the outside
1:06:13 and
1:06:13 wind
1:06:14 just kind of
1:06:15 approaches and admires the damage for a
1:06:18 few minutes and then just kneels beside
1:06:21 him and just waits for him johnny's
1:06:23 phone ranks you mean johnny's beeper i
1:06:25 thought miles passed everyone phones at
1:06:27 boston he
1:06:28 refused it everybody except johnny yeah
1:06:30 so then uh yeah johnny's beeper goes off
1:06:32 johnny takes a look at it uh in sheriff
1:06:34 office business he excuses himself from
1:06:37 the area and heads up to where the uh
1:06:40 miles office is
1:06:42 johnny do you want to use my phone no
1:06:44 it's all right johnny will uh
1:06:46 grab one of the landlines and call
1:06:48 the uh sheriff's office answering the
1:06:50 other side is jane how's it going jane
1:06:53 hey so there's a little bit of a
1:06:54 situation
1:06:55 um
1:06:57 your
1:06:58 friend neil is being summoned to elysium
1:07:01 by order of the prince he is like a step
1:07:04 away from a blood hunt so all right jane
1:07:07 you want to give me a little bit more
1:07:08 information than that
1:07:10 well
1:07:11 neil
1:07:13 had allegedly met final death when the
1:07:15 sabbath attacked
1:07:17 and now there are rumors going around
1:07:19 that this new meal practices uh some
1:07:22 sort of crazy asamite magic and is
1:07:25 heavily involved in the astomites
1:07:27 and
1:07:28 there has been an accusation made that
1:07:30 neil is not neil and that his sire is
1:07:32 back who is the accusation coming from
1:07:35 the prince the prince made this
1:07:37 accusation well the prince announced the
1:07:39 blood hunt and then i asked him to walk
1:07:41 it back
1:07:42 thank you jane
1:07:43 are they expecting us tonight they are
1:07:46 expecting you guys right now apparently
1:07:48 someone
1:07:49 someone didn't answer rhys so he made
1:07:51 the claim that there might be some sort
1:07:53 of understanding between your quarterly
1:07:56 and neil sire is it just the prince and
1:07:59 rhys coming at us like this well the
1:08:01 whole court's freaking out they don't
1:08:03 want some rampant psycho diablorist
1:08:05 running around the domain there's a crew
1:08:07 headed to neil's haven right now to bust
1:08:09 the place up and take him in all right
1:08:12 understood
1:08:13 so uh inform the court that uh they need
1:08:16 to call those people back and i'm
1:08:17 bringing neil in right now no offense
1:08:20 johnny but i've pretty much extended
1:08:23 myself out to help your friend as much
1:08:25 as i'm willing to do i'm not i am not
1:08:28 stepping into a political fight with
1:08:31 rhys my own prince
1:08:33 all of the toryador all of the nosferatu
1:08:36 i'm not doing that yeah i get it thanks
1:08:38 sorry i i'm sorry you've already done
1:08:41 enough jane thank you johnny hangs up
1:08:42 the phone he comes striding back into
1:08:45 the wreckage we gotta we got a little
1:08:47 situation guys what's wrong
1:08:50 the
1:08:51 prince has nearly declared a blood hunt
1:08:53 on you neil what apparently word's
1:08:55 gotten around of your occult leanings
1:08:58 and rollins is acting real weird which
1:09:01 has me leaning to think that he's being
1:09:04 played by somebody regardless jane
1:09:07 managed to have them call that back a
1:09:09 little bit and
1:09:11 made the call out to me
1:09:13 to bring you in
1:09:14 there is perhaps a crew heading for your
1:09:17 haven right
1:09:18 now so what i think needs to happen
1:09:22 you need to present yourself to the
1:09:23 court immediately you need to go to my
1:09:25 haven i will stop the people going to
1:09:27 your haven johnny i need to go to my
1:09:29 haven all my things are there there's a
1:09:31 boot crew that's ready to take you down
1:09:33 if they see you there that might
1:09:35 escalate into straight up violence
1:09:38 if you go to the court and you let me
1:09:40 handle this and trust me to do that i
1:09:42 will turn them away from your haven
1:09:45 you don't understand all my things are
1:09:46 there oh no oh my johnny reaches out and
1:09:50 grabs you by the shirt pulls you real

1:12:32 anything on his own at this point britta
1:12:34 walks over to kneel there's other blood
1:12:36 tears oh yeah britta grabs whatever
1:12:40 spare bit of fabric and there might be
1:12:42 like
1:12:43 a hand towel from the bathroom comes
1:12:45 over
1:12:46 takes neil by the hand presses the hand
1:12:48 towel into his other hand
