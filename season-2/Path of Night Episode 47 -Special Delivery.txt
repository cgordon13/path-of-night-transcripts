0:00:00 path of night is an actual play vampire
0:00:01 the masquerade podcast set in the
0:00:03 classic world of darkness we're all
0:00:05 friends we're here to have fun but our
0:00:06 story can include graphic violence drug
0:00:08 use sexual content and other mature
0:00:11 themes we've talked at our table about
0:00:12 safety comfort and consent both as
0:00:14 players and storytellers we know what to
0:00:16 expect we're all excited to be here and
0:00:18 we want you to feel the same so listener
0:00:20 discretion is advised
0:00:21 now let's walk the path of night
0:00:26 last time on path of night
0:00:29 neil and johnny talk over mixed feelings
0:00:31 and the uncertain future on their drive
0:00:33 then the quarter prepares to capture the
0:00:36 zantosa
0:00:37 the plan succeeds and johnny and mounts
0:00:40 deliver the staked veto to Reiss
0:00:42 recent miles will reach an uneasy
0:00:44 alliance
0:00:46 afterwards the demon whispers and
0:00:48 demands his ear but miles brings us
0:00:50 questions to johnny instead
0:00:53 the two discuss the cost of pride and
0:00:55 potential methods of praxis
0:00:58 and ultimately they decide upon dishonor
0:01:06 [Music]
0:01:09 we pick up with wind and Britta kind of
0:01:12 relaxing and waiting as
0:01:14 errands are being run by other members
0:01:16 of the quartering in preparation for
0:01:18 what's going to be one of likely many
0:01:20 confrontations with the killing spree
0:01:24 the two of you are kind of you know
0:01:26 milling about actually getting a little
0:01:27 bit of downtime and what's been this
0:01:29 hectic mad dash to a series of end goals
0:01:33 and
0:01:35 there's a knock at the door
0:01:36 big boom boom boom against the glass
0:01:39 Britta looks up she had been sitting by
0:01:42 the bar um reading some music actually
0:01:44 she looks to win wins hackles don't
0:01:47 actually go up but she is immediately
0:01:50 more alert and she
0:01:52 looks to
0:01:53 rita and kind of reaches behind her into
0:01:56 the back of her pants where her belt is
0:01:57 or where her gun is stowed
0:01:59 she looks to Brittain
0:02:01 do you want to get this or do you want
0:02:02 me to i'll get it
0:02:05 um
0:02:06 you want to walk with me oh yeah
0:02:08 all right
0:02:09 and Britta along the way uh slides a
0:02:12 pistol out from under the counter places
0:02:14 it in the waistband of her skirt goes to
0:02:17 answer the door
0:02:18 walking slowly she pops her heightened
0:02:21 hearing just to see if there's any hint
0:02:23 that she can get before she approaches
0:02:25 the glass as you approach the glass you
0:02:27 can kind of
0:02:28 hear someone kind of like scraping their
0:02:31 sneakers
0:02:32 out of the front door like against like
0:02:34 the sidewalk and like twitching
0:02:36 nervously and pacing and ah there's just
0:02:39 this very frenetic energy that's coming
0:02:42 from the other side of the door and then
0:02:44 you get a look through the glass and
0:02:46 illuminated by a street light is
0:02:49 a certain cab driver that you recognize
0:02:52 and and his hand is a box of pizza and
0:02:55 it's kind of like holdings you know some
0:02:57 of the local new haven style and it kind
0:03:00 of knocks at the glass again
0:03:03 slowly takes the hem of her sweater and
0:03:06 just brushes it back to conceal the gun
0:03:09 and also just to put it more out of her
0:03:10 reach and
0:03:12 with a confused expression
0:03:14 she very slowly opens the door
0:03:16 uh hey kind of like
0:03:19 gives this nervous wave i was just
0:03:21 coming through the area with a little
0:03:22 bit of pizza and i kind of wanted to
0:03:24 know if maybe you guys wanted to you
0:03:26 know have a quick uh quick talk about
0:03:28 things i know things are a little hectic
0:03:30 right now
0:03:30 wynn kind of looks at
0:03:32 Britta for anything to dissuade her from
0:03:35 saying yes Britta repeats ramirez's wave
0:03:38 back to him a little awkwardly but she
0:03:41 kind of catches herself and uh steps
0:03:43 back and says um i i yeah actually that
0:03:47 would be
0:03:48 that would be great ramirez
0:03:50 glad to hear it you know last time
0:03:52 last time we met things were a little
0:03:54 stressful before that i think you guys
0:03:55 were getting shot at by somebody but you
0:03:58 know
0:03:58 i think we had built a little bit of
0:04:00 rapport with each other and
0:04:02 i don't know maybe we can talk things
0:04:03 out i brought pizza
0:04:05 i i see that thank you for that oh you
0:04:08 can feel free to come in
0:04:10 i uh
0:04:11 thank you for that and uh he kind of
0:04:13 steps in he you know adjusts his jacket
0:04:15 and is like kind of he's very like
0:04:17 very nervous approaching the group of
0:04:19 you
0:04:20 so
0:04:21 it feels like we have a lot that's going
0:04:23 unsaid
0:04:25 and
0:04:26 i think it might be a good idea if we
0:04:27 just talk a little
0:04:29 maybe maybe we can understand each other
0:04:33 i think that's a good starting place
0:04:35 do you want to sit down and Britta
0:04:37 gestures over to
0:04:39 uh probably the most comfortable uh
0:04:41 seating in her haven might be that same
0:04:43 bar
0:04:44 uh he uh heads over to a countertop and
0:04:48 places the pizza box down
0:04:50 opens it up inside it looks like there's
0:04:54 just a series of rain almost random
0:04:56 toppings
0:04:57 i uh i got us garbage pizza i think we
0:05:00 could talk things over it's my personal
0:05:02 favorite i figured you guys were kind of
0:05:04 like wild maybe in different things and
0:05:07 you know it might be nothing to give it
0:05:08 a go Britta is just kind of looking to
0:05:11 win uh maybe for help
0:05:13 on the subject um is garbage pizza a new
0:05:15 haven thing a garbage pizza is like just
0:05:18 every topping okay
0:05:19 yeah i mean
0:05:21 if you get everything everyone's happy
0:05:22 right yeah yeah this is what i was
0:05:24 hoping for so
0:05:26 uh
0:05:27 i just want to preface this with you
0:05:29 know i you guys never did anything bad
0:05:31 by me
0:05:32 but when we first met i really did kind
0:05:35 of get the impression that you guys are
0:05:37 in the midst of some sort of big uh
0:05:40 conflict you know
0:05:41 that's fair to say which means that
0:05:44 you're not all the same
0:05:46 right people who all think the same they
0:05:49 don't really kind of get into big
0:05:50 blowout conflicts like that
0:05:52 so
0:05:53 what i'm hoping is that
0:05:57 maybe we could
0:05:59 find
0:06:01 some measure of peace
0:06:04 i think that's something we would all
0:06:06 like
0:06:07 what ramirez i'm just i'm not great at
0:06:10 talking so i'm just gonna come out with
0:06:12 things no matter how blunt they sound
0:06:15 maybe we should
0:06:16 start from the beginning
0:06:18 i don't know if we've ever really
0:06:20 kind of said hi and introduce ourselves
0:06:23 right
0:06:23 um
0:06:24 my name is britta
0:06:26 and she holds out her gloved hand
0:06:29 he reaches out and shakes she shakes
0:06:31 back this is my friend wen what's up win
0:06:34 win reaches out her hand reaches out and
0:06:37 kind of shakes her hand her grip is
0:06:39 stronger Britta's hands are unnaturally
0:06:42 cold but and the glove masks that to
0:06:44 some extent if he notices anything like
0:06:46 particularly creepy about your
0:06:48 handshakes he doesn't really
0:06:49 seem to comment on it after the fact
0:06:51 wayne realizes her hood wasn't up and
0:06:54 she kind of
0:06:55 pulls it up um no no sorry i'm not i'm
0:06:59 not here to judge anyone
0:07:00 um so
0:07:02 i know you guys came to the house
0:07:05 i know we must have pissed you guys off
0:07:08 because that other guy like
0:07:10 he
0:07:11 he his approach was pretty different and
0:07:14 uh
0:07:15 now that everything's done and the
0:07:17 fighting's over
0:07:19 maybe we can
0:07:21 try to move past it what do you mean
0:07:24 everything's done
0:07:27 the
0:07:27 the guy that came after you guys did
0:07:30 could you describe him
0:07:32 yeah it was this like uh
0:07:35 he was like this this
0:07:37 big black guy you know
0:07:39 kind of
0:07:40 dressed like a member of boys to men
0:07:43 does this sound like weathers it sounds
0:07:45 exactly like this yeah i know the guy at
0:07:48 the mention of a band name Britta looks
0:07:50 again to win for help it's weather
0:07:53 his approach was different
0:07:55 how do you mean
0:07:56 we we think we know who you're talking
0:07:59 about
0:08:00 and
0:08:01 he's a friend of ours
0:08:02 well there was one uh that you know we
0:08:05 were talking to and questioning like you
0:08:07 i for the record i i did not support
0:08:10 that kind of treatment of anyone thank
0:08:12 you yeah i was
0:08:14 vocal about it but you know i was
0:08:16 upvoted yeah i was going to say it seems
0:08:17 like you were the minority there um
0:08:20 and that's not and and those people
0:08:22 there they're they're good people like
0:08:23 suarez is one of the best men i've uh he
0:08:26 like his eyes go wide when he says as
0:08:29 far as by accident no um we know who he
0:08:31 is to be open with you
0:08:34 you you've come and sat down with us and
0:08:37 a lot of you are people that some of us
0:08:39 have met along the way he looks a little
0:08:41 surprised at that
0:08:43 oh well uh so
0:08:46 this guy uh
0:08:48 weathers
0:08:49 kindly just came crashing through the
0:08:51 front door started tearing the place
0:08:53 apart he could get in
0:08:55 yeah he just went right through the
0:08:57 the
0:08:58 force of will thing
0:09:00 yeah
0:09:01 he
0:09:02 he ripped through the place
0:09:05 grabbed the girl
0:09:06 and left they were very close and
0:09:10 i'm honestly not surprised that he did
0:09:12 that
0:09:13 to be completely
0:09:15 it didn't look like you intended on
0:09:18 like your people intended on letting her
0:09:19 leave alive
0:09:22 so
0:09:23 he cares about her a lot and
0:09:25 yeah that makes sense
0:09:27 oh
0:09:28 is everyone okay
0:09:30 he makes her look mostly
0:09:32 i i just
0:09:34 i just don't want anyone else getting
0:09:36 hurt if we can avoid both sides
0:09:38 you know we didn't want that either we
0:09:41 like like britta said we
0:09:44 most of us have connections to at least
0:09:45 one member of your group
0:09:47 and we didn't want it to come to blows
0:09:49 but
0:09:50 i'm glad she's safe what do you mean
0:09:52 when you said mostly it collects a slice
0:09:54 of pizza and starts like eating it
0:09:57 when i'll spend the blood and eat a
0:09:58 piece of pizza with him that kind of
0:10:00 like falls it's like so crazy and like
0:10:03 slops
0:10:04 britta picks up a piece of pizza looks
0:10:07 at it looks at wynn looks at it looks at
0:10:09 wind and
0:10:11 kind of just puts it back down on the
0:10:12 table wind kind of makes a little
0:10:14 gesture like a like a wave with her hand
0:10:18 trying to get across the point of just
0:10:21 just
0:10:21 let it happen
0:10:23 and with that reminder Britta does
0:10:25 remember the talks after the couch was
0:10:28 ruined and the wine was splattered and
0:10:30 the reminder that she could
0:10:32 use blood and so
0:10:35 she spends one however she still holds
0:10:37 the pizza for several more seconds
0:10:40 before taking a bite it tastes mostly
0:10:42 like salt and grease
0:10:44 but like in a good way she hasn't eaten
0:10:47 sense
0:10:48 her
0:10:49 her embrace so Britta is very slowly
0:10:52 chewing and kind of just
0:10:54 focusing on the sensation uh she doesn't
0:10:56 she's not even quite sure if she
0:10:57 remembers it so this is very distracting
0:10:59 for her it's hard to
0:11:01 there's this undercurrent of ash
0:11:04 like there's just something not totally
0:11:07 satisfying
0:11:08 about it
0:11:09 because in in comparison to blood this
0:11:11 is
0:11:12 nothing even your beast kind of stirs
0:11:15 hungrily at the idea of like
0:11:18 getting a real meal and you find
0:11:19 yourself eyeing
0:11:21 ramirez a little different do my best to
0:11:24 redirect that towards the unsatisfying
0:11:26 pizza
0:11:28 so uh
0:11:29 essentially uh i came here um
0:11:33 hoping that
0:11:34 maybe i can convince you guys to
0:11:38 not go after
0:11:39 our circle
0:11:40 we don't want to go after you all we
0:11:43 want is to be able to conduct ourselves
0:11:45 with without hurting people the only
0:11:48 reason that we were
0:11:50 the girl you had was our friend too
0:11:53 and that put us in a hard position where
0:11:55 we had to determine whether or not
0:11:57 what your friends were doing to her
0:12:01 would kill her
0:12:02 and what we were gonna do about that
0:12:04 because
0:12:05 well yeah we've met some of you we know
0:12:07 some of you and
0:12:09 we know her too
0:12:10 the
0:12:12 the old detective he knew her too from
0:12:14 the seams of it she actually asked us to
0:12:17 make sure that nothing bad happened to
0:12:18 him
0:12:20 well that sucks so we should do that
0:12:22 hindsight you know
0:12:24 yeah we were
0:12:26 told that he was a really
0:12:28 good detective that he was trying to do
0:12:31 good for this city yeah um
0:12:34 he uh
0:12:36 uh
0:12:37 this uh this means a lot
0:12:39 you guys
0:12:40 you know
0:12:41 talking it out uh
0:12:44 so
0:12:46 you said that
0:12:47 that you guys don't really want to hurt
0:12:49 anyone but
0:12:51 there's a lot of people getting hurt and
0:12:53 it's
0:12:54 i don't want to use weird words but i
0:12:57 just go for it it's the the vampire is
0:13:00 doing it well
0:13:03 like
0:13:06 is that okay i prefer that to monsters
0:13:09 okay vampire's okay
0:13:11 um
0:13:12 different kinds of vampires use
0:13:15 different words for themselves
0:13:17 um
0:13:18 people getting hurt maybe that's
0:13:21 the sabbat doing that
0:13:23 there is more than one political group
0:13:26 of us so what is this is like politics
0:13:28 doing this
0:13:30 it's politics in the way of
0:13:32 a coup in a in a country i had a friend
0:13:35 go to dunkin donuts that's how i wanted
0:13:37 something i shat myself thought he was
0:13:39 gonna [ __ ] die or something
0:13:41 um when was that this was just a week or
0:13:44 so ago
0:13:45 it's it's these public places that are
0:13:47 getting
0:13:48 Britta dips her head knowingly so that's
0:13:51 that's not our group
0:13:53 our group is very much about keeping
0:13:55 under the radar there is another group
0:13:57 who thinks that we should live loud to
0:13:59 put it mildly and right now they've
0:14:02 they've come to new haven to try and
0:14:04 live loud here and we're doing what we
0:14:06 can to try and keep it under wraps i'm
0:14:08 gonna ask guy a question i hope you guys
0:14:10 don't mind but
0:14:12 you you know a guy named joey little boy
0:14:15 yeah
0:14:16 yeah i'm taking care of him
0:14:18 we've been trying to help joey's mom
0:14:20 get payback
0:14:22 for what happened to that little boy and
0:14:24 we don't want
0:14:25 any trouble
0:14:27 we don't want to bite off more than we
0:14:28 can chew but
0:14:30 the thing that did it the the the house
0:14:34 you guys can't go there
0:14:36 don't go there you do not we have to go
0:14:39 there it's very it's some kind of a
0:14:41 vampire thing right it's what can you
0:14:44 tell me about it we're look we're going
0:14:47 but
0:14:48 maybe
0:14:49 maybe you guys know something that can
0:14:51 help
0:14:52 me make sure my friends make it out
0:14:54 alive so
0:14:55 you're putting the cart before the horse
0:14:57 here because short answer
0:14:59 is the the one pulling the strings the
0:15:01 house yes
0:15:03 is the thing that killed joey still
0:15:06 alive no i killed it but we can't let
0:15:09 other people we can't allow other joeys
0:15:12 so we gotta go and we gotta put this
0:15:14 thing down and i get that and i respect
0:15:17 the choice that my circle made and i'm
0:15:19 gonna be honest i couldn't change their
0:15:21 mind about any of the other [ __ ] but
0:15:24 maybe maybe you've got some information
0:15:27 i can use to save them i know this is
0:15:29 dangerous it's it's not dangerous it's
0:15:32 suicide
0:15:34 you will not come out of there
0:15:37 and when i say you will not come out of
0:15:38 there you might walk out of there but it
0:15:40 won't be you anymore
0:15:42 there is
0:15:43 i understand wanting vengeance for a
0:15:45 lost child probably better than a lot of
0:15:47 people
0:15:49 but if you go in there it's
0:15:51 justice has been done and it wasn't at
0:15:53 her hands and i wish i could help her
0:15:56 find that
0:15:57 but
0:15:58 this is just throwing yourself headlong
0:16:00 into the abyss
0:16:02 maybe that's what we're meant to do
0:16:04 what are you
0:16:06 what are you guys people i know but
0:16:10 your people can't block entry with their
0:16:13 force of will now who's tried
0:16:16 you don't seem
0:16:18 like
0:16:20 mortals
0:16:21 well i am
0:16:24 i i'm definitely mortal um but uh
0:16:29 you kind of dodged the question before
0:16:31 who's not okay in your group after what
0:16:33 happened
0:16:34 suarez got pretty hurt
0:16:36 and he
0:16:38 was not interested and
0:16:40 uh it's complicated
0:16:42 he didn't want to negotiate
0:16:45 he didn't want
0:16:46 this guy taking off with her
0:16:49 and he got a little close and this guy
0:16:51 was
0:16:53 way more serious than anything we'd ever
0:16:55 seen
0:16:57 on a whole nother level this guy was so
0:17:00 terrifying
0:17:02 i
0:17:04 we have a trick or two sometimes they
0:17:06 work sometimes they don't
0:17:08 but we've never ever ever seen anything
0:17:11 on the scale of that that weathers guy
0:17:14 if you think you couldn't handle him
0:17:17 you should be nowhere near that house we
0:17:20 have
0:17:21 abilities they're
0:17:23 different for each one of us
0:17:25 that house
0:17:27 is full of and infected with an ability
0:17:31 that could put
0:17:32 everyone in danger revenge is not worth
0:17:35 spreading that contagion it's
0:17:38 fire anything it will spread
0:17:40 fire won't kill it you don't understand
0:17:45 a member of our group
0:17:46 ah she gets these like
0:17:49 visions
0:17:50 and
0:17:51 she's shown
0:17:53 potential outcomes
0:17:55 things that can be bad things that can
0:17:57 be good
0:17:59 in this case i uh
0:18:04 in this case something real real bad
0:18:06 happened
0:18:07 and it happened because
0:18:09 we didn't do anything about it so we're
0:18:12 we're going
0:18:14 we're fighting this fight
0:18:17 the the disease fire doesn't work okay
0:18:20 these are good things these are things
0:18:21 we need to know
0:18:23 and he likes scarf sounds like pizza
0:18:25 like like nervous eating we're not we're
0:18:28 not going to jump you or anything i know
0:18:29 you don't need to i
0:18:31 trust you
0:18:32 don't choke you like he like tries to
0:18:35 laugh and like actually kind of chokes a
0:18:36 little bit
0:18:37 like coughs and ends up okay
0:18:39 um
0:18:40 yeah now i just
0:18:42 so the house won't burn
0:18:44 the house itself will what's in there
0:18:46 won't if you burn it it might spread the
0:18:48 contagion where is it in the house
0:18:50 everywhere
0:18:51 like looks at both of you people say
0:18:54 that at the same time we venture we
0:18:56 emphasize in unison
0:18:59 okay
0:19:01 will you let us go with you i don't
0:19:03 think that's a good idea
0:19:05 i don't think you going at all is a good
0:19:06 idea and i don't think you could stop us
0:19:08 if we showed up
0:19:09 no but we could reschedule
0:19:12 i think right now the best we can ask
0:19:14 for or the best what i'm asking for
0:19:17 is that
0:19:18 we don't collide
0:19:22 i'll ask i'll try to keep my circle away
0:19:24 from
0:19:25 harassing you and yours
0:19:27 and if you can keep that weather sky
0:19:29 from
0:19:30 coming back
0:19:32 he has no interest in the house
0:19:34 and honestly he
0:19:36 he's unlikely to come back at you
0:19:39 okay
0:19:40 ramirez
0:19:42 does she want to talk to joey
0:19:46 she
0:19:49 she has a lot of anger and hurt
0:19:53 and
0:19:55 i think
0:19:58 he is still in danger
0:20:02 from white
0:20:04 there's more to all of this than
0:20:07 us and you and that house
0:20:10 i understand that this
0:20:12 this can be really
0:20:14 overwhelming i
0:20:16 i'm really new to this too but
0:20:18 there's things that happen and win is an
0:20:22 expert when it comes to
0:20:24 well
0:20:26 ghosts
0:20:27 sometimes
0:20:28 ghosts don't move on if they're anchored
0:20:31 here yeah i have a few friends okay
0:20:35 the it's called the shadow lambs
0:20:38 who are your friends we might know
0:20:39 friends
0:20:40 i don't know if i should share
0:20:42 um one of them's not mr perfect does it
0:20:44 no stay the [ __ ] away from him okay okay
0:20:48 um
0:20:51 the
0:20:52 the shadow lands are in danger of being
0:20:54 swept away
0:20:55 and with them all ghosts being swept to
0:20:57 oblivion the storm yeah yeah
0:21:00 so okay
0:21:01 so the storm's been going pretty bad and
0:21:03 uh
0:21:04 are you a medium oh you could say that
0:21:06 um
0:21:07 so
0:21:08 britta is looking to ramirez and can
0:21:10 have you ever seen a rod yes i fought a
0:21:12 few yeah they're everywhere
0:21:15 like i only found them in the holy land
0:21:17 are they cropping up elsewhere now like
0:21:19 all of globally that storm
0:21:22 that storm is it's kicking people across
0:21:24 the uh
0:21:27 you know
0:21:29 she if she wants to help her son and not
0:21:32 just avenge the fact that he is not here
0:21:34 she needs to redirect her energy away
0:21:36 from the house and figure out how to
0:21:38 help him well she's got his revenge you
0:21:40 don't understand it's like a it's like
0:21:42 hard programmed in there
0:21:44 um
0:21:45 but i'm gonna try
0:21:47 i'll i'll talk to her see what i can do
0:21:49 maybe
0:21:50 i'm keeping him as safe as i can and i'm
0:21:52 trying to figure out how to get protect
0:21:54 him from what's coming i'm trying to
0:21:56 protect them all but
0:21:58 all right this is big and if we can come
0:22:00 at this from more than my paradigm
0:22:03 then this could this could change the
0:22:05 world this could prevent joey's
0:22:08 okay that's
0:22:11 it's
0:22:12 he kind of like
0:22:14 slumps not out of like shame or fear but
0:22:17 at the sheer weight of
0:22:19 the possibility we don't have to
0:22:23 work the world we could save the world
0:22:27 okay
0:22:28 i'm gonna go but before i do there's a
0:22:30 few things
0:22:33 yours first
0:22:34 i was just gonna say if there was
0:22:36 anything else that you wanted to mention
0:22:38 um of like looks like totally like lost
0:22:41 in like your toreador eyes
0:22:45 thing number one
0:22:47 if we can't stop you from going to that
0:22:49 house then we might as well tell you
0:22:51 what we can don't let anything in there
0:22:53 touch you if you can stop it
0:22:56 biohazard suits if you can clean off
0:22:59 be ready to fight there's
0:23:01 warped creatures things that won't move
0:23:04 as people do
0:23:05 and
0:23:06 these creatures will be strange they
0:23:08 will be powerful and they will be
0:23:10 unpredictable and they may be able to
0:23:12 change
0:23:13 you
0:23:15 bring medical supplies
0:23:17 okay yeah we can we can plan around that
0:23:19 thank you
0:23:20 and um the second thing
0:23:23 i guess it's a
0:23:24 bit more selfish um
0:23:28 if she's in the
0:23:29 headspace to hear it
0:23:32 could you please tell
0:23:34 johnny's daughter that he loves her
0:23:37 who's johnny
0:23:38 one of the guys who was there that night
0:23:40 leather jacket smoking uh yeah yeah he
0:23:42 was a cool guy
0:23:43 uh
0:23:45 uh oh
0:23:48 [ __ ] he tried to keep this life from her
0:23:50 and it found her anyway he was um
0:23:53 he tried really hard to
0:23:55 keep her safe and that's
0:23:57 kept good in him and i just i think that
0:24:01 he would really want her to know that he
0:24:03 does the one with the visions
0:24:06 she's the one that is telling us we
0:24:08 gotta go
0:24:09 all right i believe her honestly i'm of
0:24:11 two minds about you guys going to that
0:24:13 house because
0:24:14 nothing we could do could stop it
0:24:17 but maybe
0:24:18 maybe what you guys can do can that's
0:24:20 what i'm hoping don't mind especially if
0:24:22 i can't talk your full heads out of
0:24:24 going
0:24:28 yeah i know
0:24:30 brave and dumb
0:24:31 you'd do well with us ramirez
0:24:34 what's joey's mom's name
0:24:37 i just don't want to refer to her as
0:24:38 joey's mom it doesn't have to be her
0:24:39 real name crystal
0:24:41 tell crystal i've gotten revenge before
0:24:43 and it doesn't help
0:24:45 i'll let her know
0:24:46 i don't think she'll hear it but
0:24:49 and tell her that i'm taking care of him
0:24:52 he's safe for now i think she'll be glad
0:24:54 to know that and the end
0:24:56 [Music]
0:24:57 wasn't the end
0:24:59 he also
0:25:00 for what it's worth he wasn't alone
0:25:03 okay
0:25:05 he's not alone now
0:25:07 he kind of looks down and collects his
0:25:08 thoughts takes a few deep breaths is
0:25:11 the initial nervousness that he had when
0:25:14 he came here starts to
0:25:16 fade a little
0:25:17 ramirez if you're gonna be tangling with
0:25:19 this world
0:25:20 keep it as separate from
0:25:22 your other life as possible i'll do my
0:25:25 best
0:25:26 he uh
0:25:27 takes out what is kind of like just a
0:25:30 cut out piece of cardboard but he wrote
0:25:32 on it like as though it's like a like a
0:25:34 business card type deal
0:25:35 uh has his name and beeper number
0:25:38 uh i'm just gonna leave this with you
0:25:40 guys just in case no pressure got it
0:25:44 ramirez yeah she'll
0:25:46 tear the piece of cardboard in half and
0:25:48 jot down her own number
0:25:50 if you get in trouble in that house
0:25:52 please call
0:25:53 okay
0:25:55 all right
0:25:57 i uh um
0:25:58 all right close his throat
0:26:00 uh have a good night guys
0:26:02 hey uh
0:26:04 it was actually really nice talking to
0:26:05 you feel free to drop by again good
0:26:07 night ramirez he gives like a little
0:26:09 wave and steps out as the door closes
0:26:12 wind kind of turns to Britta
0:26:16 whoa
0:26:17 i um
0:26:20 what do we do with this i don't know
0:26:22 if we can tell johnny i guess we have to
0:26:26 i i we have to we have to tell them um
0:26:29 we have to tell them that jane is safe
0:26:31 and we have to tell them that
0:26:33 we had this conversation and we have to
0:26:36 stay firm on they're gonna do what
0:26:38 they're gonna do about that awful awful
0:26:40 house and
0:26:41 we probably can't stop them
0:26:43 well we definitely can't stop them and
0:26:45 if we did i think it would complicate us
0:26:47 to soft a word
0:26:49 for what i think it would do if we got
0:26:50 directly involved
0:26:52 all right but i will send messengers to
0:26:54 watch the house all right they'll let me
0:26:57 know when they go
0:26:58 i hope i hope we're wrong britta i hope
0:27:01 they can do something we can't maybe
0:27:03 they can but
0:27:05 you know what when
0:27:06 what we can do
0:27:08 is help you to look into what's
0:27:10 happening worldwide
0:27:12 we got that side of it we have
0:27:14 you for it
0:27:16 is joey around anywhere ah nothing can
0:27:18 see okay she kind of just her eyes dart
0:27:20 around like she's looking for someone
0:27:22 but doesn't find them
0:27:24 is anyone
0:27:26 here no oh
0:27:28 no i just i like to keep my eyes peeled
0:27:30 for him he likes to hide sometimes um
0:27:32 joey yeah no sorry dude
0:27:37 i don't
0:27:39 rita i'm of two minds and so i'm gonna
0:27:41 float them just i'm gonna speak from the
0:27:43 heart here
0:27:45 i don't know if we should tell johnny
0:27:46 that we talked to him or that we asked
0:27:49 him to let jessica know anything
0:27:52 i'm not sure we should tell them that
0:27:54 he's made such direct contact because i
0:27:57 don't know what their reaction is gonna
0:27:59 do if
0:28:00 he comes back it's possible it'll do
0:28:02 nothing and i don't i don't want to keep
0:28:04 secrets from the coterie but
0:28:06 i don't think it's fair for johnny to be
0:28:08 lied to again
0:28:10 there's
0:28:11 a lot of validity to that
0:28:14 this is his daughter this is his
0:28:16 business and i just
0:28:19 with getting his daughter away from
0:28:22 everything away from shaw and
0:28:24 now he has
0:28:26 the smallest window in
0:28:29 one that
0:28:30 and if she doesn't do anything with it
0:28:32 what's that gonna do to him i think
0:28:34 it'll hurt
0:28:35 i think it'll hurt a lot but i also
0:28:38 i think he's hurting regardless when
0:28:42 how much more can one person take though
0:28:44 i don't disagree with you but
0:28:47 if we don't tell him
0:28:49 that we know
0:28:50 jane is safe
0:28:52 and with withers
0:28:54 i can i can easily say that my retainers
0:28:57 saw weathers go in bust it down and take
0:28:59 her
0:29:00 we don't need to reveal that we've had
0:29:02 contact with one of these folks
0:29:04 again i'm not against it but i'm
0:29:08 i'm trying to not just act on impulse
0:29:10 here
0:29:11 lex did ramirez leave the remainder of
0:29:13 the garbage pizza
0:29:15 Britta
0:29:16 looks down to it and kind of like uses
0:29:19 her nail to pick at the side of it
0:29:21 our entire coterie is keeping track of
0:29:23 that house
0:29:24 and the link that it has to
0:29:27 that sleeping thing
0:29:30 not giving information over that we know
0:29:32 that something might change with it
0:29:34 that might get in our way later
0:29:37 okay i i'm sorry i
0:29:40 you're right when you're right to not
0:29:42 want to think on impulse with this but i
0:29:45 just
0:29:46 maybe my heart is being too loud i just
0:29:49 i don't think that's a bad thing britta
0:29:51 i'm asking you because i think i'm too
0:29:54 quiet
0:29:54 in that regard
0:29:56 i'd like to tell them and i think they
0:29:59 can handle it i do full disclosure
0:30:03 yeah okay
0:30:05 are you okay with that
0:30:09 short answer yes
0:30:10 long answer
0:30:12 yes but i feel like they're going to
0:30:14 want to try and get in there and stop
0:30:15 them
0:30:16 and i think that's going to lead to
0:30:17 problems
0:30:18 do you think maybe
0:30:20 we give them the full answer
0:30:24 after they've been in the house
0:30:26 wind kind of circles her neck and cracks
0:30:28 it a couple times
0:30:31 maybe we sit on this for a little while
0:30:34 but it's also possible we could get a
0:30:36 panicked call from ramirez and i would
0:30:38 need to go
0:30:39 all right
0:30:40 how about this
0:30:42 we're about to handle
0:30:44 the killing spree right yep let's do
0:30:47 that first
0:30:48 okay
0:30:49 let's tell johnny
0:30:51 that we know that we know that jane is
0:30:53 safe that we know that she's with
0:30:54 weathers
0:30:56 and that we'll update him on the rest
0:30:58 after
0:30:59 i don't see how he's not gonna demand
0:31:01 the full story now and i don't see how
0:31:03 he's going to get it out of us fair
0:31:05 point
0:31:06 give him that respect of telling him we
0:31:09 know this
0:31:10 and we'll tell it to you
0:31:11 but we've got something to focus on now
0:31:14 something bigger
0:31:15 at least when it comes to being able to
0:31:18 do anything about it
0:31:19 i don't think this is a bad turn of
0:31:21 events it's just adding to our cascade
0:31:23 of weird
0:31:25 when i am
0:31:27 i can't remember
0:31:28 anything other than
0:31:30 weird maybe someday you will if that's
0:31:33 what you want
0:31:34 um
0:31:36 when
0:31:37 yeah
0:31:38 that thing that um
0:31:41 happened with romeo
0:31:44 when i
0:31:45 i am
0:31:47 i can't remember
0:31:48 really knowing him
0:31:50 i don't know
0:31:52 i don't know what he said on your end i
0:31:54 just started wondering what i couldn't
0:31:56 remember
0:31:57 i am
0:31:58 if i was really close with him or if i
0:32:02 was friends or if i
0:32:05 was
0:32:06 i don't even know if i was in love with
0:32:09 someone or
0:32:10 him or
0:32:12 any of it do you want to find out
0:32:15 i am
0:32:17 i don't
0:32:18 every time i find something out i don't
0:32:21 it doesn't make me feel
0:32:23 i i keep wanting to
0:32:25 and i don't know if that will ever stop
0:32:27 wanting to know more about it but
0:32:29 i don't see it helping us
0:32:32 and that's what i have now
0:32:34 i didn't ask what you thought the
0:32:35 coterie needed i asked what you wanted
0:32:38 this is not a practicality question this
0:32:41 is what does britto want
0:32:44 i'm not sure
0:32:45 to
0:32:46 mind if i think about it until we
0:32:49 talk next
0:32:51 Britta we're made of time
0:32:53 we've got all the time in the
0:32:54 world i
0:32:57 hope that's true
0:33:00 [Music]
0:33:05 miles johnny the two of you we had to
0:33:07 throw out for the meeting before the
0:33:09 attempt on cynthia it's very quiet
0:33:11 tonight allowing the two of you the
0:33:13 space you're going to need to conduct
0:33:16 your dirt
0:33:17 one at a time you can kind of see the
0:33:19 other members of your quarter is
0:33:20 starting to arrive but it's going to
0:33:22 take a moment from the kind of weave
0:33:24 through people and eventually get to you
0:33:26 johnny's halfway through a pack of
0:33:27 morleys a uh ashtrays sitting in the
0:33:30 middle just filled with butts laid out
0:33:32 between the two of them is a
0:33:34 map of the greater new haven area they
0:33:38 are leafing through some notebooks and
0:33:41 journals that look to be from the
0:33:44 sheriff's office
0:33:45 and they're using markers and pens to
0:33:49 mark out locations where the killing
0:33:52 spree has struck and caused masquerade
0:33:55 breaches welcome
0:33:57 looks like we're about to put this part
0:33:58 of our plan into action
0:34:00 we now need to locate cynthia the abbot
0:34:04 according to johnny here the sabbat
0:34:06 generally do not perform their attacks
0:34:09 around the area they
0:34:10 sleep i said they don't eat where they
0:34:12 [ __ ] but you know uh then you probably
0:34:14 said it better
0:34:15 so we've laid out all the attacks that
0:34:17 the sheriff's office has on record and
0:34:20 we're hoping to
0:34:22 put all of our skills together here to
0:34:24 help locate uh possible bed down places
0:34:27 for the sabbat
0:34:29 and
0:34:30 use that to scope out their new wherever
0:34:32 they're hiding out check out that
0:34:33 location
0:34:35 and then prepare for
0:34:36 our raid
0:34:37 so i hope you came on with your thinking
0:34:40 hats
0:34:41 i mean i don't travel without mine you
0:34:43 know me right
0:34:44 100 all the time oh and before i forget
0:34:47 johnny uh opens up his jacket and
0:34:49 reaches in and pulls out a small
0:34:51 drawing stained with
0:34:54 deep
0:34:56 brownish blackish uh stains all over the
0:34:59 paper puts it down the table and slides
0:35:00 it over towards wynn and britta uh two
0:35:04 you might want to hold on to that i had
0:35:05 to dig it out of neil's guts here and
0:35:08 i'd uh appreciate not having to go
0:35:10 through that again can do wind kind of
0:35:13 doesn't really whinge at the idea but
0:35:15 definitely her eyebrows do something
0:35:17 what is what does this do
0:35:19 well
0:35:20 according to neil it aids in the search
0:35:24 i'm not sure how you want to explain
0:35:26 that the um
0:35:28 spirit of arum aremon uh
0:35:30 directed a uh wielder's great lance uh
0:35:34 against his foes um
0:35:36 whoever's in possession of that until
0:35:38 the next inauspicious night
0:35:40 their lance will be directed uh towards
0:35:43 the pursuit of their foes as much as i'd
0:35:45 love to carry that lance i think that
0:35:48 experience has proven that i'm not the
0:35:50 best scout
0:35:52 because i lose perspective when
0:35:54 interacting with the killing spree
0:35:57 i think either when you being that you
0:36:00 can easily blend in to an area as an owl
0:36:03 or
0:36:04 rid of you because you uh
0:36:06 seem to have some
0:36:08 interesting learned abilities with
0:36:11 stealth
0:36:12 might be the better scouts for the
0:36:13 situation i don't see or hear as well as
0:36:17 Britta so my vote would be for her i
0:36:19 would need someone
0:36:21 with me just in case there's anything in
0:36:23 my um
0:36:25 she kind of like goes to touch the side
0:36:26 of her forehead but nervously brushes
0:36:28 her hand through her hair and said i can
0:36:30 go with you i think neil should also be
0:36:32 on this team if we can um and neil looks
0:36:35 down at the map with all the like
0:36:36 markings on it if we can help to narrow
0:36:39 down an area a particular neighborhood
0:36:42 i have
0:36:43 thanks to johnny and that
0:36:46 drawing and her name
0:36:48 enough to be able to track where she
0:36:50 moves where she's been and where she's
0:36:52 going well based on where these attacks
0:36:54 are going
0:36:55 i could try to work out a pattern but he
0:36:58 look he glances over at neil i think
0:37:01 there's someone else here who might be
0:37:02 better at extrapolating patterns is this
0:37:04 as much information as we can get well
0:37:07 let me uh let me go through the rest of
0:37:08 the attacks that we're aware of and get
0:37:10 it to get the mark the map fully marked
0:37:12 up and then i'll let you take a look
0:37:13 yeah i pass out photos everybody take a
0:37:15 look make the last markings and confirm
0:37:17 our information and then
0:37:19 wind kind of discreetly holds up the
0:37:21 picture between her middle finger and
0:37:23 her pointer finger so this is her yeah
0:37:26 it's a pretty good drawing of cynthia
0:37:28 okay best as we can get
0:37:30 so all right she passes it to Britta
0:37:32 britta looks it over how good a drawing
0:37:34 lex not that good
0:37:36 well
0:37:38 it doesn't give you pause
0:37:40 understandable
0:37:41 not even a little
0:37:44 britta does look over the drawing
0:37:45 memorizing the details but she
0:37:48 readily accepts the folder from miles as
0:37:50 he hands it out and seems undisturbed so
0:37:53 just so you're aware
0:37:55 cynthia is the abbot as they call it for
0:37:58 the killing spree this is the
0:38:00 canine who is responsible for making
0:38:03 sure
0:38:04 the day-to-day needs of the pack are
0:38:06 taken care of even though they're
0:38:08 seemingly monsters they still have to
0:38:10 eat they still have to sleep so she
0:38:12 finds them cots and happy meals exactly
0:38:15 which is why they tend not to
0:38:17 cause too much trouble in whatever
0:38:19 storage unit or abandoned house they
0:38:21 find somewhere low key and off the radar
0:38:24 the only problem is they definitely make
0:38:27 sure that hiding is not the only
0:38:29 protection they will often have all
0:38:32 kinds of horrible creations
0:38:34 waiting to protect the abbot when the
0:38:37 rest of the pack is off conducting
0:38:39 whatever business the killing spree gets
0:38:41 up to such as
0:38:46 the zamitsy make
0:38:49 weird things
0:38:50 kind of like how vito made in his hell
0:38:53 house ah but not
0:38:56 a different flavor those ones were
0:38:57 natural offshoots defeated and make does
0:39:00 if i remember right correct they were
0:39:02 they seemed to be
0:39:04 the trimmings of a garden rather than
0:39:07 constructs the things i remember the
0:39:09 killing spree having are called
0:39:11 schlockta as i understand they're a
0:39:14 weird form of ghoul
0:39:16 and rather than keeping somebody around
0:39:19 for their personable social qualities
0:39:21 they do all kinds of horrible things to
0:39:23 their body and graft on muscle and bone
0:39:26 until you have basically an
0:39:29 an ogre
0:39:30 that can defend their abbot and their
0:39:32 haven
0:39:34 underneath that
0:39:35 they probably have a whole menagerie of
0:39:37 other things that are not quite as
0:39:39 dangerous as schlockta but you can kind
0:39:41 of imagine what what we're talking about
0:39:43 so right now we're just we're just
0:39:45 looking at at where to hit we're not
0:39:47 hitting the other thing to keep in mind
0:39:49 is that generally speaking
0:39:52 marnie
0:39:53 who is the zamizi of the pack
0:39:55 might also be
0:39:57 there in the haven with the abbott
0:40:00 marty's the one responsible for creating
0:40:02 these monsters that protect them
0:40:05 if we can get both of them that's great
0:40:08 but it also means it's double the
0:40:09 trouble if we find them both at the
0:40:12 haven other than flesh crafting what do
0:40:14 zumitsi do
0:40:15 like are they
0:40:16 combat problems or are they just kind of
0:40:19 scientists
0:40:21 i
0:40:22 really don't know what marty's capable
0:40:24 of
0:40:25 but
0:40:26 even though the bloodline differs wildly
0:40:29 from the zantosa
0:40:30 not wildly enough that i i wouldn't say
0:40:33 it's gonna be unlike fighting veto fair
0:40:36 gotcha but yes the plan is to just scout
0:40:39 right now and hit them
0:40:41 in a couple days once we're ready
0:40:44 grab supplies based on what johnny knows
0:40:47 about them and what we can find out
0:40:48 about the location so that means if
0:40:50 we're scouting if we get caught they're
0:40:52 just going to move locations
0:40:54 right let's keep from not getting caught
0:40:57 but i think knowing about their hideout
0:40:59 is more important than
0:41:01 i think the abbott will also try to move
0:41:03 their their uh their haven as often as
0:41:06 they can to try and make sure that
0:41:07 something like this doesn't happen so if
0:41:09 we do find their spot it's not gonna be
0:41:12 a couple of days we're gonna move as
0:41:13 fast as we can okay
0:41:15 that makes some sense to me um so i
0:41:18 guess everybody should get geared up to
0:41:20 go just in case yeah we should all
0:41:22 prepare we should all hunt miles gave me
0:41:24 a list of things that we're gonna
0:41:26 probably need if we find out any other
0:41:28 information we can probably scrounge it
0:41:30 up pretty quickly but okay let's find
0:41:33 this place first sure
0:41:35 once uh once we find it
0:41:37 the next step will be trying to case it
0:41:39 as best we can okay all right
0:41:42 all right
0:41:44 is this
0:41:45 is this enough for a starting place and
0:41:47 she looks to kneel while tracing the
0:41:49 edge of the map um
0:41:51 i'm not sure
0:41:54 and neil sort of gets lost looking at
0:41:56 the map and all the places they've sort
0:41:57 of xed out where the patterns of like
0:42:00 the attack patterns have happened
0:42:02 to try and see where are the attacks not
0:42:05 happening
0:42:06 within an easy night's like these people
0:42:09 aren't grabbing cabs you know so within
0:42:12 travel just to try and pinpoint at least
0:42:14 a block a neighborhood as best as he can
0:42:16 about where they might be give me an
0:42:19 eyes of gas
0:42:22 seven successes the seven successes you
0:42:24 actually kind of get an impression that
0:42:25 they're
0:42:26 keeping actually towards an area with
0:42:29 money that this pack
0:42:32 is deceptive and experienced enough that
0:42:35 all of the usual places one might go
0:42:37 searching for the sabbath are unlikely
0:42:39 to find them
0:42:41 you start thinking that
0:42:43 because all of the instances of them
0:42:45 hitting like dunkin donuts is and things
0:42:47 like that
0:42:48 they're not hunting how they're getting
0:42:50 their food
0:42:52 is pretty well concealed
0:42:54 which means they must be tapping some
0:42:57 sort of a large pool of people and
0:43:00 that's when you start to kind of realize
0:43:02 that
0:43:03 yale
0:43:04 is
0:43:05 kind of at the heart of what's going on
0:43:08 and now i want the streetwise check
0:43:10 isn't that where the tremere chantry is
0:43:16 i rolled three ones no successes on
0:43:18 streetwise
0:43:20 to be clear i didn't botch okay so i had
0:43:22 no success you're having a hard time
0:43:24 piecing it together
0:43:25 okay um
0:43:27 neil sort of zones out and stares at the
0:43:30 uh stairs at the map for a while okay
0:43:33 johnny this pack is really smart
0:43:36 they're um
0:43:39 they're hiding out somewhere in the
0:43:40 college
0:43:41 at yale
0:43:43 but it takes up so much of the city
0:43:45 and
0:43:46 there's such an easy pool to prey on
0:43:48 there
0:43:49 they're going outside to hit these
0:43:51 little things just to screw with the
0:43:52 masquerade to cause a cave to cause
0:43:54 chaos to cause a panic but
0:43:56 i just don't
0:43:58 i've spent so much time avoiding yale
0:44:01 because that's where the premiere are
0:44:03 that i don't know it as well as someone
0:44:06 maybe who lives in new haven should i i
0:44:08 have no
0:44:09 idea where in yale and it's so big i
0:44:12 don't know if anybody else well i don't
0:44:14 know
0:44:15 yale specifically but universities
0:44:18 general no that seems familiar johnny
0:44:21 will snatch up the map and take a look a
0:44:23 closer look at the yale area he's kind
0:44:25 of blinking with the fact that he's like
0:44:27 yeah i guess i never actually
0:44:30 he johnny had always been fooled by the
0:44:32 idea that they would they would have in
0:44:33 somewhere in like the rack or somewhere
0:44:36 that's a little bit seedier the fact
0:44:38 that they're maybe hiding in the open in
0:44:40 the yale area kind of gives them a new
0:44:42 take on the whole situation
0:44:44 um and he'll see if he can spot or see
0:44:48 see if he if looking at the map help
0:44:50 helps
0:44:51 kick start his brain into into uh
0:44:54 thinking of possible locations that a
0:44:57 sabbat pack could get their hands on
0:44:59 considering that they might have limited
0:45:01 influence within the city can i make a
0:45:03 street wise check yes can i claim any
0:45:06 bonuses from either sabbat survivor or
0:45:09 from open road i will give you plus two
0:45:11 deaths from sabah survivor okay and this
0:45:13 is wits plus streetwise yes sir
0:45:18 i have four successes nice excellent so
0:45:21 with four successes you kind of get
0:45:22 thinking and you realize that just off
0:45:25 of
0:45:26 yale campus
0:45:27 there's been a ton of property that's
0:45:29 been purchased by the university and for
0:45:32 the past like eight months it's been
0:45:35 undergoing renovations they've basically
0:45:39 got whole sets of like apartment
0:45:41 complexes and
0:45:43 old like
0:45:44 houses
0:45:45 that are completely empty say for the
0:45:49 daytime construction workers that are
0:45:51 there and you know they've only really
0:45:53 kind of started doing the heavy work
0:45:56 there because it you know we're now
0:45:58 finally getting into like the out of the
0:46:00 colder days neil you are a genius i
0:46:03 wasn't even thinking about yale but no
0:46:05 no if you look here on the uh
0:46:08 on like the western side of uh of yale
0:46:11 like you get out towards like past house
0:46:13 street all of these old like buildings
0:46:16 are like from like the turn of the
0:46:18 century they're like old hotels and
0:46:19 stuff like that
0:46:20 a lot of these places have been bought
0:46:22 up by the college they're sitting vacant
0:46:24 i mean you've got some construction
0:46:25 workers coming in and out but i mean if
0:46:27 anything that gives them a better a
0:46:29 better cover because there there's
0:46:31 constantly all kinds of of different
0:46:33 strange people moving around in these
0:46:35 places and there's most of them are
0:46:37 sitting vacant but it's
0:46:39 literally right next to the downtown
0:46:41 there's tons of foot traffic walking by
0:46:43 lex may i use knowledge academics to get
0:46:48 a better context on the way that i'm
0:46:51 thinking about that is whether there
0:46:53 might be like known or prestigious
0:46:55 houses that maybe this pack might be
0:46:58 more attracted to you need to know a
0:47:00 little more about the pack itself in
0:47:02 terms of like societies and things like
0:47:05 that and yale is crawling with them
0:47:08 dozens and dozens okay so because the
0:47:11 the nuances are so significant yeah you
0:47:14 would need to know more uh there's a
0:47:15 good chance that maybe cynthia has these
0:47:18 sorts of connections that she's making
0:47:19 use of here because you know in the past
0:47:22 it was kind of discussed that cynthia
0:47:24 has like a lot of connections influence
0:47:27 money things that most sabbat don't have
0:47:29 we know that this abbott has
0:47:32 more mortal reach i can
0:47:35 find something out about the university
0:47:37 i think maybe if i get a bit more
0:47:39 information about
0:47:42 um
0:47:43 i would need to know more about what
0:47:44 this pack might value if we can narrow
0:47:46 down the neighborhood stuff like if they
0:47:49 might really want to target a particular
0:47:51 fraternity or society or a historic
0:47:53 building do we know um
0:47:56 which
0:47:57 which societies and historical buildings
0:48:00 are of most interest to the tremere in
0:48:01 the area because that's right on the
0:48:02 border of their territory
0:48:05 if the university's expanding it's
0:48:06 essentially expanding their territory
0:48:08 and i have a feeling that cynthia
0:48:11 doesn't have the same friends
0:48:13 that you know Reiss has
0:48:15 so
0:48:16 i mean if we can exclude some of those
0:48:18 would that help you britta i'm not sure
0:48:21 i um
0:48:22 don't know how we'd know that sort of
0:48:24 thing about the about the premiere i
0:48:26 don't know i was just sort of asking i
0:48:29 know some things but i'm not fully in
0:48:31 contact with or fully aware of his full
0:48:33 network i don't know is that the sort of
0:48:35 thing i can make in a cult role for to
0:48:36 see like to just
0:48:37 narrow down stuff for the premiere
0:48:39 probably not no not not with just
0:48:40 certain cultural you need to like take
0:48:42 an investigatory action that makes sense
0:48:44 well we're not looking at that big of an
0:48:46 area right at this point we're looking
0:48:47 at a few blocks yeah it's just that you
0:48:50 can there's a lot of room to fit a pack
0:48:52 that has mostly protein users
0:48:55 within a few blocks
0:48:57 is that a small enough search area to
0:48:59 use
0:49:00 the location
0:49:01 method you were talking about now uh it
0:49:03 could be although the smaller the better
0:49:05 especially if it's sort of a warn of you
0:49:07 know insane stuff
0:49:09 um
0:49:10 actually
0:49:12 johnny we know cynthia's name do you
0:49:13 know when she was embraced definitely
0:49:16 not i wasn't around long enough to
0:49:18 really
0:49:19 know anything
0:49:20 deeper about cynthia than what her role
0:49:23 in the pack was okay
0:49:25 i mean it's a little bit harder and i
0:49:27 hate to go back to the well all the time
0:49:29 but
0:49:31 i could ask
0:49:32 the heavens in the same way that we did
0:49:34 when i looked at arabella i can also
0:49:36 just go look as a bird
0:49:38 sure i mean we can we can just go there
0:49:40 but i think i think we're trying to
0:49:41 narrow it down more and get rid of a
0:49:43 little bit more information so that we
0:49:44 can i mean it's a lot safer considering
0:49:46 the pack
0:49:47 if we have a couple of buildings rather
0:49:50 than a neighborhood to look through
0:49:52 nothing is bad we can find it for sure i
0:49:54 just
0:49:54 what if you did look as a bird would
0:49:57 they
0:49:58 think to look for something like that
0:50:00 johnny i think it's her job
0:50:02 to be
0:50:03 nervous about where they're living so
0:50:05 they're going to have eyes out for all
0:50:07 kinds of stuff
0:50:08 what about that token the uh the picture
0:50:11 that the arimon's lance you were talking
0:50:14 about it'll make it easier to find her
0:50:16 find information will make it easier to
0:50:17 hide from her yeah in the process
0:50:19 stalking everything but the killing so
0:50:21 maybe just take that with you guys and
0:50:24 be extra careful and see if we can just
0:50:26 put eyes on her if we can actually
0:50:28 figure out where she's going to it
0:50:29 sounds like a plan to me you keep a
0:50:31 phone on you if you get made we'll be
0:50:33 nearby in the area to roll in and we
0:50:37 might have to do this a little bit
0:50:38 sloppier than we'd like i can keep us
0:50:40 hidden at least a little bit um i don't
0:50:43 know how many of them can see things the
0:50:44 way that i can or the Toreador can but
0:50:47 city gangrel can't see [ __ ] that's good
0:50:49 to know
0:50:50 unless they've been trained to you too
0:50:53 miles shawnee you stick together yes
0:50:56 oh yeah we're still in nobody goes
0:50:58 anywhere alone territory right he says
0:51:00 having come in after hunting and feeding
0:51:02 alone oh hunting's different so then
0:51:03 that sounds like what we should do um
0:51:06 you keeping us hidden
0:51:08 and then as much as we can sticking
0:51:10 together to see if we can get a trace of
0:51:13 any of them leaving or entering the
0:51:15 neighborhood or clue or anything i could
0:51:17 also just ask the pigeons in those
0:51:19 neighborhoods if they've seen them
0:51:21 aren't they surrounded by gangrel though
0:51:23 yeah but city gangrel don't tend to uh
0:51:26 they don't talk to them
0:51:27 oh
0:51:28 okay yeah i mean we can do both but
0:51:30 either way that that involves us going
0:51:31 over there to have a conversation right
0:51:33 i mean birds fly i can get them out of
0:51:35 the area but probably not all the way
0:51:36 out here so i guess i think getting
0:51:39 close is still ideal i guess we head out
0:51:41 and look for whatever we can and yeah if
0:51:43 it comes to a fight let's not do that we
0:51:46 get ready just in case it does come to a
0:51:48 fight as prepped as we can be
0:51:51 we go in we try not to but if it gets to
0:51:53 that it gets to that okay if it comes to
0:51:56 a fight are we rip courting or are we
0:51:58 staying and fighting if we can spot
0:52:00 cynthia on the street outside of the
0:52:03 haven and she makes you we're gonna try
0:52:05 and nab her before she can get back
0:52:07 there
0:52:08 got it got it if she gets back into
0:52:10 there
0:52:11 then i think we gotta we gotta we gotta
0:52:13 think twice before we go just barging
0:52:16 into a place that might be loaded with
0:52:18 traps schlachta and all kinds of other
0:52:20 bad stuff set it on fire that might
0:52:23 cause more problems for the city than it
0:52:25 will solve
0:52:26 likely the abbot has prepped for a fire
0:52:29 they'll have an escape plan and we will
0:52:32 just scare them to their next location
0:52:34 and have caused the fire in the yale
0:52:36 area we'll have to start all over again
0:52:38 clan premier might also not look kindly
0:52:40 upon that i'm real concerned that this
0:52:42 is all happening right next to clan
0:52:44 premier and they haven't seen anything
0:52:46 they barely ever seem to leave the
0:52:47 chantry Reiss is really the only person
0:52:49 we see in court that often yeah but they
0:52:52 see [ __ ] that's that's one of the things
0:52:54 they do they can see that doesn't mean
0:52:57 that they see they trust in their wards
0:52:59 i mean i agree with too much it is weird
0:53:01 but it's not anything we can do at this
0:53:04 time if you see anything out of place
0:53:06 keep note of it that might be of it but
0:53:07 like and just remember that it seems to
0:53:10 me that the reason they've chosen this
0:53:12 area is that they're literally hiding
0:53:15 right behind the neck of a massive beast
0:53:18 this is the power seat for new haven the
0:53:20 downtown area and specifically the
0:53:22 chantry this seems like the perfect
0:53:24 place for them to like weasel their way
0:53:27 in and find safe haven yeah but we just
0:53:31 handed vito santosa over to the tremere
0:53:34 who are immediately in contact with the
0:53:36 sabbat well
0:53:38 they're not really in contact so much as
0:53:40 in not contact but in the area right
0:53:45 i get the feeling johnny's right
0:53:47 honestly i get the feeling that
0:53:49 it is you know
0:53:51 the tick on the back of the dog
0:53:53 um
0:53:54 it's bold but everything we've seen
0:53:56 about them says that they're bold it's
0:53:58 something to be aware of and it is in
0:54:00 thought but there's not really anything
0:54:02 preventing us from doing what we're
0:54:03 about to do oh no i wasn't saying that
0:54:05 we should alter our plans because of it
0:54:07 but it is something in my mind worth
0:54:09 noting and definitely using if we need
0:54:11 to if it's a thing that comes to it yes
0:54:14 definitely okay let's
0:54:16 move out i think we're as ready as we
0:54:18 will be
0:54:22 [Music]
0:54:26 one at a time the group of you make your
0:54:28 way down to its place where you have
0:54:30 agreed
0:54:31 to meet give a final review of the plan
0:54:34 and then execute it taking your first
0:54:37 major step
0:54:39 against the killing spree
0:54:42 neil miles you're some of the first two
0:54:44 to arrive it's actually kind of a quiet
0:54:46 night and
0:54:48 the two of you are given
0:54:49 ample space
0:54:51 to have your chat between yourselves
0:54:54 shortly thereafter over the course of
0:54:55 mere moments but uh wynn and johnny kind
0:54:59 of roll in
0:55:01 okay so
0:55:02 we have a location for
0:55:05 cheryl that's her new shirt right
0:55:07 cynthia steam it we have a location for
0:55:09 cynthia at least a general location
0:55:11 right we know she's in the brownstones
0:55:13 right off of yale we have a basic idea
0:55:16 of which building she's in
0:55:19 we're going to go in together
0:55:21 we've got our gear and he looks over it
0:55:23 at johnny and and britta as they walked
0:55:25 in
0:55:26 we've got everything we need
0:55:27 johnny gives a nod pulls out a morally
0:55:29 pops in his mouth and lights up still
0:55:31 got the stuff from other missions so
0:55:34 okay
0:55:35 everything's packed in the car
0:55:36 yep
0:55:38 once we get outside
0:55:39 uh a little bit private if it's in the
0:55:41 car we can go in the car
0:55:43 i will
0:55:44 just prepare um
0:55:46 johnny win
0:55:47 if you have a little blood to give um
0:55:50 i will call the hunter's moon
0:55:52 to make sure that we can
0:55:54 that you stay yourselves and we can
0:55:55 bolster our will for going in because
0:55:58 johnny she's a little sombra right can't
0:56:00 they get in there in your head yeah she
0:56:02 is she's uh the youngest of the ductus
0:56:05 children so if we can
0:56:07 bolster the two of you against her i
0:56:09 think things will keep a little stronger
0:56:11 and
0:56:12 bolster your will um
0:56:14 i will
0:56:15 also
0:56:16 um enshroud all of us
0:56:19 so that without vision like mine
0:56:22 hopefully no one can
0:56:24 see us you all remember what i said
0:56:26 about walking like me
0:56:28 stay stay out of the light try not to
0:56:29 like bump into things open doors i'll
0:56:32 enshroud all of you and then i'll take
0:56:34 care of the rest if i use my red eyes
0:56:36 can will that blow it no okay no it
0:56:40 should be fine just don't draw attention
0:56:41 to yourself it's it's more mental than
0:56:44 physical
0:56:46 once we're in there
0:56:48 neil swallows a little bit
0:56:50 this is a
0:56:52 killing mission right this is a we're
0:56:54 not trying to capture her word
0:56:56 we're trying to take her away from the
0:56:57 killing spree correct
0:56:59 he gives a little nod
0:57:00 also
0:57:01 not for nothing
0:57:03 because she is of the bloodless ombre
0:57:07 she likely has
0:57:08 powers of uptenabration
0:57:10 and when i know you've seen what it's
0:57:12 capable of yeah it's [ __ ] up but for
0:57:15 the three of you
0:57:16 she manipulates shadow like it's
0:57:19 sentient
0:57:20 and you'd be surprised how powerful
0:57:22 shadow can be is it a physical
0:57:24 manifestation of shadow or is it just
0:57:25 shadows johnny's head tilts down
0:57:29 and he gives you a very grave look
0:57:31 no it's physical
0:57:33 black arms will reach out of the out of
0:57:35 the shadow mass and grab you
0:57:38 and it's just as strong as i am
0:57:41 if you see something like this
0:57:43 don't stand your ground you get out of
0:57:45 there
0:57:46 as johnny clarifies that it's just as
0:57:48 strong as he is britta winces
0:57:51 the subtenabration has a limited range
0:57:55 which is one of its key weaknesses
0:57:58 if you stay and fight it it's gonna
0:58:00 overwhelm you and drag you down
0:58:02 you won't be able to see
0:58:04 it'll flood your eyes
0:58:06 make you blind i've heard that there's
0:58:08 even
0:58:09 even more dangerous powers it's capable
0:58:12 of
0:58:12 i can't say that i've ever seen some of
0:58:14 those more dangerous powers
0:58:16 does it exist only in the physical realm
0:58:19 or does it exist in i wish i knew okay
0:58:22 do incendiary rounds weaken it
0:58:26 i thought we were gonna try not to light
0:58:28 this place on fire that's
0:58:30 always the the goal
0:58:32 it's good to have goals i know i know
0:58:34 the lassombra fear fire and they fear
0:58:36 sunlight
0:58:37 but i do know that oftentimes their
0:58:40 power can even douse out
0:58:42 those kind of light sources okay
0:58:45 okay so
0:58:46 what's our best way of contacting you
0:58:48 two
0:58:49 seeing that we'll be
0:58:51 under
0:58:52 your contact in miles and i yeah if
0:58:54 we're trying not to break our
0:58:56 obfuscation
0:58:58 neil you've been talking people
0:58:59 a summon would work wouldn't it
0:59:01 i can but only if i see them okay the
0:59:04 other thing shooting someone you guys in
0:59:06 in obfuscate that wouldn't break
0:59:07 anything if you summon your obvious gay
0:59:09 breaks okay that's that was my that was
0:59:11 my concern i think you meant like if she
0:59:12 can summon you while you're up you
0:59:13 skated
0:59:15 um
0:59:16 it would break the obfuscate but it
0:59:18 i guess would be quick if you if things
0:59:20 are going loud that might be the bet the
0:59:22 fastest and easiest way to do it got it
0:59:24 depending on the signal over there
0:59:26 usually what i would do is just
0:59:28 keep uh keep my phone in my pocket with
0:59:30 a text message already sent
0:59:32 like just at a finger on the finger on
0:59:34 the green button
0:59:35 depending
0:59:37 all right let's have both as backups
0:59:39 um
0:59:41 when we have a better idea because we
0:59:42 have a general one the other thing that
0:59:44 we can do if you two are okay
0:59:47 watching me for a minute is i can
0:59:49 if we're not sure about the astral realm
0:59:51 i i can go look inside see if she's
0:59:54 alone see if it looks like she's going
0:59:55 anywhere i don't know if she'll be able
0:59:57 to perceive me or not but
0:59:59 maybe keep it as a last resort potential
1:00:01 risk but it's it's doable maybe easier
1:00:04 than walking room by room we'll stake
1:00:06 out two hours then we'll see if the
1:00:10 actual projection can work without being
1:00:12 spotted we can get a better idea where
1:00:13 they are in there
1:00:15 hopefully and then we move in okay makes
1:00:17 sense man with the timeline i like it if
1:00:20 anything else comes up obviously we'll
1:00:22 we'll stay in touch
1:00:23 we'll just
1:00:24 johnny uh gives you gives you all a hard
1:00:26 look this is a lot of terrifying and
1:00:29 that's their main weapon
1:00:31 but they're not invincible and this he
1:00:33 kind of jabs a finger at the table in
1:00:36 the middle of us referring to the plan
1:00:38 this is the best way to take them down
1:00:40 with us working together this is going
1:00:43 to work and he will spend a point of
1:00:45 willpower to
1:00:46 bolster everyone with iron heart
1:00:49 nice these are one per well thankfully
1:00:52 i've got eight willpower to spend so
1:00:55 so what does iron heart do for us uh it
1:00:57 increases the difficulty of people
1:01:00 trying to affect you with dominate
1:01:01 presence and mind affecting thaumaturgy
1:01:03 for the the remainder of the scene nice
1:01:05 it actually uh causes johnny to always
1:01:08 have this aura of like badassery and
1:01:12 it becomes infectious when he spends the
1:01:14 willpower and makes you feel as
1:01:16 confident as he seems to be i mean i i
1:01:18 don't want i didn't want to say it but
1:01:19 you know thank you that's
1:01:22 that's in the wools
1:01:24 an extra aura of badassery
1:01:27 okay
1:01:28 i guess we should do this then
1:01:30 good hunting yeah
1:01:32 [Music]
1:01:37 so the trip to
1:01:39 the just off campus like
1:01:42 a little dorm area that's being set up
1:01:44 is a very short walk and when you get
1:01:47 there
1:01:48 it looks like there is uh
1:01:51 you know a couple landscaping pickup
1:01:53 trucks parked outside
1:01:55 there are
1:01:57 gardening tools it looks like there's
1:01:58 been a lot of work done to this place as
1:02:00 they set it up some trees have been
1:02:01 pulled down
1:02:02 and otherwise it looks
1:02:05 pretty empty easily overlooked wind's
1:02:08 going to keep our eyes out for squirrels
1:02:10 and pigeons and other city wildlife that
1:02:15 might be around a college campus
1:02:17 and see if any of them are willing to
1:02:18 talk uh there's a lot of pigeons okay
1:02:21 when will crouch down and
1:02:23 use her animalism and
1:02:25 hey i was wondering if i could talk to
1:02:26 you for a second hi
1:02:28 um looks at you with one massive like
1:02:31 round eye
1:02:33 is it possible that from the bar i could
1:02:35 have taken like some crackers or
1:02:36 something like that or pretzels yeah i
1:02:38 mean you're not eating them i think like
1:02:40 i think likely if wind reaches in her
1:02:42 pocket she'll find some crackers oh yeah
1:02:44 just on a daily basis oh hey i'm worried
1:02:48 about those though
1:02:50 i'm an alpha i feed my pack
1:02:55 so as she's talking to the pigeon she
1:02:57 starts sprinkling out some cracker
1:02:59 pretzel crumbs he comes down eyes you
1:03:01 wearily
1:03:03 very quickly pecks at a chunk of cracker
1:03:06 here and there
1:03:08 he stands very close this guy's been in
1:03:09 the city like his whole life
1:03:11 we're looking for someone i was
1:03:13 wondering if maybe you've seen her she's
1:03:15 kind of like me
1:03:17 kind of
1:03:18 monstrous definitely a predator
1:03:20 crackers she doesn't have crackers
1:03:22 crackers well i have more crackers if
1:03:24 you answer the question good crackers
1:03:26 are good
1:03:27 that's what i hear
1:03:28 the name cynthia does that mean anything
1:03:30 to you no
1:03:31 no
1:03:33 um
1:03:34 she sprinkles crackers periodically as
1:03:36 she's she's talking
1:03:38 bob's head looks at you the white eye uh
1:03:41 have you seen any unnatural darkness oh
1:03:44 yeah yeah yeah where kind of like looks
1:03:46 around
1:03:47 everywhere well not right now
1:03:49 no but where most recently
1:03:52 more crackers he's more crackers
1:03:55 he makes like this cooing noise
1:03:57 and other pigeons start to kind of watch
1:04:00 you wearily
1:04:01 and they start checking the situation
1:04:03 she pulls out like a handful of wrapped
1:04:06 saltine crackers and just starts
1:04:08 frantically unwrapping them and
1:04:09 sprinkling them around
1:04:11 yeah i'll kind of come down good good i
1:04:13 like crackers
1:04:14 i get that darkness uh
1:04:17 yes
1:04:19 dark place there it kind of like looks
1:04:21 uh the place that has few too many
1:04:24 landscaping trucks around it yes
1:04:26 dark
1:04:28 not from here not from life
1:04:30 not from stars not from sun
1:04:33 not from moon
1:04:34 dark without light light may dark
1:04:38 human now you know yes
1:04:41 guys is there anything else we want to
1:04:42 ask the pigeons neil's just been
1:04:43 watching her talk to birds and throw
1:04:45 crackers all over herself like
1:04:48 just she's not throwing them on herself
1:04:49 she's really not trying to seduce these
1:04:51 birds sure
1:04:53 when um do you know when
1:04:56 or what the pigeons know when cynthia
1:04:59 tends to exit do you know
1:05:02 when the darkness seems to come out
1:05:04 night that tracks
1:05:06 when specifically during the night
1:05:09 after bells
1:05:10 after bells
1:05:12 i like bells
1:05:13 bells and crackers that's what life's
1:05:15 all about man
1:05:16 i get it
1:05:17 she will dispense the last of her
1:05:19 crackers all right thank you for your
1:05:20 time he leaves once they've had the
1:05:22 crackers are out so what's the word here
1:05:25 bird
1:05:27 i set myself up for that you're really
1:05:32 bad
1:05:35 when when this is really serious right
1:05:37 now
1:05:38 what's the word what
1:05:41 damn it
1:05:42 everybody's heard about the bird
1:05:44 what are you guys doing
1:05:46 i'm trying to get a handle on the
1:05:48 situation here and i'm not helping
1:05:51 so
1:05:51 basically they said unnatural darkness
1:05:53 seems to come from there she motions to
1:05:55 the building that the pigeons indicated
1:05:57 um okay
1:05:58 so that place with all of the trucks in
1:06:00 front of it okay that being said we
1:06:03 should really account for those trucks
1:06:04 because those tentacles can definitely
1:06:05 rip those trucks apart and swing it at
1:06:07 us and was there any news about when she
1:06:11 leaves after bells
1:06:13 bells like on the hour or that's what i
1:06:15 would guess
1:06:17 it's a pigeon
1:06:18 so um
1:06:20 did they say how many bells
1:06:23 no
1:06:24 okay
1:06:25 good to know it's a moderate amount of
1:06:27 helpfulness well we know which building
1:06:29 that's actually very helpful that's a
1:06:30 great start well the bells make sense i
1:06:33 think we are right by a church street so
1:06:36 that might really be that hourly bell
1:06:39 technically that means it's always after
1:06:40 bells
1:06:41 we know the building we know somebody at
1:06:44 least leaves you know after the hour
1:06:46 although
1:06:47 no offense but i i don't know how much i
1:06:49 want to judge a pigeon's judge judgment
1:06:52 of time pigeons are pretty smart if
1:06:53 they're trained but this guy seemed like
1:06:56 he was just a cracker addict it's not
1:06:59 being able to understand what he was
1:07:00 saying to you or what you were
1:07:02 discussing it just looked like a pigeon
1:07:04 eating crackers
1:07:05 if i'm being totally honest i mean aside
1:07:08 from getting the building it was largely
1:07:09 just a pigeon eating crackers okay great
1:07:12 so
1:07:12 talking about how much he liked crackers
1:07:14 here's the question
1:07:16 do we want to
1:07:18 hide out somewhere and you guys protect
1:07:20 my body and i just go look inside
1:07:23 to see if
1:07:24 cynthia is in there
1:07:26 if you go in in astral and these things
1:07:29 can astrally project we can't help you
1:07:31 johnny was teaching me how to fight but
1:07:33 i can always come back to my body
1:07:35 can you yeah
1:07:36 unless they sever my cord but
1:07:38 if they can sever my cord i'm in way
1:07:40 more trouble than i thought it would be
1:07:42 is there an amount of time we should
1:07:44 give you before we start trying to pull
1:07:46 you back
1:07:47 can we pull you back at all when you are
1:07:49 in the realm of thought you move with
1:07:50 the speed of thought so
1:07:52 it should just be a few minutes
1:07:54 so longer than 10 minutes and we start
1:07:56 shaking you or pouring water on you or
1:07:57 something okay well that won't i mean
1:07:59 yeah i'll be able to feel it but yes
1:08:01 yeah okay
1:08:02 unless we don't want to do this i just
1:08:04 well will it tip them off that's where
1:08:06 my thoughts are i don't know
1:08:08 so we should warn johnny and miles
1:08:10 before we do this just in case and then
1:08:12 update them after i mean they know we're
1:08:14 scouting they know we're going to be
1:08:15 doing [ __ ] like this specifics don't
1:08:17 hurt if we can communicate with them i
1:08:19 mean either way all right do you guys
1:08:21 want me as a bird or as a person text
1:08:23 them i
1:08:25 i mean i'm going to just be a limp
1:08:27 corpse while i'm doing this so anybody
1:08:29 anything you can do just to do you want
1:08:30 to take up lookout keep an eye out and
1:08:33 i'll stay right by neil to protect him
1:08:35 sure britta moves her hand within her
1:08:38 jacket her grip is definitely landing on
1:08:41 the handle of a gun but she keeps it
1:08:43 hidden all right so wynn will find a
1:08:46 place that is
1:08:47 pretty dark and definitely out of the
1:08:49 way of prying human eyes
1:08:51 and she will spend the blood and begin
1:08:54 the painful looking process of turning
1:08:56 into an owl as she does this brit
1:08:58 attacks smiles lets him know that neil
1:09:01 is about to go into astral that they
1:09:03 will be guarding the body and they will
1:09:04 update once that is over how long has it
1:09:06 been not very long like maybe 10 minutes
1:09:09 okay
1:09:10 a text back it's it's been 15 minutes
1:09:13 maybe maybe wait out the rest of the two
1:09:15 hours that was originally allotted
1:09:17 before sending neil in Britta swears
1:09:19 under her breath and looks over
1:09:21 um
1:09:22 miles is completely right we said that
1:09:24 we were gonna do this in two hours yeah
1:09:26 but it's like now that we're here i'm
1:09:28 nervous
1:09:29 well that's a terrible reason to do this
1:09:31 i'm gonna be real with you
1:09:33 okay fine so
1:09:34 instead i guess
1:09:36 let's do
1:09:37 he's right i forgot when someone got
1:09:39 nervous and i forgot yeah i was gonna
1:09:40 say wins like half cronenberg owl at
1:09:42 this point okay so let's just do you
1:09:44 want to be in a bird while we well i'm
1:09:46 sorry be a bird i'm not sure how to say
1:09:48 it she'd have owl
1:09:53 british just off her game she looks down
1:09:55 text miles back says
1:09:57 you're right
1:09:59 we'll wait
1:10:00 and she looks back over to neil and says
1:10:04 when can investigate from that angle all
1:10:06 right while we investigate during how
1:10:09 we're planning to i don't know if you
1:10:10 can cover her while she's i mean i i can
1:10:12 yeah let's just everybody go into an
1:10:14 alley or something so we give me like
1:10:16 give me like 10 minutes all right when
1:10:17 she's done go into an owly
1:10:21 no
1:10:21 [Laughter]
1:10:24 you're a bird you can't say that no but
1:10:26 she's definitely thinking it
1:10:29 and giggling to herself in owl
1:10:31 all right you like hoot
1:10:34 so we step into a place that has a few
1:10:36 shadows and neil starts to like encant
1:10:39 under his breath and move his fingers
1:10:42 kind of as if he was weaving and the
1:10:44 shadows start to like darken and cling
1:10:46 around the three of them in theory if i
1:10:48 don't [ __ ] up this role
1:10:51 yeah it does um so for the next
1:10:54 five hours it all clings around and then
1:10:57 the three of them sort of fade from
1:10:59 sight like neil often does on his own uh
1:11:02 as the shadows sort of cling and obscure
1:11:05 their forms and then in a whisper he
1:11:07 looks at the other two okay stay out of
1:11:10 spotlights try not to bump into anything
1:11:13 or anybody uh don't you know
1:11:15 make a lot of crazy movements uh draw
1:11:17 attention to yourself and
1:11:19 in theory no one should really notice us
1:11:21 unless they can see like i can see
1:11:23 got it
1:11:24 all right um i guess we just stake out
1:11:28 then that was the plan
1:11:30 about 45 minutes into the stakeout those
1:11:33 watching see something that strikes them
1:11:35 is rather unusual
1:11:37 you see
1:11:38 a
1:11:39 kind of a very young preteen girl
1:11:42 greasy blonde hair very unkempt
1:11:45 and she looks like she's been crying a
1:11:48 lot
1:11:49 and with her is a pair of young women in
1:11:53 college probably attending the
1:11:55 university
1:11:56 they're in like what looks to be uh kind
1:11:59 of dark jogging clothes and
1:12:02 uh they don't have like a purse or
1:12:03 anything on them
1:12:04 and
1:12:05 they seem to be speaking to the young
1:12:07 girl as encouragingly as they can
1:12:09 there's some concern on written on their
1:12:12 faces
1:12:13 this girl points to
1:12:16 uh the place you're staking out
1:12:18 and is like uh
1:12:20 my
1:12:21 my mommy's here
1:12:23 um
1:12:24 uh can
1:12:27 can you bring me over
1:12:28 and they kind of look a little confused
1:12:30 but yeah they nod
1:12:32 and holding this little girl's hand she
1:12:34 kind of takes both their hands and walks
1:12:36 with them up the steps and to the front
1:12:38 door
1:12:40 do we want to stop this
1:12:41 i mean there's one do i see anyone else
1:12:44 like
1:12:45 following along with this preteen girl
1:12:47 in obfuscate like walking behind or does
1:12:50 she seem to be alone with these two
1:12:52 human beings oh you do see
1:12:54 someone accompanying her
1:12:56 he
1:12:57 looks to be this kind of like ratty
1:12:59 looking mexican guy with pointy ears
1:13:02 his hair is also kind of this like mess
1:13:05 there's whiskers like actual whiskers in
1:13:08 the place of a mustache and these like
1:13:10 ratty clothes he prowls along following
1:13:13 the the trio with red glowing eyes and
1:13:18 claws uh pointing from his fingernails
1:13:21 does the girl look at all like the
1:13:22 picture of cynthia no
1:13:24 cynthia is a grown woman can i sense a
1:13:27 beast from any of them uh both have
1:13:30 beasts uh well you can't see one one of
1:13:32 them only neil can see okay you can see
1:13:34 the girl and she does have a beast this
1:13:36 little girl has a beast yes okay there's
1:13:39 there's two out on the street right now
1:13:41 [Music]
1:13:42 this is an opportunity to try and get
1:13:44 two of them it's way off plan and we
1:13:46 wouldn't be we may be tipping off
1:13:48 cynthia but it's not our target and
1:13:51 those two girls are gonna die
1:13:53 that might not be our concern right now
1:13:55 but we already know that every time that
1:13:59 we don't kill the killing spree that
1:14:01 they're killing people and i'm just
1:14:03 saying there there may be an opportunity
1:14:05 right now to
1:14:07 kill
1:14:08 two of them if we think we can do it
1:14:10 fast i just don't know if we can
1:14:12 win kind of looks at neil makes
1:14:14 eyes at him and shakes her head they
1:14:17 ascend the steps
1:14:19 neil
1:14:20 is standing on the balls of his feet but
1:14:23 nods that win wind flies up into a tree
1:14:27 tactically if we do it right now
1:14:29 we may blow our complete cover
1:14:32 um but we might be getting two for the
1:14:34 price of one
1:14:35 and
1:14:36 if we do it before they go inside they
1:14:37 may not get tipped off we would have to
1:14:39 move quick but if win bumps her head
1:14:41 against neil's head will that break the
1:14:44 obvious skate uh if you're too off you
1:14:45 skeeted together you're fine okay she
1:14:48 kind of pushes her owly her downy little
1:14:50 forehead against niels
1:14:55 i i can't it's it's hard to get in your
1:14:56 head right now thanks hunter's moon
1:14:59 she kind of bites his nose a little bit
1:15:00 oh
1:15:02 i don't know what you want and i can't
1:15:03 get in your head right now when are you
1:15:06 trying to comfort neil
1:15:08 chase no she bit me i don't think i
1:15:09 could get in your head either not with
1:15:11 all that
1:15:13 after getting bit and just seeing the
1:15:15 frustration in the owl
1:15:17 neil will look at her and just sort of
1:15:19 like pinch the bridge of his nose and
1:15:21 then open his vision to eyes of chaos to
1:15:24 try and see like what
1:15:27 just try and see something through his
1:15:29 like
1:15:30 recognition of patterns like what what
1:15:32 are you trying to convey here i do not
1:15:34 understand you right now
1:15:36 it is not a pure form of communication
1:15:39 so i will take a guess
1:15:41 and convey that to you and we're going
1:15:42 to see how this that seems super fair
1:15:48 it's three successes with three
1:15:50 successes you look into her big seagull
1:15:54 eyes
1:15:54 that are on an owl
1:15:58 and scales on his head
1:16:00 with pretty little pattern on her face
1:16:02 and you
1:16:04 recognize
1:16:05 that what she is conveying to you
1:16:07 whether in this conversation or over the
1:16:09 course of the past few months
1:16:10 she is telling you
1:16:12 where you go
1:16:14 she will go
1:16:15 whatever that means
1:16:17 whoever that is
1:16:19 neil opens his eyes and looks at her
1:16:23 and then like takes a half step back
1:16:25 out of like
1:16:26 ha uh
1:16:28 okay um
1:16:30 wind flies up into a tree and then like
1:16:32 blinks his eyes a couple of times and
1:16:33 looks over at britta
1:16:35 okay last chance are we going to do this
1:16:36 or not
1:16:40 she bites him on the ear
1:16:43 i like that you flew back down this is
1:16:44 not a nibble this is a bite
1:16:46 all right forget it forget it we're not
1:16:48 [ __ ] they cross the porch you're both
1:16:50 right we're not and
1:16:52 the door opens
1:16:55 and
1:16:56 the little girl calls out mom
1:16:59 she leads them in she's like come in
1:17:01 come in it's okay
1:17:02 and they follow her in
1:17:06 and
1:17:07 the ratty
1:17:08 hunter that is following them along
1:17:12 follows in as the door is left open
1:17:14 and he shuts the door slamming it behind
1:17:18 them
1:17:18 and very muffled to the point where i
1:17:21 mean really only you neil can hear it
1:17:24 the screaming starts
1:17:27 and then it's quickly silenced
1:17:29 neil
1:17:31 is a vampire
1:17:32 he
1:17:33 already doesn't he's like not physically
1:17:36 capable of blanching he does not have
1:17:38 blush of health or anything like that
1:17:39 but
1:17:40 the two women with him can very clearly
1:17:44 get the impression that neil is hearing
1:17:47 something right now
1:17:49 and he looks
1:17:50 extremely upset
1:17:53 like he's about to cry humanity five
1:17:55 plus i needed to conscience test your
1:17:57 difficulty is eight
1:18:02 okay
1:18:02 all right
1:18:04 nope two successes
1:18:07 you can kind of hear them and
1:18:10 you know
1:18:12 you know that you made the choice to be
1:18:15 better than this
1:18:16 you made the choice to not be a monster
1:18:20 and this was a failing
1:18:22 on that path
1:18:24 not just for you
1:18:26 but you allowing other people to do it
1:18:29 refusing to speak out when you know
1:18:30 you're right
1:18:32 and this time that terrible habit of
1:18:34 yours
1:18:35 has cost people their lives
1:18:37 and it weighs on you
1:18:40 britta looks
1:18:41 down kind of shrinking in her posture
1:18:44 and holding her jacket closer to her
1:18:48 neil
1:18:49 you
1:18:51 look on in horror and for a moment it
1:18:53 looks like you might whimper
1:18:56 with your eyes of chaos up
1:18:59 you see
1:19:01 that the plan remains intact
1:19:04 and that you will do what you have come
1:19:06 here to do when you feel nothing for
1:19:08 these pawns
1:19:10 who have helped to confirm the presence
1:19:12 of other enemies in the field
1:19:15 neil's face watches the front door
1:19:18 and it
1:19:20 looks
1:19:21 like he's about to cry
1:19:23 and then
1:19:25 the humanity drains from his face
1:19:29 and very clearly standing in the street
1:19:31 and obfuscate next to Britta
1:19:34 neil feels
1:19:37 nothing
1:19:38 did you actually botch here i double
1:19:40 botched i lose two points of humanity
1:19:42 that brings neil to humanity four
1:19:45 i have had to make two conscience checks
1:19:47 and i have botched them both times from
1:19:49 here on out you are particularly pale
1:19:52 gaunt your ears come to slight points
1:19:55 your lips are more thin and
1:19:57 anyone who gets too close
1:20:00 can very clearly see something is wrong
1:20:02 with you
1:20:03 neil watches the front door
1:20:05 having
1:20:07 made the choice failed to make the
1:20:08 choice
1:20:10 and just stares
1:20:12 like a completely inhuman monster
1:20:15 until the screaming stops why not you do
1:20:18 not botch or fail fail okay
1:20:21 you watch
1:20:22 you watch neil let them go you stand by
1:20:26 and whatever he feels or the lack
1:20:27 thereof
1:20:28 you find yourself feeling it too and
1:20:31 little things start to mean less to you
1:20:34 at home
1:20:35 familiar
1:20:37 the people you care about
1:20:39 your connection begins to fade
1:20:41 and without them
1:20:43 i think you know what you are
1:20:45 mechanically lose one humanity yep yep
1:20:48 she is also down to humanity for
1:20:50 [ __ ]
1:20:53 i'm sorry i that was
1:20:56 i should have gone with you guys no
1:20:58 you're right you made the right call
1:21:01 like you said before like miles said
1:21:03 before this is the plan
1:21:05 we're just a watch
1:21:07 doesn't make it right doesn't make it
1:21:09 wrong either
1:21:11 i just
1:21:13 i thought i i thought i had it right
1:21:15 earlier when i said that we knew that
1:21:16 they were killing people that
1:21:18 us being here didn't make it any
1:21:20 different it seemed like maybe we were
1:21:22 just making it more personal and like i
1:21:25 could excuse it that way but now that
1:21:27 i've done it we it's not the same we did
1:21:29 have a choice interact we didn't know
1:21:31 about it
1:21:32 the question that was posed is whether
1:21:34 or not we were going to take a swing at
1:21:35 two of them bam
1:21:38 the front door swings open and shut
1:21:39 again and outside two different people
1:21:43 emerge
1:21:44 one of them you immediately recognize to
1:21:46 be cynthia
1:21:47 and she turns to the other person that
1:21:49 is joining her
1:21:51 he
1:21:52 unlike the rest of the cd Gangrel
1:21:54 actually looks a little more handsome
1:21:55 he's got
1:21:56 he seems a bit better adjusted to
1:21:59 unlife than
1:22:01 a lot of his packmates and uh seems to
1:22:04 pay a little bit more attention to his
1:22:05 clothes he's got some nice kicks
1:22:08 he's got a few piercings and it's all
1:22:11 clean and good good looking
1:22:13 he rests his hands over cynthia's
1:22:17 and cynthia says to him
1:22:19 all right that was [ __ ] up
1:22:20 why do they insist on doing it this way
1:22:22 every time i know where it holds our
1:22:25 hands
1:22:26 it's the what the ductus wants
1:22:28 toughen us up
1:22:30 keep the pressure on the cammies
1:22:32 i know it's wrong but
1:22:34 we gotta win this somehow right
1:22:37 send miles the text message
1:22:46 you said you want to do something yeah
1:22:48 as soon as he lets go of her hands i'm
1:22:49 dive-bombing her okay so the three of
1:22:52 you will be taking a surprise action
1:22:53 that surprise action can be i continue
1:22:56 with the plan the surprise actually
1:22:58 could also be a dive bomb the [ __ ] out
1:23:00 of this [ __ ] either way role initiative
1:23:02 19. uh i'm on a 15.
1:23:04 14. britta
1:23:06 you see the start of a dive bomb you
1:23:08 don't hear it though it's just this
1:23:11 silent flying bird through the night
1:23:14 headed towards her destination with a
1:23:15 vengeance brother goes to summon miles
1:23:18 and
1:23:19 on an instinctual kick goes for johnny
1:23:21 instead roll at plus two difficulty
1:23:27 four successes subject comes with haste
1:23:29 overcoming any obstacles in his way
1:23:32 sounds good uh neil i see wind dive
1:23:34 bombing you sure do where are we right
1:23:36 now we're like in a little alley
1:23:37 watching them so this is more of like a
1:23:40 like a private property that's uh like
1:23:42 just off campus campus is always like
1:23:43 forever expanding and
1:23:46 as i mentioned on the street there is um
1:23:49 like a lot of lawn care uh landscaping
1:23:51 yup uh there's like there's a big lawn
1:23:53 here for the path and the staircase that
1:23:55 leads up that's why you had some time to
1:23:57 discuss whether or not you wanted to
1:23:58 yeah yeah for sure neil is torn for just
1:24:01 half a second because we're supposed to
1:24:02 be following the plan here and that's
1:24:04 not part of the plan but getting cynthia
1:24:07 out and watching win dive bomb
1:24:10 where he goes she goes
1:24:13 and so where she goes he goes
1:24:15 neil will spend his surprise watching
1:24:18 her go over there to try and also
1:24:20 support in his sort of inhuman malkavian
1:24:23 way now and his body will collapse and
1:24:25 he will try and project himself
1:24:28 mentally across the street to go support
1:24:30 win leaving his body behind brett and
1:24:32 neal collapses [ __ ]
1:24:34 win
1:24:38 nine successes eight successes will roll
1:24:40 over into bonus damage dice which is
1:24:44 strength plus brawl
1:24:46 uh your damage is going to be strength
1:24:48 plus one die for claws three die for
1:24:51 claws she's the big ones right strength
1:24:53 plus three dice for claws
1:24:55 so you're rolling 15 dice gonna need a
1:24:58 third hand
1:24:59 pretty much this is a three-hand job
1:25:01 where's rusty when you need him
1:25:04 and i'm spending a blood for potence
1:25:06 [Music]
1:25:09 she has 242 12 damage did you add the
1:25:13 two from the potential i did not add the
1:25:15 two from potent she will subtract two
1:25:18 successes from the damage udl and she
1:25:20 will take 12 levels of aggravated damage
1:25:23 this kills her instantly so you swoop
1:25:27 down and
1:25:29 with your claws you snatch the front
1:25:32 half of her head
1:25:34 clean from her body and a fast rotting
1:25:37 butt not ashing corpse collapsed to the
1:25:40 ground
1:25:42 the boy who is holding her hands
1:25:45 howls as he starts to ride the wave of
1:25:48 frenzy
1:25:49 and that howl starts to get echoed
1:25:52 around the campus
1:25:54 as
1:25:55 members of the pack fly into a rage
1:25:59 when you're still holding a good portion
1:26:02 of her but you are now flying back up
1:26:04 after successfully executing
1:26:07 the abbot
1:26:08 of the killing spree i need everyone to
1:26:11 make a humanity test
1:26:13 because you guys have absolutely
1:26:15 orchestrated and executed a murder is it
1:26:17 everyone everyone everyone why we're not
1:26:20 there
1:26:22 you're literally like hey guys we can do
1:26:24 this we're here in spirit this is the
1:26:25 bestest plane you're gonna love it
1:26:27 what what kind of role is this what's
1:26:29 the difficulty on this one conscience
1:26:30 difficulty
1:26:34 once he says one success
1:26:38 one success one success
1:26:40 one success
1:26:41 oh thank god oh okay despite being in
1:26:44 the throes of like riding the wave of
1:26:47 his anguish
1:26:48 the boy catches her and is in control of
1:26:52 himself just long enough to help her to
1:26:54 the ground
1:26:55 but after that
1:26:57 the beast takes over
1:26:59 and
1:27:00 he
1:27:01 will begin running in the direction that
1:27:03 he sees the bird that just murdered his
1:27:05 girlfriend
1:27:10 path of knight is an actual play vampire
