0:01:02 through their options

0:01:06 practices
0:01:10 [Music]
0:01:13 when we pick up with you starting the
0:01:17 evening what are you doing given the
0:01:19 events of last night when feels like she
0:01:22 needs to get something from her Haven
0:01:24 so at a point when miles is on a phone
0:01:27 call and Johnny's chain smoking and
0:01:30 Neil's God knows where she slips out of
0:01:32 Britta's coffee shop bar Art Studio thing
0:01:35 and heads back to her Haven when you
0:01:38 head back to your Haven there's a few
0:01:41 things that you actually notice right
0:01:43 away when you get there it actually
0:01:45 looks like this section's been wardened
0:01:48 off there's tape kind of like around the
0:01:51 area there's a sign saying like do not
0:01:53 enter and as you kind of go towards that
0:01:56 section of like the woods that like the
0:01:59 path is like blocked off by the city you
0:02:02 see kind of equipment set around your
0:02:04 Haven uh it looks like there's been all
0:02:07 kinds of like scans and samples being
0:02:09 collected and then you notice why and
0:02:13 the section of trees going around your
0:02:17 uh the Little Shack in the woods that
0:02:20 you use as your Haven there are these
0:02:22 orange and gray fatty mushrooms that
0:02:24 have grown all across the ground up the
0:02:28 sides of trees it looks like this whole
0:02:30 little section right around where the
0:02:32 weaving bear was has been completely
0:02:34 overrun by this fungus wind disregards
0:02:37 the tape
0:02:38 um it's her stuff nobody's gonna keep
0:02:40 her from her stuff but she kind of
0:02:43 takes a moment and stares at the
0:02:45 mushrooms and whether from the events of
0:02:50 past nights or just a thought that she's
0:02:54 now coming to terms with she kind of
0:02:56 starts pondering the nature of of
0:03:00 mushrooms in general and what they
0:03:02 represent the mushrooms are probably one
0:03:04 of the few things she can't kill in any
0:03:06 way that matters mushrooms are part of
0:03:09 the entropy that is extent in life and
0:03:13 trying to do something about that is not
0:03:15 dissimilar to trying to do something
0:03:17 about Kindred she kind of comes to terms
0:03:19 with the fact this might not be her
0:03:22 fight she wants it to be because that
0:03:24 makes it less scary but at this point
0:03:26 she doesn't feel a whole lot of fear and
0:03:28 for the moment she's task driven and she
0:03:32 just sort of makes her way towards her
0:03:34 Haven and when she gets there she
0:03:37 assuming that either her Hut hasn't been
0:03:39 found or it's been ignored as some kind
0:03:42 of indigent living in the woods uh and
0:03:44 disregarded which not inaccurate she
0:03:47 throws her Army cot to the side and she
0:03:50 starts digging into the dirt underneath
0:03:52 it and she does this with with her bare
0:03:56 hands not caring how much dirt is
0:03:57 getting under her nails how dirty her
0:04:00 hands are getting and eventually she
0:04:02 pulls out sort of like a bank safe
0:04:04 deposit box this metal box that is meant
0:04:07 to withstand the ages and she knows she
0:04:11 shouldn't open it now because there's a
0:04:14 time and a place and surrounded by death
0:04:17 that she can do nothing to control
0:04:19 probably isn't the right time but
0:04:21 something in her just needs to know that
0:04:24 it's all still there and so she opens
0:04:26 the lid and she starts sifting through
0:04:29 seemingly
0:04:30 very unimportant things there's a roll
0:04:33 of boxing tape that one would use to
0:04:37 wrap one's hands there is an old black
0:04:39 and white photo of a girl with long dark
0:04:42 hair wearing boxing gloves that are way
0:04:45 too big and a man behind her clearly
0:04:47 lovingly coaching her how to throw a
0:04:49 punch and then beyond that there is a
0:04:52 single yellow
0:04:54 badly knitted baby booty made by someone
0:04:57 who clearly wanted to to know what they
0:05:00 were doing and just could not make their
0:05:03 fingers do what was in their head and
0:05:05 she kind of lovingly
0:05:07 holds each of these things
0:05:09 and just sits contemplating
0:05:15 we're not supposed to go anywhere alone
0:05:16 Jesus [ __ ] Christ Neil appears out of
0:05:21 nowhere in the middle of wins Haven
0:05:23 looking not directly at her but at the
0:05:26 things in the Box in her hand and
0:05:29 without sort of addressing the fact that
0:05:31 he apparently accidentally caused her
0:05:33 some distress by just appearing out of
0:05:35 nowhere nods his head towards the
0:05:36 photograph
0:05:37 that's your dad yeah he opened a boxing
0:05:40 gym
0:05:41 he let me bring water to the guys there
0:05:43 and then
0:05:45 when I started getting old enough that
0:05:47 the guys were looking at me differently
0:05:48 he started teaching me how to fight I
0:05:50 saw she kind of gives him a look with a
0:05:53 raised eyebrow yesterday
0:05:56 when you were alone
0:05:58 in the woods up a hill house well not
0:05:59 alone Ramirez was there
0:06:02 um we're not supposed to go anywhere
0:06:03 alone but you keep walking off or flying
0:06:06 off as a case maybe
0:06:08 so I wanted to um she gives him a chance
0:06:11 to explain himself she gives him enough
0:06:13 rope to hang himself if need be he hangs
0:06:15 himself
0:06:16 very quickly I you flew off and I
0:06:20 followed I trusted the Brit ahead my
0:06:22 body and so I I just followed and
0:06:26 you looked not okay and you flew back
0:06:29 out to that place and I saw what you
0:06:33 were thinking about
0:06:35 and I
0:06:37 I was worried so you couldn't see me I
0:06:40 wasn't there but I was there I know I
0:06:44 heard you
0:06:45 um not the whole time but I just I just
0:06:49 watched
0:06:50 you seem pretty deep into it but I
0:06:52 didn't want you to be alone
0:06:53 I don't she kind of looks at the box of
0:06:56 stuff again and touches it all I don't
0:06:59 like
0:07:00 feeling like this I don't like not
0:07:04 feeling I don't like the absence I've
0:07:07 been here before it [ __ ] sucks
0:07:10 this is um this is all new to me I feel
0:07:13 like I should feel something here I feel
0:07:15 like
0:07:16 I should feel sick but I don't I don't
0:07:21 feel sick at all this is
0:07:23 it can get better
0:07:25 can it yeah
0:07:27 I've I've pulled myself out of this
0:07:29 before
0:07:31 I I know it's only about two weeks but
0:07:35 I'm the oldest one of us here and I've
0:07:38 never
0:07:39 I was always so in touch with my
0:07:41 feelings and with humanity and now since
0:07:45 the setites and since yesterday I just
0:07:47 don't feel
0:07:48 feel like I should care and I don't win
0:07:51 you've never needed to be a monster Neil
0:07:53 oh I mean aren't we all isn't that kind
0:07:56 of what this is there are the monsters
0:07:58 who live under the bed and there's the
0:07:59 monsters who live in the woods man
0:08:01 they're not the same I don't know how
0:08:05 I don't know how to take that I don't
0:08:06 live in the woods but I have definitely
0:08:07 hidden under beds
0:08:09 you
0:08:11 you've been a monster to survive you
0:08:14 haven't been a monster to make surviving
0:08:17 bearable I mean
0:08:19 I don't know I
0:08:21 how'd you get better how did you start
0:08:23 to feel it again I look back at this
0:08:25 picture of me with dark hair and
0:08:27 remember that there was once a little
0:08:29 girl who loved her dad more than anybody
0:08:31 in the world
0:08:32 and just wanted to make him proud
0:08:36 I remember
0:08:37 wrapping my hands with this tape and
0:08:41 sticking them into gloves that were too
0:08:43 big and taking on men twice my size
0:08:45 because I knew if I didn't it sent a
0:08:47 message
0:08:49 and and I look at this and she holds up
0:08:53 the booty like she can't really even
0:08:56 speak about it
0:08:58 and I look at this and
0:09:02 I remember the thing that drove me to
0:09:07 embrace being a monster and the thing
0:09:09 that kept me from going all the way
0:09:12 how
0:09:14 how would one go about
0:09:16 and he stops himself for a little bit
0:09:18 and looks down at the the booty in her
0:09:21 hand and it's like it if for some reason
0:09:23 it's taking him a second longer than it
0:09:25 usually does to like connect those kind
0:09:27 of emotions and he looks up in her nose
0:09:30 I'm so sorry when
0:09:33 I saw
0:09:34 a lot but I didn't without a lot of
0:09:37 things
0:09:39 but I have to
0:09:41 I have to think of Claire otherwise I
0:09:44 Lose Myself
0:09:45 I don't know a lot about the situation
0:09:47 but I
0:09:49 do you want to
0:09:51 I think the answer here is do you need
0:09:53 to talk about it
0:09:54 all the psych books that are on my
0:09:57 shelves tell me that I should
0:10:01 I uh I don't know how much stock I put
0:10:04 in that kind of stuff I I failed out of
0:10:06 college so I
0:10:07 uh technically I did too
0:10:10 well
0:10:11 if you want to talk about it I'm here if
0:10:13 you want to
0:10:14 I never want to
0:10:17 do you want me to go get it
0:10:20 that help
0:10:21 if I don't have to say it maybe
0:10:23 I feel like I should ask you permission
0:10:25 this time rather than just looking
0:10:27 she kind of gives this shrug like Jesus
0:10:29 you've been in there already just just
0:10:31 go but she acknowledges that what he
0:10:35 needs is to hear it and so she's like
0:10:36 yeah go get it all right we'll go ahead
0:10:38 and think about it and I'll take it and
0:10:41 Neil looks at win and he just holds eye
0:10:43 contact this time she crosses her eyes
0:10:45 once like she still can't be serious
0:10:47 about anything or like she really can't
0:10:49 be serious about this but eventually her
0:10:52 eyes settle on his he just opens his
0:10:55 senses and looks at what wind is
0:10:58 thinking about
0:11:01 foreign
0:11:04 [Music]
0:11:07 with all the hair on her head nothing
0:11:10 shaved her eyes are green but not the
0:11:14 seagull green like normal human green
0:11:16 she thinks of herself looking in a
0:11:20 mirror and putting on a pair of overalls
0:11:22 because overalls are really forgiving
0:11:23 and then she kind of takes a breath and
0:11:27 heads out to what looks out of a tent
0:11:29 and it's Woodstock and there's a bar
0:11:35 tent without really a name on it there's
0:11:38 some faded sign but she just starts
0:11:40 hauling bottles and kegs and at one
0:11:44 point at the end of the night after a
0:11:46 day of hauling bottles she hears this
0:11:48 voice in the woods it's a man he's good
0:11:51 looking and he kind of comes over like
0:11:53 he's got something to share with her she
0:11:55 heads over they talk for a few minutes
0:11:57 and then she says well I better go
0:12:00 knowing that she probably shouldn't risk
0:12:02 not getting sleep
0:12:04 all she remembers is this terrifying
0:12:08 feeling of being grabbed from behind and
0:12:11 then there's just noticeable gaps in the
0:12:14 memory and then when she starts to
0:12:19 remember again she is covered in blood
0:12:22 she has these things on her hands they
0:12:25 don't look like her hands anymore but
0:12:27 just these weapons on her hands and she
0:12:32 is in agony there is no pain like this
0:12:35 this is this is monstrous this is not
0:12:38 natural
0:12:39 so she curls up in the woods not even
0:12:44 able to scream for the pain
0:12:46 eventually these monstrous hands just
0:12:50 catch this impossibly tiny baby and
0:12:55 through wind's memory you can see that
0:12:59 it sort of blinks at her and there's a
0:13:03 sort of flash of light
0:13:04 and then it goes still and you see the
0:13:07 corner of winds braid turn white and she
0:13:10 starts clawing at her head
0:13:14 she just screams
0:13:16 and it was as though the last human part
0:13:19 of her is lying in her hands and all
0:13:23 that's left is
0:13:25 a monster
0:13:28 [Music]
0:13:35 even outside New Haven sitting across
0:13:38 from her Neil looks up just at this
0:13:41 point when is bent overhead and hands
0:13:44 like she wants to pull the hair from the
0:13:46 sides of her head but there's nothing
0:13:47 there anymore he's just watching her and
0:13:51 hesitates for a second and then sort of
0:13:53 kneels down as she's bent over and just
0:13:56 puts his arms around her shoulders
0:13:58 gives her a hug just holds her in the
0:14:00 same way that she's done to him whenever
0:14:02 he's had like panic attacks or just
0:14:04 complete breakdowns and just
0:14:07 doesn't try to say anything just holds
0:14:12 her there for a little bit
0:14:13 I [ __ ] failed
0:14:16 I was a inhuman killing machine and I
0:14:19 couldn't protect the one thing that
0:14:21 needed protecting
0:14:25 and I can't now
0:14:27 and I have to remember why and that's
0:14:29 why Claire is so important to remember
0:14:31 Neil
0:14:33 and I want you to see her
0:14:35 and I want you to think
0:14:38 I want you to find the Claire
0:14:41 he's quiet for a minute
0:14:43 hasn't really let go yet I
0:14:46 um
0:14:48 there's this idea that the more an idea
0:14:52 spreads the more it lives the more
0:14:55 understanding it is so I
0:14:57 when I know
0:15:00 no you don't I can't not know I cannot
0:15:04 see I know that she existed no
0:15:08 and that's two people and that's more
0:15:10 than it was yesterday
0:15:12 and I'm
0:15:15 I can't know you're right
0:15:18 and honestly if this is what brings you
0:15:20 back if this is the pain that you need
0:15:23 to bring you back I
0:15:25 I'm scared when because I don't know if
0:15:28 I have that
0:15:30 I don't have do you know what Claire
0:15:33 means the meaning of the name yeah no it
0:15:36 means light
0:15:40 she's my light in darkness and now she's
0:15:42 yours
0:15:43 foreign
0:15:45 okay
0:15:47 I'll try
0:15:49 she kind of Pats his hands as they're
0:15:51 wrapped around her kind of that heavy
0:15:53 comforting feel and she puts the booty
0:15:55 in his hand and wraps his fingers around
0:15:57 it
0:16:00 just hold on to her okay if you need to
0:16:02 hold it for a long time that's okay I've
0:16:04 got her
0:16:05 I um
0:16:07 when I'm a keeper of things I know where
0:16:11 you live I don't I think you need to
0:16:16 keep this
0:16:17 because I'm not going to stick around
0:16:19 for a little bit
0:16:24 um
0:16:25 she still kind of holds his hand shut
0:16:28 he hasn't moved to like resist that at
0:16:30 all not physically anyways before I get
0:16:33 to that though I am we should probably
0:16:35 talk about Ramirez if you're up for it
0:16:40 Neil seems really weird like he's he's
0:16:44 fully aware of the emotions and he he is
0:16:48 connecting to them because he cares
0:16:50 about wind like a lot
0:16:53 but usually where he's just empathetic
0:16:56 to the point where he's like a raw nerve
0:16:58 or he's feeling what other people are
0:17:00 feeling right now he's got this
0:17:03 body language and attitude like he's an
0:17:05 observer like like having never been
0:17:08 here before
0:17:09 he doesn't know how to connect in that
0:17:13 same way and you can sort of see him
0:17:15 trying
0:17:16 but he's just he doesn't have it ever
0:17:19 since yesterday and he's trying and it
0:17:22 like worries him but in that same he's
0:17:24 got that same look on his face like when
0:17:25 there's a puzzle that he has to solve
0:17:27 and he just can't quite get it yet
0:17:29 he means the Motions he means the hug he
0:17:32 means the words but there's just some
0:17:34 sort of Disconnect from the way Neil
0:17:37 usually is he looks at her and nods
0:17:41 again nods to himself and goes yeah are
0:17:44 you okay to talk about
0:17:47 Ramirez do you need a minute when kind
0:17:51 of
0:17:52 shifts but definitely leans into him
0:17:54 like she's like yeah I'm gonna move but
0:17:56 don't you dare don't you dare move from
0:17:58 this and she wipes her face it's all
0:18:01 bloody and pink at this point as she
0:18:03 wipes it away and she kind of looks at
0:18:06 him there's apology there whether he can
0:18:09 sense that or not
0:18:11 she just said we were going to tell you
0:18:13 I wasn't anticipating he was going to be
0:18:15 out there in the woods but why was he at
0:18:17 Hell House when
0:18:20 because Joey's mom thinks it killed her
0:18:22 son she's not wrong
0:18:26 they're gonna try and go after it and
0:18:28 you know
0:18:30 yeah you said we
0:18:32 you and Brenda know we did and we
0:18:35 weren't going to keep it from you but we
0:18:37 were about to go after the Abbot and we
0:18:39 didn't want all those thoughts floating
0:18:41 around we were going to tell you right
0:18:42 after so technically I'm true to my own
0:18:45 word but who um but technically correct
0:18:47 is not the best kind of correct in this
0:18:49 case who are you keeping it from
0:18:53 Johnny yeah because his daughter's gonna
0:18:56 go to Hell House yeah and she'll die
0:18:58 there she kind of gets this look on her
0:19:00 face uh and gives this shrug like she's
0:19:03 not even sure what words to say and
0:19:05 after a minute she's just like I we
0:19:08 couldn't do anything
0:19:10 and they can stop us
0:19:12 maybe there is something they can do
0:19:14 that we can't I don't know I suspect
0:19:17 people are gonna die at Hell house and I
0:19:19 told Ramirez if they get in over their
0:19:21 skis
0:19:22 call me and I'll be there as fast as the
0:19:25 owl flies yeah I heard that part
0:19:27 but I also can't stop them I'm not like
0:19:30 miles where I can just
0:19:32 redecide their priorities for them you
0:19:35 know you were concerned that Johnny
0:19:37 would go after them I was concerned that
0:19:40 Johnny was gonna go
0:19:44 and have to kill his daughter you made
0:19:46 the decision for him
0:19:48 yeah
0:19:49 for the moment
0:19:51 like I said we were never gonna keep it
0:19:53 from you guys
0:19:54 foreign
0:19:55 's quiet for a long while
0:19:59 Neil you [ __ ] know that you have to
0:20:01 handle each of us differently
0:20:03 I feel like
0:20:05 what I should be feeling is upset like
0:20:11 Johnny should know he should I'm gonna
0:20:15 tell him when we're done here okay good
0:20:17 um because I gotta be honest it's not
0:20:20 what I'm feeling right now what are you
0:20:22 feeling right now
0:20:24 I spent the last few hours taking stock
0:20:26 of me
0:20:28 and I look back and I keep not
0:20:32 making decisions and I keep looking to
0:20:34 others for God's sake when it was time
0:20:37 to call the strike on the Abbott I
0:20:39 looked to see what Bretta thought she's
0:20:41 so young and I like I like I can't
0:20:45 if I had just decided something
0:20:48 once maybe we wouldn't be here right now
0:20:52 so what I'm thinking what I'm feeling
0:20:55 and I know I feel like I shouldn't feel
0:20:57 this but what I'm feeling is like maybe
0:21:00 you made the right decision because just
0:21:02 like Miles said sometimes you have to
0:21:03 make decisions for the mission
0:21:07 I I don't like that that's what I'm
0:21:09 feeling but it's the honest truth and
0:21:12 I'm never gonna not be honest with you I
0:21:14 don't want you to not be honest with me
0:21:17 um
0:21:17 I've done what I can for now to help
0:21:19 miles with the Praxis and there's
0:21:21 there's so much that's coming down the
0:21:24 pipe Pike I could never remember
0:21:27 I always thought it was pipe let me tell
0:21:29 like sewage coming down it might have
0:21:32 been Pike like Turnpike uh the point
0:21:34 being
0:21:35 um
0:21:37 when Brit is alone right now I hate it
0:21:40 she was taken I hate that too right out
0:21:43 of our city
0:21:46 um I still feel like me enough
0:21:50 to remember the feeling of what it is to
0:21:53 be taken and alone
0:21:55 in a situation where you do not have the
0:21:57 power to protect yourself and I would
0:21:59 have done anything at the time not to
0:22:01 feel alone like that to know that people
0:22:03 were looking for me
0:22:05 miles is busy with the Praxis Johnny too
0:22:08 when you need to be here to protect them
0:22:09 somebody has to find Brenda it's our
0:22:12 code to remake we picked her she picked
0:22:15 us she fought for us she was willing
0:22:17 just like you are to take a life Boom
0:22:19 for me so
0:22:20 I gotta find her are you looking at me
0:22:23 to argue with you I'm asking you not to
0:22:26 but I don't want to just disappear on
0:22:28 everyone so if you could
0:22:31 if you kept the Ramirez thing for a
0:22:33 little bit maybe until the Praxis is
0:22:35 over
0:22:36 for me because I don't think Miles
0:22:38 trusts that I can really do this he told
0:22:41 me that I could so long as I couldn't
0:22:42 get caught and I have the best chance of
0:22:45 that but there's no guarantees in the
0:22:48 world so
0:22:49 but if it is Pendragon that took her
0:22:51 miles seems to think it has and that
0:22:54 tracks with me someone took her I don't
0:22:57 care who I can't get it out of my head
0:22:59 that Pendragon is a domineering violent
0:23:03 Prince and he has read up and I don't
0:23:08 think I gotta tell you why I feel like
0:23:10 that's a different scenario than if I
0:23:12 got taken or Johnny or miles
0:23:15 I don't want her to be alone when I'm
0:23:18 gonna go after her I I don't want you to
0:23:21 argue me out I just need you to know I'm
0:23:23 I'm asking you to let me go but wherever
0:23:28 you go I go so if you tell me no I won't
0:23:33 if you tell me to stay I'll stay
0:23:38 what happened to the buddy system
0:23:39 someone came and took one of our buddies
0:23:42 and now they don't have a buddy
0:23:44 I'm not gonna say no but I want to get
0:23:46 you there you can't win I I'm not gonna
0:23:50 fight you tonight I'm not you know I'm
0:23:52 not that's
0:23:54 I can be invisible I can be intangible I
0:23:59 can find anyone I can project my
0:24:01 Consciousness around the world if if
0:24:03 someone took her out of the city
0:24:06 I don't know I can't ask Johnny but I'll
0:24:09 find a way can you find her in front of
0:24:11 me no do your magic [ __ ] I don't know
0:24:14 where she is I have to do some footwork
0:24:16 first before I can do something like
0:24:18 that when kind of it looks like she's
0:24:20 running her tongue over her teeth and
0:24:22 her mouth like she's thinking I am not a
0:24:25 good enough ashapoo yet to find anyone
0:24:28 anywhere
0:24:29 I'm working on it but for now I got to
0:24:31 do it the old-fashioned way ish I have a
0:24:33 starting point you can talk in my head
0:24:34 right if I can see you you can see me
0:24:37 now can you put yourself in my head so I
0:24:39 have contact with you while you're doing
0:24:40 this that's not how it works I have no
0:24:43 [ __ ] clue how any of this works man
0:24:44 I'll have my phone in my pocket okay and
0:24:46 worse comes to worse if I'm somewhere
0:24:48 else
0:24:49 if I'm about to die or whatever I will
0:24:52 bring myself back to you to at least
0:24:54 tell you so you're not left wondering if
0:24:57 you're gonna disappear from your body
0:24:59 again where are you leaving your body
0:25:00 I'll have to figure it out for now I
0:25:02 need to be in my body okay I will let
0:25:05 you know where it is
0:25:07 if I can
0:25:08 I'm not gonna fail anyone else hail me
0:25:11 neither
0:25:13 there's been so much hurt
0:25:16 because I didn't act and just waited and
0:25:19 waited and waited and right now I can
0:25:22 see it and the longer I'm waiting the
0:25:24 lower the odds get so I'm Gonna Act
0:25:26 the same way that you do or miles does
0:25:28 or Johnny does or Rita does yeah you
0:25:30 think there's no hurt that comes from
0:25:32 acting versus not acting don't make that
0:25:34 the basis of your decisions
0:25:36 if this is what you think is right if
0:25:38 you if finding her and protecting her or
0:25:42 at least being there for her will bring
0:25:44 you back and crack that shell that's
0:25:47 around you right now that's what I want
0:25:49 you to [ __ ] do
0:25:51 I don't know I just know that she's a
0:25:54 member of our cotery and no one comes
0:25:56 into our city and takes our things I'm
0:25:59 done with my
0:26:01 people being taken from me when kind of
0:26:05 gives this look like she appreciates
0:26:07 that
0:26:08 I'm
0:26:12 go and I can prowl the neighborhoods and
0:26:14 take everything back that was taken from
0:26:16 me a different way
0:26:17 but at least this way I'm helping other
0:26:19 people Britta is my priority over your
0:26:21 comic books so of those two I'm gonna
0:26:23 tell you to go find her okay that's all
0:26:26 I need to hear please
0:26:28 this isn't a path you have to walk alone
0:26:31 so please if there is an opportunity
0:26:33 check in if I could bring other people
0:26:34 with me on this and have just as good of
0:26:37 a chance of being not found I would but
0:26:39 I really think I have the best chance to
0:26:41 do I'm saying you got a phone in your
0:26:42 pocket [ __ ] use it I will
0:26:44 um will you stay a little longer a
0:26:46 little bit as long as you need and I
0:26:48 want to walk with you out of the woods
0:26:50 this is Buddy system nobody should be
0:26:52 alone if they don't have to be it's an
0:26:54 important new caveat we're thrown into
0:26:55 it if they don't have to be yeah yeah
0:26:58 I'll stay and Neil and he's been like
0:27:01 crouching like holding wind and she's
0:27:03 been holding him the whole time and he
0:27:04 just sort of slumps his uh back down
0:27:07 sort of against the wall and sits and
0:27:10 just keeps holding on to win like
0:27:12 rubbing a hand on her shoulder and just
0:27:14 sitting there as long as she needs
0:27:16 she eventually let's go grab whatever
0:27:18 you need
0:27:20 um yeah I think this place is going to
0:27:21 get overtaken soon it doesn't look good
0:27:25 and um in the meantime if you need nice
0:27:28 that's not British or I mean everybody
0:27:31 should be trying to stay together but
0:27:33 if you want to stash that somewhere and
0:27:35 he nods towards the Box
0:27:37 um down where I used to grow my plants
0:27:39 there are plenty of places to hide it
0:27:41 down there and I moved enough clay and
0:27:43 Earth into there to
0:27:45 cover the tub that there's plenty of
0:27:46 places for you to put it if you need I
0:27:49 appreciate it I also understand if you
0:27:51 want to keep it close for a little while
0:27:52 I need to find a new place I need to
0:27:55 find a new place to grow from I hear
0:27:57 that
0:27:58 we'll find it we will
0:28:01 I promise miles can help with that
0:28:03 obviously
0:28:05 well this is much better at finding
0:28:06 places than I am wind does let out a
0:28:08 laugh and it is a little bit unsettling
0:28:11 just because she is generally a murder
0:28:13 hobo or a very sad Mama Bear
0:28:18 seeing that he made her laugh
0:28:20 the Neil kind of smiles and relaxes like
0:28:23 and his face looks vaguely more human
0:28:25 for like the first time since he got
0:28:27 here there you are and then he stands up
0:28:29 and starts to fade back away again she
0:28:32 squeezes his hand before he completely
0:28:34 disappears you ready to go no but I
0:28:37 think it's time
0:28:39 um because I am getting nervous about
0:28:41 this
0:28:42 I think I'm just gonna be gone by the
0:28:45 time we hit the city limits
0:28:47 she gives a sigh shaking her head and
0:28:51 she's like
0:28:53 once or somewhere safe
0:28:56 they're gonna kill me miles and Johnny
0:28:58 you don't have to tell him I told you
0:29:00 you can throw me under the bus I'm not
0:29:01 throwing you anywhere you're fragile I'm
0:29:04 not gonna break you hurtful
0:29:06 and with a little bit of the old banter
0:29:09 I think the two of them walk back out of
0:29:11 the woods she stays very close to him he
0:29:14 stays right very close but like reaches
0:29:17 down at one point and holds her hand
0:29:19 gives it a squeeze then let's go once
0:29:22 they start getting more towards like the
0:29:24 Haven and and places that are safe once
0:29:26 their paths need to diverge she lets go
0:29:28 and with that he takes a half step back
0:29:30 so he's out of our sight
0:29:32 and then he's gone
0:29:34 good luck man
0:29:39 [Music]
0:29:41 foreign
0:29:43 you riding the limo and you have what is
0:29:48 on the surface a very pleasant trip to
0:29:51 West Hartford there Roma doesn't
0:29:54 actually Regale you with Tales of his
0:29:57 prowess or anything like that he much
0:29:59 prefers to allow silence to sit between
0:30:03 the two of you as he sips his drink and
0:30:06 simply
0:30:07 enjoys the presence of his most recent
0:30:11 Conquest
0:30:12 and then you arrive to West Hartford
0:30:15 specifically to the Vanderbilt mansion
0:30:18 and there
0:30:19 there are these massive gray pillars at
0:30:23 the entrance to his Haven
0:30:25 and right away you notice the very
0:30:27 subtle but ever-present the trolls of
0:30:31 bruja servants do they appear to be
0:30:34 ghouls or do they appear to be bruja
0:30:37 they are baruja servants as to make it
0:30:40 very clear that he keeps Kindred the
0:30:43 same way Kindred keep ghouls how many of
0:30:45 them do there appear to be you catch a
0:30:48 half a dozen but you can probably assume
0:30:50 there are more is it clearly West
0:30:53 Hartford by the look of it I don't think
0:30:55 British ever been in Hereford and she
0:30:58 would only have really pictures and like
0:31:00 TV to go off of so where you are right
0:31:02 now is largely just on a hill with a
0:31:05 really just this Mansion kind of
0:31:06 capturing your attention
0:31:09 as you arrive and get out of the limo a
0:31:12 driver opens the door for you offering a
0:31:14 hand to escort you out but I will take
0:31:17 it looking around trying to piece
0:31:19 together exactly where she is but she
0:31:22 finds and said that her eyes land on the
0:31:25 patrols
0:31:26 she counts them a bit but she quickly
0:31:29 redirects her attention back to
0:31:30 Pendragon Pendragon does not seem to
0:31:34 look at you and simply expects that you
0:31:37 follow as she heads up the stairs and
0:31:40 then at the door he opens it himself and
0:31:43 then holds it open for you
0:31:45 Britta takes a second to collect herself
0:31:48 her eyes falling to his but she dips her
0:31:51 head to him and she walks on inside
0:31:53 inside there is a collection Art
0:31:57 beautiful but most of it in the form of
0:32:00 historical artifacts that have been kept
0:32:02 from various Wars going all the way back
0:32:05 to the hoplite Weaponry kept by the
0:32:08 carthaginian Army and I do need a rule
0:32:12 her eyes are immediately falling to the
0:32:14 first piece of art that is in front of
0:32:16 her as she's looking all around already
0:32:19 this is self-control yes your difficulty
0:32:22 is eight
0:32:23 foreign
0:32:24 success that's an eight okay you manage
0:32:27 to keep your Woods about you soon as he
0:32:31 turns to speak there is a pause as the
0:32:34 two of you are interrupted and a young
0:32:37 man who assumingly waiting in another
0:32:38 room begins to approach and bows at the
0:32:41 door your grace
0:32:43 I have come to deliver a gift from the
0:32:46 torreidor primigen and he turns though
0:32:49 you're not sure whether or not the
0:32:50 primigen notices there is a look of
0:32:53 irritation on the like cold blue eyes of
0:32:57 Pendragon and
0:32:59 auditorial or primagen comes forward
0:33:02 with what looks to be a fencing sword
0:33:06 that is exquisitely crafted you can keep
0:33:09 your the role you already made okay
0:33:11 and you hold it up with his hands and
0:33:15 offers it to his Prince very careful to
0:33:19 keep his eyes down the ground and show
0:33:21 his subservience though
0:33:24 Bretta is able to keep her wits about
0:33:27 herself she still gravitates in her gaze
0:33:31 towards all the art towards especially
0:33:34 now the focus and this sword going into
0:33:37 Roman pendragon's hands and the attitude
0:33:40 is the only thing that draws her
0:33:43 attention away between the two of them
0:33:45 watching their patterns Roman accepts
0:33:47 the sword he draws it and seems to
0:33:51 examine the quality of the weapon the
0:33:54 toroid or primagen bows again and with
0:33:58 this nervousness permeating from him
0:34:00 steps out and kind of leaves as quickly
0:34:04 as he came and Ben Dragon who is
0:34:06 examining the quality of the sword
0:34:08 looks to you and tell me or Prince
0:34:13 what has he done for you
0:34:15 what has he taught you
0:34:17 there's a long silence as Brett is
0:34:19 trying to sort through it seems like the
0:34:22 first thought wins out even though she
0:34:25 might not actually want it to
0:34:28 that's sometimes there's no choice
0:34:31 but to trust he taught you to trust
0:34:34 among kindred
0:34:36 that there would that that choice would
0:34:39 be revoked
0:34:44 about why the camarilla exists
0:34:48 about why we play the games that we play
0:34:51 when I had first arrived he spoke about
0:34:56 domain and
0:34:59 leading
0:35:01 do you feel it though your Beast reacts
0:35:04 into one life
0:35:06 the way it drives you to act upon hunger
0:35:10 the way it compels you to protect the
0:35:13 things that you love the things that are
0:35:15 yours
0:35:16 Can You Feel the violence that it urges
0:35:20 your towards Bretta looks down but she
0:35:23 answers
0:35:24 yes I
0:35:26 don't want to I
0:35:28 you asked me what he taught me and one
0:35:32 of the first things was how to
0:35:34 pop out my fangs
0:35:36 thanks
0:35:39 more than fangs
0:35:41 more than blood he kind of very quickly
0:35:44 with this this motion that can't
0:35:47 actually be tracked with your eyes
0:35:49 presses the very tip of his sore to your
0:35:52 chin and kind of forces you to expose
0:35:54 your throat to him
0:35:56 that monster that lurks in you it
0:35:59 resides in all of us
0:36:01 and that is why the camarilla exists
0:36:04 because it must Express itself
0:36:07 and these quarterly games
0:36:09 this intrigue
0:36:11 is the only reason
0:36:13 that we do not simply destroy each other
0:36:17 and take what we want
0:36:20 and it is the only reason that I will be
0:36:23 playing this game
0:36:25 now
0:36:27 he does not to remove the point of his
0:36:30 sword from your chin Britta makes no
0:36:33 effort to not be moved she is fluid she
0:36:37 lets her chin be tilted up to him you
0:36:39 are my prisoner
0:36:41 my captive
0:36:43 and so long as you are mine
0:36:46 you will be but as breath from
0:36:49 destruction
0:36:50 and he kind of puts the sword away and
0:36:53 you will remember that
0:36:55 you will remember that
0:36:57 when we leave
0:37:00 in Rhode Island and newborn an ally of
0:37:03 mine is holding a Gala
0:37:05 you are coming with me
0:37:08 and you will serve as a symbol
0:37:11 of how the politics that exist between
0:37:13 Harford and New Haven are going
0:37:15 to say is very so keeping her chin up as
0:37:18 he had directed and At The Mention Of
0:37:21 Newport Rhode Island the identification
0:37:24 the tiny scraps of information that she
0:37:27 had heard about in the past
0:37:29 flip through her brain very quickly but
0:37:31 keeping her own eyes fixed on his she
0:37:35 nodged just slightly and says
0:37:37 yes your grace
0:37:39 good
0:37:41 as far as my allies need be concerned
0:37:43 you are the embodiment of New Haven for
0:37:46 all your scandals and the fame you have
0:37:49 acquired being acknowledged in Boston
0:37:51 brito's eyes flick down and then up at
0:37:55 that a trace of self-consciousness
0:37:57 showing through you will serve as the
0:37:59 fabricated representation
0:38:02 of my Conquest over New Haven
0:38:05 fabricated representation you weren't
0:38:08 acknowledged by accident you told
0:38:10 Clinton came to do what he did yes
0:38:13 and the things that he did there he did
0:38:16 apart from that because of you
0:38:19 yes
0:38:20 it is why I sent you to Boston and you
0:38:23 and him you had spoken about
0:38:25 talks that the two of you had had about
0:38:27 our codery
0:38:28 if I have to walk you through it
0:38:31 it would be a terrible disappointment
0:38:34 what are you wearing
0:38:37 um so just for descriptions sake she is
0:38:39 wearing the red leather jacket that
0:38:42 Johnny gave to her that's the top layer
0:38:44 over a black long sleeve shirt with a
0:38:48 boat neck and the gloves that she's worn
0:38:50 today are satin stretch they probably go
0:38:54 up a decent length up the arm but you
0:38:56 can't see beneath the jacket and the
0:38:58 shirt and relatively practical pants
0:39:00 boots it's what she wore to Kill The
0:39:03 Killing Spree so what she answers
0:39:05 Pendragon is
0:39:08 um we were going after the Abbott so
0:39:10 it's practical
0:39:13 I see
0:39:14 I'm kind of seeing his expression that
0:39:16 he is more lenient of your attire due to
0:39:19 what you were doing
0:39:21 and the Abbott is addressed
0:39:22 we've killed her yes
0:39:25 I see
0:39:27 for all that fussing about my methods
0:39:30 my servants are going to escort you to
0:39:32 your room
0:39:33 there you will be provided with
0:39:35 something appropriate to wear
0:39:37 you will be bathed and you will be cared
0:39:40 for but it looks like she's trying to
0:39:42 stifle some confusion but instead she
0:39:45 settles on the next thought and she says
0:39:48 your grace yes
0:39:51 you are talking about your methods and
0:39:54 yes I
0:39:57 she takes an unnecessary swallow trying
0:39:59 to study her voice and no longer is
0:40:02 succeeding at keeping her chin up tilted
0:40:05 where he had placed it she finds herself
0:40:07 looking down again as she continues on
0:40:09 to say
0:40:10 it it didn't feel so different from what
0:40:14 you were talking about no and
0:40:16 we should have seen that before
0:40:18 there is time yet
0:40:20 he kind of moves sort of again expecting
0:40:24 you to follow him she does and he heads
0:40:27 into a bother again beautifully
0:40:29 decorated all right
0:40:31 would you like to describe how
0:40:33 beautifully decorated before or after I
0:40:34 roll this
0:40:35 You're Gonna Roll first gotcha
0:40:38 what's the difficulty jokes it's a it's
0:40:41 definitely a wash there's a a 10 a one
0:40:44 and a two all right that's a wash you
0:40:48 will follow him and in the room there is
0:40:51 a gorgeous piano and sitting space and
0:40:55 oil paintings that are arranged such
0:40:59 that you find yourself lost in them
0:41:01 Bretta had sealed herself trying to walk
0:41:05 her own feet into Roman pen dragons
0:41:08 Haven at least for the first room but
0:41:11 something about going through another
0:41:12 doorway makes it so real and deeper in
0:41:17 her eyes Linger on the keys and she is
0:41:21 lost you don't know how long it is that
0:41:23 you focus on this but soon at some point
0:41:27 you hear the word Madam madam
0:41:32 Madam kind of shakes her head and tries
0:41:34 to come back into into Focus
0:41:37 after kind of turning you see a young
0:41:39 woman maybe a little older than you at
0:41:42 least in terms of appearance and she is
0:41:44 dressed as a more of a servant than an
0:41:48 actual guest of the prince his grace
0:41:51 insisted that you were cared for
0:41:53 provided with a bath and clothing
0:41:56 um yes what's your name
0:41:59 Maria I'm Bretta it's a pleasure to meet
0:42:03 you Buddha you too she kind of like
0:42:05 looks over her shoulder
0:42:07 as Grace doesn't often keep guests
0:42:11 like you At The Mention Of Pendragon
0:42:14 once more Bretta realizes having come
0:42:17 back into Focus after the trance that
0:42:20 she definitely went into a trance around
0:42:22 Roman Pendragon and she does a quick
0:42:25 check over herself to see if just
0:42:28 anything's different the only thing that
0:42:30 is different is that outside the windows
0:42:32 there is this like lightening of the
0:42:34 night sky like Dawn is approaching and
0:42:37 Roman is not in the room spotting that
0:42:40 the sky has gotten a bit lighter her
0:42:43 eyes fall back too the woman she's
0:42:45 talking to and she asks
0:42:48 um what does that
0:42:49 um what's different about me if you
0:42:51 don't mind me asking please his grace
0:42:54 does not prefer the company of guests
0:42:56 gives this look like she is going to be
0:42:59 accommodating when you start getting
0:43:00 kind of getting the impression that
0:43:01 she's not overly thrilled that you're
0:43:03 here he's normally alone in here yes
0:43:07 left to his studies
0:43:09 so why why are you here
0:43:13 politics
0:43:14 okay all right Bretta doesn't look sure
0:43:18 when she says it why did I drop a bath
0:43:20 thank you she leads you to this room and
0:43:24 the room I'm not gonna have you roll
0:43:26 again
0:43:28 but it is
0:43:30 it is again just absolutely gorgeous
0:43:33 incredible use of candelabras the
0:43:36 fireplace is huge and set into the wall
0:43:39 and perfectly like arranged and of
0:43:42 course there is this like just massive
0:43:44 ridiculous bed with a canopy how many
0:43:46 successes do you have on this rule
0:43:47 double botch okay she brings you into
0:43:50 the room a new examine the canopy and
0:43:52 your your hand kind of like runs along
0:43:55 the soft bed and you just come to again
0:43:58 in another room having been guided and
0:44:01 there is this massive bathroom that is
0:44:06 almost the same size as the room that
0:44:08 you were just in however long ago you're
0:44:10 starting to really feel the weight of
0:44:12 the Sun at this point coming and there
0:44:15 is a bath that is drawn for you the
0:44:20 woman that was assigned to care for you
0:44:22 Maria is just kind of waiting with her
0:44:24 arms crossed with this kind of
0:44:27 frustrated expression does she appear to
0:44:30 be kindred or Google you get the
0:44:32 impression she's alive okay Madam I'm
0:44:35 sorry
0:44:37 um thank you I can thank you and Bretta
0:44:40 definitely seems to expect her to leave
0:44:42 she doesn't
0:44:44 um uh I I can
0:44:47 take a bath now and
0:44:51 I will be on the other side of the door
0:44:53 thank you and with that Bretta will
0:44:56 actually get ready for the bath if she
0:44:58 seems to be going there's many towels
0:45:01 and everything you can possibly need
0:45:02 arranged by our shape it looks like you
0:45:04 gave her so much time to get the bath
0:45:06 ready that she really kind of took
0:45:08 advantage of it and she steps out and
0:45:10 she closes the double doors leading to
0:45:12 the bath Bretta will start by taking off
0:45:16 the jacket but the sensation of
0:45:19 disrobing and such an unfamiliar and
0:45:22 looming Place pauses her and is there a
0:45:25 window in this room there is a winner
0:45:27 that can look out yeah she looks more to
0:45:30 the window frame than the window
0:45:32 understanding the lightness that she had
0:45:34 seen earlier trying to divert her eyes
0:45:36 away from it and takes that one moment
0:45:39 of hesitation of very much not wanting
0:45:42 to be any more vulnerable than she is
0:45:44 but that's not she feels a choice that
0:45:46 she can make so she gets her clothes off
0:45:49 and gets into the bath and sensing the
0:45:52 warmth of it just some thing about that
0:45:56 touch the warmth heating dead skin this
0:46:00 makes her break down a bit and curl in
0:46:02 and on herself in there it takes her a
0:46:04 moment to actually get clean
0:46:07 it feels like after a time you are left
0:46:12 to your own devices and when you're
0:46:15 finished and head out of the bathroom
0:46:19 covered by towel Maria's left and in our
0:46:22 place waiting for you sitting in a seat
0:46:24 legs crossed his room and on the bed
0:46:28 kind of half obscured by the canopy is
0:46:31 this what looks to be this like velvet
0:46:35 dress that lies on the bed Bretta pauses
0:46:38 in the doorway as she spots Roman pen
0:46:41 Dragon while she's in a towel and
0:46:44 immediately the combination of her High
0:46:46 humanity and her blush of Health means
0:46:49 that she's going to be blushing it's not
0:46:51 a choice
0:46:52 she phrases a bit her eyes fall to the
0:46:54 dress and to him and she forces her feet
0:46:57 to move towards him you're unsure
0:47:00 whether or not the fact that you're just
0:47:01 wearing a towel really has any impact on
0:47:03 him
0:47:04 but he's clearly noticed that way you
0:47:06 blush and sort of watching you with
0:47:09 these unblinking eyes he speaks up you
0:47:13 are going to be meeting a fellow Prince
0:47:14 by the name of Warwick
0:47:16 understand that he has a certain disdain
0:47:20 for The Toreador you will not be the
0:47:23 only Tori
0:47:25 would I expect of you
0:47:27 is that you will convince him of New
0:47:32 Haven's stability
0:47:33 I understand that there is
0:47:36 trouble in your domain
0:47:38 you will leave it out of conversation
0:47:41 as far as he need be concerned
0:47:44 New Haven is ready for the many princes
0:47:47 that are on their way to it
0:47:49 I understand I should warn you and
0:47:53 Warwick's sire Bretta bites something
0:47:55 back but dips her head down once again
0:47:58 conveying her understanding
0:48:00 the blow you down to his web is not
0:48:02 forgotten
0:48:04 but you are arriving with me
0:48:06 you will leave with me
0:48:08 cross me and I will destroy you
0:48:11 but do not and nothing can touch you
0:48:14 he gets up and he walks out Bretta Waits
0:48:17 until the footsteps have completely
0:48:19 faded before taking in a breath that she
0:48:23 doesn't need as an undead Kindred and
0:48:25 just leaning against one of the posts of
0:48:27 the bed clutching the towel closer and
0:48:30 trying to pull herself back together
0:48:32 takes a few more breaths that don't help
0:48:35 before stealing herself to look at this
0:48:38 dress yeah yeah yeah yeah it is it is
0:48:43 nicer than you anything you have ever
0:48:45 seen also wear
0:48:49 that is nicer than any of Elsa's dresses
0:48:53 what a very specific Petty dick move his
0:48:56 whole home is a toy or trap oh yeah
0:48:59 no Toyota assassins here well
0:49:09 difficulty nine one ten
0:49:13 get it girl I've got a whole list of
0:49:16 questions about this dress so I'm gonna
0:49:17 have to ask
0:49:19 oh yeah uh the first question is does it
0:49:23 appear to be ready-made or does it
0:49:25 appear to be custom is are there tags
0:49:27 inside there are no tags inside when I
0:49:30 look at this dress how old does it
0:49:32 appear to be the dress does not so
0:49:36 we're like using your raw specs and like
0:49:38 going over this like like a detective
0:49:40 yeah you actually get the impression
0:49:41 that the fabric was very recently cut
0:49:45 and sewn to the shape of this dress this
0:49:48 dress was made for you are the
0:49:51 measurements correct as I hold it like I
0:49:54 I obviously haven't tried to put it on
0:49:55 yet but visually it doesn't look cracked
0:49:57 the measurements are correct are there
0:50:00 shoes are there anything else that you
0:50:03 would need with a dress So within the
0:50:05 room there is this massive mirror bureau
0:50:08 there's all these like a chest at the
0:50:11 foot of the bed and there's tons of
0:50:14 shoes jewelry you're kind of given some
0:50:17 leave to Accent the dress how you choose
0:50:20 this is how Rita gets Stockholm syndrome
0:50:22 the dress the dress has been
0:50:25 specifically Chosen and was probably
0:50:28 made in Boston as I look to the shoes
0:50:32 the jewelry are the shoes labeled are
0:50:35 they the correct size same set of
0:50:37 questions Freda it has a lot of Britta is
0:50:40 using her skill as a torridor to attempt
0:50:43 to get information that only she might
0:50:46 be able to get out of this the labels
0:50:48 are largely like some of the huge names
0:50:51 in France and the dress is specifically
0:50:54 made for you but everything else is just
0:50:56 the poshest most like impressive choices
0:50:59 that could have been put together okay
0:51:01 Erica has a question because Erica is a
0:51:03 costumer and a giant nerd about these
0:51:05 things
0:51:06 what era is the dress style to look from
0:51:09 that was actually gonna be I'm I told
0:51:11 you it is important because the dress
0:51:14 comes in many parts and it is from the
0:51:17 late 1700s
0:51:19 uh depending on your uh experience with
0:51:23 fashion this is like this is the kind of
0:51:25 stuff that people would wear to like
0:51:27 Queen Anne's ball what did you whisper a
0:51:31 decapitation for decapitation looking
0:51:34 just right for it you know yeah
0:51:36 there is even the option for a blue silk
0:51:39 ribbon I'm sorry I am sidelining this
0:51:45 this which the audience could hear you
0:51:46 smiling
0:51:48 it's so big
0:51:51 um but it appears that this very old
0:51:53 dress has been re-cut or remade this
0:51:57 dress is very new but is made in a very
0:52:01 old style does it have the requisite
0:52:03 undergarments to make it look right
0:52:04 that's that's what I mean by many parts
0:52:06 like oh noon garments are laid out but
0:52:08 it's the it's got like the bum rolls and
0:52:10 it's got the side thing so she could
0:52:12 smuggle up widescreen TV it is forever
0:52:15 the whole look can be I needed this
0:52:18 thank you
0:52:20 I am assuming English it is English
0:52:23 Bretta having taken stock of the dress
0:52:27 and the shoes and the measurements and
0:52:30 all of it actually Retreats back to the
0:52:33 bathroom for a moment and she retrieves
0:52:35 her clothes most protective over the
0:52:38 jacket brings them back over are there
0:52:41 dressers or is there storage in the room
0:52:43 there is lots it's a very spacious space
0:52:46 he could probably keep you here for like
0:52:48 years how comforters
0:52:55 as I go to open a dresser is there
0:52:58 already does it have things in it or am
0:53:00 I putting it into an empty dresser so
0:53:03 for the most part there aren't actually
0:53:05 clothes but there's enough that you
0:53:08 could probably be comfortable for a few
0:53:09 weeks without having to to re-wear the
0:53:12 same thing and definitely room for him
0:53:14 to just kind of put more in regardless
0:53:17 she's going to make sure to hang up the
0:53:19 leather jacket and looking around at
0:53:22 everything thing and the fact that the
0:53:25 sun is Drawing Near she's going to try
0:53:26 to Peck out something to sleep in the
0:53:29 dress is far too extravagant and
0:53:31 complicated and looking around for some
0:53:34 something to sleep in it's so clear that
0:53:36 she's seeking comfort that she's seeking
0:53:39 something
0:53:41 almost like she's looking for the least
0:53:43 expensive thing in the room ah so you
0:53:47 kind of quickly figure out that
0:53:48 thousands of dollars have been invested
0:53:50 into your kidnapping
0:53:53 and there's just nothing to sleep in
0:53:56 that isn't silk or as this realization
0:53:59 is striking her she's actually going to
0:54:01 search the room you know what there's
0:54:03 probably I'm imagining that there's a
0:54:05 there's a couple things that I picture
0:54:07 being in this room one of the first
0:54:09 things that comes to mind is some kind
0:54:11 of vanity is that true yes Berto will
0:54:14 walk to this vanity and noticing the
0:54:17 thousands of dollars that have been
0:54:18 invested into this kidnapping and the
0:54:21 scenario she still clutching the towel
0:54:24 is going to reach out to the frame of it
0:54:26 and as if touching the frame of it as if
0:54:29 once again becoming entranced in the
0:54:31 same things that caught her earlier
0:54:32 about this room but what she's really
0:54:34 going to do is poke the glass with a
0:54:38 mirror to trace her finger along it to
0:54:40 see if it's a real mirror when you touch
0:54:42 a one-sided mirror it appears as if
0:54:45 you're touching the mirror versus when
0:54:47 you touch a real mirror there's a space
0:54:48 between your finger and the reflection
0:54:50 so if what you're wondering as if
0:54:54 someone could watch you from the other
0:54:55 side that's the paranoid thought that's
0:54:57 entered British mind at this point your
0:55:00 fears are confirmed Bretta continues
0:55:02 trailing her hand along the side of the
0:55:04 mirror as if again simply trying to take
0:55:07 in what she's looking at but with that
0:55:10 information registered she gives up on
0:55:13 the idea of finding something that's not
0:55:15 extravagant pulls out the first thing
0:55:17 she sees it's probably a silk night
0:55:19 dress Retreats back to the bathroom
0:55:21 changes and comes back in once that's
0:55:24 through and every preparation that she
0:55:27 can think of she looks around the room
0:55:28 for anything else like that anything
0:55:30 that looks like it might have a hidden
0:55:33 compartment or secret but the sun is
0:55:36 Drawing Near and she's just starting to
0:55:37 feel helpless so her attention isn't
0:55:40 fully on it you search the confines of
0:55:42 yourself and Define that beyond the
0:55:45 mirror everything here has been placed
0:55:49 for your comfort
0:55:50 and eventually having not found any
0:55:53 further signs of being watched you're
0:55:56 left with no choice but to rest for the
0:55:58 day shall crawl into the four poster bed
0:56:01 and when Berta goes to sleep she always
0:56:03 curls very tightly almost childlike
0:56:06 maybe it's a habit left over from her
0:56:09 training in the shadow lands or from
0:56:11 having lost that part of herself but she
0:56:14 lays herself to rest and something about
0:56:17 being alone in that moment something
0:56:19 about The Silence it has been never in
0:56:24 her memory since she's been alone like
0:56:26 this since she hasn't been with the code
0:56:29 Ray for any extended amount of time
0:56:31 she finds just the urge to fall apart
0:56:34 creeping on in and she tries to cover
0:56:37 her face as She lays down to rest so
0:56:40 that there wouldn't be a hint of that
0:56:42 coming through
0:56:46 [Music]
0:56:50 miles
0:56:51 Johnny it's the two of you alone in
0:56:54 Cedar's Cafe British Haven
0:56:57 Florida is gone wind has [ __ ] off to
0:57:01 who knows where Neil might be in this
0:57:04 room might not
0:57:06 in all likelihood it's just the two of
0:57:08 you
0:57:09 smoking more of these and brooding about
0:57:11 what comes next Johnny has a lit morally
0:57:14 hanging out his lip
0:57:17 he Paces over the front of the door
0:57:19 looks back and forth along the street
0:57:22 just to make sure we're alone
0:57:24 walks back over and from The holster
0:57:27 under his jacket pulls out the matte
0:57:30 black ax puts it on the table and gives
0:57:33 you a hard stare we have a Praxis to
0:57:36 take miles you want to walk me through
0:57:39 what you're thinking I will miles has
0:57:42 his feet up on the same table that the
0:57:44 ax went on the coat is off somewhere
0:57:46 else and he's smoking another one of
0:57:48 Johnny's Morley's
0:57:49 so I've been thinking about it for a
0:57:51 while and
0:57:53 Upton's paranoia is definitely not only
0:57:56 made it a necessity but it's made it
0:57:59 more possible
0:58:00 I know where his Haven is I know it's
0:58:02 layout
0:58:03 I know just about all of its security
0:58:06 he's got some ghouls that we'll be
0:58:08 watching for him doesn't he not many if
0:58:11 he's got any left it would be surprising
0:58:13 he sent them all away all of them the
0:58:16 paranoia yeah I don't know if he's kept
0:58:18 any that I haven't got that information
0:58:19 or if he's picked up any new ones that
0:58:21 maybe he can trust more but all of his
0:58:23 old ones whatever Quentin hit him with
0:58:25 has caused him to be deeply paranoid of
0:58:29 all those around him he wouldn't even
0:58:31 let his ghouls dress him
0:58:34 so that's given us an opportunity
0:58:37 the house is mostly unguarded it seems
0:58:39 like there may be very little resistance
0:58:41 so I have tapped into the powers of
0:58:44 Dominate and progressed my understanding
0:58:47 of them and I have been slowly working
0:58:50 on one of his old combat focused goals
0:58:54 you can see Johnny's expression is a
0:58:56 little bit shocked his eyebrow kind of
0:58:59 pops up that seems like it's been taking
0:59:01 some time you've actually been thinking
0:59:04 about this longer than I thought you
0:59:05 have since we went to go talk to Elsa
0:59:08 essentially since the night he declared
0:59:11 the ordeal for Neil I Made bread at
0:59:15 Drake twice it was Johnny nods long and
0:59:18 you can see that his expression is one
0:59:20 that he accepts your answer
0:59:22 but you can see that he looks at he's
0:59:25 giving you a look like he thinks it's
0:59:27 been longer than that he uh takes a long
0:59:30 drag off the cigarette and NASA's head
0:59:32 at the look and he's like
0:59:34 Rowlands has been a terrible leader in
0:59:37 some ways he throws away the resources
0:59:41 he should be encouraging and has done a
0:59:44 lot to hurt the domain though he's
0:59:47 helped his own particular friends he's
0:59:50 kept the people close to him he's done a
0:59:52 decent job of protecting Johnny puts a
0:59:54 hand up you can practice the lines all
0:59:56 you want you don't have to convince me
0:59:58 of anything I'm in what are we doing
1:00:01 right so I go during the day I possess
1:00:05 the ghoul that I've been conditioning I
1:00:07 asked to borrow chaps's backup talking
1:00:10 about wins fisher cat wins fisher cat
1:00:12 all right so those two ghouls in the day
1:00:16 I go there and I stake him while he's
1:00:19 sleeping and then I return back with the
1:00:21 ghouls leaving chapster to guard and I
1:00:24 mean you come back when night Falls
1:00:28 that easy huh I mean no it's a series of
1:00:33 events that have left him unprotected
1:00:35 but also it's have you thought about how
1:00:38 you want to deliver the killing blow
1:00:40 yes
1:00:42 is this something you want to share
1:00:45 there are other princes coming
1:00:47 and Pendragon
1:00:49 and Rowlands own allies those Kindred
1:00:53 outside the domain
1:00:55 they're not going to deal with a neonate
1:00:59 not in the same way
1:01:01 I get it
1:01:02 so
1:01:04 I must become a shield
1:01:09 after tonight we're gonna have to do a
1:01:11 lot of work to make sure that this is
1:01:14 accepted I know that you've been doing
1:01:16 your your preliminary footwork
1:01:20 he talked to Elsa he talked to Rhys
1:01:23 what about the other clans
1:01:26 not so much
1:01:28 I think I think the Gangrel win want
1:01:31 to be behind us
1:01:33 malkavian
1:01:35 um if anything we got from what Berta
1:01:38 Neil told us uh I believe next is going
1:01:41 to generally abstain yeah I don't have
1:01:44 very good much of a read on Nicks you
1:01:47 think we're going to be clear there
1:01:48 we'll find out I don't know she's not
1:01:51 unreadable most of the time but she's
1:01:53 also not terribly political
1:01:55 how about the NOS I don't think Renwick
1:01:58 is a fan of rolands or anything part of
1:02:01 the Gemini league but he certainly isn't
1:02:04 a fan of our codery I'm hoping he's done
1:02:07 some research but my plan is to talk to
1:02:09 him afterwards I think if he's minable
1:02:13 he seems like an excellent scourge
1:02:16 that does leave clam bruja
1:02:19 I'd like to say that clam bruja has her
1:02:21 back but unfortunately I think you've
1:02:24 just got me Jane and unfortunately she's
1:02:27 in the hands of who knows what and
1:02:30 weathers whom if he's given lift the
1:02:33 rest of the domains still we'll be here
1:02:35 but I think he might as well be kind of
1:02:37 gone well I would like to get Jane back
1:02:40 and I've liked to put Jane into some
1:02:42 point on this court
1:02:45 I would check with Elsa but I'm not
1:02:48 opposed to her being essential and I
1:02:50 think it would go to some degree for
1:02:52 making the bruja feel better Jane is
1:02:55 Central China
1:02:57 I like Jane that would certainly be a
1:03:01 win for the bruja and I think she would
1:03:03 do very well but we will have to get her
1:03:05 back yeah
1:03:07 either way
1:03:09 calling the bruja together is going to
1:03:11 be a Make It or Break It moment for you
1:03:13 I think I was thinking about going the
1:03:15 shot method making sure they're taken
1:03:17 care of that's not a bad idea I need to
1:03:20 figure out a good way to do so but we
1:03:23 can call a rave I uh
1:03:26 it's
1:03:27 a bruja meeting kind of like a rant
1:03:30 but we're allowed to bring Outsiders
1:03:33 just because you've claimed Praxis
1:03:35 doesn't mean you can just show up
1:03:37 well I could certainly bring you I could
1:03:40 talk to
1:03:41 hell I don't know who to talk to maybe
1:03:44 yamara get her to bring somebody else if
1:03:48 weathers will pick up my call I can get
1:03:50 him to bring somebody but we could
1:03:53 we can jump on this try and make sure
1:03:57 that the domain is solid afterwards but
1:03:59 it's going to be a precarious situation
1:04:00 I expect it as much Pendragon could show
1:04:03 up and he's gonna have the ear of the
1:04:05 brujas and we better have some things to
1:04:07 give them whether that's status a
1:04:10 feeling of protection something sounds
1:04:14 good I mean I planned on trying to get
1:04:17 to the bruja back but also just to make
1:04:20 this domain better for all the Kindred
1:04:22 living here there certainly isn't as
1:04:24 many brujas there used to be but there's
1:04:26 enough that they are an element that I
1:04:29 think could secure your place as the new
1:04:32 Prince this is not where I wanted to be
1:04:35 at this time but here we are also
1:04:38 looking into what we can do to get this
1:04:40 uh Rave off the ground it won't be as
1:04:42 good as if Jane was around but I'll try
1:04:45 my best
1:04:46 at that point the door kind of creaks
1:04:48 open not as though it's she's trying to
1:04:51 sneak in but she's just moving a little
1:04:53 slower uh when walks in dripping wet
1:04:56 from the rain and she with one arm she's
1:05:00 clutching this Bank safety deposit box
1:05:03 to her chest and she doesn't meet either
1:05:06 of your eyes and she just shuts the door
1:05:07 behind her and walks in and perches I
1:05:10 guess on a table
1:05:11 um she doesn't choose a chair she sits
1:05:14 on the edge of a table and pulls her
1:05:15 knees up to her chest
1:05:17 it doesn't say anything miles looks over
1:05:20 at Johnny and then to win win gives a
1:05:23 pause she lets the silence sit for a
1:05:26 minute Johnny stands up goes walking
1:05:28 over to a a back closet behind where the
1:05:33 Baristas would make drinks in this
1:05:35 coffee shop because fishing around and
1:05:37 pulls out some bar towels comes walking
1:05:40 back over to where wind's perched up
1:05:42 sets him down next to her and offers her
1:05:45 a cigarette she doesn't really seem to
1:05:47 acknowledge that the towels are there
1:05:49 she takes a cigarette but she just kind
1:05:51 of folds it between her fingers
1:05:54 like magicians would do with a coin just
1:05:56 kind of dances it over her fingertips he
1:05:58 watches her do that for a second fishes
1:06:00 around in his pocket and pulls out a
1:06:02 Zippo he kind of just he doesn't
1:06:04 actually light it he just motions to see
1:06:07 if she wants a light almost on reflex
1:06:10 she'll reach out with the cigarette and
1:06:12 let him light it he does so I don't know
1:06:16 where to start
1:06:17 about what
1:06:19 I didn't mean to keep secrets
1:06:22 it's kind of part of the job it's kind
1:06:24 of part of the lifestyle Johnny you
1:06:27 should not be forgiving me right now
1:06:34 Johnny walks over to where the table is
1:06:37 with the ax takes off his jacket and
1:06:40 puts it on the the chair next to Miles
1:06:43 cracks his neck
1:06:45 folds his arms
1:06:47 and gives a look at win and says all
1:06:49 right get it off your head get it off
1:06:51 your mind what's up do you want me to
1:06:53 start with Neil or the the humans it's
1:06:57 Neil safe
1:06:58 I don't know probably not
1:07:03 Neil went after Britta
1:07:05 Johnny looks over at Miles he ashes is
1:07:09 the part of the cigarette out in
1:07:10 response and goes I hope it's not a
1:07:12 regrettable action in the end
1:07:14 Johnny nods at that and now you were
1:07:16 saying something about the humans
1:07:19 yeah which ones the ones whose house we
1:07:22 couldn't get into Johnny's or Johnny's
1:07:25 daughter and Joey's mom swore as a
1:07:27 Suarez group Ramirez what about him
1:07:31 Johnny you're gonna hit me at some point
1:07:34 do you want to do it now or do you want
1:07:35 to do it after
1:07:37 I don't like all of this
1:07:39 just uh
1:07:41 assumption
1:07:43 then I'm gonna do something stupid so
1:07:45 just out with it Ramirez came here and
1:07:48 talked to Britta and me
1:07:50 he wanted information about hell house
1:07:52 because they're going after it because
1:07:54 Joey's mom thinks it's what killed her
1:07:56 son and she needs Revenge
1:07:58 they are all going after it
1:08:02 hello house one two three odd Dentistry
1:08:05 where Vito kept that thing
1:08:07 yeah when did they tell you this before
1:08:11 we went after the Abbot earlier tonight
1:08:14 before that
1:08:16 and I took your choice from you Johnny
1:08:18 and I
1:08:20 [ __ ] robbed you of the opportunity to
1:08:22 have a father's rage
1:08:25 and it was a dick move
1:08:27 but I had one of two choices and I went
1:08:30 with one of them
1:08:31 how long ago did they say they were
1:08:33 going to do this less than a week
1:08:35 and I saw Ramirez he was doing
1:08:39 reconnaissance
1:08:40 they hadn't gone for it yet
1:08:45 I see
1:08:46 you can see that Johnny is his eyes are
1:08:49 darting back and forth and he's kind of
1:08:52 on edge his fingers are kind of
1:08:57 typing it something that's not there
1:09:01 he talks to Britta and I less than a
1:09:03 week ago about their plans
1:09:06 and Britta and I
1:09:07 Jesus Christ anything I say feels like
1:09:10 it's gonna be just [ __ ] patronizing
1:09:12 as [ __ ] they haven't gone yet I don't
1:09:15 think so
1:09:16 can you get in touch with them I can
1:09:18 call Ramirez
1:09:20 I'll give them a call I don't think you
1:09:23 should please don't take this from me as
1:09:26 well I will give them a call Miles you
1:09:30 need to let her know about everything
1:09:31 we're doing tonight plans on
1:09:34 for tomorrow and we're going to go in
1:09:37 tomorrow night correct that's correct
1:09:39 well more like the day after I'm looking
1:09:42 starts the day I gotta go make a phone
1:09:44 call Johnny heads to the back room
1:09:46 Johnny what's your [ __ ] goal he just
1:09:49 heads to the back room and doesn't
1:09:50 respond
1:09:53 God I wish he had [ __ ] hit me
1:09:55 you shouldn't have presented it to him
1:09:57 he might have just taken it then yeah I
1:09:59 have kept enough from him yeah no but
1:10:02 I'm just saying that anyways so how was
1:10:05 the rain wet where have you been
1:10:09 she kind of looks down at the box that
1:10:11 she's holding I had to get something
1:10:13 from my Haven
1:10:14 I don't think I can go back there
1:10:16 it's cordoned off Public Health I think
1:10:20 so much the mushrooms have grown [ __ ] we
1:10:23 can't kill them miles we need to figure
1:10:25 we need to focus on the things we can
1:10:26 change I know I'm just adding it to my
1:10:29 mental list of horrible things that
1:10:31 exist in our neighborhood that you know
1:10:33 about they've always existed miles well
1:10:36 that's why I have a list of the ones
1:10:37 that I know about
1:10:38 fair enough especially if we're talking
1:10:41 about the fact that this is soon going
1:10:43 to be a domain we're running [ __ ] said
1:10:46 what you were here for the Praxis
1:10:48 conversation earlier yeah I didn't think
1:10:50 you were serious what makes you think I
1:10:52 wouldn't be serious the part that you
1:10:55 were real keen on making sure that no
1:10:57 one took Praxis from Upton Rowlands yeah
1:11:01 well I have a different general orders
1:11:05 from my sire at this point not orders
1:11:08 he's I don't want to make a sense he has
1:11:10 given me a choice
1:11:12 an opt-in is not presented himself the
1:11:15 first part of the choice he's not been
1:11:16 able to
1:11:17 put himself together to get himself in
1:11:19 line
1:11:20 so if we don't do this these 12 princes
1:11:24 coming up here are going to run ramshot
1:11:27 all over this domain rough shot
1:11:31 read a book I've read a lot of books I'm
1:11:34 sure you have it's not been a while
1:11:37 so why are we poking at me right now I
1:11:39 don't know it's Instinct okay
1:11:41 so they're going to cause essentially a
1:11:44 civil war if they come up here and this
1:11:45 domain is not together it's not going to
1:11:48 be [ __ ] good why are they bringing
1:11:50 them here that's where they're bringing
1:11:52 him I'm assuming it's probably because
1:11:54 most of the rest of the east coast is
1:11:56 following yeah but there's like why not
1:11:58 send them to Maine let's keep them out
1:12:00 of Harm's Way have you been
1:12:02 yeah I have it's really nice no that's
1:12:05 probably why then have you ever eaten a
1:12:07 moose it's a really good meal I have not
1:12:10 look I I don't think y'all tastes run
1:12:13 parallel to the taste of most of the
1:12:15 princess yeah tell me something I don't
1:12:17 know okay well that's why we were
1:12:19 talking about why they wouldn't go to
1:12:20 Maine okay but they they're not princes
1:12:23 right now they're just people right
1:12:25 they're just displaced princes which
1:12:26 means they are people of power and
1:12:29 status and of most likely violence so
1:12:32 why would they send them to a domain
1:12:34 that is not stable or that is right in
1:12:37 the line of fire there's something else
1:12:39 going on I don't have all the
1:12:41 information it's compartmentalized oh
1:12:44 [ __ ] course it is okay I'm not that's
1:12:46 not a dig at you that's a dig it the
1:12:48 [ __ ] camarilla as a whole I get it
1:12:51 why are you I get that this is mildly
1:12:55 confusing but also we ended up on the
1:12:57 side of making sure the prince is safe
1:13:00 partially because his allies were Reiss
1:13:02 and [ __ ] Shaw now I have the image of
1:13:04 Rhys [ __ ] Shaw thank you for that
1:13:06 you're welcome my present to you thank
1:13:08 you for that
1:13:10 wind can't keep the smile from cracking
1:13:12 on her face at this point and she just
1:13:14 kind of finally having not made eyes at
1:13:17 anybody finally meets miles's eyes he's
1:13:20 still kind of relaxing on the table
1:13:22 there is definitely an energy and this
1:13:25 is mostly a projection we're doing this
1:13:27 for a lot of reasons do you want a
1:13:29 personal one or do you want a domain one
1:13:31 I don't need a reason miles you've said
1:13:33 that we need to take Praxis and I trust
1:13:35 you you're just questioning why the
1:13:37 change you [ __ ] met me I question
1:13:40 everything all right so we're doing I'm
1:13:42 a shitsterer
1:13:44 yup
1:13:45 thank you for not arguing that point
1:13:48 because I would
1:13:49 she I don't know I'm like a shitster
1:13:52 that you are I don't how much do you
1:13:55 want to know I want to know everything
1:13:57 do you want to know what's up with Neil
1:13:59 he decided that he could go after
1:14:00 brother because he thinks he can't get
1:14:02 caught he decided to go after Britta
1:14:04 because he's tired of not making a
1:14:06 choice and having bad things happen
1:14:07 anyway
1:14:08 I mean great making choices make bad
1:14:11 things happen too so I again I told him
1:14:14 but I think he needs this I and he's
1:14:19 probably not going to get caught and
1:14:21 he's got a cell phone so he's very
1:14:24 prepared
1:14:25 look I can't stop him my job isn't to
1:14:29 police you people in your actions as I
1:14:32 said before let's hope it doesn't become
1:14:35 regrettable because if it does I'm not
1:14:40 sure about my own response wind just
1:14:42 kind of shakes her head and shrugs and
1:14:44 just like I feel like that our nights
1:14:46 are increasingly losing control of who's
1:14:49 pointing what guns at people
1:14:52 I very rarely lose focus on the people
1:14:56 threatening those around me
1:14:58 I
1:15:00 should also I really wish Johnny hadn't
1:15:02 left
1:15:04 um Ramirez says that um some guy stormed
1:15:08 into the house and took Jane and it
1:15:10 really sounds like it was weathers I
1:15:12 mean that's fantastic news it is that's
1:15:14 why I kind of wish Johnny hadn't left I
1:15:16 probably should have led with that that
1:15:18 would have been a good one yeah can you
1:15:19 teach me how to talk to people better I
1:15:21 can
1:15:24 that would probably be for the best yeah
1:15:26 yeah I mean the [ __ ] primogen who
1:15:29 [ __ ] let that happen I mean Jesus
1:15:30 Christ well you killed the last one so
1:15:32 that's kind of how it happened he had it
1:15:34 coming well that's how you end up being
1:15:35 primogen so the biggest thing is uh just
1:15:39 take a second before you say things it's
1:15:41 like the biggest I don't follow yep
1:15:43 that's all you have to do just stop
1:15:44 think about what you're going to say
1:15:45 then say it doesn't feel right okay well
1:15:49 I can't teach you I'm gonna try and
1:15:51 internalize it miles but I'm just saying
1:15:53 my gut instinct which is to say anything
1:15:56 says that I should say that it doesn't
1:15:58 track all right I'm gonna say something
1:16:01 that sounds like again go pretty much
1:16:03 into me so I feel like you're on you're
1:16:04 doing fine
1:16:06 she kind of gives a slow nod with a
1:16:07 small smile I mean if you want to like
1:16:10 take someone by surprise you can change
1:16:11 it up but that's pretty much what people
1:16:13 expect out of a Gangrel primogen I'm not
1:16:16 sure people expect a Gangrel primogen in
1:16:17 these days we have one we do good bad or
1:16:20 indifferent so all right so let me fill
1:16:24 me in fill in the blanks I might ask
1:16:25 questions I might not great I'm going to
1:16:28 give you this is um mildly truncated to
1:16:30 get to the point
1:16:33 foreign
1:16:36 [Music]
1:16:38 you're alone in the back room he fishes
1:16:41 through his pockets and finds a little
1:16:42 notebook that he keeps for himself where
1:16:44 he writes down important details things
1:16:47 like phone numbers because normally he
1:16:49 can't remember that thing look at those
1:16:50 kind of things he flips through and
1:16:52 finds
1:16:53 Sheila's number
1:16:55 he sits down takes a moment to collect
1:16:57 himself while looking at the phone in
1:16:59 the back office
1:17:00 and dials the number for Sheila's phone
1:17:02 the phone rings
1:17:04 and rings and rings and rings and then

1:20:51 to take care of yourself all right all
1:20:53 right and she disconnects Johnny just
1:20:57 sits with the phone against his ear for
1:20:58 a while he feels his eyes welling up
1:21:01 with blood
1:21:02 he slowly and gently puts the phone back
1:21:06 down on his cradle
1:21:07 puts his head down on on the desk
1:21:11 and kind of just
1:21:13 breathes a shaky breath
1:21:15 and is unable to do so because he's just
1:21:18 racked with sobs
1:21:21 that just kind of drains blood onto the
1:21:24 table
1:21:25 and sits in the back room and until
1:21:27 somebody comes for him
1:21:32 [Music]
1:21:33 foreign
1:21:36 after she's done talking to Miles when
1:21:40 kind of makes her way in still holding
1:21:43 the box he sees Johnny falling apart
1:21:46 heads over and just kind of leans over
1:21:48 him and kind of wraps him up like a
1:21:51 mother bird wrapping something under her
1:21:53 wing
1:21:54 parenthood's a [ __ ] [ __ ] isn't it
1:21:57 shakes a little bit under her puts the
1:22:00 hands up and kind of just Taps her
1:22:01 gently and then sits up kind of
1:22:04 straightens out
1:22:05 he has these dried caked blood stains
1:22:10 running down his cheeks from where his
1:22:12 tear ducts are unable to function
1:22:15 camera gave me a way to protect my
1:22:18 family even through this curse
1:22:21 at least that's what I thought
1:22:23 the only reason I kept going night after
1:22:25 night was that I knew there were terrors
1:22:29 in the dark
1:22:31 and my family could run into them again
1:22:34 like I do
1:22:36 and when I tried to protect them it was
1:22:38 too heavy of a hand
1:22:41 Weathers
1:22:43 gave me the ability to protect them from
1:22:46 that distance and I still [ __ ] it up
1:22:49 she
1:22:51 is out there trying to do what everybody
1:22:55 should have done fight against evil
1:22:58 things in the world put things right
1:23:01 and I've distanced myself from her she
1:23:04 thinks
1:23:05 who knows what she thinks about me
1:23:07 she's terrified to even see me and I I
1:23:10 can't help her when
1:23:12 I'm a father that can't even see his
1:23:15 daughter and tell her that he's got her
1:23:18 back
1:23:19 ruined everything
1:23:22 when kind of
1:23:24 hugs him a little closer he wiggles away
1:23:27 and she kind of like pushes her off he
1:23:29 can't even bear to be touched by someone
1:23:31 right now she respects that Johnny is it
1:23:34 important that she knows no it's not
1:23:37 important that she knows it's important
1:23:39 she has her father
1:23:41 she does she doesn't
1:23:44 she's about to go off to fight whatever
1:23:47 the thing is that Vito brought to this
1:23:50 country whatever he and whenever he grew
1:23:54 in the basement of that place he's she's
1:23:56 gonna try and do something about it and
1:23:58 she's going to get herself killed how
1:24:00 much time does she have what's the
1:24:02 timeline did they give you any
1:24:03 indication no
1:24:05 okay
1:24:07 then here's what I'm gonna [ __ ] tell
1:24:08 you
1:24:09 we can't control what our kids do or who
1:24:12 they become
1:24:14 but the impact that we have on them they
1:24:17 will feel
1:24:20 and you had an impact my impact was to
1:24:24 abandon her
1:24:25 and your impact was to make her stronger
1:24:28 it's not just all bad [ __ ] Johnny
1:24:29 whatever she is now is at least in part
1:24:33 because of you she is a strong person
1:24:38 I killed a boy that she was interested
1:24:40 in because I thought he was putting the
1:24:42 moves on her never tell you that
1:24:45 I probably [ __ ] her up Good and Plenty
1:24:47 for that
1:24:49 probably made an impact
1:24:51 that's not the right kind of impact we
1:24:53 can't control that all the time
1:24:56 so we do the best we can to protect our
1:24:58 kids we didn't do the best we could I
1:25:01 could have done a million other things
1:25:03 when I have failed over and over and
1:25:07 over again
1:25:09 when I called Gene my wife to tell her
1:25:12 that I was still alive and that I needed
1:25:15 her to get out of town I lied to her and
1:25:18 said I was gonna meet her on the
1:25:19 outskirts and I didn't I just ran away
1:25:21 again I have consistently failed this
1:25:25 family I thought the camarilla was going
1:25:28 to do the right things for them and you
1:25:30 know what that was probably a failure as
1:25:32 well
1:25:33 and now I am reaping what I have sown
1:25:36 and this girl is going to go to that
1:25:38 house she is going to get herself killed
1:25:40 and I'm not there I then let's [ __ ]
1:25:43 be there
1:25:44 I can't just wait outside for her
1:25:46 the thing that I am now
1:25:49 what if she goes during the day
1:25:51 who knows when it's gonna be
1:25:54 I could sit there every night
1:25:57 but I'm not sure sitting outside that
1:25:59 place would be good for me
1:26:02 they brought up a point this place
1:26:04 is some kind of curse it co-ops things
1:26:08 how the weeding bear left the stain
1:26:10 that's that that won't go away nope if I
1:26:13 just sit outside that place maybe when
1:26:15 she finally does come there I won't be
1:26:18 able to actually help her
1:26:22 aside from that
1:26:24 I've made my bed in the camarilla
1:26:27 and there are things that I've promised
1:26:30 I have to have miles back
1:26:32 I called Sheila and let her know that
1:26:35 whatever they need from me I'll I'll do
1:26:38 it but they
1:26:40 I gotta wait for them to make them the
1:26:42 call
1:26:43 hopefully Jessica will
1:26:47 want to reach out
1:26:48 for what it's worth Johnny I don't think
1:26:50 it's a matter of whether she wants to or
1:26:52 not she made that clear she reached out
1:26:54 it's whether she thinks she should at
1:26:57 this point
1:27:00 and for what it's worth Ramirez I told
1:27:03 him call if they run into trouble
1:27:06 so they've got two means of getting in
1:27:07 touch with us
1:27:09 why did all this happen when
1:27:12 Neil's guys
1:27:15 weird conspiracy malkavian nonsense they
1:27:19 don't he says they don't have strings
1:27:21 I don't know what the [ __ ] that means
1:27:24 he feels like he sees Under the Hood
1:27:26 under the veil of whatever but I think
1:27:29 he's blinded by other
1:27:31 nonsense
1:27:33 what is this group of people
1:27:36 according to Ramirez they're just people
1:27:38 that's not true I don't think it is
1:27:40 either but I don't think they know
1:27:42 I know that according to Neil it's the
1:27:46 end times I know the sixth great
1:27:47 Maelstrom is coming and the shadowlands
1:27:49 is going to be wiped away
1:27:51 and I think in a time when so many
1:27:54 things are ending something new has
1:27:56 cropped up and there is a single light
1:28:00 in this darkness and I think we have to
1:28:03 put our trust into that [ __ ] though
1:28:05 it may be
1:28:06 you know what I think yeah I think this
1:28:09 is us reading what we've sown
1:28:11 don't ascribe morality to this [ __ ]
1:28:14 Johnny it's not [ __ ]
1:28:16 you didn't choose this
1:28:19 I didn't choose this Choice isn't isn't
1:28:24 this choice is abandoning families
1:28:29 choice is
1:28:33 you see him kind of have a angry and
1:28:37 mournful look in his eye
1:28:39 and he is unable to finish his thought
1:28:43 but his fangs are bared Johnny do you
1:28:47 want to go hunting or do you want to go
1:28:48 to that [ __ ] bar that I found you
1:28:50 out and drink them out of tequila
1:28:52 or do you want to hit me
1:28:54 something
1:28:55 tell me how to help you right now
1:28:59 I think and you walk me home let's go
1:29:01 two miles I'm gonna listen to records
1:29:04 go to sleep and I'll be ready to stand
1:29:07 by his side when he kills [ __ ] and
1:29:09 Rowlands tomorrow night yeah from around
1:29:11 the door frame see you tomorrow night
1:29:14 I don't think I need to Johnny looks up
1:29:16 over at Miles he's not visible no it's
1:29:19 like from around the door frame meaning
1:29:21 that Mouse have been listening Johnny
1:29:23 looks up towards the door frame and
1:29:25 smiles and nods even though miles can't
1:29:28 see that Johnny slowly shakily stands up
1:29:33 when reaches out a hand to kind of like
1:29:35 take his to help him up she still has an
1:29:38 arm around the Box
1:29:39 he looks in the Box
1:29:41 looks over at her
1:29:43 I'll be good making at home and don't
1:29:45 you say a goddamn word about the body
1:29:48 system well then I'm gonna say that I'm
1:29:51 just happy to be going in the same
1:29:53 direction
1:29:54 you stay with Miles and get things
1:29:56 worked out with chaps for tomorrow I'll
1:29:59 be all right let me know when you
1:30:01 believe that
1:30:02 Johnny
1:30:04 Pat's one on the shoulder and heads out
1:30:06 the door and walks back to his Haven
1:30:13 [Music]
1:30:17 Neil as you know a lot has been going on
1:30:20 particularly with members of your
1:30:22 cautery being off and separate from the
1:30:24 group so why don't we go over your plan
1:30:27 of action and we'll make the rules for
1:30:29 it and I'll walk you through the details
1:30:31 of the information that you glean from
1:30:32 it so Neil has a quick thought a little
1:30:35 guiltily after he leaves win uh after
1:30:38 they had their moment walking back into
1:30:40 the city that he was the one most
1:30:42 recently being like hey nobody goes off
1:30:44 anywhere alone as he goes off somewhere
1:30:46 alone steps back into the Shadows into
1:30:48 an alley and the first thing he's going
1:30:51 to do is pull one of his remaining
1:30:53 ribbons out of his little Sorcerers
1:30:55 fanny pack and because he is fully aware
1:30:58 of who Britta is and where she was he's
1:31:01 going to light up sort of starting at
1:31:04 her Haven because that's where we last
1:31:07 know she definitely was and follow the
1:31:10 trail where she would have been gone on
1:31:12 foot until either he loses the trail or
1:31:15 she starts moving moving too fast for
1:31:17 him to to follow and just try and find
1:31:20 the point where she starts speeding away
1:31:21 because whether she celerated or got
1:31:25 into a car like that would have
1:31:26 triggered that would have been triggered
1:31:27 by something and then he'll look around
1:31:29 for more clues once he gets to uh like a
1:31:31 break point if he's lucky he'll just
1:31:33 walk under but he does not think he's
1:31:36 gonna get that lucky go ahead and give
1:31:37 me the rule for the casting and we will
1:31:40 begin there
1:31:41 uh success okay you're tracking leads
1:31:45 you to Downtown New Haven when you get
1:31:48 there you find yourself arriving to a
1:31:51 spot that's like right out on the curb
1:31:53 kind of giving you the impression that
1:31:55 from here she probably got into a car so
1:31:58 he sees the the Smoky line in front of
1:32:00 him and just follows it the trail brings
1:32:02 you to that point and then to that point
1:32:04 and then it sort of goes straight in a
1:32:06 direction down the street exactly okay
1:32:08 looking at the point where obviously she
1:32:10 you know where where it stops being sort
1:32:12 of uh me and the natural Meandering gate
1:32:14 of somebody who's walking even if
1:32:16 they're walking with purpose and into a
1:32:17 straight line following the streets it's
1:32:19 been cold in a little rainy if I
1:32:21 remember right and yeah we're into early
1:32:23 spring so there are there any like
1:32:25 little puddles of water around on the
1:32:27 ground uh things like that yeah why
1:32:28 don't you roll me a d10 sure on Main
1:32:31 Plus or higher there's a there's a
1:32:32 puddle okay okay you actually do find a
1:32:35 puddle it's like right in that like
1:32:36 gutter like a clogged up spot and it's
1:32:39 right by where apparently the car had
1:32:41 takes off from Neil will then I guess
1:32:44 look over and just sort of stare down in
1:32:47 the puddle you can kind of hear people
1:32:48 murmur like a weirdo and they like walk
1:32:50 by yeah he's not good enough at
1:32:52 obviously to have people like walk
1:32:53 around him or that so he's just standing
1:32:55 there like a weirdo in the street
1:32:56 smelling vaguely of you know burnt cloth
1:33:00 and uh staring into a puddle in the
1:33:02 gutter and we'll try and open up his
1:33:06 size uh to see what the what information
1:33:09 the Covenant of enki will will ring
1:33:11 hopefully this puddle has been there
1:33:12 since she left go for it
1:33:15 three successes so three successes does
1:33:18 the trick and you will actually see that
1:33:21 Britta kind of approaches where there's a
1:33:24 limo waiting in this spot and when she
1:33:27 gets to the limo the door opens and she
1:33:30 visibly becomes very like nervous and
1:33:35 suddenly careful about her body language
1:33:38 and then she's drawn inside and from
1:33:41 like the oddest angle while kind of like
1:33:43 leaning around you can see the ice cold
1:33:46 eyes of Roman Pendragon kind of like in
1:33:48 the dark of the limo neol breathes out
1:33:51 in a sigh you know they they had talked
1:33:54 about you know Pendragon being a a maybe
1:33:56 right especially when it was leading
1:33:58 away and like towards a car area for a
1:34:01 moment when he saw it was a limo he was
1:34:03 like oh no it's rolling it's like
1:34:04 Rowlands has summoned her this is it this
1:34:07 is the blood Bond getting confirmation
1:34:09 that it was Roman Pendragon is both a
1:34:12 relief but also makes him very nervous
1:34:16 the direction that the the trail was
1:34:18 going and like watching as the car pulls
1:34:20 off to get the impression that he's
1:34:22 probably heading back out of the city
1:34:23 yeah they're definitely heading to skip
1:34:26 town so there's a few places he would
1:34:28 probably bring her it's been a long
1:34:30 night already morning is not that it's
1:34:32 just a couple hours off at this point
1:34:34 right right which means he's not going
1:34:36 anywhere too far like he's probably not
1:34:38 making a trip to Boston although uh this
1:34:39 is a limo the windows in the back did it
1:34:41 look fully blacked out like this is a
1:34:44 vampire travel car or was this they were
1:34:47 tinted uh whether or not that's like
1:34:49 safe for a kindred to travel in uh
1:34:52 you're not sure okay well Neil mutter to
1:34:54 himself like I gotta I Gotta Have a
1:34:57 Little Faith here like if he if he has a
1:34:59 car for travel then
1:35:01 it could be anywhere but for now
1:35:04 there's only a few places you could go I
1:35:06 wonder I need a thought Pendragon is
1:35:09 part of operation Longbow along with the
1:35:11 Nosferatu and the malkavians the three
1:35:14 pillars of operation Longbow yep Neil is
1:35:17 a friend to the Nosferatu because he
1:35:18 helped them sort of establish the web in
1:35:21 the area and do that kind of stuff and
1:35:22 so if anybody in the area would know
1:35:24 without having to delve into like Mystic
1:35:27 nonsense and and all that kind of stuff
1:35:28 sometimes doing things the old-fashioned
1:35:30 way as Johnny puts it actually does
1:35:32 yield pretty good results so he will
1:35:35 pull his phone out of his pocket and
1:35:37 text his buddy Fester hey where you at
1:35:40 your phone rings and Neil will pick it
1:35:42 up hey man hey uh how you doing Neil
1:35:46 yeah it's uh how I'm

1:37:22 sustenance for uh highly valuable Elders
1:37:25 are going to be brought in you know with
1:37:27 the kala and the chain and my job is to
1:37:30 bring them over to the Elder who would
1:37:31 like to feed and present them with the
1:37:33 mortal and then they feed and then I
1:37:35 take the mortar back that's uh pretty a
1:37:37 lot of responsibility though especially
1:37:39 if people have feeding restrictions and
1:37:41 things like that to know about wait what
1:37:43 look at the bedroom oh no you got like

1:45:15 though we're not gonna you're not gonna

1:45:26 I'll try my best
1:45:27 hangs up Neil just stands on the corner
1:45:30 for a minute
1:45:34 no miles is already mad at me
1:45:36 and
1:45:38 then Flags a cab cab comes to take you
1:45:41 away so uh hey hey Tim Neil is known
1:45:45 miles for a long time and he's like one
1:45:47 of those weirdo perceptive dudes what
1:45:50 are the chances that he knows who miles
1:45:53 as Taylor is well you met the most
1:45:56 public one his name was Marcos
1:45:58 um
1:45:58 [Music]
1:46:08 so after that probably you wouldn't know
1:46:11 anybody else yeah that makes sense
1:46:14 Neil's size in the back of the cab and
1:46:17 busts off a quick text to miles even
1:46:21 though he did not want to have to
1:46:22 contact miles with a SOS
1:46:27 who's your tailor your phone will ring
1:46:30 after like five minutes
1:46:32 oh uh Hey man uh very clearly in like a
1:46:36 car somewhere uh I I didn't expect you
1:46:39 to call back just just a quick answer
1:46:41 was fine no that these things are not a
1:46:43 quick answer kind of deal well I just
1:46:45 wanted to know where you you got your
1:46:47 suits
1:46:49 um
1:46:51 I'm looking for fashion advice miles I
1:46:52 get that
1:46:53 um the person is unable to do that
1:46:56 anymore I'm sorry to hear that right so
1:47:00 what kind of occasion are you looking at
1:47:02 formal super formal formal but like for
1:47:05 yourself like hot formal and I need it

1:47:13 formal but deliberately sexy it's good
1:47:15 to know I have a different guy for that
1:47:16 oh okay yes uh um can I I'll pay instead
1:47:21 obviously it's not a worry
1:47:24 you need to be careful though all right
1:47:26 yes I am very very aware of yes I know
1:47:30 all right um also you know are you okay
1:47:33 you sound distracted is everything all
1:47:34 right things are happening and I am
1:47:37 distracted okay that's fine I I won't
1:47:38 take up any more of your time but I
1:47:40 assumed this was important because you
1:47:41 probably wouldn't have messaged me
1:47:42 otherwise that's why I said SOS yeah
1:47:44 that's I mean sure I know I've done that
1:47:47 before and it wasn't as important but I
1:47:48 this is actually yes I mean it's not the
1:47:51 Navy so uh well the problem is like
1:47:53 ordinarily a pseudo just look around or
1:47:55 whatever but I I know stop

1:48:50 anything stupid fur yeah
1:48:53 yeah we have glossed over that oh
1:48:56 there's nothing to indeed to the Spy
1:48:57 mask
1:49:00 uh and Neil will go to the address
1:49:02 provided by Miles
1:49:04 so that fussy Grant can hook him up with
1:49:07 a sexy outfit for tomorrow
1:49:13 [Music]
1:49:17 miles Dawn is coming and it's time to
1:49:20 enact your plan all right what do you do
1:49:23 so first we got to make sure the
1:49:25 conditioning is in place
1:49:27 okay give me a roll remember that
1:49:29 because Neil performed his magic here at
1:49:31 minus seven difficulty yes I have a
1:49:33 picture of Rowlands which is giving me a
1:49:35 huge bonus buff bump is that not the
1:49:39 lowest than that the difficulty can be
1:49:41 made three right it brings it down to
1:49:43 the minimum woof which I think is two
1:49:45 right yeah anything about a one target
1:49:48 difficulty two current willpower
1:49:52 it's a two-hander I see it's a two-hand
1:49:54 job nine okay let's see pliable not what
1:50:00 we've been doing this overnight yes so
1:50:01 you will give me a roll for the previous
1:50:03 night okay and that should get us to
1:50:05 about where things actually are
1:50:09 seven successes okay uh he is bent to
1:50:13 your will all right now it is possession
1:50:15 so I believe the rules for this is I'm
1:50:18 spending it will power and I am draining
1:50:20 his very small amounts of willpower
1:50:25 so every dice is a success
1:50:26 so that is six eight ten successes oh my
1:50:31 God
1:50:32 you have possessed him with 10 successes
1:50:35 and I now look over at my other body
1:50:40 which is sort of asleep and kind of flex
1:50:43 around and mess get used to this one
1:50:45 while I put my other body on a like a
1:50:49 bed or something like that nearby that I
1:50:50 prepared and then grab my equipment
1:50:53 on my jacket and deck myself out like
1:50:55 miles but in this larger beefier ghoul
1:50:58 suit and I go upstairs and I go outside
1:51:01 to meet chaps all right the feral
1:51:04 mongrel
1:51:05 fisher cat is waiting for you so wind
1:51:08 has definitely prefaced this with like
1:51:10 okay I told him what to do please make
1:51:13 sure Animal Control doesn't get a hold
1:51:14 of him they will kill him if they can I
1:51:18 proceed up my stairs
1:51:20 from my Haven that I've not been in a
1:51:25 ton I've been happening elsewhere but
1:51:27 this is where I'm maintaining all of the
1:51:28 princess schools more or less and I can
1:51:31 clear the stairs and I see the upstairs
1:51:34 for the first time in daylight and um
1:51:38 it's weird there comes a moment where
1:51:41 your Beast begs you to flee back
1:51:44 downstairs but the natural lighting of
1:51:46 the room it almost takes a moment for
1:51:48 you to realize that it is isn't going to
1:51:50 destroy you and as you approach the door
1:51:53 your Beast kind of trembles and rattles
1:51:57 in its cage but when you open the door
1:51:59 there's that Bright Morning Light
1:52:02 washing over you and you can feel its
1:52:05 warmth for the first time in a long time
1:52:08 also I'm like breathing and maybe
1:52:12 sweating a little bit it's very weird
1:52:14 you feel human you just don't quite feel
1:52:16 like you yeah it's been a while so I
1:52:19 look up at the sun like directly
1:52:22 and squint and then I checked to see if
1:52:24 I've got another passenger you feel
1:52:27 there is no Dark Passenger with you
1:52:32 all right I kind of it's weirdly quiet
1:52:35 no sense of Presence by myself it's very
1:52:38 weird
1:52:42 it take a second like pop the katana out
1:52:44 of its sheath a little bit put it back
1:52:45 just kind of a habit then I call for
1:52:48 chaps this monstrous little thing
1:52:51 approaches you the fisher cat kind of
1:52:54 makes this like Eerie sound when it
1:52:56 stares up at you I'm pretty much ready
1:52:58 to engage in some violence ready to help
1:53:01 out caps it makes a terrible fish or cat
1:53:03 noise oh I'll take that as he has I mean
1:53:06 I'm using animals yes kale well I'm hope
1:53:10 you know what sure
1:53:12 yeah all right I'm gonna open this door
1:53:16 and you jump in the Blazer here
1:53:19 yes so we uh go over to the Blazer load
1:53:22 them in he hops right in yeah circles
1:53:25 around a few times putting the katana in
1:53:28 its holder behind me oh it's a Blazer
1:53:30 who doesn't have that one
1:53:31 yeah I did whatever and then uh
1:53:34 I I don't know I put my hands on the
1:53:37 steering wheel just it's all odd it
1:53:39 feels cool yeah
1:53:42 to the touch and when your hands kind of
1:53:45 like tighten on it for just a moment you
1:53:47 can feel the surge of potence that your
1:53:50 ghoul has that's right not just a normal
1:53:53 human and let's go leave out at what
1:53:55 like
1:53:56 5 a.m 6 a.m 5 or 6 a.m I don't know
1:54:00 whenever sun rises at sometime in March
1:54:03 and go towards the Haven of Upton
1:54:06 Rowlands you arrive to A Beautiful
1:54:10 Victorian home and it seems kind of
1:54:14 sparse in terms of security most of his
1:54:17 goals were sent away
1:54:19 and he's largely been hiding by himself
1:54:22 and does he have like a gate or whatever
1:54:24 it is probably separating him so people
1:54:26 can't just drive right in it is gated
1:54:28 yes so I'll go up and input the codes
1:54:31 that I should have been able to get from
1:54:33 people and
1:54:34 drive right up to his almost unsecured
1:54:37 compound to me there's a buzz sound
1:54:39 gates open the Blazer pulls right in
1:54:42 everything continues going according to
1:54:44 plan I get out I open the door for the
1:54:47 fisher cat and grab a bag that was
1:54:49 prepared the night before which the
1:54:51 fisher cat hops out ready for violence
1:54:53 remember chaps no attacking unless I say
1:54:56 so then say so
1:54:58 I'll let you know
1:55:01 and I pull out a bag with a couple
1:55:03 steaks a hammer
1:55:05 submachine gun then my Katana and uh I
1:55:08 strap on some body armor just in case
1:55:10 I'm going inside probably some sort of
1:55:13 side door or whatever you enter in the
1:55:15 key code open the door you head inside
1:55:17 and wearing like pajama pants is this
1:55:21 young man with frosted tips the like
1:55:25 little V shape up at his hips and he
1:55:29 turns and His Hands there's this like
1:55:31 plate of like eggs and uh breakfast
1:55:35 sausage uh hello hi welcome directly in
1:55:39 the eyes and go still roll and the
1:55:41 difficulty of this role is too
1:55:43 [Laughter]
1:55:45 that would be eight successes okay uh he
1:55:48 freezes and plays staring at you
1:55:49 wide-eyed and Afraid dropping his plate
1:55:52 of eggs I go over and I start the
1:55:55 process of uh mesmerizing him listen to
1:55:58 my voice fall deeply into this Samba
1:56:01 sleep thing and as I go through the road
1:56:02 practice I will
1:56:04 attempt to Mesmerize him what are you
1:56:07 telling him to do I want him to until uh
1:56:13 night falls I would like him to uh stay
1:56:16 in this kitchen and not move okay is
1:56:18 this a ghoul in the
1:56:20 it is not a ghoul okay
1:56:24 six successes you crush his will and uh
1:56:28 you remains still giving the impression
1:56:29 that he is going to continue doing so
1:56:31 and I pick up the bag give him
1:56:35 a light tap on the shoulder and I
1:56:37 started moving towards where I know
1:56:39 Roland savings or sleeps you had him
1:56:42 upstairs and there is this big room
1:56:46 double doors the doors are locked it
1:56:48 looks like they are locked with
1:56:49 something I would use like a skeleton
1:56:51 key or something like that do I know
1:56:53 where what is usually contained around
1:56:55 here or yes you do all right I will take
1:56:58 care of that and uh bust my way through
1:57:00 by opening the lock gently hear the
1:57:02 click and the doors open
1:57:06 and you enter and the entire room is
1:57:09 protected from sunlight huge thick drawn
1:57:13 curtains kind of block everything and in
1:57:16 the room on this massive bed made very
1:57:21 comfortable is Upton Rowlands who seems
1:57:25 like he is just fast asleep under the
1:57:27 blankets
1:57:32 I take a breath
1:57:35 breathe it out and move towards the body
1:57:38 turning on the light switch so I can see
1:57:40 in here with a click you flip on the
1:57:42 light switch and
1:57:45 do I roll for something
1:57:51 there's almost the faintest stir that
1:57:54 comes from Upton when the light switch
1:57:56 turns on
1:57:57 but he does not wake as he was twitching
1:58:01 I slowly lowered the bag down and put my
1:58:03 hand on the katana just and waited
1:58:05 minutes pass in total silence
1:58:08 and you become certain knee is not
1:58:10 awakened
1:58:12 and
1:58:13 pull out from the bag
1:58:16 a hammer
1:58:17 and two steaks
1:58:19 grabbing one tucking it behind my belt
1:58:21 the other one in hand and
1:58:25 I go next to the bed where Rowlands is at
1:58:27 you go next to the bed the point of the
1:58:30 stake
1:58:31 presses to his chest
1:58:34 take my time
1:58:36 line it up
1:58:37 get the hammer ready
1:58:39 stake his dead ass with the hammer
1:58:42 raised
1:58:43 often's eyes flash open as he's attacked
1:58:45 the wolves
1:58:55 brother you awake from your cold Day
1:58:58 Slumber anxious with your Beast begging
1:59:01 you to do something and you feel this
1:59:05 Guillotine coming down around the neck
1:59:07 of Upton as the blood Bond pulls you and
1:59:11 your body reacts before you can really
1:59:14 even think to process what's happening
1:59:16 and you let out a scream
1:59:19 is the sound of a lock and the door
1:59:21 bursts open and entering or four men who
1:59:25 sweep the room with assault rifles black
1:59:28 uniforms and body armor and there's this
1:59:32 pause when they see you awake during the
1:59:36 day letting out the scream and with this
1:59:39 sudden wisp of air kind of like flowing
1:59:43 through the room abruptly like a gust of
1:59:45 wind Roman Pendragon is there dressing
1:59:48 kind of like a like a loose white
1:59:50 obviously kind of like a blouse and like
1:59:53 these pants that kind of come down just
1:59:54 like past his knee like he looks like
1:59:56 he's dressed for like centuries ago and
2:00:00 sort of gives this judgmental pause
2:00:04 looking over you in the bed Bretta is
2:00:07 not concentrated on that her attention
2:00:09 is on the strange men with the guns
2:00:12 Stand Down leave us they immediately
2:00:16 comply exit in the room to return to
2:00:18 their guard shift if the door is shut
2:00:20 and it's the two of you
2:00:22 as she turns from the men with the guns
2:00:26 and redisters the look on roman
2:00:29 pendrachen's face and the fact that her
2:00:32 chest is still rising and falling after
2:00:34 she took in air after that scream and
2:00:37 she can still feel the way that
2:00:39 nightmare or premonition or whatever it
2:00:41 was made her feel she looks at Roman
2:00:43 pentrakin and she says I
2:00:46 some kind of nightmare I don't have
2:00:49 those that something's happening his
2:00:51 eyes narrow slightly
2:00:54 you sense death
2:00:56 I it felt like that I
2:01:01 death under those circumstances
2:01:05 whether you bound so tightly
2:01:08 it is a sign of coming freedom
2:01:11 Freedom child I have felt as you feel
2:01:15 loss of one you are so deeply bound to
2:01:20 and that first it was frightening
2:01:23 you think that's something he's gonna
2:01:26 die
2:01:28 I
2:01:29 it is likely he is already dead whoever
2:01:32 he is
2:01:33 I I can't let that happen I I can't
2:01:38 have to
2:01:40 have to go to New Haven I'm sorry I he
2:01:43 turns behind him and just locks the door
2:01:46 wait and I run to try to try the door uh
2:01:50 jostling it I am sure that's not going
2:01:52 to the very with like the slightest
2:01:55 touch you were tossed back onto the bed
2:01:56 oh the doors very locked
2:02:04 because like there's just you think it
2:02:06 might have been potency but not you've
2:02:08 never seen it used like that or
2:02:10 literally just the slightest contact
2:02:12 against you sent a kinetic wave through
2:02:14 your entire body and just tossed you
2:02:16 back Britta is entirely stunned by that
2:02:19 and the tears are already welling up at
2:02:21 this point I felt this when my Sawyer
2:02:24 died
2:02:25 when I was freed of her
2:02:28 you are lucky it's come so soon
2:02:31 I try and thinking of being free I there
2:02:34 was a part of me that I know what's that
2:02:36 bad I don't every time I think like that
2:02:38 it feels like I'm betraying myself and I
2:02:41 that is the weakness of you
2:02:43 I I need to go help him I
2:02:48 lay down close your eyes
2:02:51 for night
2:02:54 tears run hot and fast her face going
2:02:58 red quickly he kind of sits down at the
2:03:01 edge of the bed and waits for day to
2:03:03 take you there's a glance at the window
2:03:06 the curtains and the way that he sat
2:03:08 down and Greta realizes that there's no
2:03:11 way that she's getting out
2:03:14 she wipes the forearm of her glove to
2:03:17 try to get some of the blood off her
2:03:19 face but that's a lost cause at this
2:03:20 point and
2:03:22 slowly forces herself to walk towards
2:03:25 the bed and towards Roman pendrachen
2:03:28 again once on the bed and once things
2:03:30 have quieted down enough you feel day
2:03:32 and fall asleep
2:03:35 [Music]
2:03:41 make your roll
2:03:43 oh boy
2:03:48 foreign
2:03:50 successes three successes will carry
2:03:53 over into bonus dice because you're
2:03:55 using the hammer you may enjoy an
2:03:57 additional two dice of damage are ghouls
2:03:59 allowed to spend blood for potents if
2:04:02 they have potency yeah yep yeah how many
2:04:05 levels opponents do you have I'm about
2:04:06 to ask uh uh how many levels have I got
2:04:09 ghoul has three levels of potence and
2:04:12 two levels of fortitude I really hope
2:04:14 that second part doesn't come into
2:04:15 effect I'm gonna spend for automatic
2:04:16 successes on the potents
2:04:19 foreign
2:04:21 successes okay
2:04:25 five successes carried through he has
2:04:27 staked
2:04:29 oh not a small dice pool either
2:04:34 so after the first one then I
2:04:37 immediately grabbed the other stake and
2:04:39 I'm just like watching he just stares up
2:04:42 at you unblinking Frozen in Terror at
2:04:46 the realization that you were the wolf
2:04:49 all along
2:04:51 well gonna take one of those pillows and
2:04:54 put it over his face so I don't have to
2:04:55 look at that because I not particularly
2:04:57 feeling like more guilty right now okay
2:05:00 you cover his face with a pillow yeah
2:05:03 it's just the two of you alone
2:05:05 chaps yeah the little thing comes in is
2:05:09 there anybody else in this house besides

2:09:05 back to your Haven and when you get
2:09:08 there

2:09:12 ashes on your front steps I grab my bag
2:09:16 and the now Placid gentlemen and head
2:09:21 inside
2:09:22 when you get inside you find yourself
2:09:26 moving for where you had left your body
2:09:28 and when you get there you find yourself
2:09:32 sitting in a seat slumped to the side
2:09:36 unconscious and on the small table that
2:09:39 sits before this your chair are two
2:09:43 glasses a bottle of whiskey one glass is
2:09:46 full and the other recently emptied
2:09:51 I put the Placid made in one of the
2:09:54 spare rooms and close it and then I go
2:09:56 back take the whiskey look at it down it
2:10:00 okay can I just narrate that both
2:10:02 Garrett and Erica in unison put their
2:10:04 hands over their face
2:10:06 you can narrate such
2:10:09 in the ghoul suit it tastes amazing and
2:10:12 you don't throw up you're not poisoned
2:10:15 it just tastes like
2:10:17 Victory I clink it with The Empty Glass
2:10:23 and lie down in this suit
2:10:27 and transfer myself back to my body once
2:10:29 you make it back to your body the day
2:10:31 takes you
2:10:36 [Music]
2:10:41 the following Night Comes
2:10:43 and Roman
2:10:45 despite his presence
2:10:47 in your bed when you fell asleep during
2:10:50 the day
2:10:51 is not here
2:10:54 instead
2:10:55 his ghoul your caretaker is waiting for
2:11:00 you by the mirror having seemingly
2:11:02 watched you awake with a great deal of
2:11:06 high-end makeup repaired and as you kind
2:11:10 of come to rising from your dreamless
2:11:13 sleep she gives us like cough to alert
2:11:17 to alarm you of her presence I am
2:11:20 instructed to ensure that you look
2:11:22 perfect
2:11:23 brother as she's coming to Consciousness
2:11:25 is immediately looking around the room
2:11:28 she's not entirely certain if she's
2:11:31 going to be waking up with someone in
2:11:33 the room or not and her eyes land on
2:11:35 Maria the makeup everything laid out
2:11:37 she's really not all that comfortable
2:11:39 waking up and seeing someone but she
2:11:41 seems a bit
2:11:43 she's she latches on to the fact that
2:11:45 it's Maria and she she gets up and walks
2:11:48 over to the mirror to the makeup
2:11:51 um thank you for the help of course
2:11:54 whatever he wants she teases her hair a
2:11:57 moment and kind of tosses to the side
2:11:59 and presents to you her neck there's a
2:12:01 hesitation from Bretta but she does lean
2:12:05 over and as gently as she can she'll
2:12:08 take one tray to blood
2:12:10 she fixes her hair stands straight Britta
2:12:13 make sure to lick the wound
2:12:15 um thanks again are you ready to begin
2:12:18 um yes
2:12:19 um and with that Britta goes and lays out
2:12:22 the various accessories that she had
2:12:25 remembered it's clear that she had in
2:12:28 the background of all the chaos of this
2:12:30 interaction sort of come up with a game
2:12:31 plan uh for what she would be choosing
2:12:34 and by the mirror she sets a couple
2:12:37 objects she picks out some jewelry she
2:12:40 seems to be going for delicacy rather
2:12:44 than ornate appeal internally she's
2:12:46 picked what she's picked because wearing
2:12:50 gold reminds her it just makes her feel
2:12:53 a little less far from when than the
2:12:55 silver options she gathers what she
2:12:57 needs or well it's all really there the
2:12:59 maid is so prepared but she makes sure
2:13:01 that there is a pair of Opera length
2:13:04 velvet gloves that she found in the
2:13:06 accessories and on the ground she'll set
2:13:09 what looked to be a pair of satin black
2:13:12 red bottomed stilettos looking at the
2:13:14 makeup Britta has the instinct to start
2:13:16 doing it herself but she's not certain
2:13:18 if the maid has been instructed to do it
2:13:20 for her Maria physically interjects
2:13:22 simply Focus your eyes in the mirror and
2:13:25 I will take care of the rest got it um
2:13:27 thank you
2:13:32 [Music]
2:13:36 and we shift to the New Haven
2:13:38 Underground where there is the steady
2:13:40 grip of water from the surface but is
2:13:43 otherwise clean the passageways through
2:13:46 our a bit low in terms of sealing and
2:13:49 tight in terms of space but eventually
2:13:51 Neil knowing his way around finds an
2:13:55 open chamber that is well hidden away
2:13:57 belonging to his dear friend before Neil
2:14:00 can even knock there's a soft Buzz that
2:14:03 comes from the other side a locking
2:14:05 mechanism is undone and fester opens the
2:14:08 door hey buddy true to his word Neil is
2:14:11 carrying in his arms a closed and sealed
2:14:14 suit bag from Grant from the night

2:14:22 that Miles got for him in Boston with no
2:14:26 tie or anything and a few buttons of the
2:14:29 white shirt undone down to like just a
2:14:32 few of the top buttons undone he has
2:14:34 eyeliner on uh looks like he actually

2:14:41 his dark hair is like I don't know oiled
2:14:43 or greased or something and is just

2:14:58 few modifications in mind uh you're off

2:15:54 together and even though they look like
2:15:56 you know relatively normal hands there's
2:15:58 you can't help but notice this wet sound
2:16:01 when he does it and then overly giddy he
2:16:05 pulls you in front of a mirror and sets
2:16:07 about beginning your makeup
2:16:11 [Music]
2:16:13 foreign
2:16:15 Night Comes you wake and you are alone
2:16:19 in your body
2:16:22 that's still weird
2:16:24 I reach over and uh speed dial Johnny's
2:16:28 beeper after a few minutes of waiting
2:16:30 the phone in your Parlor Room rings I'm
2:16:34 fully dressed at this point I pick it up
2:16:39 where I go there was a complication
2:16:41 complication I'll tell you on the way
2:16:43 all right I'll pick you up I'm all I'm
2:16:46 already loaded up you're gonna meet you
2:16:47 somewhere I'm at my former house

2:16:54 acceptable I'll be there give me 10
2:16:56 minutes
2:16:57 all right kind of just look at the door
2:17:00 that was open
2:17:02 is there like normal movement going
2:17:03 around here is it the regular ghoul
2:17:06 still kind of it's just a normal night
2:17:08 yeah okay so nobody else has been
2:17:11 everybody else is still acting normalish
2:17:13 I imagine that ghoul I took out during
2:17:16 the day is probably
2:17:17 trying to regain from the fatigue of
2:17:19 having his willpower wiped out yeah he's
2:17:21 having a rough go let's check out on
2:17:23 Placid man and then I'll be outside
2:17:24 waiting for Johnny Johnny arrives almost
2:17:27 exactly 10 minutes later driving a large
2:17:30 black Suburban when you load up into the
2:17:33 passenger side you look over and he
2:17:35 looks like [ __ ] he's got bags under his
2:17:38 eyes that are still crusted with a
2:17:41 little bit of blood his hair kind of
2:17:43 hangs loose he looks like he probably
2:17:45 hasn't changed clothes from yesterday
2:17:48 let's go and of course he's
2:17:50 sucking on one of his Morales you got it
2:17:52 we don't have a lot of time I don't know
2:17:54 where the Haven is it is give me
2:17:57 directions along the way yeah well I'll
2:17:59 tell you where it is and you'll know
2:18:00 that in the area and Johnny drives him
2:18:02 to The Haven so the demon is no longer a
2:18:05 problem Johnny pauses while he kind of
2:18:08 licks his teeth what do you mean it's no
2:18:10 longer a problem
2:18:12 so uh it hasn't been a month no the
2:18:16 demon uh ransomed my body back to me
2:18:19 after I left it Johnny slowly comes to a
2:18:21 stop as the light ahead of him goes red
2:18:25 and he kind of grips the steering wheel
2:18:27 a little bit dips his head
2:18:29 and nods a little bit that sounds like
2:18:33 really bad news
2:18:34 the mild up swing to that
2:18:37 he is part of that bargain as he's not
2:18:40 coming after any of us you think you can
2:18:42 trust it
2:18:43 to keep Bargains more or less the light
2:18:46 goes green and Johnny starts driving
2:18:48 again
2:18:49 all right so we lost the demon do we
2:18:53 have any idea where it went no you're
2:18:56 gonna tell the rest of the codery after
2:18:57 tonight and you know when I see them
2:19:00 again so basically like win all right
2:19:04 so that was unexpected but everything
2:19:07 else went off pretty pretty flawlessly
2:19:09 you know you said there was a
2:19:11 complication
2:19:12 and I thought we were about to head to
2:19:14 his Haven to actually confront him I
2:19:16 mean that's still the possibility
2:19:18 without a stake in him well last time I
2:19:20 left him with chaps was the stake in him
2:19:22 the Demon's gone demon is gone we can't
2:19:25 get ahead can we I mean I never utilized
2:19:28 its power so maybe I didn't leave a
2:19:30 stain I'm not worried about leaving
2:19:31 stains I'm worried about what a demon
2:19:34 being free is gonna do
2:19:37 foreign
2:19:39 but based on everything else it was
2:19:41 going to be free if we didn't take it in
2:19:43 so we basically just delayed it it's
2:19:45 original deal with Neil would have left
2:19:46 it for you too
2:19:51 I'm pretty sure that this news is is not
2:19:53 going to go as easily with win and
2:19:55 kneels it did with with me I'll deal
2:19:57 with it then let's get this done all
2:20:00 right
2:20:01 bourbon wait you got a problem with this
2:20:04 too it's it's just a black SUV
2:20:08 Johnny just shakes his head it's a a
2:20:11 little bit of nervous energy is
2:20:12 basically what you're getting off of
2:20:14 miles is they're like hoping there's
2:20:15 nothing else going wrong as we get back
2:20:17 chaps didn't eat the steak if it makes
2:20:19 you feel any better if you take a really
2:20:21 close look at the paint on this it's got
2:20:23 a metallic Fleck like a single a what a
2:20:26 single metallic flick no
2:20:29 all right funny guy the two of you
2:20:32 arrive to Upton's clandestine Haven a
2:20:36 fresh Morley comes out of his Pack
2:20:37 Johnny pauses looks over at Miles offers
2:20:41 him one
2:20:42 maybe after
2:20:44 here's the code turn the apps out and
2:20:47 enters the code so the gate can open and
2:20:49 you guys are free to head in
2:20:52 [Music]
2:20:58 after extensive work preparing your
2:21:00 makeup your hair and fitting you into
2:21:02 the dress that you'll be wearing for the
2:21:04 evening brother is brought out to a
2:21:06 limousine where Roman Pendragon and a
2:21:10 pair of men dressed in kind of very
2:21:14 sharp looking uniforms wait for you
2:21:17 Roman is dressed in what appears to be a
2:21:23 very clever nods to a more Victorian
2:21:26 goth look and he is dressed in all black
2:21:31 his coat is long the collar that he has
2:21:34 accentuates is already very sharp
2:21:36 angular features you think there might
2:21:39 be a hint of eyeliner and makeup meant
2:21:42 to draw attention to his already high
2:21:44 perfect cheekbones and there he is
2:21:48 waiting for you and watching you with
2:21:52 these Eerie piercing blue eyes as you
2:21:55 draw near one of these clearly you know
2:21:59 well-trained bruja opens the door for
2:22:02 you
2:22:03 this is the first time that Britta is
2:22:05 moving in a dress like this
2:22:07 she had the walk out to get used to the
2:22:10 weight of it the way that you have to
2:22:12 navigate the skirt but she had taken
2:22:15 that time to Center herself and to learn
2:22:16 to move in it and exiting the Mansion
2:22:20 she is taking that motion that sort of
2:22:24 centering as a way to Center herself
2:22:26 rather than just her movement and so
2:22:28 when she approaches this bruja that
2:22:31 Roman Pendragon keeps like one would
2:22:33 keep a ghoul she thanks him and accepts
2:22:36 his help into the limousine but her eyes
2:22:38 don't really leave Roman pendrick and
2:22:40 she keeps her attention to him you're
2:22:43 let into the limousine and they're
2:22:45 sitting already and that middle seat
2:22:48 across from you is a young woman and she
2:22:52 has this very pensive expression about
2:22:55 her kind of like the look that an animal
2:22:59 gives to the Butcher and getting in from
2:23:03 the other side and joining you is
2:23:05 Pendragon
2:23:07 you get this feeling like he's looking
2:23:09 you over but he doesn't actually turn to
2:23:11 address you and all he says is you look
2:23:14 lovely
2:23:16 thank you
2:23:17 and then the car starts and the
2:23:19 limousine pulls out and you go for a
2:23:22 drive eventually coming to the coast
2:23:26 or you can kind of see the moon kind of
2:23:28 hanging low over the water Britta's eyes
2:23:30 Linger on the water once it comes into
2:23:32 her view
2:23:34 something about seeing the shore like
2:23:36 that makes her nervous
2:23:38 maybe it's the memories but it doesn't
2:23:42 help that there's this
2:23:44 scared girl between the two of them
2:23:46 Britta reflexively ends up half shooting
2:23:49 the girl a little bit of a smile before
2:23:51 squashing it realizing that would not
2:23:53 help this looks like a living girl right
2:23:57 it does
2:23:58 smells quite nice
2:24:01 and she's being ignored generally uh she
2:24:05 has not been addressed in any way by
2:24:09 Pendragon who actually looks at you and
2:24:12 then casts his gaze out to the Crescent
2:24:13 Moon that hangs over the waves
2:24:16 auspicious isn't it
2:24:19 at that Beretta
2:24:22 subconsciously ends up pulling her
2:24:25 gloved hand just a little bit beneath
2:24:27 her skirt her eyes follow his gaze and
2:24:30 fall back to him
2:24:32 it's a nice night out
2:24:34 where you are headed is dangerous
2:24:36 a false stem any indication of weakness
2:24:40 and political Rivals that you don't even
2:24:42 know you have will descend upon you
2:24:45 recognize that you're entering into a
2:24:48 corner of actual monsters
2:24:50 this isn't games with Upton Rowlands
2:24:52 anymore
2:24:54 and with this very slight gesture with
2:24:57 his hand he emotions to the girl who is
2:25:00 sitting with you and she climbs out
2:25:03 towards your side of the limousine set
2:25:06 her like elbows and hands are kind of
2:25:08 rested against the cushion and she
2:25:10 exposes her neck and he looks at you now
2:25:15 drink
2:25:16 you will need to be at your best
2:25:19 brother looks down and as gently as she
2:25:22 can
2:25:23 she takes the girl's hair moves it away
2:25:26 from her neck
2:25:27 sort of keeps her hand on the girl's
2:25:30 shoulder just to study her she leans in
2:25:33 and she does take one trait of blood and
2:25:37 licks the wound and kind of brushes her
2:25:39 thumb over the girl's shoulder sits her
2:25:41 back down there's this irritated look
2:25:44 that crosses Roman and he very rough
2:25:48 with the Mortal girl pulls her by her
2:25:51 hair so she kind of like lets out this
2:25:53 wince and he sinks his fangs into her
2:25:57 neck and then you notice a hand reaching
2:25:59 for you and he pulls you back to her to
2:26:02 continue feeding until she's done he
2:26:05 says with blood spraying from his lips
2:26:07 there's no need for that I I don't think
2:26:10 I could even take in more than what I
2:26:12 just took just maybe that again but I
2:26:14 wouldn't need more
2:26:16 and Bretta actually sort of echoed the
2:26:19 same noise of startlement that she made
2:26:21 as she's pulled in tone too
2:26:24 draws Vitae from this Mortal with such
2:26:28 kind of like force that her body kind of
2:26:32 like twists some and her eyes rolled to
2:26:35 the back of her head and even though
2:26:37 she's trapped in the kiss
2:26:39 you can see like this this crushing
2:26:43 Force being applied to her and in
2:26:46 response to your refusal to feed he
2:26:50 takes her life
2:26:51 Britta closes her eyes likely still
2:26:54 unable to escape having pulled close to
2:26:57 it so close to the fact this girl is
2:27:01 dying in front of her and she squeezes
2:27:03 her eyes shut tightly as tightly as
2:27:05 possible she knows that there's The
2:27:08 Morbid thought that she can't ruin her
2:27:09 makeup right now but there's so much the
2:27:13 urge to cry
2:27:14 and forces her eyes back open as soon as
2:27:17 she's sure that she can control the
2:27:19 effect that her eyeliner might be ruined
2:27:22 swallow sound what she'd like to say in
2:27:24 the moment
2:27:26 dismissively
2:27:28 he shoves the corpse back to the seat
2:27:31 she was in
2:27:32 and
2:27:34 with a bit of silk that he carries with
2:27:36 him he cleans off his lips
2:27:39 and waits for the two of you to arrive
2:27:43 [Music]
2:27:49 Neil you're still in the dark chamber
2:27:53 that your buddy is working on you in and
2:27:56 when he seems like he's done with these
2:27:58 these chemical smells that permeate from
2:28:00 you he spins you in your seat so that
2:28:03 you are facing a mirror and there you
2:28:06 see a great deal of generously applied
2:28:11 guy liner your hair swept back and there

2:30:23 angles with a black shirt underneath it

2:30:50 approximation of a miles outfit you sort
2:30:54 of like a Justice tie in the mirror and
2:30:56 the whole time is just sort of under his
2:30:58 breath although obviously Fester is
2:30:59 probably listening to him okay you can
2:31:02 do this be miles
2:31:04 be pretty be trying to hit me when B
2:31:08 Miles B Britta B Johnny B when you you
2:31:12 can do this BJ and like as he's doing it
2:31:15 as he's getting dressed he like Neil is
2:31:17 always hunched over he always looks
2:31:19 nervous he always looks unconfident but
2:31:21 as he's going through this Mantra it's
2:31:23 like he's trying to straighten his own
2:31:26 back like he's trying to fix his posture
2:31:28 and put on this faux Aura of confidence
2:31:32 just to be
2:31:34 miles and be BR like all Britta and
2:31:37 Johnny and Wynn like all the aspects of
2:31:39 everybody else in the cotery that is
2:31:41 like do things and confidence and I can
2:31:44 yes and he's trying his best to do a
2:31:48 passable impression of a confident and
2:31:51 attractive man and then looks at Fester
2:31:53 when uh oh uh one more thing and he kind
2:31:57 of wrinkles his nose a little bit the uh
2:31:59 chemical smell I didn't know what you I
2:32:01 don't know what your preference is but

2:32:24 don't see why not there you go you can
2:32:25 like takes out this bottle and on it is
2:32:28 a label that says wolf Panther
2:32:30 [Laughter]
2:32:36 you wanna do that let's do it
2:32:39 sprays you two on the neck one on the
2:32:41 crotch I thought you were supposed to do
2:32:42 a cloud and walk through all right
2:32:44 that's my that's a myth also
2:32:46 and then he sprays Cloud walks through
2:32:49 it
2:32:55 man I'm learning a lot today
2:32:58 Neil who had but before he pulled out
2:33:01 the wolf Panther like puts these three
2:33:03 little vials back into his nylon fanny
2:33:07 pack which is in case you get nervous
2:33:09 okay yes uh sure all right
2:33:11 um I'm not gonna wear the fanny pack I'm
2:33:13 just gonna leave it in the car
2:33:15 unless what if that makes them not know
2:33:17 you're Neil
2:33:19 I'm kidding yeah leave that please okay
2:33:21 I choose here if she can well no it's
2:33:24 got that's where else am I gonna put my
2:33:25 stuff this thing has a look the pockets
2:33:28 in this are so small
2:33:29 the suit is very tight on me oh like it
2:33:32 is very tailored to be one of those very
2:33:34 slim suits the audience should know the
2:33:36 two women at the table just shared a
2:33:38 look when he complained about the size
2:33:39 of the pocket I know what I'm doing
2:33:42 there's only 12 of them Neil wears a
2:33:44 fanny pack at all times this is not
2:33:46 enough storage space all the time almost
2:33:48 all the time dude I have not been
2:33:50 disparaging you enough
2:33:52 I think I think the idea of a nice slim
2:33:55 fitting suit is the one anachronism that
2:33:56 we can all just agree to yes because
2:33:59 because it's actually in 1999 if we were
2:34:02 going by what the actual fashion was
2:34:04 it'd be a [ __ ] you'd be swimming in this
2:34:06 this is a full Zoot Suit yeah like but
2:34:09 no [ __ ] that okay so Professor is
2:34:13 actually wearing a Zoot Suit
2:34:17 but it's a classic so you got the wolf
2:34:19 Panther on yeah and I think we're now
2:34:22 ready to go all right uh let me just
2:34:25 grab my stuff he goes and he collects an
2:34:28 AK-47 and a small case of ammo uh what

2:34:44 just gonna be there yeah I don't know
2:34:46 how to fire this thing fair enough I
2:34:48 don't either
2:34:49 um the quote the great warrior poet Ice
2:34:52 Cube if a party does not require my AK

2:34:59 like a

2:36:37 Rowlands sleeping spot you arrive to the

2:36:53 quizzical look as you kind of make some
2:36:56 horrible noises through the door

2:37:24 makes this horrible satisfying noise and
2:37:27 starts to eat what a beautiful Symphony
2:37:29 for the background Johnny walks into the
2:37:31 room and kind of just Paces around the
2:37:33 perimeter of it touching things kind of
2:37:35 like looking through various things on
2:37:37 his shelf the main thing you notice is a
2:37:41 set of three roulette X's some fancy
2:37:44 stuff he's got in this room he's a
2:37:46 little bit garish but not bad Rolodex or

2:37:53 phone numbers oh yes
2:37:56 like businesses and contacts Johnny kind
2:38:00 of pauses at the uh his his contacts
2:38:03 listed just as a quick flip through
2:38:05 just so we can kind of get an idea of
2:38:07 the things that are there it's like each
2:38:09 one has upwards of like a hundred places
2:38:12 that are in southern Connecticut we
2:38:14 might need those oh you're certainly
2:38:16 gonna need these
2:38:18 and you're probably gonna need the
2:38:19 ghouls that'll be able to help you pay
2:38:21 uh flip through all this make sense of
2:38:24 it yeah we're gonna have to return back
2:38:26 there after this is done the other thing
2:38:28 you find is this safe
2:38:31 you want the room to yourself
2:38:34 yeah stay by the door it's it'll be
2:38:37 easier I'll give you a nod grab a chair
2:38:39 and put it next to Rowlands bud I'll be
2:38:42 waiting outside for you
2:38:45 Johnny
2:38:46 walks out kind of like Taps the ax on
2:38:49 the safe as he walks by it
2:38:51 just kind of looking at it like huh
2:38:53 that's gonna be interesting steps
2:38:55 outside of the uh bed chamber and closes
2:38:58 the door
2:38:59 miles it's just you and him
2:39:01 he doesn't move
2:39:04 but you know he's awake
2:39:06 I remove the pillow from his face he's
2:39:08 still staring right up at you terrified
2:39:11 Rowlands I didn't have to come to this
2:39:14 I never had to go this way
2:39:18 and
2:39:21 some ways I'm kind of sorry I did
2:39:24 ah but
2:39:27 you failed me
2:39:30 you were supposed to look out for me and
2:39:35 my interest in code race is the elder
2:39:37 ventru and all you did was take
2:39:42 take from me take from my cotery
2:39:45 put us in danger
2:39:47 Force us to live these lives that we've
2:39:49 been living for the last couple weeks
2:39:51 because you're too [ __ ] selfish to
2:39:53 get your [ __ ] straight
2:39:56 miles lean's back in the chair
2:39:58 frustrated and then leans forward
2:40:01 takes his glasses off puts him on his
2:40:03 chest
2:40:05 so here we are
2:40:08 you know Arabella tried this and she
2:40:11 picked terrible allies in a terrible
2:40:14 time
2:40:15 and I didn't really think it was right
2:40:17 at the time
2:40:18 but
2:40:21 your weakness is an infection at this
2:40:24 point
2:40:27 it is a
2:40:28 huge
2:40:30 gaping problem for New Haven
2:40:33 and you've let it Reiss run this city
2:40:36 for too long and all Reiss cares about
2:40:38 is himself and all you cared about it
2:40:40 was yourself
2:40:42 so now it's time for different
2:40:44 to take care of the Kindred here
2:40:47 to prepare for the coming Sabbat
2:40:50 just know that
2:40:52 from what I've heard
2:40:54 at least you won't suffer in some sort
2:40:56 of hell
2:40:58 it'll just be Oblivion
2:41:02 and with that I stand up and I start to
2:41:09 feed off Rowlands the point that I will
2:41:11 take in his soul
2:41:13 I need a rule for diablary
2:41:16 [Music]
2:41:18 I'm gonna pop up my strength
2:41:21 with the blood that I am currently
2:41:23 taking from Rowlands how much blood does
2:41:25 he have
2:41:27 18 18. he's a big boy
2:41:30 um what my Max is what 10 on strength
2:41:33 yeah okay so I'm gonna pump myself to
2:41:34 ten strengths
2:41:36 yes you are
2:41:39 is it just a straight strength girl yeah
2:41:44 three successes okay he had five levels
2:41:47 of damage on him you have diabolarized
2:41:48 him
2:41:51 foreign so a few things happen
2:41:54 immediately one I need a Humanity test
2:41:57 two lose a point of humanity lose one
2:42:00 rule to not lose another I'm gonna

2:42:09 pass
2:42:10 you don't know if you should have done
2:42:12 that but the last thing that happens is

2:45:46 term hey what Mommy sorry sorry Mommy
2:45:49 sorry

2:45:53 deal who said the term is irrelevant the
2:45:55 term is correct
2:46:03 yes
2:46:11 we established what uh the type that
2:46:14 goes for Johnny is I'm gonna establish
2:46:16 what John we haven't established what
2:46:17 the types for all of the characters are
2:46:19 we've established that goes for the
2:46:21 characters and in some circumstances
2:46:23 that is the same type miles is sexually
2:46:25 attracted to super villains yes yeah
2:46:27 Brett has also sexually attracted to
2:46:30 supervillains yes you recall lucida's

2:46:56 son

2:47:43 I was like we're both there to fire wait
2:47:45 no no no nothing
2:47:48 feels like it's like that's some Drax
2:47:52 energy of like yes it was Drax that is
2:47:55 that is a very much very similar to
2:47:57 draxton falling in love with his wife
2:48:00 yes oh my God yes she did she did not
2:48:04 dance the most powerful rhythm in the
2:48:06 world could be playing and she wouldn't
2:48:08 bat an eye she made my genitals and
2:48:11 gourds
2:48:13 that is Johnny talking about his wife
2:48:17 I was I was standing across the room
2:48:20 with my friends they had dragged me out
2:48:21 there for some ungodly reason I was
2:48:24 drinking a Miller High Life she saw me
2:48:26 from across the dance floor three or
2:48:27 four four I remember she was wearing a
2:48:30 denim jacket and a Black Sabbath t-shirt
2:48:32 she pointed at me walked across the room
2:48:35 and started making out
2:48:38 how is Earth from that point forward
2:48:42 that is such a good story I remember
2:48:44 what she was on her way out to a party
2:48:45 her dad was like are you gonna wear then
2:48:48 so I rolled through with my motorcycle
2:48:49 smashing through the wall and I was like
2:48:51 get on

2:48:58 Post credits

2:49:05 between Seasons I legitimately want I
2:49:06 clip a [ __ ] ton that I don't use and I
2:49:09 want to edit them all together no I just
2:49:10 I want you to post that episode is
2:49:11 normal and then we do the opening the
2:49:13 thing and then it's just a three-hour
2:49:15 episode and then we go to the credits
2:49:18 and then we do uh
2:49:20 yeah are you okay with me having a
2:49:23 comedy where I can uh or I can drive a
2:49:25 motorcycle out of the ground I think you
2:49:27 can so I feel like that's a protein
2:49:29 combo it is it uh Earth meld and potency
2:49:32 yeah Earth smelled potions but you also
2:49:35 made the drive there's a combo where you
2:49:37 can take someone on your Earth mild and
2:49:38 you like Earth metal together either
2:49:40 with a person or an object and it's
2:49:42 usually meant like as a romantic gesture
2:49:44 and I feel like Johnny doing that with
2:49:46 the motorcycle
2:49:47 stays a romantic gesture to his wife
