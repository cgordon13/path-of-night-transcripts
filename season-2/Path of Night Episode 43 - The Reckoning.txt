0:00:40 the quartery gathers at winds haven to
0:00:42 discuss the results of the night's court
0:00:44 and to attempt to sort out the
0:00:46 overwhelming amount of problems
0:00:48 remaining
0:00:50 tension rises between miles and johnny
0:00:53 britta win and kneel do their best to
0:00:55 help bring everyone back into
0:00:56 conversation
0:00:59 together
0:01:00 they choose to prioritize finding their
0:01:02 missing bra ally chain
0:01:06 [Music]
0:01:16 [Music]
0:01:19 if the quarter spends time
0:01:21 sorting out its problems and figuring
0:01:23 out what path they would take next
0:01:26 there was a rustling in the woods
0:01:29 a screech for help and
0:01:31 johnny i you probably recognize it first
0:01:34 but but when right there with you
0:01:37 you can hear
0:01:39 kabir cry out in pain
0:01:41 wind takes off running
0:01:43 as does johnny same there's a good way
0:01:45 to go running into the woods uh
0:01:47 i keep people on my site because [ __ ]
0:01:49 i'm dead out here we already stopped
0:01:52 uh you arrive
0:01:55 to
0:01:56 where
0:01:57 kabir is hoisted off the ground
0:02:00 and held in the long talons
0:02:03 of who you recognize to be raven and he
0:02:06 is holding a like fist full of mashed up
0:02:10 flowers and his clothes are shredded
0:02:14 and talons have disemboweled him and his
0:02:18 intestines just kind of like hang out
0:02:20 past his waist
0:02:22 and
0:02:23 the ravnos
0:02:25 is reduced to this whimpering
0:02:28 crying thing after having been brutally
0:02:31 savaged by raven
0:02:33 raven let him go
0:02:35 you know this man she drops him on the
0:02:37 ground yes i don't know how he knows
0:02:39 where i live but i know him i found him
0:02:41 skulking while i was on my way to see
0:02:42 you kabir you with me
0:02:46 my friend
0:02:48 this
0:02:49 [ __ ]
0:02:51 johnny uh rushes over to kabir and
0:02:53 basically kind of puts himself in
0:02:55 between him and raven win kind of
0:02:58 looks very lost as to who to go to but
0:03:00 she kind of gives raven a look like i
0:03:02 get it
0:03:03 but you [ __ ] up and
0:03:05 goes over to kabir and just kind of puts
0:03:08 her hands up like she doesn't know
0:03:10 what to do to try and help raven just
0:03:12 kind of watches with a detached
0:03:14 expression as
0:03:16 people tend took a beer cobia seems
0:03:18 perfectly fine with you helping him
0:03:22 what are you doing here i was come
0:03:25 to bring you flowers in the date as
0:03:27 promised
0:03:28 wind kind of
0:03:30 sucks on her lips
0:03:31 a little bit like she's
0:03:33 this is the sweetest thing anyone's ever
0:03:34 done and it's bleeding out in front of
0:03:36 her
0:03:37 how do i help you
0:03:39 but
0:03:41 i mean
0:03:42 i need to hear
0:03:44 gee it's very hot yeah she does she hits
0:03:46 like a brick [ __ ] house she it's very
0:03:49 hard like a brick [ __ ] house yeah that's
0:03:51 exactly it do you need me to like put
0:03:53 those back inside you
0:03:55 they go back inside these okay
0:03:57 and wind just kind of carefully moves
0:03:59 his intestines back inside him yeah he
0:04:01 grabs out his intestines and like tries
0:04:03 to help you kind of mash everything back
0:04:04 in
0:04:05 wow this is occurring brett is uh
0:04:07 looking to see if she can uh
0:04:09 sight out some animal in the woods i
0:04:12 think he needs i think he needs some
0:04:14 blood
0:04:15 peculiarly you see
0:04:17 a massive murder of crows like up in the
0:04:20 branches eyeing kabir's intestines
0:04:23 well that's not the
0:04:24 animal that i'm looking for
0:04:26 they don't seem worth the one one blood
0:04:29 point for him i'm gonna be hunting for
0:04:32 something else okay uh you're gonna
0:04:34 wander off enroll perception plus
0:04:36 survival
0:04:38 i am i'm gonna spend it willpower though
0:04:40 subtract your aspect from my difficulty
0:04:42 it's perception okay uh the extra
0:04:44 willpower is gone right now right yes
0:04:46 that was only for the
0:04:47 yep yep you are it's stiff eight then
0:04:50 drops down to diff seven for you okay
0:04:55 two successes counting the willpower
0:04:57 okay
0:04:58 better heads off into the woods
0:05:00 raven kind of like
0:05:02 regards kabir with this like ancient
0:05:04 animosity and
0:05:07 just kind of waits for you to get rid of
0:05:08 the ravenous so that she can talk to you
0:05:10 seems just unfazed by the fact that she
0:05:12 shredded him to the brink of like death
0:05:14 um
0:05:15 when do you want maybe johnny and i to
0:05:19 bring
0:05:20 your
0:05:21 guest up back that that way to your yeah
0:05:25 at least get them under the tarp yeah
0:05:27 and then maybe you can have a chat
0:05:29 kind of closes her eyes like she's
0:05:30 trying to piece logic out of this
0:05:32 situation and yeah that would probably
0:05:34 be for the best dory i got him okay uh
0:05:37 johnny scoops up kabir don't uh don't
0:05:40 worry buddy there's there's uh
0:05:41 duct tape and a beanbag chair back there
0:05:43 for you so
0:05:46 johnny will will reach his hand up to
0:05:48 his mouth bite his hand
0:05:50 and as he's carrying kabir over offer up
0:05:52 a little bit of blood took a beer uh
0:05:54 kabir will drink from johnny uh he takes
0:05:56 five
0:05:58 attack damage tag if he's to heal a
0:06:00 health level he needs five blood from
0:06:01 you
0:06:04 do you got five
0:06:10 uh
0:06:11 johnny has five

0:06:43 somewhere else maybe
0:06:45 johnny blinking back like near hunger
0:06:49 frenzy nods at you
0:06:51 and goes stocking off into the night
0:06:53 okay um
0:06:56 yeah let's just get you to uh
0:06:58 let's just get you to win's house
0:07:01 [Music]
0:07:06 raven starts scraping her claws against
0:07:08 the tree to wipe the blood off of it we
0:07:10 haven't been back to these woods for
0:07:11 some time
0:07:13 no
0:07:14 it's been a while i received your
0:07:16 message why didn't you come
0:07:19 you aren't in these woods
0:07:21 and i don't travel to cities
0:07:24 not when i can help it
0:07:26 okay i'll remember that for the future
0:07:29 i have pages of the book
0:07:32 her head kind of tilts to the side
0:07:34 and the codex itself
0:07:36 wasn't able to retrieve it what happened
0:07:40 was stolen by a demon-possessed former
0:07:42 ventrue it's free
0:07:45 yes
0:07:47 for a moment she actually looks
0:07:48 unnervous
0:07:49 there was some
0:07:53 bargain making
0:07:54 to get it loose
0:07:57 i see
0:07:59 and everyone made it out
0:08:01 for a price
0:08:03 who paid the price
0:08:06 miles and kneel
0:08:07 rows of fangs kind of manifest between
0:08:11 her lips and she kind of like
0:08:13 turns sniffing there to see if she might
0:08:16 still be able to track them
0:08:18 i see
0:08:19 what are you thinking
0:08:21 i'm thinking
0:08:23 that among your companions there is an
0:08:25 infection
0:08:27 it'll be gone soon enough
0:08:29 that was part of the bargain
0:08:31 it has never gone by its own volition
0:08:34 some sicknesses must be bled out
0:08:38 i am sorry that this has happened to
0:08:39 your people
0:08:41 i know what it's like
0:08:45 raven you're my people too
0:08:47 and i don't know how to elegantly say
0:08:49 stay the [ __ ] away from them
0:08:51 but if bleeding it out needs to be done
0:08:55 that falls to me
0:08:57 i cannot make that promise
0:09:00 the creature that is bound must remain
0:09:04 bound
0:09:05 and my sisters and i swore long ago to
0:09:07 ensure that it stays
0:09:09 bound
0:09:10 and if for some reason it is gone free
0:09:13 that matter will be resolved
0:09:16 and those responsible
0:09:18 will meet final death
0:09:20 it'll be rebound in a month
0:09:23 where is it now
0:09:25 i don't think i can tell you that
0:09:26 i think you can
0:09:28 i think i won't
0:09:31 then it is among your people
0:09:34 when is just quiet maintaining eye
0:09:36 contact not
0:09:37 confirming or denying
0:09:40 perhaps it was neil
0:09:43 i'm not going to help you kill the
0:09:45 people that i care about
0:09:47 that's because you don't realize that it
0:09:49 is an act of mercy
0:09:53 where are the pages
0:09:55 when reaches in her back pocket
0:09:57 and offers them to her she accepts him
0:10:01 undue as the rest
0:10:03 arabella rollins
0:10:06 that woman has lived a long time
0:10:09 i will seek out arabella woodlands
0:10:12 you
0:10:14 get rid of that thing
0:10:16 or i must
0:10:18 i will trust you
0:10:20 with that
0:10:22 she kind of like
0:10:24 pulls this like
0:10:26 the hooded cloak that she wears up
0:10:29 over her like wet curly black hair
0:10:33 and
0:10:34 with her like weird kind of like torn up
0:10:36 puritan clothes that she wears under it
0:10:39 you can kind of see that these nights
0:10:40 her feet are just totally bare
0:10:42 and the very small the much smaller the
0:10:45 new woman
0:10:46 kind of turns and makes her way off into
0:10:48 the dark why don't you go to cities
0:10:51 in cities they called
0:10:53 my sisters and i witch
0:10:56 and they did things to us
0:10:58 that i will not welcome again i will not
0:11:00 allow it
0:11:02 so i avoid cities
0:11:05 she just turns and goes
0:11:07 wind
0:11:08 kind of stands there for a minute just
0:11:11 whatever rain is still coming down just
0:11:13 kind of hits her
0:11:15 on the white braid on top of her head
0:11:17 trickles down the scales on the side of
0:11:19 her head
0:11:21 definitely never bringing people to my
0:11:22 house again
0:11:27 [Music]
0:11:30 we pick up a few nights later the quarry
0:11:32 spent nights researching into
0:11:35 a new potential ghoul
0:11:37 to serve miles and
0:11:39 the whereabouts of jane after doing some
0:11:41 research
0:11:42 and putting in your due diligence you
0:11:44 find that there is indeed a personal
0:11:45 possession of hers located in the
0:11:47 sheriff's office a clipboard that she
0:11:50 kind of donated and uses for her
0:11:53 projects under the guys as one of the
0:11:55 bully boys and
0:11:58 more importantly perhaps
0:12:00 johnny is aware of the location of her
0:12:02 haven so despite her having not been
0:12:04 there for some time she has personal
0:12:06 effects that neil may use
0:12:08 for his magics so the group of you are
0:12:11 together
0:12:12 miles i believe they're loaded into the
0:12:13 blazer into the blazer who's driving
0:12:15 johnny can drive johnny you're driving
0:12:19 where are you headed
0:12:20 so
0:12:21 the clipboard that we found at the at
0:12:24 the sheriff's office
0:12:26 that is part of what he needs or or is
0:12:28 that going to be sufficient or not
0:12:30 enough
0:12:31 neil isn't completely sure it's actually
0:12:33 covered by like art that she's done with
0:12:36 like markers and like all sorts of like
0:12:38 neat little like absolutely it's one of
0:12:40 those it's one of those things where you
0:12:41 can absolutely tell this is well loved
0:12:43 by somebody it's been scratched
0:12:45 like banned logos and things all over
0:12:48 the cool s's on it
0:12:50 like a lot of asses
0:12:53 i mean i feel like jane's more of kind
0:12:55 of like a 80s
0:12:56 like party like punk chick than than she
0:13:00 is a 90s kind of person but she's got a
0:13:03 little bit more of a joan jet vibe right
0:13:05 yes neil do you think this uh all of the
0:13:09 the scratch work she's put into this
0:13:10 clipboard is gonna be enough or should
0:13:12 we go to her haven i
0:13:14 i it's to be totally honest i i don't
0:13:16 know uh here's what i'm looking for
0:13:18 um some of this is a little mundane some
0:13:20 of it isn't um if i can get like a good
0:13:22 starting point of where she was last so
0:13:25 her haven might be like a good place to
0:13:27 be um and i could i can kind of look
0:13:29 into these things in the meantime all
0:13:31 right maybe take a look at this
0:13:32 clipboard to see if you see any patterns
0:13:34 maybe yeah i'll i'll play around with it
0:13:37 what's the
0:13:38 she gave this to the sheriff's office
0:13:40 or she cares about this what no no no
0:13:42 she just whenever she's going through uh
0:13:46 the the nightly tasks for the for the
0:13:48 office
0:13:50 this is the uh clipboard she works with
0:13:52 she's she's whenever she's on the phone
0:13:53 she's scratching into this thing so this
0:13:55 is her
0:13:56 if she were to have a schedule of of
0:13:59 like regular activities this is the
0:14:00 thing she would write it on yeah
0:14:02 probably okay okay yeah sure um
0:14:05 to head towards our heaven either way
0:14:06 and then they'll um
0:14:08 i'll start
0:14:09 playing around with this
0:14:10 sounds good to me
0:14:12 how's everybody else doing you need to
0:14:14 stop anywhere
0:14:15 no i'm feeling pretty good
0:14:17 ready
0:14:18 to try and help
0:14:19 you're looking pretty good tonight when
0:14:21 do you take a shower or something or
0:14:22 something
0:14:24 wait what is there something option
0:14:26 don't worry about it well i mean just
0:14:28 usually she's got that kind of like in a
0:14:29 layer of forest grime going up running
0:14:32 up her jeans but it looks like you
0:14:33 actually like may have dusted them off i
0:14:35 have a hose spaghett i don't i don't
0:14:37 mean to brag
0:14:40 all right i thought it might have rained
0:14:41 recently too so is kabir doing all right
0:14:44 yeah he's he's making a recovery i've
0:14:46 let him stay at my place for a while i
0:14:47 sleep in the ground no big deal and uh
0:14:49 does he like sleep in the ground next to
0:14:51 you or something no i let him have my
0:14:53 bed he must be really excited about that
0:14:56 i mean he had his guts half ripped out
0:14:58 so he's um
0:14:59 excited as a sliding scale would it be a
0:15:01 bad move to say he was bursting with joy
0:15:04 i will neither confirm nor deny this
0:15:06 johnny uh turns the uh
0:15:09 the um oh no you're probably sitting in
0:15:11 the front of the front seat yeah he just
0:15:12 he he looks over at you with a
0:15:15 expression of
0:15:16 half
0:15:17 anger and amusement and
0:15:20 just impressed awe at the uh the
0:15:23 bursting joke
0:15:24 but i've come loaded a bear just in case
0:15:26 hopefully you people have
0:15:28 at least put a few armaments on
0:15:30 we are in a city under siege neil
0:15:33 absolutely has not but he does have his
0:15:34 fanny pack also for that matter
0:15:35 everybody i mean uh
0:15:37 it's been a couple of days and we still
0:15:39 haven't heard from jane so
0:15:41 something's definitely up also a
0:15:43 location of her haven is kind of a
0:15:45 sensitive thing i wouldn't normally
0:15:47 bring you all here unless it was
0:15:49 actually something important so please
0:15:52 keep in mind that this is maybe a
0:15:55 a step over the line and showing you
0:15:57 into her life a little bit if you want
0:15:59 we can just stay in the car and no i'd
0:16:02 rather have you with with me than not
0:16:04 i'm just reminding you that this is kind
0:16:06 of private you know so like everyone can
0:16:08 stay in the car
0:16:10 me included and i can just go take a
0:16:11 look well the haven might also give us a
0:16:13 clue about what's going on with her too
0:16:15 wait that's why we're going right but at
0:16:17 the interior like seeing the inside i
0:16:19 meant seeing the inside you can be
0:16:22 in that
0:16:24 place let's uh let's save your ability
0:16:27 to
0:16:28 leave uh
0:16:30 okay i'm just saying he kind of he kind
0:16:32 of motions with his hand like you know
0:16:35 as if he's referring to the physical
0:16:37 world
0:16:38 yes yeah let's let's leave that for
0:16:40 another time huh i'm just saying if we
0:16:42 wanted to look inside without having
0:16:43 everybody trump around inside it's
0:16:45 gotcha an option for privacy but we can
0:16:47 be respectful of the fact that we
0:16:50 probably shouldn't know where her haven
0:16:52 is and
0:16:53 we are starting to know because it's an
0:16:55 emergency he snaps his fingers and kind
0:16:57 of nods that's all i'm asking yes of
0:17:00 course yeah that seems totally fine
0:17:02 that's fine as they're driving neil is
0:17:04 just sort of like playing with the
0:17:05 clipboard and looking at stuff um
0:17:08 trying to get impressions off of it in
0:17:10 that like weird aw speccy mulcavian way
0:17:13 that he does
0:17:14 while they're all sort of talking he's
0:17:15 gonna use spirits touch and just try and
0:17:17 get jane impressions off of it
0:17:20 okay it's the first time we've used that
0:17:21 ability in this game so far
0:17:23 yes yeah it's in season one i've never
0:17:25 used it
0:17:26 this is the bad power that makes you go
0:17:28 crazy
0:17:29 jokes on you i'm a more caviar yeah i
0:17:31 was like he started that way
0:17:34 perhaps you don't know how deep this
0:17:35 pond goes
0:17:38 give seven three successes the first
0:17:41 thing you sense is this deep anxiety and
0:17:45 resentment
0:17:46 and
0:17:47 some of that might be self-loathing but
0:17:49 there is something going on
0:17:52 that has her deeply troubled in addition
0:17:55 to this
0:17:56 you actually sense this uh meticulous
0:18:00 sharp mind
0:18:01 jane is just just by holding this you
0:18:03 get a sensation that jane is actually
0:18:06 far more clever than she tends to let on
0:18:08 and
0:18:09 lastly you
0:18:11 get this sense of like uh like a
0:18:14 departing like some sort of ending that
0:18:16 she's experiencing
0:18:18 yeah johnny was was jane going anywhere
0:18:21 not that i'm aware of because um she
0:18:24 and she's smart as a whip but like
0:18:26 uh what was going on with her
0:18:29 like mentally where was she at is there
0:18:32 a possibility that she just
0:18:33 left without saying anything i don't
0:18:36 think that's likely
0:18:38 but
0:18:39 you're asking my emotional state
0:18:41 i'm asking for context for an emotional
0:18:42 state
0:18:43 think about all bruha in the city and
0:18:45 what we've been going through over the
0:18:46 past few months yeah
0:18:48 no i get that um
0:18:51 i think we are gonna have to go to our
0:18:52 haven well i'm almost there
0:18:55 okay
0:18:56 oh jane
0:19:01 [Music]
0:19:05 after a short drive you pull up to uh
0:19:09 this tall kind of apartment complex
0:19:12 johnny you're aware that she has like a
0:19:14 nice like loft up top that kind of gives
0:19:17 like a nice view of the city
0:19:19 she actually uh she stays up on the top
0:19:22 she's got a loft that's uh got a pretty
0:19:24 good view over everything and some
0:19:26 secure spots in the back where she can
0:19:28 stay out of sunlight
0:19:29 he rummages around in the pocket of his
0:19:31 uh of his flannel pulls out a piece of
0:19:34 paper
0:19:35 i got her uh
0:19:36 i got the code to get into the building
0:19:38 right here
0:19:39 jumps out of the out of the blazer hey
0:19:41 if we go in there
0:19:42 has anyone i mean you must have
0:19:44 knowledge of the sheriff like you cased
0:19:46 crime scenes before right
0:19:48 nobody nobody touch anything
0:19:49 if you can help it a solid plan nobody
0:19:51 touched anything
0:19:52 just don't want to not really in the
0:19:54 business of forensics
0:19:56 well i'm not saying this is necessarily
0:19:57 a crime scene i'm just saying like i
0:19:58 want to get an impression of jane not us
0:20:01 touching jane okay so
0:20:03 before you
0:20:05 get done what you need to do there we
0:20:08 just leave it so that you can see the
0:20:09 patterns right
0:20:11 step one is we make sure the whole place
0:20:13 is secure
0:20:14 i can't have you kneeling down and
0:20:17 worshiping whatever weird moon entities
0:20:20 you talk to okay it wasn't really the
0:20:22 plan
0:20:22 look the point is we're gonna make sure
0:20:24 the place is clear
0:20:26 then you can do your
0:20:27 rituals or whatever but making sure the
0:20:29 place is clear doesn't mean we have to
0:20:31 go touching everything i'm just gonna do
0:20:33 a regular look first but okay sounds
0:20:36 good johnny shuts the uh the blazer
0:20:38 locks it up after everyone's out and the
0:20:41 crew goes walking over the building he
0:20:43 uh
0:20:44 kind of keep just puts an eye out to
0:20:46 look to see if there's anybody watching
0:20:48 or following us
0:20:49 kind of
0:20:50 shifting your eyes around
0:20:52 you don't see anyone having any
0:20:54 particular interest in the group of you
0:20:55 as you make your approach to the complex
0:20:59 johnny being easily satisfied by a
0:21:02 cursory glance
0:21:04 puts in the code for the building uh
0:21:06 opens up the main doors and we head in
0:21:09 to head up to jane's loft the group you
0:21:12 head to an elevator and
0:21:14 now it's one of those cool kind of lofts
0:21:16 yeah
0:21:17 and you hear like clink clink clink
0:21:20 clink clink clink clink clink clink
0:21:21 clink clink of like the chain that
0:21:23 operates the elevator and you make your
0:21:25 way up
0:21:26 there's like a teeny tiny hallway that's
0:21:29 like just a few steps between the
0:21:31 elevator and what's like the front door
0:21:32 of her home is it a freight elevator
0:21:34 where it's basically just a a graded
0:21:36 door that you pull down manually yeah
0:21:39 i'm super jealous now
0:21:40 yep
0:21:42 johnny flashing back to his like [ __ ]
0:21:44 caught under a bar like what the hell
0:21:47 my little concrete box of heaven
0:21:50 we should probably knock i don't know if
0:21:52 there's necessarily a door i think the
0:21:54 clinking is the uh is the knocking that
0:21:56 somebody's arrived yeah we just got
0:21:58 described a door there is there is a
0:21:59 door oh it's a it's a very short hallway
0:22:02 with like it basically literally goes
0:22:03 from that door to the next with just
0:22:06 like a few steps
0:22:08 um but the other door kind of does it
0:22:10 just opens all right give it a knock
0:22:15 there's no response on the other end
0:22:17 is it locked when you check it is not
0:22:19 locked uh like the doorknob is like
0:22:22 very like kind of like loose and hangs
0:22:24 when you like jostle it give it a push
0:22:26 open it pushes it's like uh it's like a
0:22:28 thick metal so like it's got some weight
0:22:30 to it but there's nothing like
0:22:33 keeping through locked or anything like
0:22:34 that does it look like it was busted
0:22:36 open or does it look like this is just
0:22:38 usually how it is well looks like
0:22:40 something was done to it hey johnny does
0:22:42 she usually keep her door locked here
0:22:44 johnny is razor focused at this point
0:22:47 and kind of very gently
0:22:49 shakes his head no but doesn't say
0:22:51 anything and unlooses the matte black
0:22:54 axe
0:22:55 from where it was kind of holstered
0:22:57 under his jacket and kind of slowly
0:22:59 moves in being very quiet and careful as
0:23:03 he's kind of looking around casing the
0:23:05 place looking for unknown threats when
0:23:08 you creep in you hear the crinkling of
0:23:10 paper underneath your boots and it's
0:23:13 very very dark in here it looks like the
0:23:16 sun proofing is like still down so it's
0:23:19 even blocking like
0:23:20 light pollution from the city and you're
0:23:23 stepping into this big dark space
0:23:25 are we turning on lights or do you want
0:23:27 eyes i i'm i'm fine turning the lights
0:23:30 on
0:23:30 we just did a big knock it's not like if
0:23:32 somebody's in here they don't know we're
0:23:34 here
0:23:35 oh look around
0:23:37 and he like reaches the handout sort of
0:23:38 blindly looks around for like a light
0:23:40 switch yeah you find one
0:23:42 you flip the switch on and again they're
0:23:45 these very very thick kind of like
0:23:48 heavy black curtains
0:23:50 that block these like huge almost like
0:23:53 floor-to-ceiling windows
0:23:55 that like line one of the walls
0:23:58 around there's kind of this is
0:23:59 definitely kind of like
0:24:01 a very
0:24:02 cared for haven there's like a bar to it
0:24:06 there's like a bunch of like stool seats
0:24:08 she's got like guitars that she keeps
0:24:11 like on the walls and there's all sorts
0:24:13 of like signatures
0:24:15 on them from various like bands that
0:24:17 jane was into
0:24:18 it's not it doesn't it's not like the
0:24:19 kind of collection where she just put
0:24:21 tons of money into it it's the kind of
0:24:22 collection machine that she built over
0:24:25 time through like hard work and going to
0:24:27 shows
0:24:29 yeah it wasn't collected for like values
0:24:32 collected because of you know these are
0:24:34 our passions right of record collection
0:24:37 there's
0:24:38 couches there's this like big like thick
0:24:41 tv
0:24:42 then you notice a glass coffee table is
0:24:45 smashed
0:24:46 there's papers everywhere a lot of
0:24:48 drawers and cabinets are torn open and
0:24:51 it looks like haphazardly someone or a
0:24:55 group of people uh ripped through this
0:24:57 area looking for something without
0:25:00 touching anything bretta's going to walk
0:25:02 over and see if she can read some of the
0:25:04 papers that are shown about the papers
0:25:06 also come in the form of like
0:25:08 bills documents and a lot of it is
0:25:10 associated with various names all of
0:25:13 them women
0:25:14 johnny when you want to make sure the
0:25:15 rest of this apartment is clear yep i
0:25:17 think through a quick tag team kind of
0:25:20 room clearing effort when and johnny go
0:25:23 through the apartment to make there's no
0:25:24 obvious threats so you don't find any
0:25:27 obvious threats uh the bedroom door is
0:25:30 like completely smashed in and
0:25:32 there you kind of see again massively
0:25:35 sun proofed there is a um
0:25:38 a large like kind of like nice queen
0:25:40 size bed and it has um i forgot what
0:25:43 it's called it's almost like um so it
0:25:45 hangs over
0:25:46 like
0:25:47 yes there's like a like a nice like
0:25:50 neat looking black canopy that kind of
0:25:52 like rests over the bed itself
0:25:54 i do appreciate her style checking under
0:25:56 the canopy nothing is under there
0:25:58 no i think maybe she was
0:26:00 helping people all these documents they
0:26:04 seem to have random women's names and
0:26:06 that's the first thing that came to my
0:26:08 mind the bells and everything or it's
0:26:10 all her that she's operating under
0:26:12 different pseudonyms so she's harder to
0:26:14 trace that could be true too while
0:26:16 they're all looking around and reading
0:26:18 things neil's still standing in the
0:26:19 doorway uh and just trying to get like a
0:26:22 really good read on
0:26:24 what happened here his general like
0:26:27 impressions of what's going on first uh
0:26:29 before he goes in to look around i mean
0:26:31 pretty quickly you pieced together that
0:26:33 there's
0:26:34 been a break-in uh it does not look like
0:26:36 they were there for valuables because
0:26:37 the tvs laughed you know the dvd players
0:26:40 left but the tours are still there i
0:26:41 mean the cars are still there the tv is
0:26:43 pretty much a possible move on your own
0:26:48 1999's tv that tv is [ __ ]
0:26:50 heavy
0:26:52 i am going to use the eyes of chaos
0:26:54 okay
0:26:55 because there is a lot of like sprawl
0:26:57 and lived in space here so it seems sort
0:26:59 of ideal
0:27:02 and let me know what my difficulty is
0:27:04 difficulty
0:27:05 six successes okay uh with six successes
0:27:09 uh you very quickly get the impression
0:27:11 that she is someone who's kind of like
0:27:13 hiding something like she definitely put
0:27:17 this whole place together because she
0:27:18 intended to spend a great deal of her
0:27:21 time here
0:27:22 more than most kindred for bruha she's
0:27:25 got a lot of security measures that she
0:27:27 had put into place
0:27:28 she is not this is like atypical of a
0:27:30 neonate not a lot of neonates kind of
0:27:32 like can get a home like this as their
0:27:34 haven the
0:27:36 big thing that you get a sense of is
0:27:38 that and this is not staged someone came
0:27:40 in here someone actually took her
0:27:42 you'd absolutely get the impression that
0:27:44 like this is
0:27:46 not part of the jihad something has like
0:27:49 interfered with the game's kindred play
0:27:51 and something has gone awry here no just
0:27:54 stands in the doorway sort of eyes
0:27:56 unfocused in that way where he seems to
0:27:58 be looking like taking in everything at
0:28:00 once and not really like picking out
0:28:03 details at the same time as he picks out
0:28:05 the the larger picture uh and then looks
0:28:07 over towards johnny presumably like as
0:28:09 he comes out of the bat the bedroom or
0:28:10 something yes
0:28:12 um
0:28:14 where did jane get her money
0:28:16 i don't know
0:28:18 she
0:28:19 brady said you think maybe she was
0:28:22 she was helping women or or
0:28:24 when maybe his aliases or something i
0:28:27 don't
0:28:28 i don't know but she had a lot more
0:28:31 resources than
0:28:32 you'd think
0:28:33 jane would have
0:28:35 she spent a hell of a lot of time here
0:28:38 like i know she was always doing stuff
0:28:40 and always busy for the domain but like
0:28:42 you know we do that kind of stuff too
0:28:43 and we're not in our domains and we're
0:28:45 not in our havens nearly as much as she
0:28:47 was
0:28:48 but um
0:28:49 jane was pretty strong she's
0:28:51 she's a um somebody took her somebody
0:28:53 definitely took her from here something
0:28:55 from her past has caught her she was
0:28:57 it's not the jihad it's not kindred we
0:29:00 have a pass before that too it's
0:29:02 possible but how many things from your
0:29:03 past can smash their way into your haven
0:29:05 and take you
0:29:07 when you strong like james to be honest
0:29:09 too
0:29:10 if you look at the smashing
0:29:12 this uh doesn't look like potents it
0:29:14 also depends on the time this doesn't
0:29:16 feel like the killing spree this isn't
0:29:19 sabot no maybe there'd be there'd be a
0:29:21 lot more
0:29:23 obvious signs claw marks things like
0:29:26 that this is i i don't know what the
0:29:28 hell this is but something took her and
0:29:30 i i don't i don't think it was kindred
0:29:32 johnny
0:29:33 but
0:29:35 how many
0:29:37 they came at us during the day too
0:29:39 and we still
0:29:41 how many how many things from your past
0:29:43 um you know if going off miles theory
0:29:45 how many
0:29:47 how many things can come in here and
0:29:48 just take a bruja in her haven a haven
0:29:50 that had way more security adventures
0:29:52 than than miles your house has none the
0:29:55 brujas office is aware of all of the
0:29:58 the criminal organizations in new haven
0:30:00 we didn't have any enemies amongst them
0:30:03 currently jane was connected to suarez
0:30:05 though wasn't she oh i don't know she
0:30:07 knew suarez suarez is a cop
0:30:10 was a cop that's that's not the
0:30:12 yeah i don't know um no my point is she
0:30:15 was someone from her past that did her
0:30:17 right
0:30:17 but did that make her an enemy of the
0:30:19 people he's put away so should we just
0:30:21 call him and ask him if he's seen her
0:30:22 then because
0:30:24 i mean it might be a little suspicious
0:30:26 but if he knows her i mean does he do we
0:30:28 have his number i mean he was publicly
0:30:30 listed we could get his number that's
0:30:32 not hard
0:30:33 even if we don't have his number we can
0:30:35 do that afterwards i'm not saying that's
0:30:36 the right call i'm just saying um let's
0:30:38 take a look around more i'm gonna
0:30:40 look around gather more clues also if
0:30:42 britta was right and she's helping let's
0:30:44 say battered women get away from abusers
0:30:47 that could make her some not small
0:30:49 number of enemies yeah but how many
0:30:51 enemy again how many enemies can smash
0:30:53 their way into a brouha's heavily
0:30:55 protected haven i mean smashing their
0:30:56 way in is one thing but and then and
0:30:58 then taking off with her that's another
0:31:02 hostage jane
0:31:04 jane i'm sure has her fair share of
0:31:06 secrets from her past but she was not
0:31:08 the type to hide anything from the
0:31:10 sheriff's office they could come back to
0:31:11 buy her does jane have a water bed
0:31:13 what does jane have a water bed
0:31:16 what does that have to do i need it
0:31:18 would help a lot or a fish tank her her
0:31:20 bedroom's over there take a look we
0:31:22 didn't touch anything that's per your
0:31:24 request i go to look if jane has some
0:31:26 sort of fish tank in here because it
0:31:27 seems to match the aesthetic or if her
0:31:29 bed is a water bed she has neither damn
0:31:31 it bunch of alcohol bottles maybe
0:31:33 no
0:31:34 toilet
0:31:37 i look in the bathroom has the bathroom
0:31:39 been touched
0:31:40 like has anyone been in there
0:31:42 no no toilet's not gonna help
0:31:44 not this time
0:31:47 what is your obsession with water
0:31:50 water has memory the [ __ ] does that mean
0:31:52 it means that water has memory and some
0:31:55 of us have made covenants
0:31:57 with enki to be able to understand it
0:32:01 and to see what it shows
0:32:03 so if she had a [ __ ] fish tank i
0:32:05 could see what happened in this room but
0:32:06 she doesn't and if she had a water bed i
0:32:08 could see what happened in there but i
0:32:10 don't
0:32:11 because she doesn't
0:32:12 so we're gonna have to do things a
0:32:13 little bit different so you tell me
0:32:15 water records time for you i mean it
0:32:17 makes sense the water cycle all water is
0:32:20 recycled only some water all right so
0:32:23 what can we do differently would these
0:32:25 papers help you more than they help me
0:32:27 is there stuff that you can touch and
0:32:29 look at i don't know i don't know um i
0:32:31 need like a face or a name i could try
0:32:34 jane i only have a couple of these
0:32:35 though
0:32:36 from here maybe here's a starting point
0:32:38 it's only been a couple of nights so and
0:32:40 he uh unzips his fanny pack and pulls
0:32:43 out a long length of white satin ribbon
0:32:46 hey neil yeah would um if there's any
0:32:50 brita will turn on her heightened senses
0:32:53 for vision and look at the glass table
0:32:56 to try and see if she can spot any blood
0:32:58 is there any
0:32:59 blood would that help whatever you're
0:33:01 doing you do not spot any blood
0:33:04 i don't see any i mean yeah it would
0:33:06 have been helpful but it's fine do you
0:33:08 see fingerprints well uh hopefully
0:33:10 there's a lot of her stuff in here what
0:33:11 whatever i mean johnny you knew are the
0:33:13 best what in here was the most like
0:33:15 personal to her i mean obviously this
0:33:17 whole place is personal to her but what
0:33:20 is the thing that is the most
0:33:22 essence of jane
0:33:24 any little bit helps
0:33:26 that clipboard can could work fine but i
0:33:28 mean we're at the heart of it here this
0:33:30 whole place is a shrine
0:33:32 of everything she loved
0:33:34 if you need a place that's probably got
0:33:36 the most energy of her i'd lay right in
0:33:39 her bed if i were you
0:33:40 is that okay
0:33:41 if she gets mad at me about it like that
0:33:44 i'm telling her this is your idea and he
0:33:46 starts to lay down on the bed the bed's
0:33:47 pretty comfy as he's there he starts
0:33:49 unrolling the white satin ribbon and
0:33:53 tries to just
0:33:54 picture jane says her name in his head
0:33:58 and surrounds himself with her energy
0:34:01 and like the heart of her haven and then
0:34:03 looks at johnny i was like hey man um
0:34:04 you got a lighter on you right
0:34:06 yeah reaches into his pocket removes his
0:34:09 zippo and kind of holds it up do me a
0:34:10 favor and um light the end of this
0:34:12 ribbon uh and if if we gotta go
0:34:15 if if it's time to go
0:34:17 we gotta go because i only got a couple
0:34:18 of these i'm sorry what just light the
0:34:21 end of the ribbon for me and if i say
0:34:22 hey we gotta go now then
0:34:24 okay let's hurry up because we got a
0:34:26 limited window here he looks like he has
0:34:27 limited understanding of what he means
0:34:29 but he does understand light the end of
0:34:31 the ribbon so he reaches out
0:34:32 flips the zippo and
0:34:35 lights the end of the ribbon on fire and
0:34:37 lex i am going to try and trace the path
0:34:40 or rather i guess illuminate the trail
0:34:42 of prey that's the yep
0:34:46 five successes so success okay uh a
0:34:50 trail is lightly illuminated for you uh
0:34:53 and you're able to follow it it's
0:34:55 faint because it's a little bit old but
0:34:57 there's enough there uh okay okay
0:34:59 everybody we gotta go
0:35:00 um we got a limited time so uh follow me
0:35:03 all right and he just he's like already
0:35:06 looking at something that no one else
0:35:07 can see like he's following a rope
0:35:10 uh or some sort of obvious illuminated
0:35:13 path and he just goes back out
0:35:15 presumably back to the elevator it does
0:35:16 lead to the elevator yes okay well we
0:35:19 gotta go this way and uh
0:35:21 hopefully
0:35:22 this will help i'm gonna be
0:35:23 concentrating elsewhere though so uh if
0:35:25 we're gonna be walking around the
0:35:26 streets of new haven can you guys make
0:35:27 sure that yep i'm not gonna be paying
0:35:28 attention anything except for this i'm
0:35:30 keeping an eye out okay thank you and he
0:35:33 starts following the trail of jane okay
0:35:36 the trail does lead out onto the street
0:35:39 so you're probably gonna need to follow
0:35:40 in a vehicle okay um uh so okay i'll
0:35:43 i'll um yeah let's get in the car and uh
0:35:45 just follow my directions um don't drive
0:35:47 too fast though i might lose it miles do
0:35:49 you mind if he's a shotgun i assume so
0:35:51 johnny loads up the uh the blazer with
0:35:53 his coterie
0:35:54 gets uh
0:35:56 his dowsing rod in the front seat
0:35:59 and he starts uh driving
0:36:01 following uh neil's directions nearly
0:36:04 follow the directions and it leads to a
0:36:07 cul-de-sac not too far from the edge of
0:36:08 the park and as you head into the
0:36:11 cul-de-sac
0:36:12 when
0:36:13 you recognize where you're going
0:36:17 and before even neil says we're here
0:36:20 you arrive
0:36:22 to miss pirillo's home joey's mom
0:36:25 [Music]
0:36:32 oh [ __ ]
0:36:33 hey we're here this is yeah
0:36:36 um wait what this is joey's house this
0:36:39 is joey's house why are we at joey's
0:36:41 house i don't know why we're at joey's
0:36:43 house joey said that is he was talking
0:36:45 to his mom that he
0:36:47 his mom could see him you've been here
0:36:49 before yeah i brought something to his
0:36:52 mom
0:36:52 is his mom a medium
0:36:54 that was going to be my question as far
0:36:56 as i know no i don't think she saw him
0:36:58 when when we dropped off the whistle is
0:37:00 that her car in the driveway
0:37:02 yeah lex are there any other vehicles in
0:37:05 the driveway no
0:37:07 specifically not just the one right does
0:37:10 the house look normal looking it over
0:37:13 with that heightened vision this house
0:37:15 looks like every other house in the gold
0:37:18 stack they're actually like designed the
0:37:19 same and kind of
0:37:21 all mirror each other well so
0:37:24 okay i don't know what i don't know what
0:37:25 this means but this is where the trail
0:37:27 ends
0:37:28 this is a weird scenario
0:37:30 did jane have anything to do with the
0:37:33 dead
0:37:34 not that i know of it's a pretty small
0:37:36 circle in in new haven all right win
0:37:39 with me
0:37:40 up front we're going to go check we're
0:37:41 going to go through the front door
0:37:43 knocking hold on when have you had
0:37:45 interaction with this woman before i was
0:37:47 an owl but yeah um
0:37:50 maybe
0:37:52 maybe we don't just go rolling up on
0:37:54 this woman's front door
0:37:56 the whole group of us
0:37:58 i mean you guys can stay and keep an eye
0:38:00 out but
0:38:01 meanwin should approach the front door
0:38:03 it's just the two of you yeah and then
0:38:04 the three of you can
0:38:06 eyes out look through windows without
0:38:08 trying to be super conspicuous once
0:38:09 again i can just go look
0:38:12 maybe that's worth a shot what's
0:38:14 possible negative possible negative
0:38:16 i'm out there doing stuff and something
0:38:18 bad happens to my body which we won't
0:38:20 let happen so nothing can interfere with
0:38:22 your looking
0:38:23 the world's a big place miles but okay
0:38:26 if you think it's possibility but i i
0:38:29 think it might have been a bad idea at a
0:38:31 chantry where there was weird spirits
0:38:33 walking around it yeah that was salem
0:38:35 that was what made me hesitate but this
0:38:36 is this is a house in the suburbs of new
0:38:38 haven i have a feeling he'll be all
0:38:40 right
0:38:40 well then let's hold in the car and you
0:38:42 can do that just a quick look no neil if
0:38:46 can medium see you when you do your and
0:38:48 she makes little walking motions with
0:38:50 her fingers i do not know the answer to
0:38:52 that question we'll find out soon enough
0:38:53 let me give it a shot i'm gonna step
0:38:55 outside my body so you'll be able to
0:38:57 tell me pretty quick if you do okay can
0:38:59 you hear me i can see and hear
0:39:01 everything johnny pops some morally into
0:39:03 his mouth
0:39:04 let's see see how this works
0:39:06 lights up all right i haven't really
0:39:08 done this a whole lot so um
0:39:10 okay here we go
0:39:12 and neil will try and
0:39:14 force his mind into the astral realm go
0:39:16 for it jitters he's not able to do it
0:39:19 [ __ ]
0:39:22 i mean if i [ __ ] up the role yeah it
0:39:23 just gets you nervous
0:39:27 i mean yeah right i think a botch of
0:39:29 that would be bad wouldn't it
0:39:31 so neil will spend a point of willpower
0:39:34 and uh this is a short jaunt because i
0:39:36 can see where i'm going so dip five
0:39:40 seven successes
0:39:43 not enough
0:39:45 with seven successes you
0:39:48 leave your body everyone sees kneel
0:39:50 slump and
0:39:51 you
0:39:52 emerge from your body into the
0:39:54 cul-de-sac the stars are of course like
0:39:57 especially bright
0:39:58 there's this vibrant energy that kind of
0:40:01 flows through this area
0:40:03 the first thing that neil does as he
0:40:04 sort of steps up out of his body
0:40:07 is wave his hand really fast in front of
0:40:09 his face do i see anything you do not
0:40:12 wind just kind of blinks and makes no
0:40:14 reaction oh well that's one question
0:40:16 answered and then he starts projecting
0:40:19 himself at the speed of thought over
0:40:21 towards the house floating through the
0:40:24 doors looking to
0:40:26 look around and find jane
0:40:28 okay roll wall power
0:40:29 oh no
0:40:35 your hands big enough their cheeks of
0:40:37 course it's a lot of dice rob that he's
0:40:39 rolling there yeah don't like this
0:40:41 what'd you get
0:40:42 six successes okay uh you arrive to the
0:40:45 entrance of the home and find yourself
0:40:46 unable to enter ugh um you find yourself
0:40:50 lacking the will to proceed
0:40:53 come on
0:40:55 come on
0:40:57 that's why this never happens um
0:40:59 okay
0:41:00 neil i guess we'll just sort of like go
0:41:02 around the house looking on the outside
0:41:04 seeing if he can see anything and
0:41:06 occasionally trying to like press the
0:41:07 windows or the walls or just trying to
0:41:09 get into this space you find yourself
0:41:11 unable to gain access however on the
0:41:13 window to the attic there is something
0:41:15 that you see and peering in you can see
0:41:19 a
0:41:20 group of people
0:41:22 one of them you immediately recognize to
0:41:24 be detective suarez
0:41:26 who is
0:41:27 sitting down across from
0:41:31 gene who looks to be in some pretty
0:41:32 rough shape there is a wooden stake
0:41:35 driven into her heart
0:41:37 detective suarez seems to be taking some
0:41:39 notes
0:41:40 accompanying him
0:41:41 you recognize
0:41:43 the cab driver ramirez who is
0:41:46 slumped in a seat appearing at
0:41:49 jane with like a
0:41:51 almost like a saddened expression and
0:41:54 there is two young women and uh an older
0:41:59 woman who is likely the parent that
0:42:02 um was discussing
0:42:04 um
0:42:06 oh boy
0:42:08 i um
0:42:10 okay
0:42:11 and neil follows the silver thread back
0:42:14 to his body okay and in the car in the
0:42:18 real realm just
0:42:20 sits back up
0:42:21 um
0:42:22 back already huh yeah i can't get in the
0:42:25 house why not i don't know the answer to
0:42:28 that question i um i jus it's like
0:42:31 something was keeping me out did you try
0:42:33 the door i tried the door and i tried
0:42:35 the windows on every level of the house
0:42:37 and i tried to go in the chimney and i
0:42:39 tried to go through the walls and i
0:42:41 can't get in the house it's like like
0:42:44 there's like a like a curtain of will
0:42:47 drawn over the whole thing i can't get
0:42:49 in a curtain of will it's the best way i
0:42:51 can describe it johnny who was looking
0:42:53 flippant when you first said that you
0:42:54 couldn't get in and kind of made a crack
0:42:56 about the door then certainly starts to
0:42:58 look like he's getting actually
0:42:59 concerned because he sees
0:43:02 how concerned you are about this
0:43:04 i did get to see through the windows i
0:43:06 couldn't get in but the windows weren't
0:43:07 closed uh they're in the attic
0:43:10 jane is up there she's staked and she
0:43:12 looks pretty rough [ __ ] suarez is up
0:43:15 there
0:43:16 uh he looks
0:43:17 uh he's he's looking at her he looks and
0:43:19 he doesn't know what to do um do you
0:43:21 guys remember that cab driver guy
0:43:23 uh that picked us up on new year's and a
0:43:25 couple other times uh rodriguez no no no
0:43:28 that was his name it's something like
0:43:29 that though what was his ramirez you
0:43:31 remember ramirez yeah i remember yeah
0:43:33 ramirez is up there too and i don't know
0:43:36 i'm gonna guess it's the girl's mom and
0:43:37 then like two other girls two other
0:43:39 women i i didn't recognize them or uh
0:43:41 joey's mom not the girls but you said
0:43:44 i i would assume right she's the only
0:43:46 five people up there there are five
0:43:47 people up there including er except for
0:43:50 jane there's in addition to jane there's
0:43:52 five people up there with her yeah it's
0:43:54 uh so it was it's it's suarez and
0:43:57 ramirez ramirez looked upset like like
0:44:00 he's not happy with how things are going
0:44:02 um like sad for jane unhappy um
0:44:06 and then uh joey's mom would be my guest
0:44:09 and some some girl i didn't recognize uh
0:44:11 and then um
0:44:15 um
0:44:17 spread it out
0:44:18 um worried about johnny
0:44:20 freaking out when puts a hand on
0:44:22 johnny's shoulder hearing that johnny
0:44:25 gives him a fixed stare
0:44:27 and before he can say anything pops the
0:44:30 door and starts marching towards the
0:44:32 front door of the house no no johnny
0:44:33 johnny johnny johnny johnny johnny
0:44:36 this is why we're supposed to just say
0:44:37 it yeah but i didn't want him a frenzy

0:44:40 it before he gets to the house it was
0:44:41 his daughter it's his daughter is in
0:44:43 there uh he's on the way to the house
0:44:44 already when runs johnny arrives to the
0:44:46 front door

0:44:55 response
0:44:57 this is
0:44:58 there a doorbell
0:44:59 there is a doorbell he hits the doorbell
0:45:01 three times
0:45:03 and then knocks again
0:45:06 after a wait
0:45:08 a woman opens the door when you
0:45:11 recognize her to be miss perello
0:45:13 joey's mom
0:45:14 she
0:45:15 opens the door with a bit of a stern
0:45:17 expression

0:45:28 gonna throw everything on the table and
0:45:29 you can take it for what it is i'm
0:45:32 taking care of your son
0:45:34 johnny gives her a sideways glance
0:45:37 little boy named joey right
0:45:39 good boy oh
0:45:41 what are you doing
0:45:42 why are you here
0:45:44 a friend of mine is upstairs with
0:45:47 with the rest of you
0:45:48 and how do you know that
0:45:50 we've met before
0:45:52 have we
0:45:53 yeah look at my eyes
0:45:55 you
0:45:56 and the things like you
0:45:58 are not welcome here
0:46:01 and as soon as we find a way to fix you
0:46:03 i'll be happy to have the conversation
0:46:05 about fixing you
0:46:06 but until then
0:46:08 you need to stay off of my property we
0:46:10 need to get our friend back
0:46:12 she is a good woman and she doesn't
0:46:14 deserve what you're doing to her
0:46:15 girl named jessica upstairs
0:46:18 no
0:46:19 she shuts the door
0:46:21 he puts a hand out and stops it from
0:46:23 shutting oh you
0:46:25 need to roll will power if you intend to
0:46:26 reach into
0:46:30 don't think this is gonna go well
0:46:31 because you've got how many successes
0:46:33 than that and that wasn't working i got
0:46:34 six successes
0:46:37 i don't suppose iron will helps out here
0:46:39 does it
0:46:41 uh no it's not mind control
0:46:43 that's only four successes
0:46:46 you reach for the door and find yourself
0:46:49 unable
0:46:50 to trespass past the border of that
0:46:54 doorway and the door just shuts
0:46:56 johnny kind of incredulously looks at
0:46:58 his hand and blinks a few times
0:47:00 looks over it when
0:47:02 did you see that
0:47:04 yeah i
0:47:05 he goes to try and touch the door again
0:47:07 realizes he can't what the hell is this
0:47:09 place we're not dealing with something
0:47:11 normal here johnny
0:47:12 regroup okay
0:47:14 back to the blazer can we just call the
0:47:18 talk
0:47:19 if we can't get in the house we can't
0:47:20 get we need them to give us jane i know
0:47:22 i don't know that that's gonna work when
0:47:24 you notice the curtains up on the second
0:47:26 floor open and
0:47:28 there is a young woman who
0:47:30 starts
0:47:31 snapping photos of the two of you from
0:47:33 the window wind pulls her hoodie down
0:47:35 more johnny will actually recognize this
0:47:38 to be sheila from the bar uh he
0:47:41 just blatantly looks up at her
0:47:43 puts his hands on his hips
0:47:45 points at her and makes a come out here
0:47:49 a gesture ah she seems pretty
0:47:51 intimidated by that and uh closes the
0:47:53 curtains do you know her too
0:47:57 it's a young girl from the bar over at
0:47:59 the uh the sherwood i helped her out
0:48:01 with her boyfriend something happened to
0:48:03 him in new york something real bad okay
0:48:06 well you helped her out your daughter's
0:48:08 in there uh
0:48:09 we we um
0:48:11 you see him kind of like when you
0:48:13 actually physically say in his presence
0:48:15 that it's his daughter like
0:48:16 near him i'm assuming you're out of the
0:48:18 car now right i mean by the car but yes
0:48:21 enough where you can hear you see him
0:48:23 kind of just tense up a little bit um so
0:48:25 i guess uh like i don't think we're
0:48:27 getting in we're not we're not
0:48:29 lex can i make an occult roll no okay i
0:48:33 pushed everything i had against and
0:48:36 you know in that context i'm not exactly
0:48:39 powerful the problem now is that if one
0:48:42 of us manages to get in we're going to
0:48:43 be by ourselves and i don't know if we
0:48:45 can get back out beats me but i don't
0:48:47 circle up around the car so they can't
0:48:49 hear us discuss things johnny kind of
0:48:51 walks to the side of the door just tries
0:48:54 to put a hand out on the house you have
0:48:56 been able to do it until you knocked
0:48:58 gotcha but anything passed seems to not
0:49:01 function what if he tries to like dig
0:49:02 his hand in like like put his nails
0:49:05 underneath the siding does like is it
0:49:07 like like if you wanna if if he starts
0:49:09 to kind of like formulate the intention
0:49:11 of ripping off a piece of siding is that
0:49:14 where his where his hand is suddenly
0:49:15 stopped no you find yourself able to do
0:49:17 that are you ripping up the sighting no
0:49:19 no no he's just testing to see where the
0:49:21 limits of this are in the car miles in
0:49:24 the car on the other side at least all
0:49:26 right
0:49:27 can we just we call them it's possible
0:49:31 but i just don't want to be out in the
0:49:32 yard discussing it
0:49:34 let's get in the car all right
0:49:36 johnny you and wyn seem like you have
0:49:39 maybe the best chance at getting them to
0:49:41 talk to you and i know they just didn't
0:49:43 want to but how do you think we can
0:49:45 maybe get them to try again my mind is
0:49:48 absolutely racing right now apparently
0:49:50 inside that house is my daughter
0:49:53 some woman from the sherwood that i
0:49:55 helped detective suarez the mother of a
0:50:00 son ghost boy
0:50:02 that win has looked out for and one of
0:50:04 my dearest friends in the in the
0:50:06 camarilla and a cabbie that we
0:50:09 interacted with i have no idea what the
0:50:12 hell this is this is the weirdest
0:50:13 conspiracy i've ever heard because
0:50:15 they're all you can say that again and
0:50:17 they're generally attached to us it is a
0:50:19 massive masquerade breach is what it is
0:50:21 yes that's part of what i was thinking
0:50:23 and somehow
0:50:24 their sorceried their way
0:50:27 a way to protect from us
0:50:28 i mean i guess do you think reese has a
0:50:30 hand here i don't think rhys helps
0:50:32 anyone this he might help somebody if
0:50:34 it's a way of getting at us this is i
0:50:36 don't think he would care about our cab
0:50:38 driver i don't think he would go at us
0:50:39 through jane either i mean are they
0:50:41 still
0:50:42 people
0:50:43 or
0:50:44 they can't be i can look
0:50:47 if i see one of them again um they close
0:50:49 that it makes more sense that it's
0:50:51 something that might be used in the
0:50:52 faces of these people we have a couple
0:50:54 options here
0:50:55 we also need to test
0:50:57 if this is affecting
0:50:58 other individuals besides ourselves
0:51:00 johnny
0:51:02 yeah when's your daughter's birthday
0:51:04 name's jessica she was born on august 10
0:51:07 1980. she's got your last name as far as
0:51:10 i know yeah
0:51:12 that's good enough
0:51:13 and neil is going to try and ritual
0:51:16 important to see same same way he did
0:51:18 against arabella to see what the major
0:51:20 forces are going on in her life just to
0:51:21 rule out some reef stuff are you
0:51:24 doing this right here oh we're in the
0:51:26 car right yeah yeah i guess okay so you
0:51:28 guys are going back into the car yeah my
0:51:30 also told us to get back yeah yeah yeah
0:51:33 johnny's standing out on the street
0:51:35 outside of the car because he's pacing
0:51:37 you can't pace in the driver's seat
0:51:41 neil takes five minutes and
0:51:43 four successes with
0:51:46 four successes
0:51:48 you know
0:51:49 that there are no strings on her
0:51:51 at all nothing you can clearly see and
0:51:55 instead it seems that she is
0:51:58 awake
0:51:59 and making choices
0:52:02 for herself there's a strength to her
0:52:04 that that you have not really seen in
0:52:06 humans
0:52:07 neil takes a little notebook out of his
0:52:09 fanny pack and like
0:52:11 looks at little star maps real quick and
0:52:14 continues to do stuff as johnny paces
0:52:16 around the car for a couple of minutes
0:52:18 and then looks over that's just
0:52:20 i i don't understand don't understand
0:52:23 what that's not rhys it's not it's not
0:52:25 anyone it's not even that nobody's
0:52:28 pulling her strings she doesn't even
0:52:29 have strings it's like
0:52:32 it's like her eyes are open
0:52:34 for the first time and she's making all
0:52:36 sorts of choices on her own
0:52:38 like i haven't seen
0:52:40 i haven't seen this kind of
0:52:42 how do you describe it clarity of
0:52:44 purpose strength of will i i don't know
0:52:46 in
0:52:47 in
0:52:48 i've barely seen that kind of thing in
0:52:50 kindred
0:52:51 let alone just a just a person and she's
0:52:53 just a person
0:52:54 this doesn't make any sense johnny snaps
0:52:56 over to the window that's my daughter
0:52:58 you're talking about and she's a person
0:53:00 and i'm saying that she has more will
0:53:03 and more
0:53:04 purpose more i don't know
0:53:07 i don't know johnny i don't know
0:53:08 nobody's pulling her string she doesn't
0:53:10 even have them you have strings miles
0:53:12 has struck we all have everybody has
0:53:14 strings she doesn't have any all right
0:53:16 we have a couple options here
0:53:18 one seemingly we can't get inside i
0:53:21 don't know if this portrays to everyone
0:53:23 or not
0:53:24 but
0:53:24 i know that it's unlikely for us to be
0:53:27 able to do that now i don't know if that
0:53:28 prevents other things from going inside
0:53:32 but
0:53:34 we can use
0:53:36 mortal forces if we want to escalate
0:53:38 this what do you mean escalate
0:53:41 you they have a dead person upstairs
0:53:44 yeah but that's what cops are for
0:53:47 but these are good people these are
0:53:50 people that we've
0:53:51 met along the way people that have
0:53:53 helped us and and we can't talk to them
0:53:56 and we can't leave jane with them do we
0:53:58 have suarez's number do we have your
0:54:00 daughter's number johnny do you have the
0:54:03 bar girl's number i mean i think we've
0:54:05 got ramirez's number
0:54:07 we've called on him a couple of times as
0:54:09 a cab plus he's a dispatch we could just
0:54:12 we could call and talk before we start
0:54:14 calling the cops on people i could get
0:54:15 because i could get suarez's number from
0:54:17 the office
0:54:18 i
0:54:20 don't have a number for my daughter
0:54:23 i think she called from the house line
0:54:25 every time she called my beeper
0:54:28 uh sheila
0:54:29 i could call the [ __ ] the sherwood and
0:54:31 get her number
0:54:33 i feel like we need to talk to these
0:54:35 people i i agree with britta
0:54:37 they're not
0:54:38 they're a big masquerade problem right
0:54:40 now but they're not part of it is i
0:54:42 don't know people
0:54:44 and if they won't talk to us then what
0:54:46 i don't know they've got jane
0:54:48 that's they've got jane because as soon
0:54:50 as we started pushing some of these
0:54:52 buttons they're going to get spooked
0:54:54 they're already spooked we're outside
0:54:55 their house we're doing the thing where
0:54:57 we're putting the cart before the horse
0:54:58 let's try calling them and then we can
0:54:59 escalate from there if we have to who
0:55:01 should we try calling
0:55:03 maybe sheila first who was in charge
0:55:05 when you were looking upstairs
0:55:07 tough to tell
0:55:08 suarez has a sense of authority about
0:55:10 him but i don't know if he's in charge
0:55:12 probably safe there i think the the
0:55:15 easiest phone number to get would
0:55:16 probably be sheila
0:55:19 ramirez looked the most sympathetic to
0:55:21 jane if it helps that might be an n
0:55:23 right there or at least he looked upset
0:55:26 at the condition she was in
0:55:28 sheila or ramirez who are we pulling
0:55:29 this trigger on
0:55:31 take it to a vote call sheila i don't
0:55:34 have ramirez's number currently and i
0:55:36 don't want to go through my records i
0:55:38 don't have anyone to go through my
0:55:39 records
0:55:40 can i borrow someone's phone bretta
0:55:42 hands her phone over to johnny with a
0:55:45 little bit of assistance on getting it
0:55:46 started he dials in the number for the
0:55:48 sherwood sherbet
0:55:50 hey
0:55:51 how's it going tonight it's saxon how
0:55:53 you doing saxon

0:56:01 woman who works for you the one i helped
0:56:03 out a few weeks back sheila yeah oh yeah
0:56:07 she quit
0:56:08 did she
0:56:09 yeah

0:56:14 installed her happen to have her number
0:56:15 do you yeah i still got let me let me
0:56:17 check for it give me a minute i
0:56:18 appreciate it you kind of hear the
0:56:19 sounds of like a bar starting to kind of
0:56:22 really get active in the background
0:56:24 20 30 seconds go by and before he's back
0:56:27 on the line hey uh yeah here's the
0:56:29 number i guess it's gonna be five five
0:56:31 five and then he like rattles off a
0:56:32 number johnny uh pulls out a pencil and
0:56:34 some paper because that's something he
0:56:36 definitely carries on him and uh
0:56:37 scratches down the number everything
0:56:39 okay
0:56:40 yeah absolutely i just wanted to make
0:56:42 sure she was doing all right uh
0:56:45 that uh that business with her boyfriend
0:56:46 wasn't nothing yeah everything uh
0:56:49 everything good around the bar lately
0:56:50 yeah so about the boyfriend um
0:56:54 the police were by
0:56:56 had some questions about them but once i
0:56:58 let them know that she wasn't working
0:56:59 here anymore they kind of moved on
0:57:01 the police anyone in particular
0:57:03 no i didn't really get any names it was
0:57:05 a pretty quick ordeal
0:57:07 uh beat cop or detective i look like b
0:57:09 cops all right well you take care of
0:57:11 yourself you get you uh you hit my
0:57:12 beeper up if you need anything yeah yeah
0:57:14 same johnny hangs up and then uh using
0:57:17 the number he's just scratched down
0:57:19 dials it back into the uh cell phone and
0:57:21 waits
0:57:23 it rings for a bit but eventually you're
0:57:26 a quiet hello
0:57:28 sheila
0:57:29 what do you want this is johnny saxon
0:57:32 i'm i'm assuming you remember me
0:57:34 i remember you
0:57:36 are you uh
0:57:37 upstairs
0:57:39 i'm not really a liberty to discuss okay
0:57:42 i'll take that as a
0:57:43 as a yes however you need to take it
0:57:46 the person
0:57:47 that you have upstairs
0:57:50 is a friend of mine
0:57:52 and i would appreciate it
0:57:54 if you let them go
0:57:56 now i don't know
0:57:58 what kind of negotiations we need to
0:58:00 make to see that happen
0:58:01 but i'm willing to make those
0:58:03 negotiations
0:58:05 johnny
0:58:07 you are
0:58:09 sick
0:58:10 afflicted with something terrible
0:58:14 and i know know exactly how we're going
0:58:16 to fix it but we will
0:58:18 i know
0:58:21 i know what's going on with
0:58:23 with your friend is scary
0:58:26 but it's a necessary part of the process
0:58:28 to making you better
0:58:29 look
0:58:31 you have
0:58:33 the vaguest idea of what's going on with
0:58:36 me and my friends
0:58:38 johnny i know that there's something
0:58:39 wrong with you
0:58:40 and it makes you hurt people
0:58:42 and i know that sometimes you feel
0:58:43 really really bad
0:58:45 and i know that you're barely legal to
0:58:47 drink alcohol so i think your view of
0:58:50 the world is probably a little bit
0:58:52 limited and if i understand it correctly
0:58:54 you also have an 18 year old girl up
0:58:56 there by the name jessica right johnny
0:58:58 i'm going to pretend you didn't just try
0:58:59 to condescend me
0:59:01 oh i certainly did just condescend you
0:59:04 know now you're making descending johnny
0:59:06 she hangs up buddy that was not a
0:59:08 productive conversation you see him roll
0:59:11 over the
0:59:12 strong desire to crush the phone reaches
0:59:15 over and picks the phone out of his
0:59:17 hands
0:59:18 bretta reaches over and puts her palm
0:59:20 over neal's mouth
0:59:23 wayne hands the phone back to britain
0:59:24 bretta uses her other hand to take her
0:59:26 phone back puts it in her pocket does
0:59:29 not remove her palm from neil's mouth is
0:59:31 that anything learned in that
0:59:32 conversation
0:59:34 no
0:59:36 other than the fact that
0:59:38 i'm pretty sure that that was sheila
0:59:41 and they think that we're sick
0:59:44 with something
0:59:46 i mean in a sense
0:59:48 i mean
0:59:49 wait what if they're right what if this
0:59:51 is like an illness that could be cured
0:59:54 it's more of a curse than an illness but
0:59:56 yes
0:59:57 if they're trying to to fix us and
1:00:00 make us not
1:00:02 vampires
1:00:04 we're
1:00:05 dead
1:00:07 i if they fix being a vampire
1:00:10 or just a corpse
1:00:12 fixing this [ __ ]
1:00:14 is something that all of us have thought
1:00:16 about
1:00:17 a lot
1:00:20 you have had a very
1:00:21 busy few months
1:00:24 learning how to just survive as a
1:00:25 kindred but let me tell you after the
1:00:28 first couple of years
1:00:30 you start getting really desperate
1:00:32 trying to fix this you start doing
1:00:34 things
1:00:35 to test the limits of this curse
1:00:39 and it can get really bad
1:00:41 and not everybody makes it through
1:00:44 but eventually you learn to live with
1:00:46 this
1:00:47 or you don't because you're not
1:00:48 something that needs to be fixed you're
1:00:50 something new
1:00:52 did they sound like they had like
1:00:54 a plan
1:00:55 to fix uh surface drain or
1:00:58 to be perfectly honest sheila still
1:01:00 sounds like the
1:01:01 obnoxious bartender that i helped out a
1:01:04 couple of weeks ago
1:01:06 when i saw them in the attic it kind of
1:01:08 i got the impression that they were
1:01:10 debating
1:01:11 i don't know how organized this little
1:01:15 clique is here
1:01:16 if maybe we could help them with however
1:01:19 they want to try and fix us i mean
1:01:22 neil said it was something that he'd
1:01:23 never
1:01:24 seen in people before
1:01:26 maybe they know something the magic that
1:01:28 they have that's are they trying to fix
1:01:31 jane is that what they're doing or are
1:01:33 they trying to learn how to fix us by
1:01:35 examining jane i don't know either way
1:01:38 good people have kidnapped a person
1:01:40 good people have kidnapped a good person
1:01:42 can you call that number for one more
1:01:44 time
1:01:45 i think i've calmed down and i could
1:01:46 talk to her maybe we let someone who's
1:01:48 not johnny talk to her wait no you still
1:01:50 have your hand over your mouth
1:01:53 you are you've been talking so i assume
1:01:55 that you gently put a filter over all
1:01:57 that
1:01:59 i assume when you started to talk that
1:02:01 brita slowly slipped her hand away a
1:02:04 little bit to let you give your
1:02:06 attention he likes her hands like oh and
1:02:09 he starts talking it gets slapped
1:02:12 do not do that do not speak for me
1:02:19 um
1:02:20 all right johnny
1:02:21 but
1:02:22 yeah maybe just
1:02:24 ask for your daughter if it doesn't work
1:02:27 and britta hands over the phone can you
1:02:30 redial it oh um yeah and bretta takes it
1:02:33 back dials it uh quickly
1:02:35 and hands it to johnny
1:02:37 the phone is now in your hand
1:02:39 i'm wait waiting for the uh is it
1:02:41 ringing okay so you call uh yep it rings
1:02:44 it rings the rings and it goes to uh
1:02:46 like an answering machine shield's
1:02:48 answer machine yeah like it's forwarded
1:02:50 to an answering machine after the uh
1:02:53 the beep happens let me know if i can
1:02:55 put a uh
1:02:56 a call down this is johnny saxon
1:02:59 i have calmed down since our last talk
1:03:03 and i wanted to point out that i realize
1:03:06 that this is
1:03:08 perhaps not the way you would like to
1:03:10 meet or discuss us with us standing
1:03:13 outside of your house
1:03:16 the fact that you have our friend does
1:03:18 not change anything we want her back and
1:03:21 we want to talk about how we can make
1:03:23 that happen
1:03:24 if you can figure out a way where we can
1:03:26 meet on neutral ground somewhere where
1:03:29 you feel safe to talk to us
1:03:32 let us know
1:03:33 if you do not and you ignore us i will
1:03:36 hang up the phone right there you're
1:03:38 talking into a recording
1:03:40 yes
1:03:40 don't get recorded
1:03:42 i was gonna say we have to call the
1:03:44 authorities yeah don't do that either
1:03:46 don't tip them off to our things
1:03:48 we have options but we don't have them
1:03:50 if we start outlining them i don't think
1:03:52 telling them that we can really call the
1:03:54 authorities is uh outlying a possibility
1:03:57 that they're moving your phone is hung
1:03:58 up right
1:04:00 look if we start using authorities we
1:04:02 don't want them time to prepare also i
1:04:04 don't know that calling the cops is
1:04:05 gonna help us because i guarantee suarez
1:04:07 still has friends
1:04:09 so do we
1:04:10 i would outweigh his friends against
1:04:11 ours some of his friends can be sure
1:04:14 here's the issue though miles changed i
1:04:16 can help you
1:04:18 i basically shake my head at him right
1:04:20 now like trying in the middle of trying
1:04:21 to discuss and i just like shake my head
1:04:23 well we can't change his friends i i
1:04:26 mean
1:04:26 well so let's take the logical path the
1:04:29 the sort of
1:04:31 if we call the authorities right and it
1:04:33 goes to like a trial or whatever none of
1:04:35 us have
1:04:36 if i was surprised i would say fine you
1:04:39 know and we'll talk about this maybe
1:04:40 even get arrested or arraigned or or
1:04:42 whatever uh let's talk about this in the
1:04:44 morning i don't think any of us is gonna
1:04:46 show up to an arraignment or stick
1:04:47 around to talk to the cops
1:04:49 or
1:04:50 things and suarez has a lot more
1:04:53 time to talk to them than we do that's
1:04:55 why we have lawyers for a lot of that
1:04:58 and the town runs the city runs itself
1:05:00 yes and no does it right now
1:05:02 the regular city yes but miles how much
1:05:06 of the regular town of new haven do we
1:05:08 really want to get involved with this
1:05:10 that how many how many questions do we
1:05:13 want being brought up
1:05:15 they have figured us out somehow these
1:05:17 problems have existed before and they
1:05:19 have also gone away this problem has not
1:05:21 existed before not in the same fashion
1:05:23 correct trying trying to be as
1:05:26 sober about this as i can
1:05:28 if this was a problem given to me by the
1:05:30 sheriff's office and i was dealing with
1:05:32 this as a bully boy recovering
1:05:34 jane would be the priority pulling her
1:05:37 out of a morgue would not be difficult
1:05:39 and four mortals having effectively been
1:05:43 found with a corpse with a wooden stake
1:05:46 driven through their heart their
1:05:47 testimony be written off as the the
1:05:50 [ __ ] of four crazies they'd be on
1:05:52 the news for maybe a night or two and
1:05:54 then it would be uh swept under the rug
1:05:57 maybe except other thought yeah uh it
1:06:00 seemed like they were debating what to
1:06:01 do with jane and it seemed like there
1:06:04 were a couple of different
1:06:05 sides and if we put a shot clock on that
1:06:08 that would make them make a decision
1:06:09 real fast that's what i said about not
1:06:11 warning them so i mean like cop cars
1:06:14 show up or somebody calls suarez because
1:06:16 he does still have friends in in the
1:06:18 office we can assume i'm trying not to
1:06:20 like just spiral down worst case
1:06:22 scenarios here but we can't get in the
1:06:24 building no okay what if we throw a rock
1:06:27 in there with a message on it okay i
1:06:29 feel like that we can just text them
1:06:31 that may not get to all of them someone
1:06:33 in there is going to be sympathetic to
1:06:34 us i feel like it's probably ramirez i
1:06:36 thought it could have been joey's mom
1:06:38 but apparently she's freaked out
1:06:40 what if it's not a rock i'm hoping that
1:06:42 she'll listens to the message and they
1:06:44 come back with us with an offer of how
1:06:46 they would like to talk to us because i
1:06:48 can't understand that having a group of
1:06:51 kindred outside when they're obviously
1:06:53 tuned in to what we're capable of could
1:06:55 be a very uh
1:06:56 difficult thing to swallow what if it's
1:06:58 not a rock and it's like some kind of
1:07:01 tranquilizer or something and we i guess
1:07:04 we'd have to test miles's theory to see
1:07:05 if we could get someone who wasn't like
1:07:08 us inside but wait tranquilizer you're
1:07:10 talking about gassing the place i don't
1:07:12 know
1:07:12 no
1:07:13 all right following this through if they
1:07:15 don't contact us we can't wait them out
1:07:17 we can't be out here during the day if
1:07:20 they just ignore us we don't have a way
1:07:22 in and we can't what else can we do to
1:07:25 not hurt them to be fair we might have a
1:07:28 way in i just don't know if i want to
1:07:30 cause that level of property damage
1:07:32 driving the car through the wall i'm
1:07:33 pretty sure i can just actually peel
1:07:35 back some of the wall i can jump over
1:07:37 that roof and i can go straight through
1:07:39 that reminder that i tried to do that
1:07:42 you were incorporeal uh-huh and i
1:07:44 couldn't get through the walls or the
1:07:46 windows or the roof
1:07:47 and anything we start doing like that is
1:07:49 very hostile and visible yeah and if i
1:07:52 couldn't project myself through
1:07:53 immaterial matter johnny you might get
1:07:55 six inches into that wall or however big
1:07:57 a wall is and
1:07:59 stop while the group of you are watching
1:08:01 are talking
1:08:03 you start to notice that curtains
1:08:05 windows
1:08:06 all over the cul-de-sac start kind of
1:08:08 like opening and people start watching
1:08:10 the group of you from there inside their
1:08:12 homes
1:08:13 oh god we're still mostly in the car
1:08:15 johnny's just past pacing around yeah
1:08:17 like everyone like people are all like
1:08:19 kind of looking at this car cops are
1:08:21 nothing they might have called the
1:08:22 neighborhood watch johnny get in the car
1:08:24 is this an area of uh new haven where
1:08:26 that might be a case yeah it's
1:08:27 cul-de-sac okay i hate to say this
1:08:30 because i want to help jane but we might
1:08:32 have to just go this could escalate real
1:08:34 bad and not in a way that's favorable to
1:08:37 us right now i don't know how to show
1:08:39 our good intentions if we stay tonight
1:08:42 backing off might be the best way to
1:08:43 show them that we're willing to reason
1:08:45 leave a note in the mailbox and go
1:08:47 johnny will pull out his notebook write
1:08:50 down his beeper number down all of our
1:08:52 numbers johnny i'm gonna i'm gonna put
1:08:54 just the beeper number one down too
1:08:57 okay
1:08:57 he'll put uh he'll put johnny's beeper
1:09:00 number and he'll put wyn's number on the
1:09:01 piece of paper go over to the uh to the
1:09:04 door and basically since he can knock
1:09:07 he'll basically put it under the knocker
1:09:08 on the door when you crouch down to
1:09:10 leave the message at the door the door
1:09:12 opens and
1:09:14 what you see is a
1:09:16 man smaller than you older uh you
1:09:19 definitely recognize
1:09:21 detective suarez he's got like kind of a
1:09:24 moth eaten jacket a yellow button-down
1:09:27 shirt black tie
1:09:29 brown like pants and old shoes that are
1:09:32 all scuffed up johnny kind of uh
1:09:34 looks them up and down and
1:09:37 puts out the uh the note with the phone
1:09:38 numbers on it hands it over to him uh he
1:09:41 does not reach for it kind of shrugs you
1:09:43 kind of get the impression he might not
1:09:44 be wanting to yeah oh absolutely he uh
1:09:47 he bends down and puts it down on the
1:09:48 ground on the uh porch
1:09:51 the man that came with you
1:09:52 who is he the blonde one
1:09:55 friend of mine tell your friend that i
1:09:57 remember everything and he shuts the
1:09:59 door
1:10:00 wind kind of smacks the side of the car
1:10:02 johnny let's go
1:10:04 johnny reaches down picks up the note
1:10:06 pulls the uh the pencil out and uh
1:10:08 underneath the numbers
1:10:10 writes uh
1:10:12 jessica i will pick up this time please
1:10:15 call love dad
1:10:17 puts it back down on the ground and then
1:10:19 heads back over to the car
1:10:24 [Music]
1:10:27 you guys regroup at the car we should
1:10:30 head out
1:10:31 johnny's kind of leaning against the
1:10:32 driver's side door
1:10:34 looking down at the ground
1:10:36 and kind of slowly looks up and in the
1:10:37 car
1:10:39 suarez says he remembers everything mile
1:10:42 i didn't think that was a possibility
1:10:44 neither did i
1:10:46 no no i thought it was a distinct
1:10:47 possibility that he would break through
1:10:49 his will power was has more terrible
1:10:51 have you ever heard of a mortal man ever
1:10:53 breaking through dominate like that
1:10:56 i haven't not in a while
1:10:59 so it's something that can happen
1:11:01 it depends there are things that can
1:11:04 mess with the memory we could talk about
1:11:05 this while driving when's right let's go
1:11:09 johnny gets in
1:11:10 starts the blazer and turns around the
1:11:12 cul-de-sac and starts heading out johnny
1:11:15 um
1:11:16 i'm
1:11:18 sorry this is how you're seeing your
1:11:20 daughter again
1:11:22 he just kind of nods and pops some
1:11:24 morally in his mouth
1:11:26 i don't know
1:11:27 obviously none of us know what's going
1:11:29 on but
1:11:31 yeah i'm
1:11:32 i'm sorry
1:11:34 wind kind of sits in the back seat kind
1:11:35 of sprawled out and
1:11:37 using her thumbnail to clean out her
1:11:39 other nails on her hand
1:11:41 god knows what's under there
1:11:43 so
1:11:44 here's the big question guys
1:11:47 how much of this do we present to the
1:11:48 rest of the domain
1:11:50 none currently
1:11:52 if i was some of this domain
1:11:55 my first instinct wouldn't have been
1:11:57 tranquilizers
1:11:59 they're gonna look at this and see
1:12:01 a bunch of mortals who know too much
1:12:03 right they're gonna see a threat they're
1:12:05 gonna see a threat that's capable of
1:12:07 taking a strong kindred from
1:12:09 out from a well-protected haven
1:12:12 keeping her there
1:12:14 they already wanted to get rid of suarez
1:12:17 right so
1:12:19 if we tell them
1:12:21 then we know how this escalates would it
1:12:24 get us jane back no
1:12:27 if i was the domain
1:12:28 i wouldn't give two shits about getting
1:12:30 jane back in the face of a masquerade
1:12:33 breach like this let alone bred us right
1:12:34 the threat that something like that
1:12:36 could pose where someone could just bust
1:12:38 into your haven and take you like that
1:12:42 i'd throw
1:12:43 send some bully boys to throw a few
1:12:44 molotovs through the windows
1:12:46 and you don't have to get inside you
1:12:48 burn everyone down and even if they
1:12:49 escape jane is still inside
1:12:52 he's not wrong
1:12:54 that's what they'll do currently the
1:12:56 domain is in the know
1:12:58 if we want to try and save james
1:13:01 and if we want to not hurt
1:13:05 these people
1:13:07 i i don't i don't think we can tell them
1:13:10 not until we know more
1:13:12 being that i am senator shaw the domain
1:13:14 is aware
1:13:16 that there are people no i i'm aware
1:13:19 both the senate shall and the acting
1:13:21 sheriff are aware okay yeah so that's
1:13:24 good so we don't have to tell the prince
1:13:25 right i don't think we have the right
1:13:26 mindset
1:13:27 we at least have
1:13:29 we have no actually shouldn't he no uh
1:13:32 well this pertains to him this would be
1:13:34 he's dealing with the thing from quentin
1:13:37 still he will delegate to the sheriff
1:13:39 right it's my job to deal with it
1:13:42 how far are we willing to go with this
1:13:44 i guess the question is who do we prize
1:13:47 more at this point we need to hope that
1:13:49 they're willing to reach out after that
1:13:51 message i left
1:13:53 how much time how bad how bad was i
1:13:57 good not great
1:13:59 that's better than i was i can expect
1:14:01 for
1:14:02 so sometimes like sometimes i kind of
1:14:04 blank out when i start saying things
1:14:05 very nice of you to say when
1:14:07 there was
1:14:09 they've had mixed
1:14:11 interaction with us correct you're a
1:14:13 little aggressive johnny
1:14:15 they already have reason if suarez
1:14:17 remembers what miles said there can you
1:14:20 find jane again if they move her i can
1:14:22 find jane
1:14:23 un unless they
1:14:26 they have no reason to move her we can't
1:14:27 get in
1:14:28 moving her would mean that we have an
1:14:29 opportunity to take her back unless they
1:14:31 think of the same firebombing plan than
1:14:34 i do
1:14:34 paranoid they are
1:14:36 and how much they know about what they
1:14:38 can keep out with whatever sorcery
1:14:40 they're doing who knows they can also
1:14:42 move during the day
1:14:44 right box jane up take her somewhere
1:14:46 else hopefully then if they understand
1:14:48 that
1:14:49 or if they think they understand what we
1:14:51 are
1:14:52 and they
1:14:54 presumably know that we can't be in the
1:14:56 sun hopefully they will take care of her
1:14:58 during the day so
1:15:00 we don't have
1:15:02 a reason to think they're gonna kill her
1:15:03 right away
1:15:05 they've had her couple days and they
1:15:06 broke into her haven
1:15:08 presumably during the day uh with all
1:15:10 the curtains down like that so
1:15:12 they could have just killed her but they
1:15:14 didn't
1:15:15 that's why i'm wondering if they're
1:15:16 studying her
1:15:18 or maybe they're debating like i said i
1:15:20 don't think that was a unified
1:15:22 i mean we fight all the time these
1:15:24 people gotta
1:15:25 we bicker it's the same thing it's just
1:15:27 a degree she says remembering that her
1:15:30 her raven is uh slightly propped up by
1:15:32 cinder blocks
1:15:34 um we need to set
1:15:36 we need to set some form of timer on
1:15:39 this
1:15:40 we can wait for some amount of time to
1:15:43 see johnny if your daughter calls or if
1:15:45 one of them takes you up on it but we
1:15:47 don't know
1:15:48 how long this lasts and
1:15:51 i'm gonna go with the night we need i
1:15:53 think give it a day i think one thing
1:15:55 that we might need to do is is you we
1:15:57 might need to call some people
1:15:59 who are not
1:16:01 to watch kindred i don't know if you
1:16:03 have anybody that you might trust to act
1:16:06 as a negotiator
1:16:07 or at least someone that we can post to
1:16:09 watch them during the day we don't it
1:16:11 doesn't need to be a person to watch
1:16:12 them during the day
1:16:14 what are you thinking birds chaps
1:16:16 okay we need to at least set up that but
1:16:20 we also need to do it in a way where
1:16:22 they
1:16:23 we're not breaking trust with them right
1:16:26 currently but
1:16:28 they are a masquerade threat
1:16:30 they're a threat
1:16:32 not just to the masquerade yeah there
1:16:33 doesn't need to be a qualifier
1:16:36 it could be both but if there's they
1:16:38 broke into a haven and took a vampire
1:16:41 out of her home if they're seen to be a
1:16:43 masquerade threat then us trying to
1:16:46 protect them and that being seen by the
1:16:48 domain will not be well received exactly
1:16:50 thankfully we have a little bit of time
1:16:53 there is a killing spree of sorts that
1:16:56 is a far greater threat and demanding
1:16:59 the attention of most of the core of new
1:17:00 haven
1:17:01 we at least have a couple of nights to
1:17:03 deal with this before
1:17:04 before it gets to anybody else's uh
1:17:06 attention except i also had the
1:17:08 impression that the court was kind of
1:17:09 waiting on us to deal with the skilling
1:17:11 spree at least part of it
1:17:14 so
1:17:15 it's not a they have another problem so
1:17:17 we can deal with this problem so we have
1:17:18 two problems we have three problems
1:17:21 okay we have a lot of problems we have
1:17:23 enough problems that we can move from
1:17:26 this and give it some amount of time
1:17:28 whether that be a night or more we don't
1:17:30 know how much time we have we have no
1:17:32 way of guess guessing how much time we
1:17:34 have but we do have other things that we
1:17:36 can focus on
1:17:37 while we're hoping that they'll call us
1:17:38 back right so we set some sort of timer
1:17:42 and we decide
1:17:43 how far we're willing to escalate when
1:17:45 we know that they're not
1:17:48 when we can't wait any longer for them
1:17:49 to reach out the longer
1:17:51 we wait the more prepared they are
1:17:54 and the more opportunity they have to
1:17:56 decide
1:17:57 what to do with jane
1:17:58 or to figure out where our havens are
1:18:01 yeah they definitely drew a lot of
1:18:02 attention to mine
1:18:04 with the cops and if we assume that
1:18:06 suarez has
1:18:07 connections
1:18:09 still
1:18:10 um
1:18:11 we had ramirez take us to your place
1:18:14 the only ones i think they don't know
1:18:15 about are she
1:18:18 sheila is aware i live near the sherwood
1:18:20 i don't know if she knows i live under
1:18:22 it does anyone
1:18:24 the owner of the sherwood
1:18:26 and you said sheila was a bartender yeah
1:18:29 so
1:18:30 not a hard puzzle to put together
1:18:32 possibly you guys could stay at my place
1:18:36 for a bit
1:18:37 i think your place and maybe winds are
1:18:40 the only ones that they don't know about
1:18:42 well not easy anyways
1:18:44 mine's completely off of public record i
1:18:47 you have filed no paperwork so we talked
1:18:49 to his mom though yeah
1:18:52 and joey stays at your place yeah
1:18:54 he uh joey stays with me that's
1:18:58 your haven might not be as secure as you
1:19:00 think either
1:19:01 uh suarez is aware of the two of you and
1:19:04 he's a pretty damn good detective
1:19:06 we did some paperwork to figure out that
1:19:08 you owned that place i'm assuming that
1:19:10 he could probably do similar uh
1:19:12 paperwork too
1:19:14 we might need a group holiday guys
1:19:16 we can't leave the city though we have
1:19:17 this i didn't say leave the city find a
1:19:20 temporary haven for all of us to stay
1:19:21 together
1:19:22 yeah i don't think we can afford to not
1:19:24 watch each other's back at this point
1:19:25 with both the killing spree and these
1:19:28 people
1:19:29 yeah yeah
1:19:30 i
1:19:33 i can sleep in the dirt it really
1:19:34 doesn't matter to me where we choose
1:19:36 okay what definitely matters to me
1:19:37 because i don't i can't do that
1:19:40 um and i want us all
1:19:42 around the same place i i think if we're
1:19:44 going to be staying places now um
1:19:46 i think for tonight
1:19:48 my opinion right uh tonight maybe i
1:19:50 think we
1:19:51 britta if you're still okay with us
1:19:53 staying i think we all stay together
1:19:55 there and then we start looking for
1:19:57 you know cause you don't wanna do a
1:19:58 haphazard either um you know credit card
1:20:00 records and stuff can be changed um
1:20:03 traced and i need to talk to joey
1:20:07 i mean i haven't even been back to my
1:20:08 haven yet
1:20:09 that's okay
1:20:11 i've been
1:20:12 where have you been avoiding it
1:20:15 neil where have you been
1:20:17 staying
1:20:18 around the neighborhood
1:20:20 what i think the first night didn't you
1:20:23 stay at uh johnny's place at one point i
1:20:25 stayed with johnny the first night yeah
1:20:27 um
1:20:28 yeah i i you know
1:20:30 with johnny and then um
1:20:32 uh i i i was staying with fester for a
1:20:35 couple of days
1:20:36 um okay and now it's tonight i just
1:20:38 haven't wanted to go home yet and now i
1:20:40 definitely don't
1:20:41 although i do have to get some stuff at
1:20:43 some point so
1:20:44 are we
1:20:45 in agreement that we'll wait until
1:20:47 tomorrow night
1:20:49 see if maybe they take us up on talking
1:20:53 yeah we can make this a tomorrow night
1:20:55 problem because we can't do anything
1:20:56 right now
1:20:57 i
1:20:58 i'm gonna talk to some folks and um
1:21:01 have them watch
1:21:03 and we wait until tomorrow
1:21:06 in the meantime there are other things
1:21:08 we have to get accomplished
1:21:10 you still have to talk to the settings i
1:21:12 have a few phone calls to make i've got
1:21:15 to do some footwork to see if i can find
1:21:16 my wayward child i thought we were going
1:21:18 to call him we could do that i mean
1:21:22 i think it's super sidetracked what do
1:21:23 you want to do with vito is this just a
1:21:26 ideally i'd like to try and give him
1:21:29 over to
1:21:30 the justicars so if we can find him do
1:21:32 we just want to
1:21:34 bash him real hard
1:21:37 i don't know what you want to do the
1:21:38 just the cars you said well i don't know
1:21:41 any justicar but we happen to know an
1:21:43 archon he looks over at uh miles right
1:21:46 i'm not even sure if they want him
1:21:47 anymore
1:21:48 maybe maybe see if you can get in touch
1:21:50 with your uh sire that's on my list of
1:21:52 calls but remember he was
1:21:54 you he was going to be used to punish
1:21:56 shaw that was the only reason they
1:21:57 wanted him they wanted to give him to
1:21:59 the premier to study we'll see if you
1:22:01 see if you can get
1:22:02 him see if you can get your sire to uh
1:22:04 pick up and maybe ask him what he wants
1:22:07 done about that
1:22:08 i have a couple conversations i need to
1:22:09 have with him so it's on my list
1:22:11 hopefully i can get through
1:22:14 but
1:22:15 i don't know
1:22:16 is there anything concretely we can do
1:22:17 without
1:22:18 i could try and also do some more
1:22:20 footwork to see if we can find out any
1:22:22 leads about where the killing spree is i
1:22:24 can do that
1:22:25 i've got ears on the ground i can i
1:22:27 haven't been pushing because we've had
1:22:29 so much other stuff going on but i can
1:22:31 we can look um
1:22:33 would it help having
1:22:35 a child
1:22:36 of one of the killing spree members
1:22:38 give you some of their blood
1:22:40 i
1:22:41 appreciate the weight of the offering
1:22:44 you're making there but i kind of meant
1:22:45 doing this the old-fashioned way okay
1:22:48 i ain't talking my language
1:22:50 easy enough to
1:22:52 i know people on the street ask for you
1:22:54 know hot spots and
1:22:56 i thought you were planning on talking
1:22:57 to the bruja and seeing
1:22:59 what amara wants
1:23:01 calling for a rant is something that i
1:23:02 do need to do
1:23:04 i wasn't going to trouble all you with
1:23:05 that that's just gonna be an unpleasant
1:23:07 experience all around i think we need to
1:23:09 get into a better habit of troubling
1:23:10 each other with
1:23:12 our individual burdens
1:23:14 he nods appreciatively at that i want to
1:23:16 talk to joey
1:23:18 it won't be hard but ask him what does
1:23:20 mom's been saying
1:23:21 ask him if his perspective of talking to
1:23:23 mom is a conversation or a
1:23:26 one-way conversation so does that mean
1:23:29 we're going to your place tonight are we
1:23:30 going to british haven tonight
1:23:32 i need to go to my haven at some point
1:23:34 and plus i know how to find the animals
1:23:37 around there better no offense but um
1:23:40 your place is kind of small and if all
1:23:41 five of us are gonna be there it's a
1:23:43 dangerous place to sleep yeah
1:23:45 stacked up like cordwood in a one
1:23:47 entrance room is not exactly where i
1:23:49 want to be no
1:23:50 so can we swing by where you're at and
1:23:53 then maybe come back to my place we're
1:23:56 not far from the park either way you're
1:23:58 gonna drop you off the park well i'll
1:23:59 take everybody over to british are we
1:24:01 still doing the buddy system yes let's
1:24:03 be splitting up okay then someone come
1:24:04 with me i'll go with you okay two you
1:24:07 gonna be all right
1:24:08 should be i have no idea
1:24:10 also we probably should do something
1:24:12 about the weird mushrooms growing by my
1:24:14 place i don't it's so we have so much to
1:24:18 put it on the list it's not actively
1:24:20 trying to eat us right now so it's so
1:24:22 far as we know as far as we know but i
1:24:24 really don't want it doing something to
1:24:25 the local wildlife and then we have
1:24:27 multiple weeping bears on our hands keep
1:24:29 an eye on it and we'll try it with right
1:24:31 now not on my highest priorities
1:24:34 if you want you could try a little bit
1:24:35 of the old johnny magic
1:24:37 fire bomb it he tosses you his zippo i
1:24:39 think that's how that got there in the
1:24:41 first place well fungal systems always
1:24:43 grow underground if you destroy the
1:24:46 above mushrooms it's not going to do
1:24:48 anything because
1:24:50 the core of it
1:24:51 is beneath the earth you know a lot
1:24:55 about mushrooms um
1:24:57 i used to
1:24:59 bretta kind of looks blank and
1:25:01 isn't sure how she was going to finish
1:25:03 that sentence
1:25:04 okay sorry um that's one of the less
1:25:07 scary awesome things we've learned about
1:25:08 you
1:25:09 um
1:25:11 thank thanks
1:25:12 it was meant as a compliment sorry if
1:25:13 that wasn't clear

1:25:19 stay safe everybody
1:25:21 um
1:25:23 okay
1:25:24 johnny will drop the two of them off uh
1:25:26 near the park

1:25:31 because he realizes that he needs that
