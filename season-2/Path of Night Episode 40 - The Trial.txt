0:00:42 Wynn meet with the former Sheriff
0:00:44 weathers and entrust their new Allied
0:00:46 nara's safety to him weathers fills them
0:00:49 in on the new Scourge runwick he also
0:00:51 warns Johnny that his sire might be back
0:00:53 in town Johnny and Nguyen returned to
0:00:55 court where Brad and Miles update the
0:00:57 cotery
0:00:58 umbrella explains her arrangement with
0:01:00 Elsa Linden and the group discusses the
0:01:02 cost of apology
0:01:04 Renwick argues with both miles and
0:01:06 Johnny intern throwing accusations
0:01:08 around the public also silences the
0:01:10 argument between Johnny and runwick
0:01:12 before she meets with Miles that you
0:01:14 finally see eye to eye
0:01:15 at the end of the night Neil has a
0:01:17 mysterious visitor
0:01:20 [Music]
0:01:23 once everyone is awakened you each
0:01:25 receive your summons to court miles you
0:01:28 are expected to help maintain order
0:01:30 while after enrolling makes his
0:01:32 decisions regarding what is to happen
0:01:35 about this uh sudden Spike
0:01:40 some might incursions into the domain
0:01:43 all right is he
0:01:45 less crazy today you're not really sure
0:01:48 you're you're informed of this via third
0:01:50 party gotcha one of his goals gotcha
0:01:53 on top of that I need to do something
0:01:56 about Marcos
0:01:59 what are you doing about Marcos well we
0:02:01 need to do something because I can't
0:02:02 keep a dead body in the bathtub for days
0:02:04 on end I do believe that Johnny helped
0:02:10 arrange some of the other bully boys
0:02:12 to clean up to handle the cleanup I just
0:02:15 want to make sure and make sure the body
0:02:17 was put in a place where it would be
0:02:19 both respectful and remove suspicion
0:02:23 about where it was found gotcha
0:02:26 um and why he died okay an important
0:02:28 thing to note for you miles is that you
0:02:29 wake with three more blood gone three
0:02:32 more blood gun yes so one from waking up
0:02:35 in three additional yes wasn't I Rising
0:02:38 with like my full blood pool regardless
0:02:40 before yes something has changed
0:02:43 you're unclear as to why that's
0:02:45 happening what is clear
0:02:47 is that your down blood and the demon
0:02:53 has been less vocal
0:02:55 interacting with you during your entire
0:02:57 trip back to The Haven it didn't really
0:02:59 make any you know fasting offers it just
0:03:02 sort of let you go home while suspicious
0:03:05 I don't have the energy for it right now
0:03:07 so I think I'm going to
0:03:10 take its silence is a blessing for now
0:03:12 and hopefully it's not a curse and
0:03:17 head towards Elysium two you get that
0:03:20 feeling that demons aren't exactly known
0:03:21 for their blessings
0:03:23 [Music]
0:03:25 no no
0:03:27 but miles does not have the mental space
0:03:30 to deal with that right now he's gotta
0:03:32 keep Neil from dying and then we'll go
0:03:34 from there so what do you do I will head
0:03:36 to Elysium and uh first thing I'll see
0:03:39 is check in on Neil to make sure
0:03:42 nobody's done anything in toward Jordan
0:03:47 [Music]
0:03:51 Neil you wake up being tended to by Tori
0:03:53 or they bring you someone to feed from
0:03:55 one of their blood dolls they very kind
0:03:57 of politely indicate that you know no
0:03:59 harm should come to this person but
0:04:02 you're offered uh you're able to feed
0:04:04 three new only has to feed two he just
0:04:07 takes a little bit just enough to from
0:04:09 yesterday and waking up today there's
0:04:11 like uh an uncomfortable amount of like
0:04:13 joy that this doll experiences when you
0:04:17 feed from them and then they're on their
0:04:19 way Neil's not used to feeding off of
0:04:21 conscious people and it just it feels
0:04:22 weird and he clearly does not like it
0:04:25 um
0:04:26 good good evening he like just sort of
0:04:30 awkwardly looks at the torreador that
0:04:31 are around doesn't really know what to
0:04:33 say offers like a hello and then just
0:04:36 false silent again they offer incredibly
0:04:39 polite hellos but they make no attempt
0:04:42 whatsoever to initiate conversations
0:04:43 with you do I remember that figure
0:04:46 coming to me right before daytime oh
0:04:48 yeah I sort of check because I'm still
0:04:51 not they the toriador took me out of my
0:04:53 shackles and everything so I'm still
0:04:54 just kind of hanging out they do give
0:04:56 you a little bit of a weird look when
0:04:57 you start patting yourself down yeah
0:04:59 just checking to make sure I'm me I
0:05:03 guess that I'm everything's okay
0:05:05 how do you check to make sure you're you
0:05:07 uh
0:05:09 do any of you have like a mirror or
0:05:10 anything that I could borrow I have a
0:05:12 thing in court today yeah one flips open
0:05:15 a little pocket mirror I passed it to
0:05:17 you Neil doesn't really know what he's
0:05:18 doing he's just kind of looking at
0:05:20 himself in the mirror trying to make
0:05:23 sure he's he's him as best as anyone who
0:05:27 has no conception of that trust tries to
0:05:29 check uh you find yourself continuing to
0:05:32 have no conception of that great yeah
0:05:34 sounds about right close the little
0:05:36 compact and give it back to him with a
0:05:38 thanks without having fixed my hair or
0:05:40 done anything still look like [ __ ]
0:05:43 so what time is when when am I
0:05:47 what's the
0:05:48 do we know what the plan is do we no
0:05:51 schedule has been announced
0:05:53 but when it is time you will be escorted
0:05:55 and the trial will begin
0:05:58 hey I might not get another chance uh
0:06:01 I've always wanted to ask this
0:06:03 how do you how do you how do you get
0:06:05 people like you
0:06:07 I kind of look between each other well
0:06:09 it isn't for everyone ah okay yeah
0:06:12 that's what I and Neil just got a full
0:06:14 silent and just hangs out you don't
0:06:17 really have anything else to do
0:06:22 [Music]
0:06:26 Brita will first show up to Elysium
0:06:28 having dress very nicely and she will
0:06:32 see if she'll be allowed to visit Neil
0:06:34 you are indeed allowed to visit you all
0:06:36 right Britta will thank whoever let her
0:06:38 in we walk up to Neil kind of looking
0:06:41 him over to see where his head's at it
0:06:43 looks terrible there is a visible look
0:06:46 of relief on Neil's face when he sees
0:06:49 Britta just an absolute like oh my thank
0:06:51 God like a friendly face because it's
0:06:53 the first time in a while since he's
0:06:55 seen a friendly face as she's coming
0:06:57 over to Neil she's kind of like walking
0:06:59 slowly and trying to keep like a gentle
0:07:02 countenance about herself she says hey
0:07:06 and as she does so she pulls a comb out
0:07:10 of her pocket and is intent to approach
0:07:13 Neil to actually fix his hair Neil moves
0:07:16 as if to take the comb just like oh
0:07:19 thanks Alba and then kind of realizes
0:07:21 her intention and is like oh right yeah
0:07:24 that's probably smart and puts his hand
0:07:26 back down and sort of gives leeway for
0:07:30 her to just make him not look like a man
0:07:33 who lives in a trash pile that he is and
0:07:36 looks up
0:07:38 um hey thank you you guys did this for
0:07:42 me so it's nothing to thank me for
0:07:45 and as Brett is talking she'll uh comb
0:07:49 Neil's hair and kind of like part it
0:07:51 nicely it's probably a weird experience
0:07:53 for him I imagine she's probably not
0:07:55 doing it the way that he's used to no
0:07:57 probably forgot which is just run his
0:08:00 fingers through and be like all right I
0:08:02 believe his hair was described as a
0:08:04 grease curtain yes yeah no yeah it's
0:08:06 absolutely not you know vampires aren't
0:08:09 greasy but
0:08:12 it's a very gentle touch as if Brett is
0:08:16 not entirely certain how much physical
0:08:17 contact uh Neil's ready for at this
0:08:20 moment but she's being very efficient
0:08:22 like it's combing the hair and she flip
0:08:24 uh she moves down to kind of flip his
0:08:27 collar correct
0:08:28 definitely one of them tucked like
0:08:30 inside this shirt and it just has the
0:08:32 whole thing's a mess
0:08:34 as she's doing all this and sort of like
0:08:36 gently making him look presentable
0:08:40 um
0:08:41 no thank you
0:08:43 specifically I don't
0:08:45 if you weren't here I don't think I
0:08:48 would have had a chance here because you
0:08:51 were the X Factor in all of this
0:08:55 he um
0:08:57 I talked to Reiss yesterday
0:08:59 and
0:09:01 um he's a plan had a plan for for me
0:09:04 obviously uh for Johnny for miles for
0:09:08 win
0:09:09 um and honestly having known them as
0:09:11 long as I did he he basically had them
0:09:13 picked pretty well for how their
0:09:15 reactions would go and how they would
0:09:17 spiral and everything would fall apart
0:09:19 and um
0:09:21 he didn't have
0:09:23 he didn't have a plan for you
0:09:25 he he asked questions about you he was
0:09:27 curious he didn't know what to make of
0:09:31 you or or how to
0:09:33 Factor you in he underestimated and and
0:09:37 if it weren't for you not
0:09:39 it's not just me that's getting a chance
0:09:42 here
0:09:44 it's it's every single one of us
0:09:46 um
0:09:47 he was he looked so
0:09:50 I don't speak French but he looked so
0:09:52 pissed
0:09:54 when Elsa came in the room
0:09:57 and I I can you know
0:10:01 I don't speak French and I don't speak
0:10:02 Latin but I I can I can put puzzle
0:10:06 pieces together
0:10:07 so I don't know if anybody else is gonna
0:10:10 see it but
0:10:11 thank you
0:10:13 for all of our sake thank me when it's
0:10:16 over
0:10:17 all right oh
0:10:19 depending on how it goes I might not get
0:10:21 a chance to thank you when it's over so
0:10:22 I wanted to do it now
0:10:24 um I want to hear it after well yeah I
0:10:26 would like to say it after too but
0:10:28 listen Neil this isn't gonna stop here
0:10:32 oh I know and I need you and all of us
0:10:36 to be together as we make it through
0:10:38 this
0:10:39 we're gonna try I'm gonna try but I
0:10:43 I honestly don't know what to do
0:10:46 I don't know what to say okay
0:10:50 try and pretend like you're talking to
0:10:53 us maybe okay
0:10:55 you mean when I'm talking to the prince
0:10:56 be respectful and put your best foot
0:11:00 forward but you know speak like you're
0:11:04 talking to us like like you know your
0:11:06 center with us
0:11:09 there's a
0:11:10 there's a thing
0:11:12 Johnny files into this trap sometimes
0:11:15 miles does too it's
0:11:17 something I have in common
0:11:19 um
0:11:20 they think that the truth matters or
0:11:23 that fairness or Justice matter and
0:11:26 that's not what this is
0:11:28 whether or not I live or die here it's
0:11:31 whether or not I have the political
0:11:33 clout and I don't or whether or not
0:11:36 people just kind of like me enough and
0:11:38 no one has ever liked me enough except
0:11:41 for those guys in an Esperanto and I
0:11:45 realize that popularity games suck in
0:11:48 this court
0:11:49 but you can get through by by showing
0:11:52 yourself that you're you're not a threat
0:11:54 by showing yourself that you can be
0:11:56 helpful all these things I mean you
0:11:59 haven't done anything Neil
0:12:01 depends on what the prince thinks
0:12:04 but you can make him think that
0:12:07 oh the premiere here when I walked in
0:12:09 did I see tramir you did not no okay are
0:12:14 there other Tori door in the room still
0:12:16 no brother's left alone with you okay
0:12:19 one other thing and I don't I don't know
0:12:21 how to you know the guy the one from the
0:12:24 subway the the tea up in Boston to the
0:12:28 web of knives yeah the one that's coming
0:12:30 for me yeah
0:12:33 I saw him at Sun up last night can you
0:12:38 make any sense of that I mean why are
0:12:40 you so alive I don't know
0:12:43 the world went silent and the door
0:12:44 opened and I was so tired because the
0:12:47 sun was already up or coming up and Neil
0:12:51 could he have searched your memories
0:12:52 when you were asleep I don't know I have
0:12:55 no idea all right Buddha shakes her head
0:12:58 thank you for telling me
0:13:00 I hope that's a tomorrow problem because
0:13:03 I have no idea how to handle that right
0:13:06 now I'll keep an eye out okay I'll I'll
0:13:09 keep a lookout for that person but if
0:13:12 you're alive that means something and
0:13:13 that means something that I guess they
0:13:15 don't want you dead so wow
0:13:18 might be worse
0:13:19 um hey
0:13:21 I didn't get to hear uh did anyone ever
0:13:25 find Nara
0:13:26 no it's okay
0:13:28 Neil doesn't say anything but sort of
0:13:30 bites both of his lips in that kind of
0:13:33 like sad relief like it's a Bittersweet
0:13:37 relief like oh thank God she's okay but
0:13:39 you know you gotta focus on you Neil
0:13:42 Brit is very good at reading people it
0:13:45 is pretty clear that Neil does not think
0:13:47 he has a chance but is putting on the
0:13:50 brave face and the thumbs up to try and
0:13:53 make her think that he thinks he has a
0:13:56 chance just to like sort of be weirdly
0:13:59 reflectively comforting of like hey I'm
0:14:02 gonna die but all right I'll try my best
0:14:05 not in a good headspace very confused
0:14:09 but more worried about everybody else in
0:14:11 the codery than than his own life
0:14:14 you are gonna get through a nail
0:14:16 okay okay
0:14:18 um
0:14:19 hey any uh I asked the auditory door and
0:14:22 they just they just said it wasn't for
0:14:24 me any advice on how to on how to get
0:14:27 people like me
0:14:28 you like them well I do like them it's
0:14:30 never helped you show that you like them
0:14:33 you play to the things that they like
0:14:35 about themselves
0:14:37 okay
0:14:38 thanks um
0:14:40 thanks for the advice and the hairstyle
0:14:43 all right
0:14:44 um Good Luck
0:14:46 and Bretta will offer a hug he will hug
0:14:49 her back does seem to take comfort in
0:14:52 the active like physical touch and then
0:14:55 as sort of the hug breaks he'll like
0:14:57 have both hands on her shoulders still
0:14:59 oh hey look
0:15:02 I'm gonna try but there's no guarantees
0:15:04 here
0:15:05 if this goes bad for me you need to make
0:15:09 sure you need to be the calming
0:15:11 influence
0:15:13 because they'll just hype each other up
0:15:16 and that's what Rhys wants to happen for
0:15:19 win and Johnny and miles to fly off the
0:15:22 handle
0:15:22 because I'm dead
0:15:24 you need to keep it together so that
0:15:26 this doesn't Domino I promise you that
0:15:29 I'll keep an eye on them you keep an eye
0:15:31 on you okay yeah I know I get that but
0:15:33 promise me that you'll try to live
0:15:37 I
0:15:39 promise that I will try and live
0:15:42 pending the costs you promised me that
0:15:45 you will keep them together in a life
0:15:47 I'll do my best
0:15:49 you are The X Factor here okay
0:15:53 also uh Rhys
0:15:57 forcibly made me tell him about you
0:16:00 I don't want to burden everything right
0:16:02 here but um I I I kept most of it on
0:16:06 raps uh despite the pain but um you uh
0:16:10 he does know that your your flashbacks
0:16:13 are in black and white
0:16:14 um he's a smart guy he might start to
0:16:16 put stuff together I kept everything
0:16:18 else under my hat as best as I could but
0:16:21 you know I didn't tell him about
0:16:22 anything else but he got that much out
0:16:25 of me sadness and hurt kind of flickers
0:16:27 over britta's expression before she can
0:16:29 kind of push it back
0:16:30 but she kind of like nods
0:16:34 this looks that neon says
0:16:36 yeah that's
0:16:38 I think that's gonna be an issue so I am
0:16:41 I'm gonna need you to help me through
0:16:43 that once we handle this yeah I'm I'm
0:16:46 sorry it was he forced it out of me
0:16:49 there was there's a ritual I understand
0:16:51 I don't understand but I understand okay
0:16:54 I you don't need to apologize just let's
0:16:56 do this okay
0:16:58 all right and she gives him a sincere
0:17:01 but kind of strong nod yeah gives a very
0:17:04 sort of weak but attempt sincere nod
0:17:08 back and she will walk out
0:17:14 [Music]
0:17:16 meanwhile most of the blue boys are
0:17:18 present at this time all of the court
0:17:20 has been called to me and be present for
0:17:24 this the only person who has not arrived
0:17:27 is Jane his weather's here weathers does
0:17:30 arrive okay Johnny definitely gives a
0:17:32 nod over to uh weathers now they're not
0:17:34 as reciprocated the premier have showed
0:17:37 up the tramir are now showing up yes
0:17:39 bretta's eyes are scanning the crowd for
0:17:41 next uh NYX is also present win is just
0:17:44 kind of standing in the back arms
0:17:47 crossed kind of looking at the floor
0:17:48 she's not sure what benefit it is for
0:17:51 her to be here this this feels like a
0:17:54 deliberate way of getting her to fly off
0:17:56 the handle and break Elysium Bretta will
0:17:58 also try to gather the codery to stand
0:18:01 together I think until trial time I am
0:18:04 working to both bolster the prince's
0:18:07 General reputation by mingling and
0:18:10 talking with people and also at the same
0:18:13 time trying to purvey a general sense of
0:18:17 Neil Neil by construct me essentially
0:18:22 being a worthwhile save for the domain
0:18:24 and stuff like that and like trying to
0:18:27 basically bolster that through just
0:18:28 general intermingling and talking and
0:18:30 things and a couple things that I
0:18:31 haven't been able to do since we've been
0:18:33 on the road and kind of reestablished
0:18:35 those ties and stuff like that okay it
0:18:38 is decided by Upton ruins that Rhys will
0:18:41 prosecute
0:18:42 and bring forward the charges against uh
0:18:46 Neil and you miles will defend him
0:18:51 question from Johnny is it like Jane to
0:18:56 miss a court event oh absolutely not her
0:18:58 thing is like she she's the political
0:19:01 eyes and ears for the bruja Clan
0:19:02 hopefully trying to sneak out before
0:19:04 things get started Johnny will head up
0:19:06 to the Sheriff's Office go through the
0:19:09 the Rolodex up there find her number and
0:19:11 give her a call she does not answer does
0:19:13 she have like a uh a message on her or
0:19:16 like a uh a way to leave a message with
0:19:18 her she does have an answering machine
0:19:19 Johnny will leave her a quick message
0:19:22 basically just hey Jane it's uh it's
0:19:26 Johnny uh this is uh kind of a weird
0:19:29 flip of uh rolls usually I'm the one
0:19:32 who's being called by you

0:19:39 weathers if you can or send me a message
0:19:42 to my beeper
0:19:44 uh let me know if you need any backup
0:19:47 Johnny hangs up and kind of frowns the
0:19:49 phone takes another quick look out down
0:19:52 at the court because the the sheriff's
0:19:53 office looks down over the court right
0:19:55 uh yes it does redwick is in attendance
0:19:57 as well Renwick is present Johnny kind
0:20:00 of like from the seclusion of the Court
0:20:02 it gives him uh some eyes how's he
0:20:04 what's he looking like tonight uh he's
0:20:06 actually largely seated with the
0:20:09 Nosferatu uh they've got a pretty like
0:20:12 professional demeanor that they've put
0:20:14 together they're they're seated they're
0:20:17 orderly and uh it looks like they're you
0:20:20 know ready to Bear witness to whatever
0:20:22 happens next has Roland showed up yet at
0:20:25 all or is this coming all his stuff
0:20:27 coming through is it's all coming from
0:20:29 his Ghouls and he's kind of hanging out
0:20:31 at his office waiting for the Wolves to
0:20:33 finally arrive
0:20:35 so I see his last question not less
0:20:37 crazy tonight he's not
0:20:40 Johnny will hang out up in the uh
0:20:42 Sheriff's Office as long as he can
0:20:44 um and once he starts to see that things
0:20:46 are starting to progress he'll give Jane
0:20:48 one last call I'm assuming she doesn't
0:20:50 still doesn't pick up she still does not
0:20:52 pick up he uh leaves another brief
0:20:55 message being like hey please call me
0:20:57 and then heads back down to uh make sure
0:21:00 that he's present for appearance's sake
0:21:02 while Johnny is making calls to Jane
0:21:05 when kind of looks for miles in the
0:21:09 crowd you find him there mingling and
0:21:10 kind of getting ready
0:21:12 hey this what can I do to be of use here
0:21:19 do you have any friends that you've made
0:21:22 I have you guys
0:21:24 it's got to be other people you've dealt
0:21:25 with or other Gangrel that are
0:21:27 Wanderers and don't come into the domain
0:21:29 very often I mean unless you've got
0:21:31 something that can absolutely prove that
0:21:33 Neil is Neil and I don't have to go
0:21:34 through this whole thing it's gonna be a
0:21:36 lot of
0:21:37 weird wordplay imagine or I'm not
0:21:40 exactly sure what Reiss's case is going
0:21:42 to be like yet I don't know either and I
0:21:45 feel like me being here is a huge
0:21:46 liability for us
0:21:48 I mean you're aware of how you're
0:21:51 feeling so maybe
0:21:52 that should be fine you've met me right
0:21:55 right
0:21:56 and we've defended Elysium before
0:22:00 all right we need like I don't know how
0:22:03 this is gonna play out yet he's
0:22:07 a prince is still very
0:22:09 weird unless you have something to stop
0:22:11 him from being weird
0:22:14 then I don't know what else we can do
0:22:17 because if we could get him
0:22:20 as the judge or whatever it may be then
0:22:24 then we might have a better chance he's
0:22:27 more material and it's something we can
0:22:30 play a little bit better than
0:22:31 wait who is Judge of this Rhys is
0:22:34 Prosecuting I'm defending
0:22:36 Prince oh it is a prince okay is he
0:22:39 gonna do it from the upstairs you're not
0:22:41 sure
0:22:43 maybe you should talk to Neil
0:22:45 I make sure that he's ready and the
0:22:49 better face that he can put on the
0:22:50 better it is kneel you begin screaming
0:22:54 incoherently in the room that you're in
0:23:04 so loud those outside of the room such
0:23:07 as the members of your quarterly and the
0:23:09 entirety of Court kind of starts turning
0:23:12 their heads towards the room that you
0:23:14 are screaming from because it is that
0:23:16 loud wind runs toward them
0:23:19 um bully boys kind of like put their
0:23:21 hands up but they're like we're gonna
0:23:22 look at it hold on hold on get the [ __ ]
0:23:24 out of my way that like immediately
0:23:26 triggers like an aggressive reaction
0:23:28 from the world like you get the [ __ ] out
0:23:29 of my way I'm not your [ __ ] I'm not
0:23:32 your [ __ ] yeah you are enough
0:23:35 let me throw I kind of Knocked get out
0:23:37 of the sheriff's way Bretta follow us
0:23:40 along right and you guys followed my
0:23:41 weekend like basically I signal like
0:23:43 follow behind me as we move in towards
0:23:45 the screaming Neil
0:23:54 for Neil words echo through his mind
0:23:58 there is no such thing as Independence
0:24:00 in the Jihad there is only a lack of
0:24:04 awareness of one's Masters
0:24:07 and he feels
0:24:10 like his mind has been sort of prodded
0:24:14 and poked like a psyche is kind of being
0:24:17 pulled apart
0:24:19 like the skin being pulled from a fruit
0:24:22 and what he sees
0:24:26 is a boy with charcoal skin and has no
0:24:30 eyes
0:24:32 and it walks through these dark Halls
0:24:35 until it comes to a throne room and in
0:24:37 this throne room there is a man
0:24:40 with jet black skin
0:24:44 a thick beard and scarring on his face
0:24:47 and neck
0:24:48 and he knows that they have a
0:24:49 conversation
0:24:51 one that is peaceful at first and simply
0:24:55 addresses a change that has happened to
0:24:59 this culture over the course of
0:25:00 Millennia
0:25:01 and the boy makes it clear
0:25:04 that there is to be a return to the old
0:25:06 ways
0:25:07 and that their neo-fight God Allah has
0:25:10 no place in their sacred Mountain
0:25:14 and the man
0:25:15 scarred but somehow still quite Noble in
0:25:19 appearance
0:25:21 explains this boy something that he
0:25:24 seems to believe that the boy simply
0:25:25 doesn't understand
0:25:27 which is that Hakeem had given him on
0:25:31 life
0:25:32 but Allah gave him life and he forced to
0:25:35 choose between the two he would choose
0:25:38 Allah always
0:25:40 and the boy shrugs accepting the choice
0:25:43 made by this man
0:25:45 and with a weave of hand
0:25:48 incinerates the Methuselah as though he
0:25:50 were never there
0:25:53 the charcoal boy approaches the throne
0:25:55 seemingly aware of his surroundings
0:25:56 despite having no eyes
0:26:00 he kneels beside the Black Throne
0:26:03 and calls forth the next of hakeem's
0:26:06 wayward children
0:26:08 so that they might be corrected next
0:26:12 and then you come too
0:26:14 feeling as though your skin has been set
0:26:16 Ablaze by whatever this
0:26:19 this monster is Neil gasps when he comes
0:26:24 back to Consciousness uh like batting in
0:26:27 his skin as if he's actually afraid that
0:26:28 it's on fire and and looking around with
0:26:31 like wild panicked eyes not really sure
0:26:34 where he is yet completely freaking out
0:26:38 he looks like he wants to just run
0:26:40 through the walls just to get away from
0:26:42 the inside of his own head no thoughts
0:26:46 of the fact that he's about to be on
0:26:47 trial no awareness whether or not
0:26:50 anybody else is in the room with him
0:26:51 just complete psychotic Panic of lack of
0:26:56 understanding and and trying to order
0:26:58 just all these insane thoughts that just
0:27:02 assaulted him like clawing at himself
0:27:04 basically and muttering over and over
0:27:07 again under his breath nonsense phrases
0:27:11 in Arabic basically just they aren't
0:27:14 even if you speak the language it's not
0:27:17 it's nonsense it's nothing it's just a
0:27:18 bunch of thoughts all coming out at once
0:27:21 mashed together that his his vocal cords
0:27:23 and his body can't keep up with as he
0:27:26 continues just to rock back and forth
0:27:28 like batting in his skin and muttering
0:27:37 when can you grab him win approaches
0:27:40 with her hands up is Neil it's okay it's
0:27:45 okay Neil
0:27:46 you're here it's us Lex did I get it I
0:27:49 may have no idea but do I have an
0:27:52 impression that that is something that
0:27:53 just happened or will be happening or
0:27:56 has yeah okay who's present in the room
0:27:58 with Neil
0:27:59 um at least myself and these two so far
0:28:02 I don't know who else may have come in
0:28:04 it's just a singletory order that I've
0:28:06 been watching him at that point they
0:28:08 open the door for you and let you in boy
0:28:09 boys are keeping everybody else out
0:28:10 currently Johnny will actually uh lead
0:28:13 the formation of bully boys to keep
0:28:15 everyone out of the room okay
0:28:19 where are we what's what's going on Neil
0:28:21 we're in Elysium
0:28:23 okay
0:28:24 okay you're in the same room you've been
0:28:26 in for a day
0:28:28 it's just us here
0:28:30 it's okay and she kind of crouches down
0:28:33 in front of him she kind of gives him
0:28:35 space she doesn't try to touch him
0:28:37 because it looks like he's kind of
0:28:38 feeling some sensory things but she
0:28:40 crouches down in front of him his hands
0:28:42 still raised to show him that she's not
0:28:45 gonna do anything as his if he starts to
0:28:48 come back to himself a little bit he
0:28:50 does sort of lean forward like the
0:28:52 rocking sort of leans forward when he
0:28:54 stops batting at himself just to sort of
0:28:57 lean into to win when she gets close
0:28:59 just for some sense of like touch and
0:29:02 stability flashing back a long time ago
0:29:04 to when he gave Brita a little pendant
0:29:08 that was like Hey if you ever lose track
0:29:09 of reality here's a great way to to do
0:29:12 it and he's he's kind of using win as
0:29:14 like a pendant right now as a as a way
0:29:17 to stay Tethered to this reality she
0:29:20 reaches out and takes his hands
0:29:24 um I saw I Saw The Herald of sugar he
0:29:29 he's gonna
0:29:31 or is or has or is doing
0:29:34 I don't know
0:29:35 I know what the Schism is
0:29:39 I know what it's gonna be
0:29:42 much worse than I thought it was going
0:29:45 to be
0:29:47 I didn't understand I didn't know
0:29:50 I know now I know why they wanted me to
0:29:52 see it when nods it's gonna be okay I
0:29:56 need to I need to tell Laura I need to
0:29:58 talk to her I need to we'll find a way
0:30:01 to get the message to her okay okay I
0:30:03 know you're hurting I know that this was
0:30:06 a lot I can tell
0:30:08 but I need you to try and pull it
0:30:10 together okay
0:30:12 so
0:30:13 easy for him
0:30:15 like it was nothing
0:30:17 what was nothing just a wave of a hand
0:30:19 the enema throws a lot evaporated wind
0:30:22 kind of has her eyes go wide what like
0:30:25 it was
0:30:26 like it was a child's game that kind of
0:30:30 easy there's like a weird twitch at the
0:30:33 word child like a like he's suppressing
0:30:36 like hysterical laughter but has enough
0:30:38 of himself to realize like that maybe
0:30:40 this isn't the time
0:30:42 but it's it's a fraying thread keeping
0:30:44 him together
0:30:45 when doesn't understand a lot of what
0:30:48 he's talking about this is she knows a
0:30:51 lot about spirits and she knows a lot
0:30:53 about the dead this is a different
0:30:55 branch that she knows nothing about but
0:30:57 what she does know is that this is
0:30:58 important and this is important to Neil
0:31:00 and she squeezes his hands said that's a
0:31:04 tomorrow problem right well I'm
0:31:07 maybe not it might be happening right
0:31:10 now
0:31:11 I don't know
0:31:13 what do you think we can do about it
0:31:14 right now
0:31:15 I I need I need time I need a minute I
0:31:18 need I need I don't know
0:31:21 okay well we're gonna try and get you a
0:31:22 minute okay we might not have that we
0:31:26 need nail can you
0:31:29 I have a
0:31:31 dang it I
0:31:33 I have an idea okay I think I might kill
0:31:37 two birds with one stone but it's
0:31:39 I don't know it's a risk miles I I need
0:31:42 to remember that you I
0:31:45 there's going to be the schism
0:31:48 amongst the children of Hakeem
0:31:51 and anyone who stays at Alamo and
0:31:54 doesn't bend the knee to The Herald
0:31:56 and return to the old ways is going to
0:31:59 be killed
0:32:01 and chubair and Nora and there has to be
0:32:04 more
0:32:05 there are
0:32:07 Assamites who are going to not want to
0:32:10 return to the old ways who are going to
0:32:11 want to follow Allah who are going to
0:32:13 want to flee all the mud and they're
0:32:17 going to need a place to go
0:32:18 someplace that can protect them
0:32:21 at least a little from the children of
0:32:23 Hakeem and they haven't managed to get
0:32:25 me yet which means
0:32:27 the prince wants weapons right
0:32:30 yeah he does what if we just go both
0:32:31 faced what if I just offer him weapons
0:32:35 I mean that's borrowing against tomorrow
0:32:36 too I'd have to talk to Nora I'd have to
0:32:38 talk to all of the children of Hakeem I
0:32:39 don't know what if you just put yourself
0:32:43 forward as a potential Ambassador not
0:32:45 making promises not saying that you'll
0:32:48 get these weapons but saying that you
0:32:50 believe that well I don't know about
0:32:52 talking about Visions in court but it
0:32:54 kind of looks at miles at that probably
0:32:56 not a good thing I don't think so but if
0:33:00 the topic comes up if they keep on
0:33:03 asking you about your connections then
0:33:04 you could put it forwards theoretically
0:33:06 to say if asamites were to try to allow
0:33:10 with a camarilla then you being a being
0:33:13 a part of the camera you could help
0:33:16 um here's the other problem though I I
0:33:19 don't know miles a year longer term
0:33:21 politically savvy than I am go ahead um
0:33:24 the the
0:33:26 this
0:33:27 thing that can just kill methusel is
0:33:31 like it's nothing
0:33:32 if we Harbor the things it's hunting oh
0:33:36 it doesn't even matter because I want to
0:33:38 punish all the children of kind miles
0:33:40 ever since he's mentioned the name
0:33:42 rashoggi there has been this stirring
0:33:46 inside of you and for the first time you
0:33:49 begin to wonder if the demon that hides
0:33:53 under your skin is afraid I don't know
0:33:56 if you should talk about the Visions
0:33:58 unless you have any sort of evidence to
0:34:01 say that they're present or real or any
0:34:03 of that but I do think that it brings up
0:34:06 a good idea right like brokering new
0:34:09 allies to The Domain into the camarilla
0:34:11 if presented well and in the sense that
0:34:14 it would be historical thing a thing
0:34:17 that has not yet happened before maybe a
0:34:20 good way to lure The Prince and he would
0:34:22 be
0:34:24 I think you might latch onto something
0:34:25 like that as long as he wasn't
0:34:28 fearful of the consequences how bad
0:34:30 would it be if this was something we
0:34:33 talked about and then I talked to to
0:34:35 Nara or to she Bears Dead uh talk to
0:34:39 Nora and said hey what if this is
0:34:43 something I could get you and she said
0:34:45 no and no one was interested and this
0:34:48 was an insane idea that I'm having
0:34:51 right at the brink of death well we're
0:34:53 thinking too far forward right is there
0:34:55 so much of things too far forward yes uh
0:34:58 to be found now or at least could be an
0:35:00 individual and she does those
0:35:02 so even if we get one individual well I
0:35:05 also owe her right that's why I use the
0:35:07 word us okay for what it's worth Nara
0:35:10 mentioned that she could call in
0:35:14 reinforcements if we needed them it's a
0:35:16 tomorrow topic whether or not you would
0:35:18 be successful as an ambassador
0:35:20 right now you need people to like you
0:35:22 right so if you can put forwards that
0:35:25 you have the ability the unique ability
0:35:27 that no one else has a connection that
0:35:30 could make the prince more powerful and
0:35:33 to show your dedication to this domain
0:35:36 that might work and these allies would
0:35:39 be probably in opposition to your
0:35:41 previous iron possibly we don't have to
0:35:43 go into the details but that ought to be
0:35:45 a driven home yeah Johnny pokes his head
0:35:48 in from outside hey guys it's getting a
0:35:51 little bit uh tense out here what what's
0:35:53 going on what's the play what am I
0:35:55 telling these people at court
0:35:57 um Neil sorry is it normal to say that
0:36:00 you just had a malkadian kind of moment
0:36:03 no that's not cool but uh I did have a
0:36:06 panic attack he panicked that's fine I'm
0:36:09 looking more at you Sheriff yeah come on
0:36:12 out
0:36:13 I'll follow the wind kind of still stays
0:36:16 kneel by Neil gives his hands one more
0:36:19 squeeze he squeezes them back
0:36:21 tremulously essentially I'll go out to
0:36:24 the crowd and be like
0:36:25 he was suffering some aftershocks from
0:36:29 yesterday's interrogation and it just
0:36:32 hit him all of a sudden we apologized to
0:36:35 the disturbance of the Elysium and your
0:36:36 time here it's being handled now he's
0:36:39 all good four into the back doors the
0:36:41 prince enters he looks disheveled and
0:36:44 nervous his tie is not on correctly oh
0:36:47 my God I start heading over there
0:36:48 immediately beside him is a rather
0:36:51 concerned Reiss who like silently
0:36:53 encourages you to fix this immediately
0:36:55 so like he comes out and like I try to
0:36:58 like get him to go back in the other way
0:37:01 so that we can get his ghouls to fix him
0:37:03 Johnny seeing uh how nervous miles is
0:37:07 we'll just kind of raise his voice up
0:37:10 and start kind of shouting at the crowd
0:37:12 to hopefully draw their attention to him
0:37:14 Bretta will pass off the comb in her
0:37:17 pocket to Miles all right everybody the
0:37:19 sheriff spoke up I expect you all to
0:37:22 listen to what he said I try to get him
0:37:24 in the back room to like he he complies
0:37:26 yeah oh you're great sir you're not
0:37:28 we need to get you ready to preside over
0:37:30 here I don't want to be touched by
0:37:32 anyone and but in this time was more
0:37:34 difficult than expected it is a trying
0:37:36 time out there tell me well they're
0:37:38 ready out there
0:37:40 um they're mostly ready yes they have
0:37:43 heard what you've been doing for the
0:37:45 domain and I've done much to
0:37:49 as you asked of me
0:37:52 might as I figure out how I'm going to
0:37:53 resolve all of these issues and I think
0:37:55 you're going to like what I do he goes a
0:37:58 wink
0:37:58 would you like
0:38:00 let me in so that we can you'll see uh
0:38:04 plan better it just kind of walks out
0:38:08 I look over a race and I'm like it like
0:38:10 is this really like essentially what it
0:38:12 look like is this really what you want
0:38:14 Rhys kind of gives you a look like this
0:38:17 didn't have to be Prince here's your
0:38:19 prince and then he walks out
0:38:26 foreign
0:38:35 to confirm the guilt of a returning
0:38:39 Nemesis to The Domain
0:38:41 and in addition to this
0:38:44 we are gathered to
0:38:47 indicate that New Haven is a strong
0:38:49 domain
0:38:50 and that it will not be sullied by
0:38:52 Outsiders who would interfere with our
0:38:55 traditions and so I would like the newly
0:38:58 acknowledged Kindred Ridder to come
0:39:01 forward
0:39:02 and
0:39:03 uh let it be known that she was
0:39:06 acknowledged against her will by
0:39:09 Infamous members of operation longbow
0:39:13 but fret not I have devised a means of
0:39:16 ensuring her loyalty to this domain and
0:39:18 the extent his wrist and quietly
0:39:20 gestures for brother to drink what is
0:39:22 the general reception of the crowd to
0:39:26 this declaration an alarming number of
0:39:29 Kindred I seem to think this is kind of
0:39:32 perfectly normal other Kindred some of
0:39:34 them you see they're like counting on
0:39:36 their fingers how many times he's
0:39:37 already done this there others are like
0:39:39 kind of like giddy to see some like
0:39:42 drama and like suffering at the hands of
0:39:45 other Kindred and some smart ones are
0:39:48 looking a little wary
0:39:51 with how casually he has simply
0:39:54 commanded someone to drink from him is
0:39:56 there anyone a particular note that is
0:39:58 has that reaction or are the people no
0:40:00 in the court house sending their things
0:40:02 to their chest Elsa Linden does not seem
0:40:04 overly thrilled but as far as like high
0:40:07 profile Kindred of the domain she's the
0:40:09 only one as Brita does start to walk up
0:40:12 to the prince she does cast a glance
0:40:14 over her shoulder towards Elsa Linden to
0:40:17 assess that you again quickly get the
0:40:20 impression that she's not overly pleased
0:40:22 but she makes no movement to act against
0:40:24 the prince and that glance being over
0:40:26 Bretta continues walking up as she gets
0:40:29 up there and does a bow I'll be like
0:40:31 your grace not yet Moss
0:40:34 we haven't moving on to the good part
0:40:36 again may I offer a suggestion I'm not
0:40:39 on a crowd miles quiet down
0:40:41 this is a little extreme no it's not
0:40:44 this is the camera
0:40:46 watch it'll be fine
0:40:48 you'll just wrist out there's a little
0:40:50 stab in this hey
0:40:53 you're Grace
0:40:55 I wish that I had the opportunity to be
0:40:57 acknowledged by you
0:40:59 I'm glad that I can
0:41:01 now serve the domain in this capacity
0:41:05 too good that all who question whether
0:41:07 or not Buddhas and service to a subada
0:41:10 near the wells uh be aware that she is
0:41:14 loyal to New Haven
0:41:16 and not Boston
0:41:17 I'm loyal to you your grace
0:41:20 yeah I hold his wrist up to her
0:41:24 Your Grace you have my loyalty
0:41:27 is
0:41:28 this necessary
0:41:30 if I have my loyalty you are more than
0:41:33 ready to prove it no
0:41:34 yes then do so if Johnny looks like he's
0:41:38 about to say something
0:41:39 he does
0:41:43 win steps up grips his shoulder
0:41:46 this sucks
0:41:48 not now
0:41:49 Johnny gives a long hard look at when we
0:41:52 can looks like he is about to fight back
0:41:54 tears and kind of Nod slowly at her and
0:41:58 grips her shoulder back and she just
0:42:00 keeps a hold on him both for herself and
0:42:02 for him thank you win good move thank
0:42:05 you
0:42:07 and with that Bretta maintains you know
0:42:11 flickering eye contact with the prince
0:42:13 down to his wrists and up to his eyes
0:42:16 down to his wrists up to his eyes
0:42:18 approaches
0:42:20 takes his wrists carefully into her
0:42:23 hands
0:42:24 pauses kind of hoping that there will be
0:42:27 some kind of interruption
0:42:30 It Never Comes
0:42:32 when squeezes Johnny's shoulder harder
0:42:36 she slowly forces her head down to take
0:42:39 the bite
0:42:40 the blood says just as it did before
0:42:43 except now you can feel its power surge
0:42:47 through you it is addictive
0:42:51 you were warned about the blood Bond
0:42:53 before but you didn't realize that it
0:42:55 was so all-encompassing and to now you
0:42:58 feel that we're here to Simply ask
0:43:00 you would rush to drink again
0:43:03 brita's posture visibly shifts you can
0:43:06 see her weight fall more on her toes
0:43:10 towards the prince like her hips incline
0:43:13 just a bit more towards him the way that
0:43:15 her hands grip around his wrists is more
0:43:20 protective and there's a bit of like a
0:43:23 trace of her index finger along his
0:43:25 forearm as she drinks
0:43:28 when he has decided you have had your
0:43:30 fill
0:43:31 there's this light shove as if you're
0:43:33 being dismissed off to go stand with the
0:43:35 others she pulls away and makes sure to
0:43:38 get the blood uh to lick the blood off
0:43:41 her lips kind of maintaining eye contact
0:43:43 for a second he gives a satisfied smile
0:43:45 at them and dips back to the codery
0:43:49 let it be known that the will of the
0:43:52 camarillo's order order in all things
0:43:54 any signs of chaos will be subjugated or
0:43:59 broken
0:44:01 britos properly subjugated by the camera
0:44:03 now
0:44:05 our mind is bent to our will
0:44:08 and she will serve loyally
0:44:10 isn't that so Brita
0:44:12 of course you're Grace
0:44:14 having the opportunity to answer him
0:44:16 positively seems to fuel her and even
0:44:20 like sitting down with the codery again
0:44:22 she inclines and sort of like angles
0:44:25 herself like her hands falling into her
0:44:27 lap so that she can kind of look at him
0:44:28 more when she says it and now
0:44:31 we will address the other source of
0:44:34 chaos that has come to this domain to
0:44:36 wreak havoc
0:44:37 Sheriff
0:44:39 bring forth
0:44:41 The malkavian Mastermind thing
0:44:45 his name is Neil and I will go get him
0:44:47 yes that one his name is allegedly new
0:44:52 [Music]
0:44:57 so I'll go back there and I will have
0:45:00 Neil rise and dust him off a little bit
0:45:02 and take a second straighten him out
0:45:04 nine miles
0:45:06 is it it's time to go be prepared
0:45:11 um
0:45:11 yeah I've really tried to prep me for
0:45:15 yeah you okay yeah I'm
0:45:17 he's extraordinarily eccentric I think
0:45:19 something the malkavian prince in Boston
0:45:21 did
0:45:23 so is he here no okay I sent him a
0:45:26 letter and then he went uh bonkers oh
0:45:29 yeah how what kind of crazy paranoid
0:45:33 just paranoid
0:45:35 megalomanias but that's kind of normal
0:45:38 yeah okay he can he's just more paranoid
0:45:42 than we can some of us can do that
0:45:45 through letters and art and things great
0:45:48 I don't know if you have anything to
0:45:49 counteract that that'd be great but
0:45:51 other that's not subtlest you want me to
0:45:53 no okay that's never mind I was just
0:45:56 hoping no sorry well therapy talking to
0:46:01 him really calming him down helping him
0:46:03 to work through his delusions not a
0:46:05 possibility okay well then I got nothing
0:46:07 yep sorry
0:46:09 I mean this is technically worse for me
0:46:10 let's go do this remember you're Neil
0:46:13 not over your sire yeah I know that
0:46:16 good
0:46:17 deal flashes back to when he was
0:46:18 checking your mirror like 20 minutes ago
0:46:20 looking at himself am I me I I know I
0:46:23 may
0:46:23 [Laughter]
0:46:25 let's go okay
0:46:28 um
0:46:29 hey man uh
0:46:31 never mind let's go
0:46:34 let's get through this
0:46:37 miles holds up a finger then the answers
0:46:40 in its brain yes why do you bow to
0:46:43 someone that is so afraid
0:46:46 So Unworthy
0:46:49 why do you let her suffer like that
0:46:52 enslaved
0:46:54 she'll bear the consequences for all our
0:46:56 nights
0:46:58 I don't think it'll be all her nights
0:47:01 as long as you are unwilling to act
0:47:04 shall be
0:47:06 the time may be approaching sooner than
0:47:08 I thought
0:47:13 conquer and
0:47:16 you need but say yes
0:47:20 miles drops his finger and lays us out
0:47:23 what was that was that the
0:47:26 was it was that the um Neil White Taps
0:47:29 the side of his head maybe you want to
0:47:31 ask that later sure yeah okay
0:47:34 it's not gonna have enough on my mind
0:47:36 right now right that's a tomorrow
0:47:37 problem man we gotta stop doing that
0:47:40 that's what got us here well not
0:47:42 everything could be dealt with at once
0:47:43 come along let's see if we can't manage
0:47:46 our way out of this one okay let's try
0:47:48 my best oh by the way I'm your defense
0:47:49 Neil looks like actually relieved when
0:47:52 miles says I'm your defense freeze is
0:47:54 your prosecutor yeah I kind of figured
0:47:55 that one I have no idea how this is
0:47:57 going to go depends I guess on if I give
0:47:59 a confession let's try not to
0:48:02 say
0:48:03 no as much sorry all right yeah let's go
0:48:07 let's see what happens let's go yep we
0:48:09 got some ideas
0:48:13 [Music]
0:48:16 Upton Rowlands gestures to his longtime
0:48:20 friend Reiss to begin addressing the
0:48:23 chord Reef steps forward
0:48:26 rather scrawny diminutive man or the
0:48:29 beakish nose and slick back hair guard
0:48:32 of New Haven
0:48:34 the reason that we are gathered was
0:48:36 because and rumors had begun
0:48:38 that kneel of them Clan markavian
0:48:42 had in fact been replaced by his
0:48:45 blood-hunted sire I wish to bring forth
0:48:47 good news to the court Neil is indeed
0:48:50 who he says he is we have formed the
0:48:51 tests and we believe that Neil is in
0:48:55 fact the mulcavian Kindred who acted
0:48:58 valiantly during the Lupine attack that
0:49:01 happened not so long ago
0:49:03 however
0:49:05 during the course of our investigation
0:49:06 it became apparent that Neo is a student
0:49:11 of his bloodhunted sire he is a
0:49:14 practitioner of foul
0:49:16 desert Magics has been prone to the
0:49:19 sacrifice of living people and animals
0:49:22 alike in order to channel their power
0:49:25 and perhaps worst of all like his sire
0:49:29 he is in League with an order of
0:49:31 Assassins hailing back
0:49:33 to the legendary Eagle's Nest
0:49:36 kneel is the pawn of Assamites
0:49:40 there's like a slight gasp
0:49:42 not only is he in Pawn of these asamites
0:49:44 he was directly involved in a violation
0:49:47 of the Masquerade and tended into
0:49:50 Asha members of this way with Clan into
0:49:54 the domain jeopardizing all of its
0:49:56 citizens by exposing them to rampant
0:49:59 Diablo's monsters
0:50:01 this is so true
0:50:03 at the scourge and shaded a takedown and
0:50:06 successfully captured one of these
0:50:10 Assamites
0:50:11 it is regrettable no no it is suspicious
0:50:16 that when one of these Assamites were
0:50:18 brought in
0:50:19 others
0:50:21 intervened
0:50:23 and as a result of their malicious
0:50:25 intent
0:50:26 that asamite continues to run free
0:50:29 through this domain
0:50:31 none of you are safe
0:50:34 the assemites are here Neil has ensured
0:50:37 that they arrive safely and with every
0:50:39 Advantage they need in order to take the
0:50:41 unlives of the camera like Kindred no
0:50:43 doubt they are hired
0:50:45 by the Shabbat there's another gasp
0:50:48 it is no secret at this point
0:50:51 and Neil's quarterly is possessed of
0:50:53 many ties to the Sabbath and therefore
0:50:56 would be rather simple for Neo who left
0:50:59 with the Sabbat during The Siege
0:51:01 she broke her an agreement and offered
0:51:04 the aid of the Assamites in exchange for
0:51:06 his freedom
0:51:08 so yes
0:51:09 it would have been
0:51:11 good news that such an upstanding
0:51:12 Kindred has returned to the domain
0:51:14 safely but unfortunately
0:51:17 Neil is no upstanding kindred
0:51:20 he is a Madman
0:51:22 wielding the powers of Duran key
0:51:26 and uses them to betray this domain to
0:51:30 threaten our Prince
0:51:33 his actions make that of British seemed
0:51:35 benign
0:51:37 but I'm a man with an open mind
0:51:40 and I invite miles to prove otherwise
0:51:43 he takes a step back and returns to a
0:51:45 seat
0:51:46 I'll take a step forward present myself
0:51:48 to the crowd
0:51:50 presented an entirely different figure
0:51:52 than Maurice
0:51:54 in many ways
0:51:57 prove what
0:51:59 so far I've heard a number of
0:52:01 accusations and very little proof of
0:52:03 anything but
0:52:05 we will start with what we do know
0:52:07 as you established this is Neil Foster
0:52:10 and he has learned of magics to help
0:52:14 this domain in the case of the return of
0:52:16 his siren this is gasp Neil's face gets
0:52:20 sort of a like At first like ah [ __ ] and
0:52:22 then we could just because after 30
0:52:24 years of like don't tell anybody just
0:52:26 telling the court he just reflects
0:52:28 emotion
0:52:29 but then sort of resolves into a all
0:52:31 right we're doing this let's do this
0:52:32 miles see knowing the trouble that his
0:52:36 sire caused the domain before has sought
0:52:38 to remove any stains that the clanimal
0:52:41 caveman and his work diligently in its
0:52:44 defense and its rise
0:52:46 in terms of the camarilla he's worked
0:52:48 diligent with me and my codery as me as
0:52:52 the sheriff and with the former Sheriff
0:52:53 to The Domain to guarantee the safety of
0:52:57 all of its citizens
0:52:58 even during the attempted Praxis of the
0:53:02 domain even when a Lupine threatened the
0:53:05 domain he was there to protect you all
0:53:08 and to help Dakota reduce do this
0:53:12 it would be a significant loss to The
0:53:14 Domain in the upcoming battle with the
0:53:16 Sabbat that we would lose such a member
0:53:19 that would help us
0:53:20 defeat these forces
0:53:22 and for it to be implied that he is of
0:53:25 the Sabbat that the prince has put
0:53:27 Sabbat supporters in positions of power
0:53:30 seems
0:53:32 audacious
0:53:33 the question that prints so much
0:53:36 especially with
0:53:37 little to no evidence or proof and an
0:53:40 individual that hasn't shown up at
0:53:42 quarter supposedly got away
0:53:45 seems very circumstantial at best
0:53:47 I think the benefit of the domain is
0:53:50 that we reward Neo for his service by
0:53:53 his continued service to The Domain
0:53:55 to continue the order
0:53:57 and well-being of this domain in the
0:53:58 face of all of the things that might be
0:54:01 trying to bring it down
0:54:04 and I will take a sweep around
0:54:07 give a bow take my seat
0:54:09 Reiss comes forward
0:54:11 God of New Haven miles vaguely makes
0:54:15 reference to advantages provided by Neo
0:54:19 well why are they really
0:54:21 I gave no warning of the Lupine attack
0:54:23 no warning of this about attack he did
0:54:25 not fight the Lupine did not fight the
0:54:27 Savant did not make any effort to
0:54:29 preserve any country life save for
0:54:31 perhaps else of London but we only
0:54:33 believe that because she was forced to
0:54:35 pay a boon
0:54:37 so
0:54:38 I will keep it simple for miles to say
0:54:42 does Neil zester on Ki if so who taught
0:54:47 him
0:54:49 did Neil bring an Assamites into the
0:54:52 domain of New Haven
0:54:54 how did Neil escape the Sabah
0:54:58 he turns and it's back to a seat
0:55:01 Neil looks over at miles just silently
0:55:04 sort of indicating with his face like do
0:55:06 you want me to answer those questions do
0:55:07 you want me to shut up like
0:55:09 give me some direction here boss I don't
0:55:10 know what's going on I I'll Stand Up
0:55:13 signal for nail and then he might be
0:55:15 talking but not at this moment
0:55:17 swear that Rhys brings up all of the
0:55:20 defense of the domain during the
0:55:22 incursion because I was there and I
0:55:24 didn't see him doing much of anything
0:55:25 besides attacking my coteries so I'll
0:55:28 have no attacks on anyone's character
0:55:30 during this meeting if you intend to
0:55:31 bring something forward against oh I was
0:55:33 just reminding him so Therese you're
0:55:34 welcome to do do not interrupt me you
0:55:36 fool
0:55:38 if you wish to bring allegations against
0:55:40 messenger please do so after these
0:55:43 questions have been answered
0:55:49 miles takes a moment and gives a small
0:55:51 bow to the prince in regards to his
0:55:53 words
0:55:54 I will let Neil speak to
0:55:56 where he learned durangi
0:55:59 and why
0:56:01 part of this tip seeking out a character
0:56:03 is I don't think I actually know no we
0:56:05 did not explain that so
0:56:08 I'm not comfortable just making [ __ ] up
0:56:10 right now because
0:56:12 you gotta keep it right yep that also we
0:56:15 are surrounded by people who could tell
0:56:16 when we're lying right so like
0:56:18 but I believe in his intent and his
0:56:21 ability
0:56:23 and that also that he did try to warn
0:56:26 the domain about the coming of the
0:56:28 lupine
0:56:29 the timing was
0:56:31 difficult to pin down
0:56:33 and I will reach to raise kneel up in
0:56:37 front of the crowd give him a steady he
0:56:39 definitely needs a hand on his elbow to
0:56:41 get him up
0:56:42 give him a studying presence hand on the
0:56:45 back so that he stands up straighter
0:56:46 instead of his normal hunched with Miles
0:56:48 correcting his posture it was actually
0:56:50 reasonably tall
0:56:52 probably taller than Miles and Miles
0:56:53 will take a step back to allow Neil to
0:56:56 take the thing
0:56:58 um
0:56:59 hi everybody I don't uh
0:57:02 sorry I'm not used to being in front of
0:57:04 everyone
0:57:04 um so I'm just gonna look over there and
0:57:06 he turns and just looks directly at The
0:57:08 Prince and doesn't look at anyone else
0:57:11 because a crowd will make him Panic so
0:57:14 he just focuses all his energy on
0:57:15 talking to the prince
0:57:17 it's true that I uh
0:57:21 pursue a Mastery of Heaven and Earth
0:57:23 um
0:57:24 I learned it originally from my sire
0:57:28 decades ago just the very basic precepts
0:57:31 before he went crazy
0:57:34 and betrayed all of us
0:57:37 and abandoned me
0:57:39 I kept trying to learn
0:57:43 at first out of a sense of curiosity
0:57:47 just knowledge to know things for the
0:57:50 sake of knowing them it was really hard
0:57:53 to learn on my own I didn't have any
0:57:56 teachers or writings or just the very
0:58:00 basic principles
0:58:01 but I I made a little progress and then
0:58:04 when
0:58:05 in the 80s I met miles and he brought me
0:58:09 into his cotery I had a new reason to
0:58:12 keep learning I wanted to be useful
0:58:16 I'm not
0:58:17 I I wanted to do good I wanted to do
0:58:21 good for the domain and the camarilla
0:58:24 and I wanted to
0:58:27 prove that I was worth something so I
0:58:30 kept trying to learn
0:58:31 on my own for a long time
0:58:34 um I don't have a lot of skill but I I
0:58:37 know enough
0:58:39 to be useful also I did try and warn
0:58:42 people about the Lupine um
0:58:45 actually I I learned I I specifically
0:58:47 Beyond just trying to tell people about
0:58:49 it I told the cotery and Johnny and
0:58:52 Miles about it
0:58:54 and Johnny Miles killed it so
0:58:57 yeah also I don't sacrifice people
0:59:00 that's insane
0:59:02 um that's that's like an insane thing to
0:59:04 think he does look over also laughs at
0:59:06 the irony and all of her toyators start
0:59:08 laughing and then the court laughs
0:59:11 uh
0:59:13 Neil is looking at Rhys and so doesn't
0:59:15 quite register that a bunch of toriador
0:59:17 are laughing at him no no no no no no no
0:59:19 no no no no you're not laughing at you
0:59:21 got it
0:59:22 so he doesn't register that your joke
0:59:24 your comment beip which became a
0:59:27 successful quip thank you sorry or
0:59:29 willed it it's really funny
0:59:33 um but he does he is looking at Reiss
0:59:35 with this very Earnest which probably
0:59:38 helps to sell it but like this very
0:59:40 Earnest like man that's crazy like uh
0:59:42 yeah who makes people into objects who
0:59:45 sacrifices people that's that's crazy
0:59:49 um and maybe just Rhys would catch this
0:59:52 because he's looking right at him but
0:59:54 there's sort of an undercurrent of like
0:59:56 and you would know that if you knew
0:59:58 magic right
1:00:00 then he looks back at the prince
1:00:02 uh Your Grace I I I'll answer any
1:00:05 questions you have uh at all who is the
1:00:08 size of mine
1:00:09 which one the one that you smuggled into
1:00:12 the domain we didn't smuggle anyone into
1:00:15 the domain well he seems to know what
1:00:17 we're talking about so
1:00:19 she uh reached out to me
1:00:21 um and asked for my help uh because
1:00:26 they're
1:00:27 are a number of assamites
1:00:30 um who very soon are likely to be
1:00:33 looking for
1:00:35 a shift in allegiances
1:00:38 and
1:00:39 um
1:00:40 I I know that it may be hard to hard to
1:00:43 believe sometimes but I I am a good
1:00:45 representative of the camera and and you
1:00:48 your Grayson and the domain of New Haven
1:00:50 and so
1:00:51 they reached out um
1:00:54 and my thinking was uh
1:00:58 if they're looking for a new home and a
1:01:01 new
1:01:01 person to pledge their allegiance to
1:01:04 oh
1:01:06 well I I love New Haven so I I live here
1:01:09 and and this is your domain and I
1:01:12 thought maybe
1:01:14 you know it kind of trails off but
1:01:15 there's the look on his face is very
1:01:17 much like hey man put the pieces
1:01:18 together that is positively the most
1:01:22 ridiculous and as he gets ready to
1:01:24 continue ranting opt-in pauses when one
1:01:28 of the tremeer breaks formation
1:01:31 and approaches Rhys or the cell phone
1:01:36 and very quietly they speak between each
1:01:40 other close enough that you can still
1:01:41 hear
1:01:42 and The Apprentice says
1:01:44 my region something has happened
1:01:47 you are called
1:01:49 you are called to uh
1:01:52 our superiors have called upon you and
1:01:56 every Magus in the region and every
1:02:00 region and Rhys kind of looks between
1:02:05 Neil and The Apprentice
1:02:08 what what just happened
1:02:11 curse Lord Reiss
1:02:14 my cars has been broken
1:02:17 Reiss's jawline tenses and he kind of
1:02:20 scans the room nervously
1:02:23 um
1:02:24 forgive me oh Grace there is uh
1:02:28 there's business elsewhere that I'm
1:02:30 called to
1:02:31 it would seem
1:02:33 that something has happened
1:02:36 among these Assamites
1:02:38 and
1:02:40 they have delivered
1:02:42 a blow against the camera
1:02:45 I will um Endeavor to
1:02:48 undress that as quickly as possible uh
1:02:50 if you'll excuse me and Johnny pipes up
1:02:53 at this and actually goes your grace you
1:02:57 asked this Premiere to to prosecute him
1:03:00 ask him to finish his work and not leave
1:03:02 your court so callously Rhys you are to
1:03:05 turn and you're to finish your objective
1:03:09 as assigned to you
1:03:11 throughout like this whole little
1:03:13 exchange and even through Johnny's
1:03:15 outburst and what the prince is saying
1:03:17 Neil is just looking directly at race
1:03:20 Bretta is also looking directly at Upton
1:03:23 Rowlands
1:03:24 as a reminder
1:03:28 uh
1:03:30 bill is looking directly at Reiss and
1:03:34 sort of to himself sort of to Reiss just
1:03:37 mutters the word
1:03:40 Reiss's fist that his fists ball up
1:03:44 until the weights of his knuckles become
1:03:47 visible
1:03:49 of course your grace
1:03:51 considering that Neil has admitted to
1:03:53 virtually every crime I've accused him
1:03:55 of it is my recommendation that you
1:03:57 undergo ordeal
1:03:59 somebody want to explain their deal it
1:04:01 is a form of trial among the camera
1:04:04 where a quest is given to a kindred who
1:04:08 is believed to have violated camera lost
1:04:11 this could be done by a prince or a just
1:04:13 a car parameters are given out and if
1:04:16 the Kindred fails their ordeal they are
1:04:20 admitting guilt and suffer dire
1:04:22 consequences usually final death
1:04:25 opt-in give it a nod to Reiss has always
1:04:29 fallen for his plan and then Wing set
1:04:32 miles oh my [ __ ] god oh no
1:04:35 jealous
1:04:38 oh I hate that me too
1:04:44 I have just the ordeal for you Neil
1:04:48 he like licks his hands and like adjusts
1:04:52 his hair yes regrets there is a
1:04:57 concerted effort being made to repel
1:04:58 this sabot you are aware of much of it
1:05:02 and it is said by yourself and Miles
1:05:05 then you intend to use your strange
1:05:08 alien magics
1:05:10 to help the domain rather than hinder it
1:05:12 it just so happens
1:05:14 that there is an individual that has
1:05:16 disrupted progress
1:05:19 our allies the followers of satin have
1:05:21 been developing a force and have forged
1:05:24 deep alliances with the anarch movement
1:05:27 there is one however that has been a
1:05:30 thorn in our side
1:05:33 you are will use your perverse
1:05:37 assassin magic and you will end the
1:05:41 bruja known as Amara
1:05:43 once and for all
1:05:48 two successes to uh not Frenzy
1:05:53 Neil looks stricken not because he has
1:05:57 like a super close relationship with
1:05:58 Amar he's never like once maybe ever but
1:06:02 just going on a murder mission is so
1:06:04 that's just he doesn't so Smite it's so
1:06:08 Assamite and also it's just not Neil but
1:06:12 he says nothing do I get a rebuttal of
1:06:14 this or is he making a proclamation at
1:06:16 this point oh no he's he's like this is
1:06:18 his Proclamation uh uh which you know
1:06:21 can be discussed miles yes friends
1:06:25 it has been brought to my attention
1:06:27 by the followers of certain that they
1:06:29 are owed by this court I have made
1:06:31 arrangements to see to it that this
1:06:35 absolves your quadri of any debts owed
1:06:37 to and the followers have set and we can
1:06:41 all move forward with a strong
1:06:42 relationship uh Neil you're going to you
1:06:46 are given UH 60 nights
1:06:49 to see to it that she meets final death
1:06:51 during this time you're to be treated
1:06:54 fairly you will not be harassed for uh
1:06:57 suffer any accusations regarding your
1:06:59 behavior and
1:07:01 the uh saracen that you have invited
1:07:05 into this domain uh is not to be
1:07:08 destroyed to Let's receive my
1:07:10 intolerance uh until we reconvene to
1:07:13 discuss your performance
1:07:15 yes you're great is he legitimately
1:07:18 declaring war against the [ __ ]
1:07:19 anarchs in court essentially it's way
1:07:22 worse than that yeah what he's actually
1:07:24 saying is that most of the anarchs uh
1:07:26 the followers of set have dug their
1:07:28 claws into and that there's one anarch
1:07:31 that's like basically resisting yeah
1:07:33 that's why we need a third war Johnny's
1:07:36 eyes flash over towards weathers what is
1:07:39 his reaction weathers has very slowly
1:07:42 gotten up stepped away
1:07:45 and you catch him just as he slips out
1:07:47 the door without anyone noticing
1:07:50 Johnny will slowly start backing away
1:07:53 from the crowd and try to do the same to
1:07:55 catch him before he leaves court all
1:07:57 right give me a manipulation plus
1:08:00 stealth
1:08:03 two successes all right with the two
1:08:05 successes you slip out
1:08:08 um
1:08:09 Your Grace I I sort of I don't want to
1:08:12 make any assumptions as to your will
1:08:14 um
1:08:15 do you wanna
1:08:16 um if
1:08:18 she used to be destroyed uh and she
1:08:21 finds herself inside the balance of your
1:08:24 domain uh
1:08:25 does this ordeal carry with it the right
1:08:30 of oh she's an anarchy um yes sir all
1:08:33 Kindred Bound by the traditions
1:08:36 and yes
1:08:37 you have right of Destruction over this
1:08:39 Wayward bruja yes sir take a head and
1:08:43 when you have it
1:08:44 deliver it to the Setai to Norfolk she
1:08:47 has indicated that she has use of her
1:08:49 head
1:08:50 yesterday
1:08:52 Neil looks like he's gonna throw up even
1:08:54 more so than he kind of usually does but
1:08:56 doesn't say anything be made where that
1:09:00 Miles has performed admirably and uh
1:09:04 through uh his work with some support
1:09:06 from his quarterly has uh brought about
1:09:09 the final death
1:09:11 of
1:09:13 Arabella Rowlands
1:09:14 and as such should be seen as a kindred
1:09:17 of great standing within this domain
1:09:20 I guess I will take this opportunity to
1:09:22 take out her dignity I knew there was a
1:09:25 fancy word for it get close and present
1:09:28 it to him and I'm like oh Christ this
1:09:31 declaration and open court
1:09:34 yes of course
1:09:37 not getting it I pass it over to him
1:09:41 miles is demonstrated
1:09:43 incredible loyalty to this domain
1:09:47 and as such I have one final decree for
1:09:50 the evening before I go about my
1:09:53 business oh [ __ ] yeah
1:09:57 let it be known
1:10:00 that miles is relieved of his position
1:10:03 as Sheriff of this domain and he will
1:10:06 instead serve as my senator
1:10:09 [ __ ]
1:10:10 please that was in character
1:10:14 yeah what is my husband's reaction I
1:10:16 needed a narrative do you a narrative
1:10:19 his face is very much a sign of great
1:10:23 acceptance and a great gift from his
1:10:26 Prince doesn't his cautery can be like
1:10:28 are like [ __ ] he wants to like kill
1:10:31 someone subterfuge extra first yeah uh
1:10:35 is that in my bonuses coming into this
1:10:37 procedure sigh or anything like that
1:10:39 yeah you're gonna prestigious Circle
1:10:42 four or five successes you nailed it
1:10:45 maybe I was born to do this
1:10:48 Rhys
1:10:49 does not look unfazed by this decree and
1:10:52 as he slinks off to go deal with
1:10:54 whatever pressing issue he has been
1:10:56 approached about he gives you this look
1:10:58 like a war has just been declared and
1:11:02 then he heads off
1:11:03 and Upton who is blissfully unaware of
1:11:06 this says senatorial
1:11:10 you have two responsibilities that are
1:11:12 laid before you I expect both of them
1:11:14 done post haste first you will find a
1:11:17 new shift to replace you and secondly
1:11:20 this killing spree
1:11:23 has resided into my domain quite long
1:11:26 enough
1:11:27 see to it that they are eradicated
1:11:30 yes your prince oh and one more thing
1:11:34 see like saying this lovely like leans
1:11:36 over and puts his like armor on your
1:11:38 shoulder and like you can like like feel
1:11:41 his like scratchy stubble like against
1:11:45 your ear that he gets so like close
1:11:48 and there's enough chance then Rhys may
1:11:51 be offended
1:11:52 in case he is
1:11:54 I happen to know if something he wants
1:11:56 very much so quietly I wish for you to
1:11:58 arrange something
1:12:00 there is a man
1:12:02 as you know he was the man responsible
1:12:04 for the house that has all these odd
1:12:07 rubbish rumors
1:12:08 uh what was that name Zantos yes zantosa
1:12:13 the city that he is acquired and turned
1:12:14 over to Reiss
1:12:16 he Patsy on the back gets up and walks
1:12:18 away
1:12:22 [Music]
1:12:25 I guess I approached the diet like the
1:12:28 guys at that point and be like
1:12:30 I guess this is adjourned
1:12:33 core kind of gives you for like you
1:12:36 actually get like a bit of like a look
1:12:37 of like kind of understanding from a lot
1:12:41 of the court and I seem relieved that
1:12:43 someone adjourned it and they start
1:12:45 going about their business before they
1:12:46 go too far
1:12:48 one thing
1:12:49 I say this is Miles Davenport of Clan
1:12:52 ventru also Linden has been
1:12:55 a great asset to the court
1:12:58 and a pleasure to have in the Elysium
1:13:01 and I wish to apologize for anything
1:13:03 that I may have said or done that showed
1:13:06 any disrespect to her or Clan Toyota
1:13:09 and I will like put my hand out and like
1:13:11 bow my head towards her in her general
1:13:13 direction out over that way there's a
1:13:15 pregnant pause before Elsa makes
1:13:18 extremely light with the fact that there
1:13:19 was just a trial and gives a simple wink
1:13:22 as her response I can give her a smile
1:13:24 back and Nod and
1:13:26 hopefully the air is changed in this
1:13:28 court and I want to go murder something
1:13:31 Victoria obviously fun over how smooth
1:13:34 she was and there seems to be this very
1:13:36 sudden break in tension when she winks
1:13:38 and I will remove myself from my Dice
1:13:40 and like look at Neil and like give him
1:13:42 my shoulder strugging like uh

1:16:18 you have to keep screaming Neil is is
1:16:20 gin tequila Bitters and milk

1:16:48 don't know that any of this mix is well
1:16:50 can you do like absinthe tequila oh
1:16:53 I don't know alcohols very well so like
1:16:55 I'm just absence is a very strong Irish
1:16:58 flavor yeah I don't know that that would
1:17:00 necessarily complement any oh it would
1:17:03 not yeah you need like citrus with
1:17:05 absent really
1:17:06 I think what about hibiscus uh
1:17:10 all right now I'm thinking of in
