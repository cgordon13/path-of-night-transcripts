0:02:08 necessary back in the 90s I like how you
0:02:11 just slammed all of us at once they just
0:02:13 they just they have they in the in the
0:02:15 trunk there was actually a space to load
0:02:17 multiple CDs that you could access
0:02:18 through the radio so that way it took
0:02:20 the multi-disc CD player in the trunk
0:02:21 there but if you ever got rear-ended
0:02:23 your stereo system was hosed oh that
0:02:25 sounds well you couldn't change CDs when
0:02:27 you're in the car you'd have to actually
0:02:28 get out get into the trunk but you could
0:02:30 have like six CDs at once which who
0:02:32 could possibly listen to more music at
0:02:34 once than the songs contained on six
0:02:37 whole CDs you could also have it you
0:02:40 would have an individual CD thing in the
0:02:42 front too that's like

0:11:41 masquerade breach
0:11:43 stupid idiot they're gonna just like
0:11:45 laugh my ass off
0:11:47 all right
0:11:49 get it yes hello low voice all right so
0:11:53 Johnny is going to talk about candy corn
0:11:55 he thinks they're all right a little bit
0:11:57 waxy he understands why some people
0:11:59 might not like him but you know what
0:12:01 some occasionally maybe just a few
0:12:03 pieces of candy corn not too bad
0:12:07 all right that works well medium
0:12:09 but I will say I think Miles may have
0:12:12 given me a piece too many because I
0:12:15 enjoyed the few pieces of candy corn but
0:12:18 now I don't know what to do with these
0:12:19 last seven I mean I guess I could have
0:12:21 fangs candy corn fangs I don't know all
0:12:25 right and a high
0:12:27 but really I think I would prefer some
0:12:30 Reese's cups I mean those are the best
0:12:32 kind of candy but at the end of the day
0:12:34 I probably shouldn't be doing this
0:12:37 because I'm diabetic yeah
0:12:39 so I just wrote up a quick uh miles
0:12:42 color Cipher so it's just 2D 10 rolls
0:12:44 amazing so go ahead and give me a two
0:12:48 rolls and just tell me what they are
0:12:50 seven
0:12:51 two seven two uh so that would be
0:12:54 Nightshade burgundy

0:34:34 yeah absolutely

0:35:10 while I'm just getting real deep in

0:35:27 howl oh
0:35:28 [Music]
0:35:30 dear God that could actually be a decent
0:35:32 segment no not not that specifically but
0:35:36 putting people in a like a radio show I
0:35:38 hate this let's move on
0:35:40 he hates it so that means it's
0:35:42 automatically win radio like segment
0:35:45 where they have a guest just like 30
0:35:47 minutes of them just interviewing
0:35:49 someone and here we have some Bible
0:35:51 producer occasionally Cuts in you're
0:35:54 gonna like spitting your coffee let's
0:35:55 discuss coffee
0:36:04 so yeah if we're doing radio shows
0:36:09 I love this soundboard man I like it
0:36:12 better if he just makes it if we're
0:36:14 doing more if we're doing radio shows
0:36:16 it's Johnny you realize that soundboard
0:36:18 is actually a thing right like you don't
0:36:19 just make noises with your mouth
0:36:21 well what do you make them with I'm
0:36:23 sorry what was that Robin you mean the
0:36:24 fake
0:36:26 rob you were saying hey if we're doing
0:36:29 radio shows we need to I I we need at
0:36:32 least two different radio shows one is
0:36:34 the [ __ ] morning Zoo crew Johnny and
0:36:37 win yeah yeah that's us and then the
0:36:39 other one is just an NPR style podcast
0:36:42 Neil and Britta who's talking to whoever
0:36:45 and then miles obviously is producing
0:36:48 for both and just jumps into the middle
0:36:49 of all or he's just the music segment
0:36:52 playing the new hits and now miles with
0:36:54 the news
0:36:56 you're all terrible uh this is Miles
0:36:59 speaking look I love the idea of
0:37:02 everyone doing anything and then miles
0:37:04 just being so uncomfortable on Mike you
0:37:08 guys can each do a commercial Johnny
0:37:10 like if you don't shoot big red [ __ ] you
0:37:15 glare
0:37:22 10th Kingdom tenth Kingdom I really like
0:37:24 that show and I'm not gonna apologize
0:37:26 for it it's great we've talked about we
0:37:28 both own copies of it
0:37:30 I don't think I do anymore well I think
0:37:33 it's still findable I hope it's still
0:37:35 findable I kind of want to watch it now
0:37:38 it was really good well like the first
0:37:41 half is very good the second half is
0:37:43 like less memorable the second half is
0:37:45 fine and it's fun
0:37:48 there's just the biggest problem I have
0:37:51 with it is that the engagement ring is
0:37:55 the worst most annoying thing that could
0:37:58 ever exist and it's like a major plot
0:38:00 point that this is a huge deal and like
0:38:03 it's the perfect one and it is the worst
0:38:05 my remembrance of the the movie after
0:38:07 love town is way less than my
0:38:10 remembrance oh after love town I don't
0:38:12 remember because that's when it stops
0:38:13 being like kind of fairy tale-ish and
0:38:14 being more like plot oriented yeah it
0:38:16 goes to the third act and like oh we
0:38:18 gotta cover some [ __ ] here yeah we gotta
0:38:20 wrap this [ __ ] story because we just
0:38:21 spent
0:38:22 um I don't know an hour in love Town
0:38:25 yeah
0:38:26 on uh half of it is on a side plot for
0:38:29 Wolf
0:38:32 yeah
0:38:33 oh man
0:38:35 it's a good show though
0:38:38 shave off some of the hair that's the
0:38:39 90s undercuts are not really a thing no
0:38:41 they're not you just make it are you
0:38:42 kidding me [ __ ] skater cut yeah oh
0:38:45 yeah Neil is with me skater boy though
0:38:46 I'm just saying it's a thing
0:38:48 later we'll have to be a skater boy
0:38:50 don't worry I recall Tommy
0:38:53 having an undercut and super long hair
0:38:54 oh yeah no I don't recall that no
0:38:56 remember
0:38:57 like come on it's a deep undercut don't
0:39:01 worry
0:39:01 I didn't watch a lot of power yeah
0:39:08 um the soccer
0:39:10 yeah
0:39:13 and it is not your night man no no I
0:39:17 haven't ruled anything well I mean it's
0:39:18 pretty much not been your weekend in
0:39:20 terms of problems
0:39:23 I mean that's you know
0:39:25 maybe we should switch out those dice
0:39:26 for other dice
0:39:28 there's nothing wrong with the dice I'm
0:39:30 just saying it might help to be fair it
0:39:32 can't hurt I distinctly recall Johnny
0:39:34 being a wrecking ball recently yeah so I
0:39:39 think this might just be like
0:39:41 the pendulum swinging the other way Gary
0:39:43 kind of has weird luck like that like
0:39:45 he'll like he'll he'll have a night
0:39:47 where literally everything goes wrong
0:39:50 um and then you have to like as an sc
0:39:52 you have to be careful because you're
0:39:53 like hey I'll throw you a bone diff five
0:39:54 and they're like nah
0:39:56 nah and then there's other times when he
0:40:00 just kind of goes on this glorious
0:40:01 Rampage and kills everything in front of
0:40:03 him
0:40:04 fact
0:40:07 that is low to attack a win out of
0:40:09 anybody here I'm so delicate please no
0:40:12 you are just you're [ __ ] awesome she
0:40:14 is
0:40:15 fine
0:40:16 and you don't deserve that [ __ ] you do
0:40:19 so much for this Coterie and then she's
0:40:20 just giving you all this [ __ ] about
0:40:22 your hood the squad are gonna stick
0:40:24 together
0:40:27 or it could be here whoever the [ __ ] you
0:40:29 are no that's that's clearly you by here
0:40:31 right that's what I thought
0:40:34 I don't know about clearly about that no
0:40:36 it's clearly once you make a beer yeah
0:40:38 he sticks the member of your Quarry all
0:40:41 right Kabir enough enough uh you got me
0:40:43 oh did you know whoa I got fooled You by
0:40:48 ear can talk for himself Kabir do you
0:40:49 buy here please
0:40:51 thank you
0:40:52 I just like to point out that this
0:40:55 exchange is a perfect example of why I
0:40:56 make you test your character voices so
0:40:59 much louder
0:41:04 I forgot that if Jupiter was ever gonna
0:41:07 die I didn't actually expect this to be
0:41:09 yet
0:41:10 um uh I had plans and him confessing his
0:41:13 love for wind we know that I was always
0:41:16 loved yeah he died while we were in a
0:41:17 stupor and got eaten there was not a
0:41:19 chance for final words sounds like
0:41:21 jubiere was also in that stupor yeah you
0:41:23 know honestly we were all on a stupor so
0:41:25 was he who knows what those could have
0:41:27 been his last words yeah
0:41:32 he spent all that time instead of
0:41:34 getting us out of the stupor
0:41:38 I can't wait for the car heads to reply
0:41:40 to this podcast telling us how wrong we
0:41:42 are oh I know right
0:41:44 actually I feel like the overlap in that
0:41:47 Venn diagram is pretty slight
0:41:49 and if you were a fan of path of night
0:41:51 but also a car ahead let us know
0:41:57 please tell us more information so we'd
0:41:59 have to look it up on Google ourselves

0:42:05 no no no no no no okay yeah all these
0:42:08 facts are what the world of Darkness
0:42:09 actually which is like our world but
0:42:12 slightly different we are authorities on
0:42:14 right you don't know now we just piss
0:42:16 off a whole different segment
0:42:18 much more than the car people

0:50:00 no it's like two years later
0:50:02 early 2000s 2000s yeah do you know what
0:50:05 we're talking about
0:50:07 it's where you wear two polos at the
0:50:08 same time so you got two different
0:50:10 colors and they're both popped I know
0:50:12 what the color thing is but this all
0:50:13 just kind of sounds like yeah I have
0:50:15 brosided
0:50:16 Jersey's short of me to be honest not
0:50:19 inaccurate it's north it's north Jersey

0:50:27 right
0:50:29 anyways we get to go to see Morgan we
0:50:32 apologize to our Boston listeners the
0:50:35 feeding is actually insane insanely easy
0:50:38 here
0:50:40 a pun upon everyone waking up Britta
0:50:43 gonna come walking out and see Johnny
0:50:45 just covered in in viscera laying at the
0:50:47 door and he's gonna kind of like look
0:50:49 over at her and be like thanks for
0:50:50 keeping me here
0:50:51 the good news is all right all right all
0:50:54 right let's actually let's yeah that
0:50:56 actually needs to like I mean also good
0:50:57 news their jackets fine yeah my jacket's
0:51:01 clean
0:51:03 and I did bring a pack of white extra
0:51:05 whites
0:51:06 prepared for this very important you got
0:51:09 this I like to think like when I curled
0:51:10 up on the floor I like had a blanket
0:51:12 that like you know like just very like
0:51:14 peaceful like that [ __ ] video of the
0:51:16 dog that goes into his own cage I'm
0:51:18 really just imagining you guys you get
0:51:20 you know uh [ __ ] Bill Paxton from
0:51:22 near dark yes yes and the scene was just
0:51:25 like covered like down the front in his
0:51:27 like all blood it's exactly what Johnny
0:51:29 looks like right now except that you
0:51:31 went through a dude's neck sideways
0:51:32 Johnny getting to touch with his Sabbat
0:51:34 Roots I know right that should be a
0:51:37 theme for this campaign out of the
0:51:39 Sabbat
0:51:40 [Laughter]
0:51:45 I never spent oh yeah yeah honestly
0:51:47 until I started throwing around [ __ ]
0:51:49 sorcery like I people never [ __ ] use
0:51:51 his blood
0:51:52 I use all my blood all the time right
0:51:54 trust me yeah
0:51:58 the only reason that I don't necessarily
0:52:02 want to teach you Celerity is because I
0:52:04 don't want to tank your Humanity
0:52:07 I mean that's reasonable right that's
0:52:10 very reasonable this is a drug I don't
0:52:13 know if you're ready for it listen Brit
0:52:15 is not gonna think that far ahead I can
0:52:17 warn you that right now
0:52:19 well potence is first on the list then
0:52:22 Celerity it's gonna be everyone with
0:52:24 Celerity except for Neil
0:52:26 um I'll give you all day you could have
0:52:27 you could have potent as much potent as

0:52:49 it was immediately going to be as like
0:52:52 all I do is win
0:52:54 anything else
0:52:58 yeah I was straight because I I played
0:53:01 on my head and I was like all right so
0:53:03 then pin dragon's movie was like the
0:53:05 only thing I have left this combat so I

0:59:36 order [ __ ] you [ __ ] you
0:59:39 shouldn't be as effective as it is and
0:59:41 yet here we are
0:59:44 does silver work on dead things
0:59:46 sometimes and was that what's a girl can
0:59:50 silver shoot rates don't want to hit a
0:59:53 ghost okay
0:59:54 but walking through a ghost just bodily
0:59:57 walking through a ghost deals one Corpus
0:59:59 damage to it what about supernatural
1:00:00 rules can we shoot rock salt at him I
1:00:03 mean you can it fits enough rock salt
1:00:05 going through their Corpus that will
1:00:06 absolutely ah that actually talks about
1:00:09 how like rates are afraid to walk around
1:00:11 uh downtown New York City because every
1:00:14 people just walk through you until
1:00:15 you're in a harrowing and you're [ __ ]
1:00:17 so there's like they just don't do it
1:00:20 can't possibly do Times Square no races
1:00:23 in Times Square exactly like nope

1:00:33 great album electric eye and all that
1:00:34 stuff like that you don't like
1:00:35 painkiller ah
1:00:39 that was really a ten point not a link
1:00:41 that is both Tim Garrett friendship and
1:00:44 the miles Johnny friendship all in one
1:00:46 conversation there was some significant
1:00:48 overlap in that little diagram

1:00:53 one another
1:00:54 stack of pancakes
1:00:57 I know you're up but you're about you're

1:01:26 black hand will rise up and choke all
1:01:27 who oppose it I don't know what that
1:01:29 means be careful
1:01:31 watch your back wave that sign around at
1:01:34 the airport
1:01:41 he looks like you're like oh they got me
1:01:44 shucks
1:01:47 fine you know the black hand will rise
1:01:49 up to
1:01:53 uh we're gonna take that again
1:01:58 that's why I like all of the best uh
1:02:01 wrestling moves are the ones that have
1:02:02 no shot of like actually hurting someone
1:02:03 yeah because then they can spam it they
1:02:05 can be dramatic they can like like the
1:02:08 Rock Bottom is not it's like a like I
1:02:11 was gonna say I'd rather Rock Bottom
1:02:12 than spider yeah oh yeah okay
1:02:17 black bottom rock bottom rock bottom
1:02:20 Johnny slowly pulls up his sunglasses
1:02:22 and tosses them to the side maybe that
1:02:24 has to happen in point I mean it makes a
1:02:26 lot of sense that Johnny would be the
1:02:27 most electrified podcast entertainment
1:02:30 yo we're going back to New York at some
1:02:33 point we gotta pass by Stanford right
1:02:35 now
1:02:36 oh it's yeah but you don't meet those
1:02:38 wrestlers if you go there did you think
1:02:40 I was gonna let you message
1:02:41 do you think I was gonna let you mess
1:02:43 with my Coterie well it doesn't matter
1:02:46 what a crazy Journey Johnny trying out
1:02:50 gimmicks just looking in the mirror
1:02:52 fresh out the shower slicking his hair
1:02:55 back they call me Huntress
1:02:58 [Laughter]
1:03:12 I came up with my sister killer
1:03:16 and then she practices it just
1:03:19 um just my favorite I love banter
1:03:23 characters but I I do have a soft spot
1:03:25 for deliberate like like purposely
1:03:28 written I wanted to be adventurous
1:03:32 all right but and yes please
1:03:35 before we talk about suicide squad
1:03:38 another Rebecca's done ranting about the
1:03:39 DC EU I feel like we can get back to
1:03:41 games so actually
1:03:44 no Oh you mean the excellent artistic
1:03:48 cut
1:03:49 I mean Chris was trying to sell us on
1:03:51 the yeah
1:03:53 this episode this up this episode of
1:03:55 path of night is presented in 4-3 to
1:03:57 preserve Lex's original vision
1:04:05 [Applause]
1:04:08 [Music]
1:04:15 they did the math 10 of that movie's in
1:04:17 slow motion the problem is there are
1:04:19 Parts where the slow motion is like
1:04:21 really it like it's so good and it's
1:04:23 like Superman spotting flash is an
1:04:25 excellent slow motion uh the the slow-mo
1:04:28 hot dog the weird dream state of [ __ ]
1:04:31 cyborg great use of slow motion it
1:04:33 totally makes sense but like
1:04:36 the deliberate uses undercut by all the
1:04:39 non-deliberate use the women singing for
1:04:41 Aquaman so my God
1:04:45 not only did that take too long and then
1:04:47 they stretch it out and it doesn't it
1:04:48 takes too long and then they made it
1:04:50 longer right
1:04:51 this is where he starts getting into
1:04:53 that auteur deal okay
1:04:56 let's not turn this into a spider please
1:04:58 stop or anything about the DCU yeah
1:04:59 Rebecca you have wasted so much time
1:05:03 um Rob watch your Dice Man
1:05:05 by the way when I was holding her
1:05:07 [ __ ] dice box I was so tempted to
1:05:10 just jump it out
1:05:17 you have to like
1:05:19 it's dramatically like looks like
1:05:22 everyone understands that you're
1:05:23 thinking thoughts
1:05:27 she was on the wrong side otherwise I
1:05:29 would have felt but I'm like this is a
1:05:30 trap we'll see what happens
1:05:35 okay sticking quiet Neil and then go to
1:05:38 prophecy now
1:05:39 okay guys uh we're at Elysium and I'm uh
1:05:43 just gonna be over here in the corner
1:05:45 not talking to anyone uh trying my best
1:05:48 to just avoid the notice of literally
1:05:51 every story door if I can help it oh you
1:05:53 [ __ ]
1:05:58 doing it over there in the corner
1:06:00 I'm losing it okay it sounds like a good
1:06:04 time to go into Rob for a second oh
1:06:08 [ __ ] you guys [ __ ] oh how are there
1:06:12 multiple jokes at my expense like like
1:06:15 spread the [ __ ] wealth a little bit I
1:06:17 mean we were hitting how about you just
1:06:19 don't tell us what to do Rob because you
1:06:21 sell it so well Rob yeah I do love
1:06:24 attention
1:06:25 your voice
1:06:27 I see
1:06:30 I've gone too far back looking into the
1:06:33 toilet I see
1:06:35 so many weird musical guests
1:06:38 like a bad version of SNL haul just
1:06:42 taking
1:06:43 horrible wet shits
1:06:46 miles what have you been feeding them
1:06:48 feeding them
1:06:51 pretty much
1:06:52 how do you plan to get loud what's
1:06:56 what's with Neil yeah
1:07:00 I really
1:07:02 I really just need you
1:07:06 to not
1:07:09 come back
1:07:12 all right probably about as loud as it's
1:07:14 gonna get I really thought he was gonna
1:07:15 say to stop doing the Mickey Mouse yeah
1:07:17 I don't
1:07:19 sound like that okay I just I just want
1:07:24 you don't sound like that what does he
1:07:26 sound like
1:07:34 yeah that was Goofy falling off a cliff
1:07:36 I'm glad
1:07:38 we got there though
1:07:43 he was all right so I'm Gonna Keep you a
1:07:47 little bit lower but I might arise uh
1:07:51 it does make the dream work all right
1:07:53 here I am testing for Britta
1:07:55 guys I would really really like to talk
1:07:58 to Nyx and maybe really hunt before this
1:08:01 I when Miles said to go get some people
1:08:04 it was kind of hard not to stop
1:08:07 because talking to next talking to Nyx
1:08:09 has been pushed off every time that
1:08:10 we've been to court and I mean the last
1:08:12 time I came to court I was wasn't even
1:08:14 acknowledged what do you think they know
1:08:16 about that do I have to say that to
1:08:19 someone
1:08:23 so much room to get loud all right
1:08:25 Bruno stop talking we're at court you're
1:08:27 just making things annoying all right we
1:08:30 have other things to do we'll get to
1:08:31 your business with NYX later oh so now
1:08:34 you want me to stop talking at court but
1:08:36 it was okay to put me in front of a
1:08:38 prince and another domain I mean what if
1:08:42 Roland well what if Roland hates me now
1:08:45 now that I'm acknowledged
1:08:50 I've forgotten Rebecca specifically gets
1:08:53 you everything yeah she does she does
1:08:56 because our initial response as well who
1:08:59 [ __ ] cares
1:09:02 we're like
1:09:04 you're actually obligated to care
1:09:07 that's a [ __ ] isn't it I don't know
1:09:09 what you're talking about
1:09:11 this seems normal to me
1:09:15 you know also if it happens again where
1:09:17 you have to get blood from one of us you
1:09:19 can know hey maybe not uh win or or
1:09:23 miles I love you guys but I don't want
1:09:26 to love you that hard Neil's becoming
1:09:29 our living ball director you guys are
1:09:30 like my best friends but not like my I
1:09:32 don't want you to be my best friend yo
1:09:34 you guys should know valderry yeah
1:09:37 you guys want a valderry all right I
1:09:40 could probably like him Johnny stop it
1:09:41 it sounds like everyone's ready
1:09:46 is that tea or is that water with a tea
1:09:48 bag genuine question
1:09:50 um it's a water infuser water it's like
1:09:54 it's basically herbal tea okay um but
1:09:57 it's billed as a water flavor it's a
1:10:00 really ugly Ice Cube that she she didn't
1:10:02 want to leave
1:10:03 all on its own in the in the freezer so
1:10:05 she was a champion I felt bad for it it
1:10:07 needed a friend
1:10:09 I'll drink you even though I don't want
1:10:12 to
1:10:13 be a way worse question but apparently
1:10:15 is that water or tea is a valid question
1:10:17 yes water infuser y'all do that right
1:10:20 y'all like put like weird personalities
1:10:22 on the internet anime objects where
1:10:24 you're like damn it the episode season
1:10:26 one episode one yes
1:10:28 well you absolutely you I purposely pick
1:10:31 out the like bent cardboard box if I'm
1:10:33 buying something yeah because no one
1:10:35 else will love it yep yeah no one else
1:10:37 is gonna buy you I'll do it
1:10:40 I can name this pencil Eric and your
1:10:43 heart will break a little as I break it
1:10:48 the ones are dope
1:10:49 we're pack animals it is a sign of ultra
1:10:52 this is a great it's a great speech that
1:10:54 he makes at the end of the first episode
1:10:55 of community
1:11:00 time we see a dog and C-Dog yo my
1:11:03 vampires yo you guys snort you need to
1:11:07 snort it bro
1:11:11 we've upgraded yeah see dog get these
1:11:13 guys some stuff
1:11:15 hey yo C-Dog here
1:11:18 front main problem biscuit cover band
1:11:24 stay stale cookie I'm not call ourselves
1:11:27 limp corny oh boy I'm gonna have to work
1:11:31 on some branding but limp Coney X
1:11:34 the X me I mean I guess the real
1:11:36 question is do you consider yourself a
1:11:37 musician
1:11:40 I don't know he might not taste good I
1:11:43 don't know maybe you need to hear these
1:11:44 raps hey my dog do you consider new
1:11:48 metal rap rock music because then yes
1:11:51 but I also just like damn it I'm so
1:11:53 hungry but no
1:11:56 I'm sorry I'm not I'm pretty okay with
1:11:59 it actually turns out he's chosen his
1:12:00 Hill to starve on now I know y'all be
1:12:03 loving this [ __ ] right here
1:12:05 hmm
1:12:08 look at over miles do they have to be
1:12:10 original musicians or can they just like
1:12:12 I know it turns out not well yeah but
1:12:16 where's the lower bar some days you want
1:12:19 to sleep in
1:12:21 so it turns out that their actual
1:12:23 ability to play music plays very
1:12:25 everything sucks you just can't win
1:12:27 what's very funny everybody gets snuffed
1:12:30 what the concept of Miles being like
1:12:33 [ __ ] I'm hungry because I carry a
1:12:34 weed whacker can we just get full scenes
1:12:36 of high miles
1:12:40 I feel like high miles would be very
1:12:42 paranoid guys I just don't
1:12:43 guys
1:12:44 you're my friends like I know you're my
1:12:46 Coterie but you're my
1:12:47 friend what the [ __ ] is wrong with Miles

1:13:05 God damn it
1:13:10 now that is extra Tang
1:13:13 oh come on oh
1:13:17 that is just unpalatable
1:13:21 oh yeah I would have to kill those
1:13:22 characters
1:13:24 just something horrible
1:13:27 Killer Bees just rolling
1:13:30 I said to my man hey dog I was like hey
1:13:33 dog what's the dog who's the best rapper
1:13:35 in the game and he was like method and I
1:13:37 was like yeah obviously but what's your
1:13:39 favorite drink and he was like I don't
1:13:41 know Hi-C and I was like exactly so we
1:13:43 could be like extra Tang c x right
1:13:47 and he looked at me was like you smoke
1:13:49 way too much man
1:13:52 that's how we came up with our band it's
1:13:53 a great way to introduce Theo Bell
1:13:55 physically on screen is happening
1:13:56 incorrect best wrap of all time is
1:13:58 Eminem followed closely by Fred Durst oh
1:14:01 no
1:14:03 my name is Watts
1:14:07 Slim Shady
1:14:09 I feel like ICP is like the bottom of
1:14:13 all barrels
1:14:17 I I truly consider Limp Biscuit a more
1:14:21 dignified fandom I am the Steve Rogers
1:14:24 didn't Juggalos Juggalos
1:14:29 yeah I can't disagree with you
1:14:33 and yet
1:14:34 I have to admit that if magnets was out
1:14:36 in 99 uh our Miracles is at 99 I feel
1:14:40 like Neil would love that song Neil is
1:14:43 barely not a juggalo like honestly not
1:14:46 oddly if Neil had more confidence and a
1:14:49 willingness to like break windows and
1:14:52 [ __ ] he'd be a joke
1:14:54 Johnny uh Johnny distinctly looks at the
1:14:57 pile of blood sorcery and then
1:14:58 immediately walks past it over to it
1:15:00 over to the white makeup and the black
1:15:02 makeup sitting on his vanity grabs and
1:15:04 goes what is this
1:15:06 sorry are you a juggalo no I just love
1:15:10 kiss

1:15:55 all right we're starting
1:15:56 [Laughter]

1:16:00 yeah I spaced out
1:16:05 and we will cut to win who is at the
1:16:08 shack I think she still has a monster in
1:16:11 her refrigerator uh oh my God I don't

1:17:29 [ __ ] just like I was about to say
1:17:32 Brujah but that seems a little bias
1:17:37 thank you what a moment of character
1:17:40 growth
1:17:41 maybe a testament look statistics say
1:17:46 it's usually
1:17:48 it's just because you hang out with
1:17:49 Johnny a lot statistics don't lie
1:17:54 succession at this point
1:17:56 I'm sorry guys we're just in the sound
1:17:58 tests I mean technically it is recorded
1:18:01 but all right
1:18:05 God damn it you know what good [ __ ] you
1:18:08 guys you know what we can do it again
1:18:11 all right so you want to go back to
1:18:13 Mickey Mouse all right none of this is
1:18:16 what can we do the sound Test please can
1:18:18 we do the sound Test please
1:18:23 with sugar on top
1:18:25 this is not better I'm sorry
1:18:28 I can't stop it after like she's doing
1:18:30 the [ __ ] Batman thing why are you
1:18:31 making me do the prophecy voice
1:18:36 would you like to do prophecy boys no no
1:18:38 that's not what I was
1:18:41 [Laughter]
1:18:53 [Laughter]
1:18:58 oh [ __ ]
1:19:02 Rob has gotten up and walked away from
1:19:05 the table
1:19:06 I think he doesn't come
1:19:09 here combination about being funny and
1:19:11 horrified oh I would I would just like
1:19:13 to know this is this is the first but
1:19:16 perhaps not the last time we'll all be
1:19:18 crying today
1:19:21 I didn't say anything
1:19:25 [Laughter]
1:19:32 you just happen to be like
1:19:35 tangential to the damage he was dealing
1:19:38 at
1:19:39 no I think I think Lex was right I think
1:19:42 we're done oh my God
1:19:44 a good session everybody all right I
1:19:46 just want to say that was an emotional
1:19:48 emotional coaster
1:19:51 we'll do better next time man we're not
1:19:53 contributing yeah that's the next post
1:19:55 credits is just five minutes of us
1:19:57 laughing yeah no no joke just that
1:20:02 Rob having turned up your gains
1:20:07 based on what Lex and Erica were doing
1:20:09 you don't generally need to turn up my
1:20:10 games so I might turn your game a bit
1:20:12 back down but the thought is if I do
1:20:15 that then when because you're the one
1:20:17 with the most ranged yeah
1:20:20 um if I having turned up your game a
1:20:21 little it's really good
1:20:24 um
1:20:29 Johnny will call Shaw okay
1:20:37 for that let me take that again clear
1:20:40 clear uh clear won't take it again
1:20:43 oh and before we start Rob I assume
1:20:46 you're probably gonna be in Rob voice
1:20:47 for any of this recording so presumably
1:20:50 all right so I'm gonna turn you down let
1:20:52 me know if you're gonna go back to now
1:20:55 turn on for What
1:20:58 Turn Down for What
1:21:03 no don't turn down for him he's not
1:21:05 worth it
1:21:06 turned down for me when
1:21:10 suck dick
1:21:11 I mean it's Reiss we can turn on a
1:21:13 little we can turn down a little bit I
1:21:14 have literal [ __ ] mind control when
1:21:16 turned down for me he's not that bad we
1:21:19 can turn down a little bit for him you
1:21:21 can turn down a little bit for me
1:21:23 a little bit softer now listen to your
1:21:25 friend a little bit softer now
1:21:30 a little bit more of that blood yes like
1:21:33 maybe all of it
1:21:35 now you greedy little boy
1:21:38 all right now that just got weird oh now
1:21:41 you want to turn down
1:21:43 now I would like to revisit the previous
1:21:45 offer of turning down who's racist this
1:21:47 is what I want to turn down for vampire
1:21:49 wizard Daddy can I get some more blood
1:21:51 please
1:21:56 I ain't got that kind of money
1:22:00 I got resources one man
1:22:03 I spent most of it already you're
1:22:05 getting paid
1:22:08 foreign
1:22:22 [Laughter]
1:22:25 put it on my vampire Card wait you guys
1:22:28 spend your own money
1:22:37 someone needs to run to the prince and
1:22:38 be like yo Reiss was just talking about
1:22:41 how much the prince of Boston
1:22:43 disrespected your ass
1:22:44 in open court
1:22:47 an open court nonetheless he broke the
1:22:49 rules
1:22:50 declare a bloodhunter prince it's the
1:22:52 only way to solve this
1:22:54 I suppose you can in your domain no I
1:22:57 think it means
1:23:00 so yes on another prince in a sense yeah
1:23:04 she's really not getting nautical stars
1:23:07 we didn't say that don't infer that come
1:23:10 on man you get them first and we'll all
1:23:12 follow up after it started gonna get the
1:23:15 tough guy hardcore hat and then you

1:23:20 whatever Adidas
1:23:22 chalk scary [ __ ] out of my table
1:23:26 you [ __ ] animal it's so real in here
1:23:29 right Adidas with hot pink laces oh
1:23:31 that's pretty cool it's pretty good yeah
1:23:35 immediately caves
1:23:38 I mean can we both agree can we both
1:23:41 agree that we're at least wearing
1:23:42 American Eagle girls pants yeah oh yeah
1:23:44 okay thank you they don't make voice
1:23:45 pants like that
1:23:46 this is before skinny jeans existed yeah
1:23:49 you have to go [ __ ] American Eagle
1:23:51 and get a pair of girls jeans
1:23:53 and suffer through having tiny pockets
1:23:57 so bad for you
1:24:00 yep definite suffering
1:24:03 I didn't do any of that
1:24:05 we know right
1:24:08 oh that was so Savage
1:24:13 only because of Rob's reaction
1:24:17 it hurts because it's true can we just
1:24:21 record or something now like I think we
1:24:23 are I think this is our recording
1:24:26 don't like someone bouncing listen to
1:24:27 some Atreyu oh that's amazing these are
1:24:30 all the best places you think they're
1:24:31 still making albums
1:24:34 oh that's a good question I kind of hope
1:24:36 not all right
1:24:38 there's a couple bands you live in that
1:24:40 area you die in that era oh who was it
1:24:42 it was [ __ ] hate you know with an
1:24:44 album last year oh my God what
1:24:47 [ __ ] somebody else did too that band
1:24:49 stuck together what the [ __ ] oh right
1:24:51 Counting Crows had a new album no that
1:24:54 was being advertised at the [ __ ]
1:24:55 movie theater no yeah for some reason I
1:24:58 did not think you were gonna say movie
1:25:00 theater I thought you were going to say
1:25:01 fair like like at a state fair or like
1:25:04 Counting Crows it's like the butter God
1:25:06 or something like that is the name of it
1:25:10 talking about old fans
1:25:14 I don't know
1:25:18 um anthropomorphic person with a slab of
1:25:21 butter on their heads okay because I was
1:25:23 just picturing like so butter God in a
1:25:25 weird way maybe I've spent too much time
1:25:26 thinking about Middle America uh made
1:25:29 sense to me because I just thought like
1:25:30 oh the Iowa State Fair or whatever and
1:25:31 they have like those big [ __ ] butter
1:25:33 statues and you just do like you know an
1:25:35 effigy of a God or an idol made of
1:25:38 butter
1:25:48 but okay well that makes more sense just
1:25:51 in case I'm gonna record this because in
1:25:52 this maybe they'll show up in some weird
1:25:54 [ __ ] place to haunt us but Taking
1:25:56 Back Sunday came out with an album in
1:25:58 2019.
1:26:00 did it take back Sunday finally that's
1:26:02 right did they get it
1:26:05 blows my mind look man
1:26:08 there's a lot of Sundays that come and
1:26:10 go they do their thing every once in a
1:26:12 while they're able to take one of those
1:26:14 Sundays back this is their story
1:26:23 that was a [ __ ] walk should we record
1:26:24 now yep we should that's established we
1:26:27 already are
1:26:30 you got another day
1:26:32 I got you one more day one more day one
1:26:35 day
1:26:46 you've opened the musical theater so I
1:26:49 hope you're filled with regret
1:26:51 I have no idea
1:26:53 it's not that big a secret
1:26:57 I had a really bad idea about how to fix
1:27:00 the prince I'm sure you did I mean do
1:27:04 not punch the prince in the torpor don't
1:27:06 do that John no no no no no I was
1:27:08 thinking like a sippy cup from Johnny's
1:27:10 perspective
1:27:11 oh no I'm just saying that uh you know
1:27:16 horrid reality can make all kinds of
1:27:18 weird things go away and weird things
1:27:21 happen
1:27:23 but probably sneaking in my friend into
1:27:25 Elysium to use powers of the prince
1:27:27 probably a bad idea yeah but especially
1:27:30 Powers we don't necessarily even know or
1:27:32 understand yeah
1:27:33 it's definitely a bad idea but I don't
1:27:35 think that means it's the wrong idea no
1:27:37 I think it's the wrong idea anyway go
1:27:39 back to prison get damn it
1:27:42 um
1:27:43 boy you just gained some status off this
1:27:46 meeting didn't you
1:27:48 you look so upset I wish the audience
1:27:49 could see how upset Tim looks I've got
1:27:52 [ __ ] to do status doesn't help me with
1:27:53 that sometimes but sometimes it does
1:27:56 sometimes it does yeah
1:27:59 it's still also a weird thing to serve
1:28:01 in a mug
1:28:02 yeah I don't know why like the vehicle
1:28:04 for delivery makes such a difference but
1:28:06 it definitely does
1:28:08 like I remember you having the whole
1:28:11 thing where you just wanted to like
1:28:12 clean out an Old Mayo jar and put like
1:28:14 [ __ ] Kefir in it for a while and just
1:28:16 be like
1:28:17 what that was like a you [ __ ] special
1:28:20 yeah for like a couple of years why all
1:28:23 I wanted to I don't think you ever did
1:28:25 it but it was like when you were you
1:28:26 there was like a period of time where
1:28:28 you're way into yogurt yeah I'm still on
1:28:30 the yogurt all right well like wow but
1:28:31 like we're telling us actively about
1:28:33 yogurt all the time and uh oh the kefir
1:28:37 Goblin thing yeah like hop out of a
1:28:39 [ __ ] bush with in a bathrobe
1:28:43 or get it all in your [ __ ] beard like
1:28:45 yeah that's right I know you living his
1:28:47 best life look man we've been friends
1:28:48 for a while like cheddar Goblin with
1:28:50 yogurt
1:28:52 foreign
1:28:53 she's got a little bit of light coming
1:28:54 off from the screen of actually wait
1:28:57 dude I'm sorry dude they light up cell
1:28:59 phones yes okay
1:29:02 um she's got a I don't know like the old
1:29:06 Nokia not as bright yeah
1:29:08 but they do have bullets they're my soul
1:29:14 should have a Nokia come on
1:29:16 that thing's ugly they're all ugly flip
1:29:20 phones are cool
1:29:22 right wind would have had to find me I
1:29:26 would have probably died to sunlight
1:29:28 if I'd gone too far
1:29:33 so it was really funny because it's a
1:29:34 small forests
1:29:41 look that is a two-day roll for me yeah
1:29:44 and I have no glasses right now yeah
1:29:47 what do you roll uh that would probably
1:29:50 be with survival to get your way out so
1:29:53 I have three wits and no survival
1:29:55 so that's a minus one it's too Dice and
1:29:59 no I and my perception checks are down
1:30:00 you're a higher difficulty for trying to
1:30:02 get out my perception checks are in one
1:30:04 die
1:30:06 with the fact there's probably snow in
1:30:08 the garage
1:30:11 I would die I would die to sunlight
1:30:15 well miles needs to not be what doing
1:30:18 what he's doing it is simply the end
1:30:23 and I know myself
1:30:25 what happened to that political

1:36:33 comfortable with yes
1:36:35 I'm solidly more comfortable with two
1:36:39 I have more questions but
1:36:44 double teamed no no that's a different
1:36:48 thing from earlier in the night with
1:36:50 Kabir right
1:36:52 I hate this I hate this
1:36:55 also I like that double teamed in the
1:36:59 context there means that
1:37:01 God would just can we move on can we
1:37:05 move on we were trying Rob until you
1:37:07 brought us back
1:37:08 that is not fair it's not true

1:37:15 I guess I'm a [ __ ] today
1:37:18 all right end of time
1:37:21 I was gonna try and work Daddy into it
1:37:23 but I just decided again thank you for
1:37:25 not you're welcome we can work that into
1:37:27 it later hell yeah stop it foreign
1:37:37 because we're about to get hit with a
1:37:39 big old [ __ ] fist okay if you're
1:37:41 rolling dice you need to you're gonna
1:37:43 get double teamed with the big old
1:37:44 [ __ ] fist
1:37:46 stuff
1:37:51 picture and her listening to the mixtape
1:37:52 and starts with push it by salt and
1:37:55 pepper
1:37:56 I take back everything I said just
1:37:59 kidding I love salt and pepper push it
1:38:02 real good I mean who doesn't it's an
1:38:05 Anthem of their ages I find it very
1:38:07 funny that Elsa would use files as like
1:38:09 a modern music like hook up she's like
1:38:12 you can't tell any of the other Toreador
1:38:15 about this now please give to me that
1:38:18 new metal
1:38:20 but it says have you miles have you
1:38:23 heard there's this band it's called corn
1:38:25 but they spell it with a K so the
1:38:27 specific thing about the itself with uh
1:38:29 Elsa is the very fact that he became a
1:38:31 music producer because he wasn't very
1:38:32 good at music yeah
1:38:35 that's dope and that Marco is like poser
1:38:38 suck and Marco's quite literally was
1:38:41 better
1:38:41 yeah not today though [ __ ] hate
1:38:45 successes baby okay I mean that can be
1:38:46 interpreted multiple ways
1:38:49 not Marcos he's dead yeah that's the
1:38:52 that's the one oh you're right that
1:38:54 actually makes him better that's that
1:38:57 music ghost
1:38:58 hey when I thought we were here to talk
1:39:00 to Romeo why is that what what Marcos
1:39:04 oh hey bro come sit at the piano with us
1:39:07 have you met Johnny guys don't make this
1:39:10 bad
1:39:12 no Joey's looking for a piano teacher
1:39:13 you know he's got two
1:39:16 how come all ghosts play piano just the
1:39:19 good ones damn
1:39:22 yeah no Marcus doesn't have a ghost
1:39:27 I don't know why that is but I don't
1:39:29 know so I know if I want to know every
1:39:30 time your boy told you
1:39:33 it's people going to like no so if
1:39:35 you're specifically in the last episode
1:39:37 was like he's burning in hell like it
1:39:39 was right well Cal seems very made-up
1:39:41 place
1:39:43 you are literally inhabited by a demon
1:39:47 no I'm inhabited by something that says
1:39:50 it's a demon
1:39:53 he's not wrong
1:39:55 miles the wolves are at the door let's
1:39:58 yeah let's get focused
1:40:02 seriously
1:40:04 this is not happening am I to understand
1:40:06 that Roman Pendragon either has an
1:40:09 auspects Combi where he can tell
1:40:10 someone's uh measurements or he has
1:40:13 expression five with a some kind of
1:40:15 measurements spec actually he has an
1:40:19 army of pet monkeys
1:40:23 and pet toriador and Pat Brewer we can
1:40:26 show up there Boston yeah so are both of
1:40:29 my statements false or is that in
1:40:30 addition
1:40:33 she would like to use his key detective
1:40:35 skills
1:40:37 yeah
1:40:39 yeah no I knew the picture exactly in my
1:40:42 mind when I said I smuggle a widescreen
1:40:45 TV I assume but I just want to see the
1:40:47 picture and that makes you guys nerds
1:40:49 the picture really helps in the audio
1:40:51 medium that was for me I'm cutting all
1:40:54 of this it leans into the mic and then
1:40:57 he's gonna put it back in and then he's
1:40:58 gonna cut it again he's gonna cut it
1:40:59 then he's gonna put it in I love this
1:41:01 brood has been captured also a dress
1:41:02 also what the [ __ ] with the dress there
1:41:05 are important questions since we were
1:41:07 taking a small break to comment on this
1:41:08 scene so far I'm very disappointed that
1:41:10 at no point you did not bite your lower
1:41:13 lip yeah especially when your chin was
1:41:16 lifted By The Sword yep no I was
1:41:18 expecting full bisexual tension I've
1:41:22 give me a sec here's just
1:41:26 for a bunch of tropes but you literally
1:41:27 lifted her chin with a sword
1:41:34 zero to 100 that fast
1:41:38 interested interesting I'm pretty sure
1:41:40 Lex is always looking for opportunities
1:41:42 to lift someone's children he lifted my
1:41:44 chin with a sword and assigned to the
1:41:46 jealous housemaid to take care of me I
1:41:48 mean I was really hoping we're basically
1:41:50 engaged after after he lifts at your
1:41:52 trip with the sword and then he was like
1:41:54 you are my prisoner I was like I was
1:41:56 really hoping you were gonna be like if
1:41:57 she bites her lower lip
1:42:01 let's add a small grown

1:48:35 to get so much better what's your prince

1:49:20 was like yeah yeah this is a nine dollar

1:50:04 yeah uh until all the torridor kept uh
1:50:07 correcting my uh actually it was mostly
1:50:09 Premiere there's only like from your
1:50:11 friends would just come up and be like
1:50:12 chaos unacceptable
1:50:15 we don't do that here
1:50:16 what I was in a rush and they're like
1:50:18 how the shirts are close when they fix
1:50:22 this immediately
1:50:24 I'll go put on more black one on the two
1:50:27 Carver was my first [ __ ] uh world of
1:50:30 Darkness PC it uh it met at least my
1:50:34 first one more PC who wears black ever
1:50:36 and I've had like four two or five
1:50:38 enough yeah this is the first one who
1:50:39 actually wears [ __ ] black nice it's
1:50:41 been a long ass time 80 world I mean
1:50:43 Andy had a black T-shirt on but like and
1:50:45 like a brown jacket the black wasn't
1:50:47 black wasn't color uh Scott Reed's color
1:50:50 it's not uh it wasn't NYX color it's
1:50:54 definitely not friend's color yeah
1:50:56 um yeah Carver's the first one I'm like
1:50:58 I wear a black coat I felt like I'm like
1:51:01 the opposite
1:51:03 black for everyone most of my characters
1:51:06 I feel like that's the correct choice I
1:51:09 just didn't weirdly no if you actually
1:51:12 like look like go to a vampire event and
1:51:14 look around a lot of guys a lot of
1:51:16 Browns yeah like and it the things that
1:51:19 people are usually wearing that are
1:51:21 black are like oh he's in a black suit
1:51:24 yep what a statement yeah my uh if
1:51:28 you're wearing a black shirt with a
1:51:28 black tie underneath
1:51:32 for like a long ass time it was just all
1:51:35 black on black on black I am a Toreador
1:51:38 who dresses romantic goth and I am
1:51:40 notable yeah yeah that's super true huh
1:51:44 wait is this the same one covered in
1:51:45 teeth because that could also like this
1:51:47 200 player event hey you guys know the
1:51:49 the the gothatory or you know the one
1:51:51 the one God's story or yep so
1:51:55 hypothetically
1:51:57 immediately following practice like
1:51:59 miles is still wiping his mouth
1:52:01 Johnny goes that's not Praxis miles
1:52:07 I'm sorry whatever it taken as a
1:52:08 metaphor I'm sorry who taught you again
1:52:10 I love the idea for women like it was a
1:52:12 practice if you didn't deobularize him I
1:52:15 joined it she's like no we gotta do this
1:52:18 right guys
1:52:22 Castle borrow
1:52:24 caps yep
1:52:26 um sure okay I could probably have fun
1:52:28 with that
1:52:32 who has not been on screen in a long
1:52:34 time
1:52:36 no surprise me well I could probably
1:52:39 sometimes
1:52:41 [ __ ] yeah we need more Johnny like
1:52:44 reminding everyone about his biceps
1:52:48 it was one of my favorite I know we have
1:52:50 to go with me it was one of my favorite
1:52:52 little sides you're like God damn it
1:52:54 like I wish my [ __ ] spect applied but
1:52:56 not strong arms and we were all like
1:52:58 yeah man
1:53:00 you were like yeah [ __ ] strong arms
1:53:03 boy and you're like 16 success
1:53:06 [ __ ] gross it's so goofy though
1:53:09 because
1:53:10 if I wasn't carrying people you're less
1:53:14 effective I'm less effective but because
1:53:16 I I picked somebody up on my giant arm
1:53:19 that's like the secret truth of Brujah
1:53:21 though right right if you're just
1:53:22 fighting you're like okay wow he's got
1:53:24 some cool powers for fighting but if
1:53:25 he's being dramatic if the stakes are
1:53:28 high and his friends need him you
1:53:30 [ __ ] get presents for a reason
1:53:31 yeah
1:53:34 remember he can use he soon he will be
1:53:36 able to use presents to give potents
1:53:39 true
1:53:40 and like not even a small amount oh that
1:53:43 would be gross yeah
1:53:46 all right it's gonna be Neil breaking
1:53:48 legs
1:53:50 yeah you can think about that did you
1:53:55 know people just like Johnny told me
1:53:57 it's all in the wrist oh no no
1:54:02 that's not what he was talking about
1:54:04 that it's all in the wrist man wait wait
1:54:07 no sorry that was win's lesson
1:54:09 the wrist in the tongue yes
1:54:13 so what you told me how to fight
1:54:19 we talked him wrong on purpose
1:54:21 it's all the same to her
1:54:24 first one then the other like two
1:54:27 seasons from now like Neil why do you
1:54:29 have fortitude I've been spending a lot
1:54:31 of time with wind and she scares the
1:54:33 [ __ ] out of me
1:54:35 I am so comfortable with that I learned
1:54:38 draw from Johnny but I learned grappling
1:54:40 from when
1:54:43 she doesn't use safe words it's not good
1:54:47 I'm kidding when would 100 use
1:54:51 what does he know
1:54:53 literally nothing Reckoning just happens
1:54:56 it's weird there's [ __ ] demons
1:54:58 [ __ ] whatever oh man can they fix a
1:55:01 vampire I don't know we haven't even
1:55:03 touched changes yet I'm just a Brujah
1:55:06 okay it's probably all kinds of weird
1:55:08 they're probably they're probably
1:55:09 [ __ ] one of them's living inside
1:55:10 miles's head
1:55:13 maybe
1:55:14 UFOs who knows
1:55:23 and Aliens because every time people
1:55:26 like there's no aliens I actually used
1:55:27 to do that with my Toyota because
1:55:29 [ __ ] cat playing her Trimmier who had
1:55:31 like every [ __ ] lower five just
1:55:34 randomly explodes at my character where
1:55:36 I met her about all these like [ __ ]
1:55:38 things in the world of darkness and I
1:55:39 was like all right what about aliens and
1:55:42 it's just like aliens aren't a thing and
1:55:44 I'm like are you [ __ ] kidding
1:55:46 there's literally just be like hold on
1:55:49 so what is more likely here that this
1:55:51 this this this this this this and this
1:55:53 all exist and this one thing doesn't uh
1:55:56 yeah it was so good
1:55:58 the secrets of the world have been
1:55:59 revealed to me and now I know everything
1:56:01 what about things that aren't that
1:56:02 that's ridiculous
1:56:04 all right there certainly isn't another
1:56:07 layer to everything that I don't know
1:56:10 important yeah before we pause in that
1:56:13 scene where did we leave off in it uh
1:56:15 let me go I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna

1:59:18 the idea it's actually made Better
1:59:20 Together
1:59:21 is that the one thing wolf Panther
1:59:23 faster like doused my neck and crotch
1:59:26 and cologne and then spritzed himself

1:59:31 he was scent marking you honey
1:59:36 oh Rob just because Neil didn't get it
1:59:39 doesn't mean Rob didn't get it
1:59:43 wolf Panther is actually a brand
1:59:45 distributed by Clan ravnos doesn't
1:59:48 actually exist
1:59:51 hey why do I smoke
1:59:55 I swear I've smelled this before ah what

2:00:12 feel like you've smelled this on wind
2:00:13 before
2:00:13 [Laughter]
2:00:18 you be careful because it drives when
2:00:20 crazy
2:00:24 Neil comes back wins just like all of a
2:00:26 sudden just fanning herself
2:00:28 so horny like a madman's quill but for
2:00:31 like other senses art
2:00:35 I don't think wolf Panther can ever be
2:00:37 described as art it's just an expression
2:00:40 Creations
2:00:41 horde reality to create a cologne called
2:00:45 wolf Panther that drives Gangrel
2:00:47 sexually mad
2:00:51 time
2:00:54 yeah very sexy
2:00:56 no no
2:00:58 it's too sexy
2:01:00 on the bottle it says warning no no two
2:01:03 seconds
2:01:08 do not use unless you want her to use
2:01:10 clothes
2:01:15 winners the clouds
2:01:20 that's also in the bottle it's the claws
2:01:22 claws
2:01:25 what is win I am literally doused in
2:01:27 Wolf Panther and this Fades quickly

2:01:32 so I try to look up to see if it was an
2:01:33 actual scent
2:01:35 no it's not oh thank you but it turned
2:01:38 up Scorpios a lot for some reason
2:01:41 that makes sense
2:01:44 and I've been an astronomy person that
2:01:46 makes sense astrology
2:01:49 I don't know much about the stars but
2:01:51 that [ __ ] makes sense I said I like

2:02:44 because girls just randomly cosplaying
2:02:47 The Ventrue who can control his body
2:02:49 yeah I was gonna say in this case in
2:02:51 this case it's not actually a disguise
2:02:53 in this case it's a costume yeah so

2:07:31 it's so much worse
2:07:36 he was Chima man
2:07:40 I I hope you're good with the Tim I feel
2:07:42 like this is like the most gangster
2:07:44 moment miles has had yet
2:07:47 literally standing over The Ventrue he
2:07:50 has beaten as he rises to power and then
2:07:53 the Devil comes to get his to do they uh
2:07:56 what's what's fun is like you've been
2:07:58 [ __ ] obviously you've been T like
2:08:00 that solves the like hey weird blood
2:08:01 stuff like mile [ __ ] from the last I
2:08:05 don't know
2:08:06 six months wow inside recording it yeah
2:08:10 yeah yeah
2:08:13 you're right
2:08:15 your eyes are still alive
2:08:20 [Music]
2:08:23 this is why I was I wanted it to be the
2:08:25 season finale because it's like
2:08:28 boom here we are the choice
2:08:32 many people are gonna [ __ ] freak I
2:08:34 hope I think by the reaction Okay so
2:08:39 like man you know who I'm looking
2:08:41 forward to the [ __ ] one fan who put
2:08:44 out a theory on Twitter like six months
2:08:47 ago that was like yo what if the demon
2:08:50 is like taking votes when miles isn't
2:08:51 like awake and it's like this dude's
2:08:54 walking around and like let's just tag
2:08:56 them when we put the episode out I gotta
2:08:57 figure out who it was again I gotta go
2:08:59 back through our mentions and
2:09:01 okay okay I'm so sorry I had such
2:09:04 feelings I could not keep no no no no I
2:09:07 this makes me feel so good it does the
2:09:11 only reason that I didn't have that same
2:09:13 moment is that [ __ ] rob brought up
2:09:15 the possibility of that happening and I
2:09:16 went oh my god
2:09:18 when you brought that possible we were
2:09:21 talking about that a lot we well you and
2:09:23 I off like often know I'm like random
2:09:24 like I wonder if this is gonna happen yo
2:09:26 I I feel like you always generally
2:09:28 surprised me with with things during the
2:09:30 course of gameplay yeah for sure um
2:09:32 but I'm usually like oh [ __ ] yeah
2:09:35 this one I was like oh damn I didn't see
2:09:38 that coming at all I'm [ __ ] dead
2:09:41 here's the deal the the the the idea
2:09:44 because we like to talk about the idea
2:09:46 that like yeah the Demon's like taking
2:09:47 stuff like this is Twitter or let me
2:09:48 talk about it like that it was in my
2:09:50 head the idea that the demon would call
2:09:52 at the moment of the call on the phone
2:09:53 at the moment practice
2:09:55 I'm holding your body hostage like you
2:09:58 can sweep me off the front steps so good
2:10:02 yeah that was definitely fifth on the
2:10:04 things that I thought was a possibility
2:10:07 I heard I recall you mentioning once
2:10:09 being like [ __ ] I hope the Demon's not
2:10:11 just hunting for me
2:10:13 I mean
2:10:15 definitely making my life easier
2:10:18 miles takes the miles takes I was like
2:10:21 yeah fine you know you release from all
2:10:22 contracts and leave my body safe there's
2:10:25 one last thing
2:10:27 I'm kind of gonna miss you a little bit
2:10:28 yo for real though like the fact that
2:10:30 you the fact that you set that up is
2:10:32 what makes it so good yeah because
2:10:34 you've been seeing the fact that you
2:10:36 lose yeah no no like it it makes you
2:10:38 feel dumb a little bit for not having
2:10:40 seen it which is so good honestly
2:10:42 seating this is the payoff that started
2:10:44 getting seeded in the [ __ ] Chantry
2:10:46 outside of Boston yeah like
2:10:50 I think that's a pretty successful
2:10:52 practice everyone
2:10:52 [Laughter]
2:10:58 this seems good and we can stop with him
2:11:02 that is exactly how I picture that going
2:11:06 down
2:11:07 can I just note though that uh wind just
2:11:10 lost some of her blood pool to Kabir and
2:11:11 still this is the first on-screen kiss
2:11:13 oh my God you're right
2:11:16 as it should be I'm not mad at it but I
2:11:19 just want it said somebody gotta say it
2:11:22 your concern has been noted we'll bring
2:11:24 it over to the next meeting
2:11:27 oh Jesus did win lose some of her blood
2:11:29 pool to Kabir depends what did you do
2:11:33 probably more than one maybe
2:11:37 it costs off another one just to be sure
2:11:38 to be sure I mean unless you guys are
2:11:39 like swapping blood that's a thing
2:11:42 things get really weird and vampiry at
2:11:45 that point definitely slapping spit but
2:11:48 I don't like it when you say
2:11:54 can I just say that I am
2:11:56 exceptionally like baffled by the fact
2:11:59 that you guys spend willpower to look at
2:12:01 stuff
2:12:03 I have one skill here I'm just saying
2:12:05 like as a brew hot I'm like what are you
2:12:07 doing those are punch dots
2:12:11 you look at his colors you're looking at
2:12:15 boats
2:12:16 willpower
2:12:19 so uh
2:12:22 okay pause for a second
2:12:25 keep that pause because the plank came
2:12:27 through on audio uh
2:12:30 [ __ ] [ __ ] have a drinking game
2:12:32 going pause please
2:12:34 for Rob's sake later please for a second
2:12:36 yeah please
2:12:39 laughs
2:12:41 I need to know the rules of the drinking
2:12:43 game at some point but also
2:12:46 if you are doing the drinking game
2:12:48 please be very careful when you are
2:12:50 picking up your Beverages and do not sip
2:12:52 them in front of the mics I'm saying I
2:12:55 thought that was cool as hell
2:12:57 [ __ ] that was a blast

2:15:15 you've seen the hair you you recognize
2:15:17 some of them
2:15:19 so both of us know that's him
2:15:23 so it doesn't feel like an elder power
2:15:25 right
2:15:27 [Music]
2:15:28 and to be clear they came in through the
2:15:31 door came in through the door and did
2:15:33 not use an elder power to do it okay
2:15:35 okay
2:15:38 uh that's on you

2:16:35 more decks you're carrying two long
2:16:37 swords just [ __ ] Johnny it open
2:16:39 Johnny is a bit better at johnnying it
2:16:41 opens
2:16:42 ironic yeah and then throw the sword
2:16:45 over your shoulder
2:16:48 make sure the sword is ceramic though so
2:16:50 it shatters
2:16:53 it's a kind of sword that Miles uses
2:16:55 it's like a like a a Chinese Samurai
2:16:58 saber or something
2:17:00 that hurts man oh I hate that soul level
2:17:03 um
2:17:04 you know all those those Chinese Samurai
2:17:06 guys really good at martial arts like
2:17:08 Bruce Lee he probably had all kinds of
2:17:10 Sabers they're really good after just a
2:17:12 Kata or two
2:17:14 I can't even begin to start describing
2:17:17 where that's wrong
2:17:19 he's just they just gotta Focus their
2:17:21 Chi you know about chi I read books
2:17:24 unlike some people I prefer coffee
2:17:27 that's shy
2:17:29 huh yeah I mean to be fair try is the
2:17:32 word for tea someone else reads books
2:17:35 because you're not
2:17:38 so what you're saying is I'm that I'm
2:17:40 right I am I'm supporting you all right
2:17:43 good to know
2:17:46 and let that be a lesson jail Johnny
2:17:47 Saxon is a student of History
2:17:51 I'm disowning all of you
2:17:54 you always say that
2:17:56 I've already written you out of the will
2:17:58 I was in the will yes wow leaderboard
2:18:04 maybe I could have gotten like a bathtub
2:18:05 or something yes I believe you my highly
2:18:09 prized bathtub sweet for you use
2:18:11 improperly yeah I'll definitely like
2:18:14 store my books in yeah
2:18:19 real bad by the way I think your Samurai
2:18:22 sword's broken it's all curved no Sabers
2:18:25 are naturally covered yeah but that's
2:18:27 not a state I mean like a saber is like
2:18:28 you know it was like a Cavalry sword
2:18:30 that's the best thing I've seen the
2:18:32 Ninja Turtles and nothing's supposed to
2:18:33 be straight nope that's a ninja toe what
2:18:35 a Ninja Turtle window no they have two
2:18:39 toes no and that's on their feet and
2:18:41 yeah that's just because they're Mutant
2:18:42 Turtles the closest I got no no it is a
2:18:45 straight flighted
2:18:50 swords I can't I can't like
2:18:54 you know how the vikas became famous for
2:18:55 the Sabbat
2:18:56 doesn't they whip off their dick and
2:18:58 throw it at people
2:18:59 oh kind of yeah okay it's actually not
2:19:01 far off
2:19:02 um so original is Mica vehicles
2:19:05 and the camera was created during this
2:19:08 thing called the convention of thorns
2:19:10 immediately after the convention of
2:19:12 thorns the anarchs that refused to
2:19:14 submit to the will of their Elders
2:19:16 declared themselves one Sabbath a pack
2:19:20 was what an anarch gang was called on
2:19:22 the Dark Ages so they were like no we
2:19:24 are one gang and they then burn Thorns
2:19:28 to the [ __ ] ground and in this huge
2:19:30 bonfire a [ __ ]
2:19:33 mikovico's ripped his junk off
2:19:36 and threw it into the fire basically
2:19:39 being like I will conform to no form of
2:19:41 identity all right I am free in ways
2:19:44 that like the human imagination hasn't
2:19:46 thought of yet
2:19:48 and like just just lost its goddamn mind
2:19:51 it down to like a metamorphosis and all
2:19:53 which it's about like that is
2:19:55 so cool and then like Vykos is like who
2:19:58 will be the first to die for the Sabbat
2:20:00 this small candy tribute just it was
2:20:02 like me and just threw themselves into
2:20:03 fire and [ __ ] died
2:20:05 the Supreme president did not have yet
2:20:07 have the vocabulary to say that's so
2:20:09 [ __ ] metal That's So Raven
2:20:13 no they meant it yeah but like ficos
2:20:19 became like the image of non-conformity
2:20:22 and is like a [ __ ] superstar in the
2:20:25 eyes of the Savannah trans icon yes
2:20:28 they're the first anarch loyalists yeah
2:20:31 before the loyalists were like hey maybe
2:20:33 let's you know
2:20:34 take it back at stuff this is a little
2:20:37 crazy guys
2:20:39 yeah you're here I need you here
