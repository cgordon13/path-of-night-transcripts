0:01:05 visits when in Breda and explains that
0:01:07 weathers has rescued Jane though the two
0:01:10 Kindred protests Ramirez informs them
0:01:12 that his group will be facing down Hell
0:01:14 House
0:01:15 the three share Intel and come to a new
0:01:18 understanding lucari then gathers and
0:01:21 finalizes their plan
0:01:23 kneel Nguyen and Britta bribe the local
0:01:26 wildlife and locate The sabbat's Haven
0:01:29 stick to their plan despite the spot's
0:01:31 horrific hunting
0:01:33 and as the humanities of both win and
0:01:35 Neil slip the Abbott Cynthia appears
0:01:39 when in one Fell Swoop takes the abbots
0:01:42 on life
0:01:44 [Music]
0:01:46 the wind who's on her way out after
0:01:48 successfully annihilating the Abbott and
0:01:52 Neil was an extra projection and brother
0:01:53 had initiated summons on Johnny Miles
0:01:57 was going to be heading with Johnny
0:01:59 beginning of the round I think we're
0:02:00 gonna go straight to the top of the
0:02:03 rounds my initiative would then change
0:02:05 to 18 as I will be spending a Celerity
0:02:07 this round understood
0:02:09 Johnny I rolled a one so I'm an 11. 11
0:02:12 miles 15. top of the round goes to
0:02:15 Britta operator what are you doing I am
0:02:17 initiating my plan to pick up Neil
0:02:20 regardless of whether he chooses to
0:02:22 return to his body I'd need him to not
0:02:23 be prone and my plan is to start trying
0:02:27 to hide with him but I don't know how
0:02:30 much of this I can accomplish in this
0:02:32 round okay so you're like running in the
0:02:33 cover I am picking him up and trying to
0:02:35 run him into cover okay next on the
0:02:39 initiative is going to be a three
0:02:41 character swallow of the same initiative
0:02:43 it is Neil or a miles so Neil why don't
0:02:47 you go so I'm in astral projection
0:02:49 basically following Jorge who is
0:02:52 following win yes Neil will spend a
0:02:55 willpower to manifest basically as he's
0:02:58 running like inside of an alley and just
0:03:01 look at him and so like the weird astral
0:03:05 projection form of Neil this doesn't
0:03:07 faster projection form does not look
0:03:08 like you right it looks like not
0:03:10 necessarily no yeah what does it look
0:03:12 like isn't that the one that represents
0:03:13 something true about yourself uh it was
0:03:15 how you view yourself sometimes it's
0:03:17 like a silhouette it really depends on
0:03:19 you got it so what does Neil look like
0:03:20 Neil manifest real quick basically like
0:03:23 right in front of the guy as he's
0:03:24 running and he looks like a blonde
0:03:29 French featured man dressed in like
0:03:33 1800s like not early 1900s spiritualist
0:03:36 clothing
0:03:38 absolutely dripping with blood and
0:03:40 manifests to look very much like a
0:03:45 idealized and yet perverse image of his
0:03:49 own sire
0:03:50 and looks directly at Jorge and says I
0:03:54 really think that you should just turn
0:03:56 around and go home and we'll try and hit
0:03:59 him with the haunting okay uh You're
0:04:02 Gonna Roll a plus two difficulty the
0:04:04 difficulty for The Haunting is his
0:04:07 perception plus self-control or Instinct
0:04:10 seven uh then plus two so diff nine yep
0:04:14 okay just spending the willpower to
0:04:15 manifest count as your willpower centers
0:04:17 for the round it does okay
0:04:19 foreign
0:04:20 success okay he is haunted one success
0:04:23 only lasts for like for the night
0:04:26 [Laughter]
0:04:27 what can last like last time I hit
0:04:30 somebody with it it was like a month
0:04:32 a couple of months anyway so he just
0:04:34 says that and then at the end of the
0:04:37 round we'll just sort of disappear uh
0:04:40 but just this bloody distorted looking
0:04:43 man stands in front of him and tells him
0:04:46 he should probably leave and manifests
0:04:49 the powers of Madness Jorge wouldn't you
0:04:52 have taken his attention
0:04:54 will lash out violently with claws at
0:04:58 your uh image raking and ravaging and
0:05:01 doing everything he can to try to hurt
0:05:03 you Neil looks unimpressed before fading
0:05:08 away to nothing it's your courage rating
0:05:10 no he looks scared of [ __ ]
0:05:13 yeah my car is running into two uh Neil
0:05:15 actually died
0:05:19 he has magic claws oh no yeah uh the old
0:05:23 despite not being corporeal definitely
0:05:25 flinches yeah you're totally right it
0:05:27 definitely tries to do the intimidation
0:05:29 thing and then just flinches
0:05:32 maybe like you you kind of turned away
0:05:35 so like they don't see it as you fade
0:05:37 away but like no I don't think I'm bad
0:05:38 like courage is a two that Lex is
0:05:39 totally right you can make a courage
0:05:41 roll yeah roll roll to Flinch yes
0:05:46 don't botch this rule minus three human
0:05:50 do I have to do this
0:05:54 sounds like a yes
0:05:57 two successes I don't Flinch
0:06:00 you hold on with everything uh you hold
0:06:04 together and it doesn't hurt you and you
0:06:07 also don't run away I don't run away the
0:06:10 most vampire she ever heard roll dice to
0:06:12 look unimpressed uh
0:06:18 in my head Neil manages to hold it
0:06:21 together until the end of the round when
0:06:22 he Fades fully back into the astral
0:06:24 realm it's like oh my God I did it did I
0:06:26 Pete I didn't even pee that time way to
0:06:29 go buddy if you had it would have been
0:06:31 astral P
0:06:34 whose turn is next left add some miles
0:06:38 I'm with Johnny so whatever the [ __ ]
0:06:40 he's doing because actually at this
0:06:41 point he got something else holds to
0:06:43 roll with Johnny I think because you're
0:06:45 higher on the initiative track than
0:06:47 Johnny you do notice that he is parking
0:06:49 up to some unseen Force win what you got
0:06:53 she's not looking behind her she knows
0:06:55 people will likely be pursuing not
0:06:57 something if sure if she if this is
0:06:59 something she could or would notice
0:07:01 was he a city angle yes okay continuing
0:07:05 her her flight she kind of dips into the
0:07:08 trees to break the sight line but she
0:07:10 starts flying in the direction of 123
0:07:12 Ogden Street okay you will at this point
0:07:15 have escaped combat Johnny Johnny looks
0:07:18 over at miles it's go time he stands up
0:07:21 from where he's been sitting in the bar
0:07:24 where they have been waiting for the the
0:07:26 queue grabs Miles by the shoulder and
0:07:28 starts heading outside I'm not going to
0:07:30 use Celerity in a bar because that would
0:07:34 be a masquerade breach and I haven't
0:07:38 been summoned that hard yeah I mean you
0:07:40 know the masquerades are probably still
0:07:42 intact so there's really no reason to
0:07:44 worry about that stuff
0:07:45 foreign
0:07:48 they're all pretty level-headed people
0:07:51 but his intent is to basically go
0:07:52 outside somewhere like into like the
0:07:54 alley where then he can speed away
0:07:56 towards Britta Miles are you heading out
0:07:58 with him yes okay so the two of you
0:08:00 start making a way outside get around to
0:08:02 a little alley space or there's some
0:08:04 people smoking cigarettes some some
0:08:06 cloves and a celebrity action celebrity
0:08:10 actions what are you doing I used my
0:08:12 first Clarity action I don't know if
0:08:13 that was all of my salaries I've not
0:08:14 used any of your Celerity actions okay
0:08:16 I'm just going to try to continue to try
0:08:18 to sneak away with Neil to meet with
0:08:20 Johnny and with Miles give me a DEX plus
0:08:22 stealth uh your difficulty is seven
0:08:25 they're on the hunt
0:08:27 for successes okay you will actually
0:08:30 make it back more towards where Johnny
0:08:33 and miles are likely coming from at this
0:08:35 point you're out of combat I continue
0:08:36 with that same action okay with Neil
0:08:39 you'll make it to the other side of the
0:08:40 street and and we will hop over to Neil
0:08:44 what are you doing he's just continuing
0:08:46 to like freak out in the middle of the
0:08:47 street in frenzy now that I've
0:08:48 disappeared you yeah I mean he's not on
0:08:50 the street but like out on the lawn yeah
0:08:52 okay Neil is going to at the speed of
0:08:56 thought project himself after win
0:08:59 just to make sure she gets away safely
0:09:01 okay uh you will uh follow her and she
0:09:04 looks like she's perching and just kind
0:09:05 of waiting it out right now he doesn't
0:09:07 Manifest this round he just makes sure
0:09:09 she's okay as Fred is carrying Neil she
0:09:12 has his arms slung over her shoulder and
0:09:15 the tip of his ear is within the side of
0:09:18 her vision and kind of catches for a
0:09:21 second just it looking a little odd but
0:09:24 she's got an objective miles more
0:09:26 generally with a Brisk run walk thing to
0:09:29 them yeah you can actually now see uh
0:09:31 brother Neil across the street Neil
0:09:34 looks down let's move in it seems like
0:09:36 let's start moving towards her and
0:09:37 keeping an eye out for anybody that's
0:09:39 pursuing them Johnny what are you doing
0:09:40 Johnny sees the two of them and kneels
0:09:42 down yeah he will rush over to British
0:09:45 side and basically kind of scoop Neil up
0:09:48 off of her is he okay he'll kind of like
0:09:51 search over his uh over Neil's body to
0:09:53 make sure that there's to look for where
0:09:55 he assumes he's been injured and then
0:09:58 immediately switch to where's win he's
0:10:01 an astral she's in there wait so what
0:10:04 happened
0:10:05 um so
0:10:06 were you successful Britta looks down
0:10:10 and it takes her a minute to pull
0:10:12 herself together before she can kind of
0:10:15 look almost back up to Johnny but she's
0:10:18 more looking at his chin while she's
0:10:19 talking than actually making eye contact
0:10:21 and she says yeah we we got it done
0:10:25 Cynthia's gone Johnny nervously kind of
0:10:28 looks around for other members of the
0:10:30 pack having kind of now now having put
0:10:32 together the fact that that howl he
0:10:34 heard was the pack realizing that their
0:10:37 ABBA is dead so here's what happened no
0:10:40 we don't have time for that we gotta get
0:10:42 out of here right now they're gonna be
0:10:43 on the war path let's go take Neil let's
0:10:46 go to the vehicle wins still an owl
0:10:50 um she'll contact us when she's able to
0:10:51 okay Neil if Neil's an astral projection
0:10:54 he must be with her let's go miles look
0:10:56 harder they go to at this point uh it is
0:10:58 probably the Chevy Blazer we've been
0:11:00 using around the most indescript vehicle
0:11:03 that I own
0:11:05 the slightly raised uh Chevy Blazer and
0:11:08 uh that's the vehicle we head towards
0:11:10 has a nice place where we can just slide
0:11:12 Neil's body in so once we get there I
0:11:14 want I'm hoping we'll get filled in
0:11:15 looking for Johnny to get in the front
0:11:18 seat before she starts up yeah Johnny
0:11:19 Johnny will put Neil in the back uh jump
0:11:22 into the driver's side and then take a
0:11:25 pretty circuitous route out of here
0:11:27 trying to make sure we don't have any
0:11:28 Tails or anything you drive out you
0:11:30 can't help but keep looking over your
0:11:31 shoulder because some of these guys
0:11:33 can't actually be seen by anyone but
0:11:34 Neil
0:11:35 but after a little while without any
0:11:37 attacks you start to get a feeling that
0:11:40 things might be safe
0:11:44 [Music]
0:11:47 when that violence and panic screams and
0:11:52 Eerie sounds they hear out around the
0:11:54 campus quiet down and it feels like you
0:11:58 might even be alone Jorge is gone when
0:12:00 heads in the direction of Hell House she
0:12:04 doesn't make it all the way there that
0:12:05 is a horrible horrible place to be but
0:12:07 if she did have someone on her tail
0:12:09 that's probably where she'd want to lead
0:12:11 them and she kind of finds that that
0:12:15 penumbra of where the the spiritual
0:12:17 plane and the shadowlands start to
0:12:19 sicken around the house and she kind of
0:12:21 perches in the woods on the good side of
0:12:24 it and she just kind of sits as an owl
0:12:27 for a few minutes she kind of shakes her
0:12:29 head and kind of clear any viscera off
0:12:31 of her beak for curiosity are you
0:12:34 looking towards the house or the path to
0:12:37 the house
0:12:38 just kind of got her head on a swivel
0:12:39 she's an owl so she and she might be
0:12:41 being pursued so she's there's not
0:12:43 anywhere she's really not looking gotcha
0:12:45 she doesn't like looking in the
0:12:46 direction of the house but she does
0:12:49 glance it from time to time and she just
0:12:51 kind of sits
0:12:52 for a few minutes she sits long enough
0:12:55 to verify that she is not being pursued
0:12:58 by anything Gangrel ideally anything
0:13:02 but specifically anything Gangrel and
0:13:06 she kind of curls her feet up onto the
0:13:08 branch kind of adjusting in her owl body
0:13:11 as she begins to transform back and her
0:13:15 mind is it's a it's a beehive at this
0:13:18 point there's so much buzzing there are
0:13:21 so many thoughts so many what if so many
0:13:25 unanswered questions that the noise
0:13:28 itself is sort of just drowning out
0:13:31 itself it's it's white noise of itself
0:13:35 and as she transforms back she kind of
0:13:37 just lets her legs dangle over the edge
0:13:40 of the branch and sits for a minute
0:13:44 she knows that
0:13:46 she should feel something from seeing
0:13:49 Jorge's face as she killed someone he
0:13:52 cared about and she doesn't
0:13:55 while you sit alone watching the house
0:13:56 there is a very suddenly a flashlight
0:13:59 shining up on you from down below you
0:14:02 did not see this person there before
0:14:03 Neil neither did you
0:14:06 interesting and looking up at you with a
0:14:09 dumbfounded expression is Ramirez
0:14:12 uh
0:14:14 were you just a bird
0:14:16 yeah yeah I was
0:14:19 hey Ramirez
0:14:20 hey uh
0:14:22 are you okay qualified term I'm
0:14:25 physically intact
0:14:26 I was one of those really nervous type
0:14:29 kind of jokes
0:14:31 um
0:14:32 in a weird state right now I'm sorry
0:14:35 you look kind of sad that's a good thing
0:14:37 I think I I think it's good that I look
0:14:40 sad I should be sad
0:14:42 I should be upset
0:14:44 and if some part of me is feeling it
0:14:46 maybe maybe I'll feel it for real
0:14:48 sometime it kind of gives a little bit
0:14:49 of an apologetic look and moves the
0:14:52 flashlight from your eyes
0:14:54 I'm it's not because I was afraid or
0:14:56 anything I was just startled that's I
0:14:59 don't think you're I don't think you
0:15:00 would yeah hurt anyone but uh
0:15:05 you've got some blood on your feet and
0:15:09 you're really looking like it's been a
0:15:10 long night is All I'm gonna climb down
0:15:12 if that's all right yeah yeah I prefer
0:15:15 it she starts shuffling her way down the
0:15:18 tree yeah some good company
0:15:21 where are you scouting
0:15:23 yeah yeah I'm trying to figure out what
0:15:26 we can before we go do this thing what
0:15:27 do you see when you look at this place
0:15:29 right now the stuff of nightmare
0:15:31 veins pain is
0:15:35 there's something monstrous
0:15:37 and that's here
0:15:39 and it's twisted everything so much not
0:15:41 that it's like corrupted or made the
0:15:43 place bad it's worse than that
0:15:46 this place is part of the monster wind
0:15:49 doesn't really the edges of her mouth
0:15:51 kind of twitch up like she's not happy
0:15:54 but kind of relieved that he can see
0:15:57 it's as bad as she sees it you see that
0:15:59 too huh yeah I mean it's kind of why
0:16:02 we've got to do the thing we've got to
0:16:03 do
0:16:04 in the astral realm Neil is listening to
0:16:07 this whole conversation and he just has
0:16:10 a very confused frown on his face by the
0:16:13 way you're in the astral plane at the
0:16:15 house so everything went as described
0:16:17 before this is there the place is
0:16:20 twisted sick the house is there and
0:16:23 every now and again you see like
0:16:26 something opens the window from inside
0:16:28 something opens the door from inside the
0:16:32 house has eyes and the house slowly
0:16:34 reaches for the world around it and all
0:16:37 sorts of things that houses aren't
0:16:40 supposed to do in an odd way that the
0:16:43 review sit in the dark looking at it
0:16:46 together
0:16:46 Neil watches the movement of the house
0:16:49 in the realm of thoughts
0:16:52 but mostly his eyes are on Wynn and
0:16:57 Ramirez
0:16:58 watching from the outside in with a
0:17:02 curious frown like he looks a little bit
0:17:05 lost himself when you know shuffles her
0:17:09 feet on the ground not consciously
0:17:10 trying to wipe the blood off but
0:17:12 probably some part of her is
0:17:14 do you guys have a timeline
0:17:16 as far as I know and when it's time to
0:17:19 go we go
0:17:21 uh actually
0:17:24 um
0:17:25 this is really the first time I've seen
0:17:27 anything change about this house in a
0:17:29 while you being here that's neat and
0:17:31 interesting
0:17:32 I um I was being followed figured this
0:17:36 would be a good place to dispose of
0:17:37 someone
0:17:39 I'm glad you're safe
0:17:41 glad you are too
0:17:42 she says that with gladness that doesn't
0:17:45 quite reach her eyes
0:17:46 turns to walk away and then stops and
0:17:49 looks back is it gonna sound weird and I
0:17:51 don't mean to but I guess we're kind of
0:17:53 a couple weird people uh but
0:17:57 you know if you ever want uh
0:18:00 you know some clothes place to stay
0:18:03 um
0:18:04 I'd be happy to help
0:18:06 she tries to smile
0:18:08 I really appreciate that you want to do
0:18:10 that but I wouldn't do that to you it's
0:18:13 no problem for me
0:18:15 it would be
0:18:16 I just you know
0:18:18 I think people should help people
0:18:19 themselves
0:18:22 it kind of gives you a look
0:18:24 and others and you guys did you guys
0:18:27 were pretty kind to me one night so
0:18:29 think of it as paying it back
0:18:31 Ramirez just so you know things are
0:18:33 about to explode in this city things are
0:18:36 about to get very dangerous for a lot of
0:18:39 people
0:18:39 keep your people safe
0:18:41 you're not you're going to go into hell
0:18:43 house but good thing we've got such
0:18:45 dangerous friends
0:18:47 she does genuinely chocolate that he
0:18:49 kind of gives a wave and starts sending
0:18:51 off on his way when
0:18:54 stands there for a minute and kind of
0:18:55 crouches down holding her head in her
0:18:57 hands once he's out of sight
0:18:59 and just kind of tries to process
0:19:01 everything that she has felt and been
0:19:04 supposed to feel but didn't and what
0:19:06 that means she digs back to her her
0:19:09 psych textbooks that have been unopened
0:19:12 for a very long time and and finally her
0:19:15 her trail of thought it starts back
0:19:18 before she was embraced in the life she
0:19:21 had there and then she starts kind of
0:19:22 working Her Way Forward kind of mentally
0:19:24 grounding herself and where she is now
0:19:26 one life did she have before then
0:19:30 [Music]
0:19:35 dad was a Korean war vet when he came
0:19:38 back he um he opened a boxing gym
0:19:41 he uh there weren't a lot of women there
0:19:43 but he always wanted me there so I could
0:19:46 learn how to fight and
0:19:47 protect myself
0:19:49 and he and Mom
0:19:52 they were hippies before hippies were a
0:19:54 thing
0:19:54 they kind of let me do my own thing and
0:19:57 didn't really judge when I came back in
0:19:59 real late judged a little less when I
0:20:01 started throwing up in the morning
0:20:03 didn't judge when I wanted to be a bar
0:20:04 back at uh dad's bar for Woodstock
0:20:07 but they never got the chance to judge
0:20:09 because she didn't come home
0:20:11 just kind of a nameless victim of
0:20:13 Woodstock
0:20:15 and her mind kind of jumps there like
0:20:17 she doesn't want to remember the moment
0:20:19 that she wasn't human anymore
0:20:22 she kind of jumps to the moment of
0:20:24 sinking Claws and teeth into her sire
0:20:27 Rusty was not the first Gangrel she's
0:20:29 killed but the justification for this
0:20:31 one was a lot better
0:20:32 and that was kind of the moment she for
0:20:34 her was her baptism it wasn't the moment
0:20:36 she became a vampire it was the moment
0:20:39 she took another life for Revenge
0:20:41 it was sort of like she'd been carrying
0:20:44 a burden for a very long time and in
0:20:47 that moment she set it down
0:20:49 and then once it was down she didn't
0:20:51 know what to do so she just kind of
0:20:52 picked up the burden and kept walking
0:20:54 with it
0:20:55 and she kept walking
0:20:57 and she eventually found miles he was a
0:21:01 prissy little man he needed someone
0:21:03 dirty to tell him how to do dirty
0:21:05 someone who could tell him no or give
0:21:07 him the finger when he needed it then
0:21:09 gradually Neil and Johnny filtered in
0:21:13 and Joey
0:21:16 she remembers the first moment Joey
0:21:17 trusted her enough to slip his little
0:21:20 hand into hers even though they were
0:21:22 both just monsters in the dark
0:21:24 and she protected him like she couldn't
0:21:26 protect others and then she remembers
0:21:30 seeing Britta for the first time
0:21:32 something familiar but
0:21:34 not at the same time
0:21:36 her brain kind of fast forwards through
0:21:38 the past few months and stops on when
0:21:41 Kabir showed interest in her she'd she'd
0:21:44 been with other people since being
0:21:45 turned but it was not because they had
0:21:48 shown interest it was because they were
0:21:50 there
0:21:51 and she has a reptile brain and she took
0:21:54 advantage of the fact that other people
0:21:55 do too
0:21:56 but this was the first one who had
0:21:58 actually shown interest
0:22:00 and made it known
0:22:03 and kept showing interest and maybe some
0:22:06 part of her wasn't as far gone as just
0:22:08 being a reptile brain
0:22:11 and then she kind of remembers where she
0:22:13 is and she's kind of blinks and found
0:22:17 that she's started sinking part way into
0:22:19 the Earth just so desperate to ground
0:22:22 herself that she's literally grounding
0:22:24 herself
0:22:25 as win is thinking about the past and
0:22:30 Kabir and begins to fade into the Earth
0:22:34 Neil's voice cuts into her head and just
0:22:38 says
0:22:39 no one followed you
0:22:41 you're safe
0:22:43 come home
0:22:45 and that's kind of the final key that
0:22:47 she needed to kind of open her her
0:22:49 seagully eyes
0:22:51 and she takes a breath that she doesn't
0:22:54 need for oxygen but does need
0:22:56 and lets it takes in through her nose
0:22:59 out through her mouth and pulls out her
0:23:02 phone and clicks to dial miles
0:23:08 [Music]
0:23:12 after the attack against The Killing
0:23:15 Spree the three of you make it back with
0:23:17 Neil's body where are you headed so
0:23:19 Johnny goes for a long circuitous Drive
0:23:22 probably actually hops up onto the Merit
0:23:25 over onto 91 for a while just to kind of
0:23:28 really make sure that nothing can follow
0:23:30 him then they head back in and head
0:23:34 towards the cafe which is where we've
0:23:37 currently been standing correct yep he
0:23:39 parks off a safe distance from the cafe
0:23:42 hey birdie you want to check things out
0:23:44 in there real quick a small word with uh
0:23:46 miles Britta has been curled up uh in
0:23:49 the back of the car kind of avoiding
0:23:51 conversation even though she said she
0:23:53 would explain so once she's given that's
0:23:55 an excuse she pops out of the car nods
0:23:58 back to Johnny and mothers I'll be back
0:24:01 and we'll we'll be right there you see
0:24:04 anything weird you just uh you just get
0:24:06 the heck out but we'll be uh we'll be
0:24:08 right behind you all right I got it and
0:24:11 she heads on him once she's well out of
0:24:13 earshot will send a shawl
0:24:15 that went pretty well it did you've
0:24:18 talked to the two
0:24:20 Top members of the camarilla in New
0:24:22 Haven you have successfully conducted a
0:24:25 raid Against The Killing Spree when you
0:24:27 want to make a move for the crown
0:24:28 I need a couple more days I need to work
0:24:31 over one of
0:24:32 the prince's old ghouls
0:24:35 to be a more pliable vessel
0:24:38 I'll tell you this for though The
0:24:40 Killing Spree is going to want revenge
0:24:42 for what we just did
0:24:44 the second they get a chance to make a
0:24:46 retaliation the fact that we killed
0:24:49 their Abbott is going to look less like
0:24:50 a victory
0:24:52 you need to make this move faster than
0:24:54 you want
0:24:57 maybe a night or so I could probably do
0:24:59 it but
0:25:01 I hate to say this
0:25:04 but it uh it looks like it did a number
0:25:06 on our Coterie to conduct this execution
0:25:10 if you've got a brute force your way
0:25:13 through a ghoul to get to Rowlands do it
0:25:15 it's just it's a time thing I can do it
0:25:18 but it's not
0:25:19 I understand yeah it's not a worry about
0:25:22 his particular safety it's partially
0:25:25 detestable and I'm trying not to
0:25:27 completely destroy his own will
0:25:30 I realize what I'm asking there
0:25:33 but this is a precarious situation and I
0:25:36 think right now the court is as
0:25:40 appreciative as they're gonna be for you
0:25:43 to swoop in and take the reins I
0:25:46 wouldn't waste that good will it was
0:25:49 always the plan I did think this was
0:25:52 going to go down with more Bloodshed
0:25:54 though
0:25:55 Let's uh let's make sure she's not alone
0:25:57 for too long I don't think I don't think
0:25:58 the kid looks very good
0:26:00 Johnny uh hops out opens up the back
0:26:02 door and pulls out Neil kind of cradles
0:26:05 him in his arms and uh starts heading
0:26:07 over towards the uh the cafe leaving
0:26:09 miles in the car by himself by the time
0:26:12 you get Neil inside but uh it is nowhere
0:26:16 to be found
0:26:18 [Music]
0:26:24 oh
0:26:25 right up
0:26:27 what's up
0:26:29 your head inside yep letting the boys
0:26:32 talk their politics and politics it's
0:26:36 clearly not anything of relevance to you
0:26:39 oh got it got it uh and as you're you
0:26:43 know getting ready to maybe put weapons
0:26:45 away looking around I guess sold you
0:26:49 feel an urge to leave like you have
0:26:51 somewhere to be and it is an
0:26:53 overwhelming soul-crushing urge to leave
0:26:56 immediately and go somewhere Britta
0:26:58 doesn't bother putting anything away
0:27:00 cleaning up she just keeps going but it
0:27:03 slips out leaves out the back and you go
0:27:06 and you head right over to Downtown New
0:27:11 Haven in the Heart of the City and there
0:27:14 in front of the tall buildings and
0:27:17 Gothic architecture there is a very
0:27:21 classy limousine and you feel the urge
0:27:25 drawn to the limo
0:27:28 predecepts are purposeful she's
0:27:30 following in that irrepressible urge to
0:27:34 get to that limousine and before she
0:27:37 knows it her hands on the handle and she
0:27:39 slid into the back there's someone there
0:27:41 with you when you get there before I get
0:27:44 to the door uh when you when you open
0:27:46 the door and slide in got it uh you
0:27:48 immediately know there's someone in
0:27:49 there with you and when you look over
0:27:51 your shoulder uh you see him is very
0:27:56 well dressed his long black hair is
0:27:59 slicked back and he looks at you with
0:28:01 ice blue eyes
0:28:03 and you recognize Roman Pendragon
0:28:05 immediately
0:28:09 [Music]
0:28:13 we cut back to Miles and Johnny entering
0:28:16 the Haven and
0:28:19 her weapons have been put away nothing
0:28:22 has been organized she's just gone
0:28:23 Johnny calls Alpha Brito
0:28:26 when no response is had he kind of
0:28:28 nervously looks over to Miles and starts
0:28:31 kind of casing like running around the
0:28:33 place looking for someone
0:28:36 you hear something Break by the back
0:28:37 door I I go towards the matte black ax
0:28:40 he is drawn from its place of uh of
0:28:44 holding yeah you see two things when you
0:28:47 get to it the back door is a jar and the
0:28:50 window beside the door has cracked the
0:28:53 back door's jar and the window is
0:28:55 cracked the window next to it is cracked
0:28:57 a big like huge crack running from like
0:29:00 the top right corner to the bottom left
0:29:02 but there's no indication as to what
0:29:04 just caused that noise that what broke
0:29:06 the glass and caused you to hear it
0:29:07 Jenny gets a look over to Miles like you
0:29:10 got to play here I I start moving out
0:29:13 forward I was like keep my hand on Neil
0:29:15 and I go out and look outside with the
0:29:18 katano basically with the hand on like a
0:29:20 diamond but it's on still sheath you
0:29:22 keep your hand on your blade right and
0:29:24 you check out the door
0:29:25 enroll me an investigation oh we're
0:29:28 [ __ ]
0:29:30 you have your glasses on uh I do but um
0:29:33 investigation is a knowledge skill
0:29:36 um I have none okay so you may not roll
0:29:39 it right
0:29:40 Johnny do you have investigation Johnny
0:29:43 does an investigation okay give me a
0:29:45 roll I have perception
0:29:49 between the two of us we're almost a
0:29:51 smart character
0:29:54 almost two successes with two successes
0:29:57 uh you spot the heel of a boot smudged
0:30:02 into silt like a track left that's
0:30:06 definitely Brutus and it definitely
0:30:07 looks like she was walking at a Brisk
0:30:10 Pace Johnny will kind of step out into
0:30:13 the back behind the uh outside of the
0:30:16 door and kind of look around is there
0:30:19 any indication of what did it to the
0:30:20 window no
0:30:22 no sign at all what caused that to the
0:30:24 window come back inside I'm gonna give a
0:30:26 call and I'm gonna try to call her cell
0:30:31 [Music]
0:30:35 meanwhile in the limo Roman Pendragon
0:30:38 watches you
0:30:40 kind of in the same way that a lion
0:30:41 beholds meat Britta slowly finishes the
0:30:46 motion of sitting down I imagine she
0:30:48 kind of paused Midway through when she
0:30:51 looked over and connected eyes and
0:30:53 realized exactly what situation she was
0:30:55 in
0:30:56 so she'll slowly kind of sit properly
0:31:00 and look over and his demeanor sinks in
0:31:04 and after a few moments her first
0:31:08 reaction is to quietly just say
0:31:13 hey
0:31:15 you can hear the sound of a storm
0:31:17 rolling in
0:31:18 he smiles just slightly Britta yes
0:31:23 um yes
0:31:25 I'm
0:31:26 struggling to convince myself that I
0:31:29 shouldn't break you perhaps you might
0:31:32 meet with more success
0:31:34 and then your phone rings
0:31:36 Britta does not look away from Roman
0:31:38 Pendragon for a few seconds the phone
0:31:40 just
0:31:41 seems like a cosmic impossibility at
0:31:45 this moment and it takes that second or
0:31:47 two to realize like no that's real
0:31:49 that's that's a thing that's happening
0:31:51 she looks down to the phone she pulls it
0:31:53 out when you go to move
0:31:56 you get the Sensation that this might be
0:31:59 a dangerous thing to do
0:32:01 but he reaches for you like right across
0:32:04 you just past you and get your phone out
0:32:06 for you
0:32:07 and holds it out for you
0:32:10 he looks over his shoulder into the
0:32:13 driver
0:32:14 Drive
0:32:15 the car starts and the two of you begin
0:32:18 moving Britta looks to her cell phone
0:32:20 being in his hands and back up to his
0:32:23 eyes
0:32:25 and just
0:32:28 looks questioningly at him for a moment
0:32:30 she doesn't reach for the phone she
0:32:31 doesn't try to answer it
0:32:35 okay
0:32:36 she slowly reaches out
0:32:38 takes the phone gently
0:32:40 and flips it open
0:32:43 hello
0:32:45 hi
0:32:45 you took off
0:32:47 I'm watching his reactions to the entire
0:32:49 time like everything is a pause in case
0:32:53 there's any information that I seem to
0:32:55 get from his expression or demeanor
0:32:57 Roman sits back
0:32:59 crosses his legs
0:33:02 and watches intentionally putting up any
0:33:05 kind of front as he readable he looks
0:33:07 like he's waiting sure but not
0:33:09 discouraging hmm
0:33:11 I am
0:33:13 had somewhere else to be
0:33:16 on purpose
0:33:18 there's a couple conversations that I
0:33:21 need to have
0:33:22 do you have this
0:33:24 Britta accidentally makes a bit of a
0:33:28 how do you even describe that with the
0:33:31 face apprehension like like uh I don't
0:33:34 know kind of face
0:33:36 um I think you just described it
0:33:39 yeah sure uh
0:33:42 but with that sort of like tilt of the
0:33:44 chin uh towards the concept of that
0:33:46 question
0:33:48 all right better
0:33:50 is there anything we can do
0:33:53 you know what I wouldn't be surprised if
0:33:55 there was something you could do
0:33:57 but
0:33:58 still the time for it
0:34:01 I'll be okay
0:34:02 come back to us
0:34:04 oh well
0:34:06 um I'll get you back when I can
0:34:09 I'll hang up the phone and Britta slowly
0:34:12 flips her phone shut as well
0:34:14 so why should I exercise kindness why
0:34:18 would you want to break me
0:34:21 Boston
0:34:23 were you ever gonna let a Slave
0:34:25 that isn't what I asked you
0:34:29 yeah we left Boston
0:34:32 did I instruct you to stay in Boston
0:34:36 you're done
0:34:38 and were you taken from Boston against
0:34:41 your will
0:34:42 I could try to split hairs and say that
0:34:44 we had to for this domain but
0:34:47 you made that choice
0:34:49 and it wouldn't be precisely a selling
0:34:51 point to me no
0:34:53 so why should I forgive you
0:34:56 I think it's
0:34:58 got its upsides
0:35:00 um I'm listening
0:35:02 you wanted us in Boston because we're
0:35:04 useful to you
0:35:07 were so useful to you those who defy me
0:35:10 are not useful they are obstacles
0:35:15 and for you
0:35:16 there is a choice
0:35:19 be useful
0:35:21 or be an obstacle
0:35:22 and I understand your quotery as met
0:35:25 with remarkable success
0:35:28 but I tend to win my fights and have
0:35:31 roused to anger you will lose friends
0:35:34 so I should I give you a second chance
0:35:39 because you we're good friends to have
0:35:42 on your team hypothetically
0:35:44 he reaches out to this like very
0:35:47 beautiful bottle okay like so beautiful
0:35:51 it is very beautiful
0:35:54 and with a bit of uh Showmanship to his
0:35:58 body language he arranges a pair of
0:36:00 glasses
0:36:02 he pulls the cork from the bottle and
0:36:05 will slowly pour what does not smell
0:36:09 like wine into these glasses and despite
0:36:13 his clear interest in destroying you he
0:36:16 offers you a glass breda's eyes flick
0:36:19 from the glass to him as if trying to
0:36:21 figure something out she tilts her knees
0:36:24 inwards I assume they're kind of sitting
0:36:26 next to each other Yep they're side by
0:36:28 side adjusting her posture slowly to
0:36:31 more face him and she reaches out takes
0:36:35 the glass and she can't help but look
0:36:38 like she's trying to figure out what it
0:36:40 is there's that glance of like how the
0:36:42 light reflects on it how it feels to
0:36:45 hold the glass in her hand and she does
0:36:47 not take a sip possibly in the polite
0:36:49 way avoiding that he might pour himself
0:36:51 less to possibly he is pouring himself a
0:36:54 glass
0:36:55 um and she will continue to wait until
0:36:58 he seems to be done
0:37:01 so you say you're a good friend to have
0:37:04 I think I'm a lot better of a friend
0:37:05 when I'm not broken
0:37:07 we may have to find out but in the
0:37:10 meantime he raises his glass to yours
0:37:13 it's a friendship so weighing tail to
0:37:16 the Head
0:37:17 um before she kind of looks down almost
0:37:20 shyly clinks her glass with his are you
0:37:23 wearing body armor oh yeah I'm all
0:37:24 decked out and weird I'm wearing the
0:37:26 leather jacket Johnny gave me I am fully
0:37:29 ready for awfulness
0:37:31 he drinks I'll just wait a couple
0:37:34 seconds and then take this at myself you
0:37:36 look dressed for war he says with some
0:37:38 amusement and he reaches out and with
0:37:42 his thumb he sinks it underneath the
0:37:44 left strap of your body armor and with
0:37:47 like tug the Kevlar rips the armor
0:37:50 breaks and he just tears a cheer from
0:37:52 you well that's gonna have a strong
0:37:54 reaction so Britta is going to uh
0:37:57 there's a little tablecloth yeah uh the
0:37:59 wine is going to be placed hastily
0:38:01 backed down on the table and she is
0:38:03 going to scoot back from him confuse uh
0:38:05 expecting attack is her demeanor he does
0:38:08 not seem to notice your reaction and
0:38:11 just sort of continues continues with
0:38:13 what as he speaks as you are no doubt
0:38:16 aware I have an interest in New Haven
0:38:19 and as I understand it there are many
0:38:22 contenders coming to The Domain in the
0:38:24 very near future
0:38:26 last time we spoke
0:38:28 perhaps
0:38:30 perhaps I made a mistake and wasn't
0:38:33 sufficiently clear
0:38:34 but I would very much like to have a
0:38:37 positive relationship with your quotery
0:38:40 but it must be one where I am clearly
0:38:43 understood
0:38:44 and that my expectations are clearly
0:38:47 understood
0:38:49 and what I expect is loyalty
0:38:53 I expect honor when you speak
0:38:56 do not lie to me that you will remain
0:38:59 somewhere and then flee
0:39:01 I think that you could kill me right now
0:39:04 if you wanted to I think it'd be easy
0:39:08 I think that you already showed that you
0:39:10 are
0:39:11 willing to uphold your word you summoned
0:39:14 me here and
0:39:16 and
0:39:18 I'd like to trust you
0:39:21 if you want if you would be willing to
0:39:25 forgive us
0:39:27 um
0:39:28 that would go a long way to trusting you
0:39:32 I am not without Mercy he says Infamous
0:39:36 for being without Mercy
0:39:40 as brother is suggesting that she could
0:39:43 try to trust him
0:39:45 she sweeps the hair out of her face
0:39:48 that's gotten in the way from scooting
0:39:51 away from him tries to sort of pull her
0:39:54 posture back from protective but still
0:39:57 there a bit it's still there a bit that
0:39:59 she's facing him but so cautious
0:40:04 uh leaning forwards as she kind of gets
0:40:07 the last couple strands uh out of the
0:40:09 view of the conversation he seems to
0:40:11 lean into it and
0:40:14 again slowly he reaches and begins to
0:40:18 collect your weapons one at a time
0:40:21 confiscating them doing the work of
0:40:23 collecting them from you himself rather
0:40:26 than simply ordering you to turn them
0:40:28 over she lets him
0:40:30 tell me
0:40:32 what are you doing tonight
0:40:34 killing the Urban
0:40:37 of
0:40:39 the Sabbat pack in New Haven and she
0:40:42 looks down the humanity that had stuck
0:40:45 by her despite all of that so plaguing
0:40:48 her causing that guilt to come across
0:40:50 her face briefly just with the mention
0:40:51 of it
0:40:52 forget your guild child
0:40:55 this is what it means to be kindred
0:40:59 as a reminder is he path dead ah he is
0:41:02 so low in humanity it's actually hard to
0:41:04 tell ah okay uh path dead and ultra low
0:41:08 Humanity actually look the same yeah
0:41:10 okay
0:41:11 you have exerted power over your enemies
0:41:16 toppled them and because of this those
0:41:19 who you cherish can thrive
0:41:22 you will do this countless times
0:41:25 there's no sense in being miserable
0:41:27 about it she shifts a bit it's not clear
0:41:30 where the discomfort lies in those words
0:41:33 but it's nothing that she's willing to
0:41:35 bring up just uh watches him the end of
0:41:39 that sentence slowly nonce with horror
0:41:43 resignment doesn't want to be agreed to
0:41:46 it but she clearly sees the reason in it
0:41:49 call your friend and tell them you'll be
0:41:51 gone for a few nights
0:41:54 okay
0:41:55 Britta picks herself on backup and
0:41:58 redial Smiles miles miles here
0:42:01 cheeriness and miles's response throw a
0:42:04 spreader for a second before her brow
0:42:06 kind of furrows and she just manages
0:42:10 um it's it's a brother again situation
0:42:12 I'm gonna have to be gone for a few days
0:42:16 how are you driving is there any visual
0:42:19 tell that someone is using heightened
0:42:20 census as someone who uses it myself
0:42:22 there is not great there's a pause miles
0:42:26 before Britta answers
0:42:28 I think that I'm
0:42:30 gonna do my best right
0:42:32 I'm getting the sense that we should not
0:42:34 interfere
0:42:35 I'm not sure but
0:42:37 would it make it worse
0:42:41 Britta looks down at that
0:42:44 I think that you'll know about this when
0:42:47 and if it's your time with a kind of Nod
0:42:50 too it would all right I'm sorry I don't
0:42:54 apologize
0:42:55 take care of it
0:42:57 I'll do what I should
0:42:58 we'll see you soon
0:43:01 hi
0:43:06 [Music]
0:43:10 hang up the phone
0:43:12 take a deep breath and then your phone
0:43:14 rings again and I pick up the phone
0:43:16 again
0:43:17 miles here
0:43:19 that was chipper sorry I have it
0:43:22 um
0:43:23 I'm good I'm headed back where are you
0:43:25 guys
0:43:26 we're at British
0:43:29 do you know what's going on with Neil
0:43:32 his body is still
0:43:34 unoccupied I'll be very honest I was
0:43:37 looking at one thing most of the time
0:43:39 and I did not see what happened to Neil
0:43:41 but I heard him so I think he's okay
0:43:45 okay we thought he might be trailing you
0:43:49 he may have been I can't see him if he
0:43:52 is but I did hear him so I do think he's
0:43:54 okay
0:43:55 um we have a different situation okay do
0:43:59 you want to fill you in when you get
0:44:01 here because there's not much you can do
0:44:03 about it but
0:44:05 heads up
0:44:07 more or less
0:44:09 you guys yeah that's not really a great
0:44:12 note to leave a phone call on Miles
0:44:15 sorry there's
0:44:17 Britta has been requested to stay with
0:44:22 someone unfortunately I don't really
0:44:25 know who
0:44:27 I just know it's somebody of
0:44:29 a large amount of power
0:44:31 I have a couple guesses but
0:44:33 unfortunately I can't really tell when
0:44:35 other people are talking on over the
0:44:36 phones so
0:44:39 um she seems to have it handled for now
0:44:41 but she has
0:44:43 it's sort of been taken sort of taken as
0:44:47 sort of like a little pregnant yeah
0:44:51 she knows what she's doing does she I
0:44:54 talked to her
0:44:55 that the ability to speak doesn't make
0:44:58 you intelligent it doesn't make you know
0:45:00 things I know the answer yes I
0:45:02 understand being forced to say things
0:45:03 you know part of the whole thing with
0:45:06 ventru right no the answers that she
0:45:09 gave me makes me feel like she's going
0:45:12 to handle it to the best of her
0:45:14 abilities I get the sense Britta is like
0:45:17 four months old okay she's older than
0:45:19 that and been put through a lot of [ __ ]
0:45:21 in that time she has been through a lot
0:45:25 unfortunately I don't think we have much
0:45:28 of a choice here all right well I'm
0:45:29 coming back I you can yell at me when
0:45:31 you get here oh I plan on it I figured I
0:45:35 I don't I I'm angry it's not at you I
0:45:37 know
0:45:39 why do you put up with me
0:45:42 um
0:45:42 unexpected question all right look I'm
0:45:45 because of all the other code already
0:45:48 you've generally been the most okay with
0:45:52 your own life
0:45:54 and that is something that we share
0:46:00 I'm gonna come back and I'm gonna be mad
0:46:02 and I'm gonna be mad because I need to
0:46:05 hold on to being mad at something fair
0:46:07 enough it's not you but I'm gonna be mad
0:46:10 all right all right sounds good
0:46:13 no it doesn't it sounds like a hell of a
0:46:15 night let's I'll I'll see you there look
0:46:17 we've had a lot of hell of a nights and
0:46:18 they're not gonna stop quite yet no I
0:46:21 think we just kicked the Hornet's Nest
0:46:23 here we're not done yet all right I'll
0:46:26 be there
0:46:27 as the crow flies you can be a crow now
0:46:29 no it was just a poor attempt at humor
0:46:32 oh I've had a lot of birds around this
0:46:35 evening all right we'll see you when you
0:46:36 get here all right I Johnny and Neil
0:46:39 with you you look over and see that
0:46:41 Neil's still on the ground and Johnny is
0:46:43 pacing back and forth staring daggers at
0:46:46 you like almost like smoking down the
0:46:50 filter of a morally like vibrating at
0:46:53 the fact that he's just been listening
0:46:54 to this conversation and hasn't been
0:46:56 able to say anything because he respects
0:46:58 your your phone etiquette too much
0:47:04 uh half and half
0:47:06 okay
0:47:07 um I suspect
0:47:09 if he followed me and you'll probably
0:47:11 follow me back sounds good all right bye
0:47:13 click what the [ __ ] is going on I wait
0:47:18 for anymore
0:47:20 Britta has gone with someone is it Roland
0:47:24 no you're sure yes this person is more
0:47:28 powerful
0:47:28 [Applause]
0:47:30 you see his eyes kind of flicker back
0:47:32 and forth doing some mental math and he
0:47:34 has a sense of style
0:47:37 he allowed her to take the phone call it
0:47:40 said spoke volumes to very often
0:47:42 wouldn't do that yeah
0:47:44 that's that's we don't know he has a
0:47:47 sense of sign you just don't see him
0:47:48 [ __ ] off
0:47:49 she did oh she's pretty great for Miles
0:47:52 yeah not him this guy was really cool
0:47:55 I heard thunder and everything
0:47:59 he knew about presentations
0:48:02 do you think he was so tights no no
0:48:06 there wasn't enough rubbing it in
0:48:10 and dragon that's a good guess
0:48:14 I don't know why that happened literally
0:48:16 thundering
0:48:18 literally every time you say pen dragon
0:48:20 thunder Francis this is insane
0:48:24 I caught a sound of a voice I think it
0:48:27 was his but I'm not good at picking that
0:48:29 stuff up all right all right
0:48:34 if we're gonna make a move on Upton this
0:48:36 actually might work in our favor getting
0:48:37 her out of out of the picture for the
0:48:39 time being
0:48:40 I mean as long as there's wind on her
0:48:42 way she is she's safe sounds like it and
0:48:45 Neil is still unaccounted for I don't
0:48:48 know poke him right
0:48:50 uh nobody knows that what's going on
0:48:52 with Neil um hopefully he's just doing
0:48:54 Neil stuff but otherwise I don't know
0:48:57 he's trapped outside of his body we'll
0:48:59 give him another 20 minutes and it'll
0:49:01 bring him outside and toss him in the
0:49:02 water
0:49:05 means the gutter oh there's a
0:49:07 thunderstorm outside it's New Haven of
0:49:10 course we're close to water I mean not
0:49:12 not all that close like big chunks I'm
0:49:15 pretty sure he meets The Gutter I'm
0:49:16 pretty sure I can I can leap some bounds
0:49:18 into the water I think that's true he's
0:49:20 by the way he's still talking about the
0:49:22 gutter he does not still talking about
0:49:24 they're Gathering up all right
0:49:28 I guess this would be a good time to
0:49:30 discuss the plan with them shortly
0:49:33 thereafter
0:49:34 win arrives
0:49:36 moments before when enters Bridge Haven
0:49:39 Neil's body sits back up
0:49:42 and looks around nice back with us
0:49:44 you're about just about to take a swim
0:49:46 what why make sure it's him make sure
0:49:49 who's what him how are you gonna do that
0:49:51 the only one who could tell is me this
0:49:53 doesn't feel like him get your ex oh my
0:49:55 God no actually what's going on with you
0:49:58 you seem different I don't think so I
0:50:00 stuck to the plan Johnny gives you a
0:50:02 kind of a wary look I mean something
0:50:04 about your demeanors definitely seems
0:50:07 change Neil looks significantly less
0:50:10 Humane yeah
0:50:11 win should be here and he just slice
0:50:14 counts down on his fingers when he
0:50:16 reaches the end of the countdown when
0:50:18 kicks the door open no she doesn't kick
0:50:20 it she opens it like a regular person
0:50:21 Johnny who's retrieved a towel from the
0:50:25 back tosses one over to you the second
0:50:27 you walk in Wind catches it like they've
0:50:29 done this a hundred times begins telling
0:50:31 off her hair so what happened where's
0:50:34 Britta
0:50:35 I heard you talking to win
0:50:37 I'm under the assumption that somebody
0:50:40 powerful has requested her presence for
0:50:44 the coming nights and so we're gonna go
0:50:45 check in with her right
0:50:48 we did
0:50:49 I heard second hand from the
0:50:51 conversation but it sounds like she's
0:50:53 not in a position to be having anybody
0:50:57 else along which also means she's alone
0:50:59 with whoever this was it's not okay I
0:51:03 don't think anyone said that it was okay
0:51:04 it's safer than
0:51:06 opt-in at this point
0:51:08 is it is it yes I think the three the
0:51:11 three top candidates that could have
0:51:13 possibly taken are actually to be to be
0:51:16 honest it could have been anybody from
0:51:17 the court here could have been Upton
0:51:18 could have been Elsa could have been uh
0:51:20 Reiss why wouldn't it have been Reiss but
0:51:23 it also could have been set Heights okay
0:51:25 it also could have been Pendragon so
0:51:26 what I'm hearing any one of any one of
0:51:28 those don't rabbit hole we can't make a
0:51:31 move against them what I'm hearing is
0:51:34 that we need more information that
0:51:36 someone needs to find her and check in
0:51:39 when so no one else is in the room
0:51:41 listening that's what I'm hearing and we
0:51:45 were specifically warned against showing
0:51:47 up
0:51:47 showing up were we yes why who
0:51:52 ever she's with we would make her
0:51:55 situation worse I'm not comfortable
0:51:58 leaving her unchecked in with at the
0:52:01 very least
0:52:02 she called and talked to me when someone
0:52:06 else was in the room with her it's a
0:52:08 very different conversation okay like I
0:52:10 told win I know how that kind of stuff
0:52:12 works I'm not even talking about
0:52:14 domination yeah I'm also talking about
0:52:17 coercion I'm talking about the yes the
0:52:19 physical threat while you're there
0:52:21 exactly we don't have to do anything if
0:52:23 we're just looking right do you know
0:52:25 that he can't see you
0:52:27 no seems like a big risk if it's going
0:52:30 to get her into more danger would he be
0:52:31 able to tell it was me I don't know
0:52:34 I don't either but at least find out I
0:52:37 was just thinking I'd be a bird someone
0:52:39 kidnapped a member of our Coterie and she
0:52:43 said under duress that she was fine and
0:52:45 handling it I don't trust that actually
0:52:48 she didn't say she was fine but she said
0:52:50 she was handling it your discomfort is
0:52:51 noted
0:52:53 the point is any of the people we just
0:52:55 mentioned wouldn't just kidnap her and
0:52:57 not be in contact if they didn't want
0:52:59 something so either they're going to
0:53:01 release her after a few days or they're
0:53:02 going to be in touch with us and tell us
0:53:04 what they want or they're gonna hurt her
0:53:05 it's weirdly
0:53:08 he picked Britta
0:53:10 yeah he did right put some pieces
0:53:14 together miles
0:53:16 she's in danger
0:53:17 we're always in danger we've been in
0:53:19 danger she's in a different kind of
0:53:21 danger I actually think she's in a
0:53:22 stronger position than we are how so
0:53:24 because he's talking to her he wants her
0:53:28 attention he wants conversation that's
0:53:30 why she's in danger I think she's in a
0:53:33 better position than the rest of us yeah
0:53:34 you said that Elsa has been teaching her
0:53:37 for months
0:53:39 this is quite possibly one of the things
0:53:42 that is she is most ready for
0:53:44 but we don't know that we all do things
0:53:46 we don't know what about the other ones
0:53:48 I called in with her I checked in with
0:53:51 her
0:53:51 and I get it I'd rather not be here I'd
0:53:54 rather go out there and send Johnny out
0:53:57 to go figure out where the [ __ ] she had
0:53:59 gone
0:54:00 or used your abilities to figure out
0:54:02 where she'd gone than to sit here and
0:54:04 wait
0:54:06 but that could endanger her way more
0:54:09 so I mean you do have a point we have we
0:54:14 waited earlier today and that gave us an
0:54:16 opportunity
0:54:18 seems like it
0:54:20 and we need to try to trust her and
0:54:23 that's what I'm doing
0:54:25 she would have been able to signal in
0:54:26 one way or faster another if she was
0:54:28 truly desperately in need of our help
0:54:31 are you sure she didn't she's
0:54:35 she's young
0:54:37 that's what I worry about I get it but
0:54:40 she's also had a lot of unknown training
0:54:43 on top of it
0:54:44 I've got at this point in time I'm
0:54:48 inclined to not press on this so what
0:54:51 are we doing in the meantime if we're
0:54:54 not going to go and find her or at least
0:54:56 figure out where she is to send her a
0:54:57 message what are we gonna do finally a
0:55:00 question that actually matters he looks
0:55:03 over to uh to Miles wind is kind of
0:55:05 leaning against the bar flicking things
0:55:07 from out from under her nails and just
0:55:09 kind of staring off into space Neil just
0:55:11 keeps looking at Johnny
0:55:13 you want to tell them what we're about
0:55:14 now Johnny is taking the position that
0:55:16 he is because
0:55:18 heard His presence would have made this
0:55:20 next part much harder you're going after
0:55:22 Rowlands correct win looks up I've set
0:55:26 the stage
0:55:27 I've been working with his ghouls to
0:55:30 at least be more friendly with his
0:55:32 allies take over his assets
0:55:34 I've secured the general friendship and
0:55:37 or permission from various Elders in
0:55:40 this court
0:55:42 if you take Princeton from Rowlands and
0:55:45 let's say that you're right and it is
0:55:46 let's look at some worst case scenarios
0:55:48 and it is Pendragon or somebody like
0:55:51 that who has Britta wants to stop him
0:55:53 from holding her hostage until you bend
0:55:55 the knee because she's with him right
0:55:57 now and she could just die in an instant
0:55:59 I'm not saying moving against Rowlands is
0:56:02 the wrong thing but I've been talking
0:56:04 about repercussions on repercussions for
0:56:06 a while now and somebody who says they
0:56:08 want the prince them as you're about to
0:56:10 practice has someone that we in theory
0:56:13 care about as a hostage
0:56:16 we've never been safe from Pendragon
0:56:19 we haven't been safe from Pendragon as
0:56:21 soon as he noticed us but by doing this
0:56:24 and possibly for her to work an angle
0:56:27 for the rest of us we may be able some
0:56:30 working relationship
0:56:31 because in the end the Sabbat are coming
0:56:34 and we're not going to be able to fight
0:56:36 them on our own and the whole reason
0:56:38 we're doing all of this is to be able to
0:56:40 resist If he if you're worried about him
0:56:43 using her to Blackmail us and abetting
0:56:45 the knee he can do that at any any time
0:56:47 if miles is Prince he has the added
0:56:50 stress of worrying about whether or not
0:56:52 he's actually got the backing of the
0:56:53 court of New Haven because forcing some
0:56:55 some random Coterie to bend the knee is
0:56:58 one thing forcing the prince who has the
0:57:00 backing of the tremeer and the toridor
0:57:02 is a whole another and knowing us I
0:57:05 really don't think it is if miles has
0:57:07 already done all the pre-work to get
0:57:09 everyone behind him he doesn't have to
0:57:11 bend the whole Court he just has to bend
0:57:13 miles we're gonna be in a working
0:57:15 relationship with Pendragon so but it's
0:57:18 a hollow threat if he kills her and he's
0:57:20 Prince that's an a declaration of open
0:57:23 War if he has her and miles is simply
0:57:27 just a venture of the city he can kill
0:57:29 her and the prince might suggest that he
0:57:33 apologized to essential
0:57:35 we kill Upton
0:57:38 have her blood Bond broken I'm not
0:57:40 against killing Upton I just I'm
0:57:43 uncomfortable with the thought of
0:57:44 leaving Britta alone I don't like it
0:57:46 either I don't think anyone here does
0:57:48 I'm gonna be very honest I don't think
0:57:50 any of us are okay with the situation as
0:57:52 it sings it just feels like we're
0:57:54 sweeping past it and if that's what
0:57:56 we're gonna do that's what we're gonna
0:57:57 do fine I just I'm just accepting things
0:57:59 that I cannot change currently we don't
0:58:02 have to be able to change it to be able
0:58:04 to observe it to get a better lay of the
0:58:06 land if it looks like he's gonna kill
0:58:07 her anyway we at least know about it
0:58:08 ahead of time when
0:58:10 where's Romeo
0:58:13 I can find him I could call him here if
0:58:16 there's some way to do the observe pen
