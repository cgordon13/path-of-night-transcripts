0:00:23 now let's walk the path of night
0:00:26 last time on path of night the quarterly
0:00:29 readies itself and heads to quinton
0:00:31 king's court to meet with the mad prince
0:00:33 out of spite towards upton Rowlands the
0:00:35 prince of boston acknowledges Britta
0:00:37 into the camera
0:00:39 roland pendragon allied with quinton
0:00:41 king and present at his court asks the
0:00:43 quarter to bloodlessly take over new
0:00:45 haven and to join in his crusade against
0:00:47 the sabbath the quarter exchanges
0:00:49 information with local tremere and gains
0:00:51 contact with the local giovanna the
0:00:53 toroidal spy sent by the gemini league
0:00:55 informs the quartering that if they
0:00:56 leave boston pendragon will have them
0:00:58 killed and that the gemini league is
0:01:00 working to provide the group assistance
0:01:02 and a safe way out miles receives a
0:01:04 phone call from arabella Rowlands who
0:01:06 asks for a meeting
0:01:08 [Music]
0:01:10 uncertain of what the meeting is about
0:01:13 the quartery decides that they will
0:01:16 uh travel to meet her at quincy market
0:01:18 and the group of your head down
0:01:21 steps there are people everywhere as you
0:01:24 enter into
0:01:25 the access point for the t
0:01:27 unlike new york
0:01:29 down here is cleaner than above ground
0:01:32 in the streets of
0:01:34 new york
0:01:35 but it's almost every bit just as
0:01:37 crowded
0:01:38 and noisy and sweaty
0:01:41 and
0:01:42 people frequently bump shoulders as they
0:01:44 pass by
0:01:45 but eventually you make it to your stop
0:01:48 the the train pulls up and the doors
0:01:51 open a crowd gets off
0:01:54 and a crowd gets on all right johnny
0:01:57 finds a uh a good vantage point on the
0:02:01 little t car that we get on in one of
0:02:03 the uh one of the corners and
0:02:06 kind of mean mugs some of the the crowd
0:02:08 to
0:02:09 give space to the coterie so that we can
0:02:11 have our backs to a safe spot all right
0:02:14 guys we're taking a few transfers over
0:02:16 to state street and then it's gonna be a
0:02:17 little five minute walk to quincy
0:02:20 uh okay sure i do not like how many
0:02:22 people are on here
0:02:24 i mean it's uh something you know boston
0:02:26 transit turns turns off at like one
0:02:29 o'clock in the morning so
0:02:30 maybe on the way back it won't be you
0:02:33 know i don't know
0:02:34 not long-term problem
0:02:36 yeah this isn't a particularly great
0:02:38 form of transportation
0:02:40 it's efficient in the city it's better
0:02:41 than driving in boston just keep an eye
0:02:43 out for anybody acting weird that's
0:02:45 gonna be hard isn't it i mean there's so
0:02:47 many people passing back and forth well
0:02:50 i mean yeah i could keep a lookout you
0:02:52 just look if you want
0:02:53 lex kind of paranoid i'm gonna put up
0:02:56 like aspects and or perception and just
0:02:58 make sure that everybody on here is
0:02:59 human
0:03:01 the door
0:03:02 closes
0:03:03 for the car and you may roll
0:03:07 [ __ ]
0:03:10 seven successes
0:03:11 seven you say with seven successes on
0:03:14 the car you feel that the people that
0:03:15 are with you in the car
0:03:17 are probably just you know everyday folk
0:03:21 however
0:03:22 through the window to the car ahead
0:03:24 where the two kind of meet you see
0:03:28 an individual with
0:03:30 dark charcoal-like skin
0:03:33 and
0:03:34 cloth kind of pulled up over
0:03:37 his nose
0:03:39 it's like a portrait view but you see
0:03:41 him
0:03:42 by that door and are confident that you
0:03:45 are looking at a vampire as this aura of
0:03:49 kind of rippling black and veins
0:03:54 appears in his like pale kind of sickly
0:03:56 aura
0:03:57 he
0:03:58 apparently unbeknownst to everyone
0:04:00 around him
0:04:01 begins to open
0:04:03 the first car door kind of very
0:04:06 meticulously
0:04:08 making his way into the crowded car
0:04:10 urine
0:04:12 guys guys we're not um
0:04:15 there's a
0:04:16 uh some there's a yeah
0:04:18 neil was like stumbling over his words
0:04:20 because he's like clearly starting to
0:04:22 panic a little bit
0:04:23 um there's somebody coming into the the
0:04:26 car i don't know if you guys can see him
0:04:27 uh
0:04:28 definitely um he's he's an an and
0:04:30 asamite uh like a like a
0:04:32 he's a diablorist and he's coming in
0:04:35 he's coming from that car into this car
0:04:37 right now nobody else sees him
0:04:39 johnny reaches into his jacket just puts
0:04:41 a hand on his knife doesn't make a move
0:04:43 to draw it or anything just gets gets
0:04:45 ready uh point him out he's he's right
0:04:48 um he's right he's right there and like
0:04:51 neil sort of puts a hand
0:04:53 on his lap as he's sitting
0:04:55 pointing like trying to be subtle and
0:04:57 not like just
0:04:59 there's the guy but like show johnny
0:05:02 where
0:05:03 he sees this guy walking though you do
0:05:04 your best to guide him johnny finds
0:05:06 himself ignoring that space and not
0:05:09 quite being able to follow your
0:05:10 direction
0:05:11 and as this assassin draws closer he
0:05:14 reaches into a long coat that he's
0:05:16 wearing
0:05:17 and withdraws
0:05:19 a very
0:05:21 broad bladed knife a jambia um
0:05:25 guys um no i don't you can't see him uh
0:05:29 uh
0:05:30 neil will okay we gotta do something to
0:05:33 get out get off the car or something i
0:05:34 don't i don't know if we are looking at
0:05:36 him
0:05:36 neil is looking at him and is going to
0:05:38 like stand up and look directly at him
0:05:40 okay he at this point
0:05:42 licks the edge of the knife
0:05:44 and leaves this like black corrosive
0:05:48 film
0:05:49 along the edge
0:05:50 oh
0:05:52 guys i don't
0:05:54 johnny looks back at the rest of the
0:05:55 coterie to see if they if if they're
0:05:57 clocking this guy we can't see him i
0:05:59 don't see him neil and i'm getting the
0:06:00 impression that he'd be pretty
0:06:01 recognizable neil look it will since
0:06:04 nobody else is can see this guy neil's
0:06:07 going to stand up like in the middle of
0:06:09 the there's a crowd of people between
0:06:10 the two of you
0:06:12 and he kind of like steps towards a
0:06:15 group disappearing
0:06:17 and it you're finding it's very hard to
0:06:20 track and keep track of him um
0:06:23 are we in the back car or like where
0:06:25 what car are we in yeah you're in the
0:06:26 back so we could jump out of a moving
0:06:28 train or
0:06:30 okay does he look like the kind that
0:06:31 would care if people are around uh he's
0:06:34 avoiding them but he's also he he just
0:06:36 pulled a knife he
0:06:38 poisoned the knife he's he like he's
0:06:40 coming at us right now okay so we should
0:06:41 go
0:06:42 he's between us and and
0:06:44 i mean we could hit the emergency stop
0:06:46 and and go out the back but then we're
0:06:48 just in this subway i i don't know what
0:06:51 and there'll be still a bunch of people
0:06:52 around you with an emergency stop um but
0:06:55 if we get out of the train then the
0:06:56 masquerade remains intact possibly if we
0:07:00 if we put some space between us and the
0:07:01 crowd can he you can he cross that space
0:07:04 with obfuscate if there's the crowd
0:07:06 between us he's no no if we put some
0:07:07 space between us and the crowd i i i
0:07:10 don't understand the question yeah the
0:07:11 answer is right now what's that i'm kind
0:07:13 of panicking right now i don't
0:07:15 understand the question
0:07:16 if i back all these [ __ ] up by
0:07:18 ten feet yes will he be able to cross
0:07:20 that space yes
0:07:22 uh i'm going to look directly at where
0:07:24 this guy is yeah you need to i need you
0:07:26 to rule perception plus alertness to do
0:07:28 that you're at plus four difficulty plus
0:07:30 four difficulty yes okay so i am dif5
0:07:34 you're a dip five with plus four
0:07:35 difficulty i have all specs five baby
0:07:41 i don't know which of those numbers
0:07:42 distressed me more look at the big
0:07:44 peepers on neil
0:07:46 if only i could do something
0:07:50 six successes
0:07:52 you lose him his skin becomes like that
0:07:54 of a chameleon and he just blends into
0:07:56 the surroundings and is gone
0:08:01 [Music]
0:08:05 neil do you still have eyes on him no i
0:08:07 don't no he's he's in here somewhere
0:08:08 he's he just blended in i don't know
0:08:10 where he is i can't i can't clock him i
0:08:12 pull the emergency stop you head over to
0:08:14 the emergency stop which is usually
0:08:16 happening right uh yeah you reach up and
0:08:18 you yep pull the line someone's like
0:08:20 what the hell
0:08:22 hey pal yes calls out what the [ __ ]
0:08:25 door's open that's what the [ __ ]
0:08:27 everyone out are we just in the middle
0:08:28 of like a towel right now i guess it's
0:08:31 better than masquerade on the on a
0:08:32 [ __ ] car uh train car
0:08:35 not our city
0:08:36 robredo will follow out johnny make sure
0:08:39 everybody gets off first
0:08:41 and then we'll carry up the rear as we
0:08:44 get up onto the little like
0:08:45 tiny little like
0:08:47 sideway of the train there is not very
0:08:50 much room to move at all
0:08:52 and the group of you press up against it
0:08:54 the doors close
0:08:56 and the train car leaves
0:08:58 i mean i know he's it was in the dark
0:09:00 i'm still obviously gonna be like
0:09:01 keeping eyes out and looking for this
0:09:02 guy you guys are in pitch
0:09:04 black wind kind of squeezes her eyes
0:09:07 shut and when she opens them again they
0:09:09 are bright red and glowing heightened
0:09:11 senses doesn't help with a lack of light
0:09:13 right it it helps a little but not
0:09:16 full-on i can't see [ __ ] i will
0:09:18 put up heightened senses for a vision i
0:09:20 mean i've got this phone screen we can
0:09:22 use
0:09:24 uh usually there's like emergency lights
0:09:26 and things we just need to find a pool
0:09:27 of light yeah
0:09:28 when
0:09:29 kneel keep us moving in the right
0:09:31 direction see if you can't find us
0:09:32 someplace a door out of here or
0:09:34 something like that everyone else stay
0:09:37 within touch of each other who's behind
0:09:39 me me all right put your hand on my
0:09:41 shoulder what is our marching one are
0:09:42 you out front i'll be out front okay
0:09:45 when
0:09:45 as the group of you start to walk
0:09:48 your skin tightens
0:09:50 and you feel yourself
0:09:53 covered in goosebumps as chill washes
0:09:56 over you
0:09:57 and this tunnel
0:09:59 it's walls sealing everything is caked
0:10:03 in this thick
0:10:04 molasses
0:10:06 and like buried in the molasses
0:10:09 you can see like the shapes of people
0:10:12 that were swallowed by it
0:10:19 yeah why we stop moving
0:10:20 when are you all right yeah
0:10:22 what there's there's there's people in
0:10:25 it there's people in what people in the
0:10:27 in the goo in
0:10:29 it's all around us do any of the rest of
0:10:31 us see any or feel any goo
0:10:34 i mean yes this place is pretty gross no
0:10:36 wait i don't know what you're talking
0:10:37 about are you seeing something beyond
0:10:41 like in death stuff am i seeing
0:10:44 shadowland stuff yes okay
0:10:47 it's
0:10:48 yeah it's
0:10:50 it's bad it's probably something to do
0:10:53 with with the storm
0:10:55 it's it's taken so
0:10:57 so many people um they're all trapped in
0:11:01 it yeah i don't want to be down here any
0:11:02 more than anybody else does
0:11:04 particularly knowing that um let's get
0:11:06 the [ __ ] out of here let's get let's
0:11:08 just can we
0:11:09 can we go that way can we get are you
0:11:11 stopped from can we just walk that way
0:11:13 or is that going to be uh just let her
0:11:15 speak
0:11:16 we
0:11:17 we can go this way if it's the best way
0:11:20 to an exit did we pass
0:11:22 an emergency exit door did anyone happen
0:11:25 to notice as we were going they're
0:11:27 usually glowing we should see it pretty
0:11:29 easy if there's one around okay might as
0:11:31 well keep going the direction we're
0:11:32 going and we'll run into something one
0:11:35 way or another miles you have service
0:11:37 down here now can i make a lore wraith
0:11:40 to see if this is something that i've
0:11:41 heard of
0:11:42 academics is actually what i need i can
0:11:44 do that too have you heard can i be
0:11:46 ghostbusters too
0:11:49 based on the limited amount of info
0:11:53 what's the difficulty
0:11:55 eight
0:11:57 uh one success
0:11:59 one failure
0:12:02 wait so what does that mean a batch
0:12:05 i guess so right did you roll one did
0:12:07 you roll negative one success a success
0:12:09 and that's cancelled out by a one and
0:12:11 then i have also additionally a one yes
0:12:13 that's the point yeah with the botch
0:12:15 you're pretty sure this has
0:12:17 something to do with
0:12:20 a few pop culture references that you're
0:12:21 aware of you know that there are places
0:12:23 in new england where a fog washes over
0:12:25 people end up in another dimension and
0:12:27 things tend to go really bad while
0:12:29 they're there but it turns out it's
0:12:30 usually just a nightmare about someone's
0:12:31 own inner turmoil and feelings
0:12:34 so basically
0:12:36 when there's a very good chance that
0:12:38 wynn is confronting some of her own
0:12:40 emotions right now
0:12:41 i got big feelings
0:12:43 about molasses which is a little unclear
0:12:46 but
0:12:47 when
0:12:48 you will know that on january 15 1919
0:12:52 a 15 foot high 160 foot wide wave of
0:12:56 molasses
0:12:58 washed through the north side of boston
0:13:01 killing dozens of people
0:13:03 and
0:13:04 nearly destroying the city of boston
0:13:07 when this happened a great many people
0:13:09 died and
0:13:11 it rushed at almost 40 miles an hour
0:13:14 just slaughtering people whatever this
0:13:17 is
0:13:18 our souls who were trapped in that death
0:13:20 and have not been able to escape
0:13:23 the way that they died fun fact they
0:13:26 said that the smell lingered for years
0:13:28 these people are very likely lost to
0:13:31 their shadows and are this like rolling
0:13:35 pile of specters
0:13:37 stalking through this subway system
0:13:40 likely in search of other people to add
0:13:42 to it
0:13:43 hey when it's all right you know like we
0:13:46 can walk with you yeah i just want to
0:13:48 get out of here we need to get out of
0:13:49 here fast yeah yeah
0:13:52 they they're going to try and add us
0:13:54 i don't
0:13:55 wha
0:13:56 i don't know what don't question her
0:13:58 listen to what she says she's in charge
0:14:00 win get us out of here i'm going you see
0:14:04 hands kind of like johnny johnny johnny
0:14:07 johnny kind of uh pushes forward looking
0:14:09 around desperately trying to see
0:14:10 something coming at him johnny dodge
0:14:12 roll at difficulty
0:14:15 two successes okay
0:14:17 johnny feels a cold hand
0:14:20 brush against the back of his neck
0:14:22 trying to grasp him as he rolls out of
0:14:24 the way
0:14:25 whatever's going on it's happening and
0:14:27 it's bad
0:14:28 she's not kidding guys something just
0:14:30 tried to grab me they're specters
0:14:32 they're they're gonna try and take us
0:14:34 they're trapped in the molasses flood
0:14:35 okay
0:14:36 let's get the [ __ ] out of here i can go
0:14:38 we should probably keep moving Britta
0:14:40 looks very confused but we'll walk with
0:14:42 the crowd i'm out of my element here
0:14:43 wins you lead us in the right direction
0:14:45 we'll follow you
0:14:46 always let's go when uh you lead the way
0:14:49 i need a dex plus athletics from
0:14:51 everyone and the distance when you can
0:14:52 actually see where there's uh a door
0:14:56 that like workers would use to access
0:14:58 these tunnels however the light around
0:15:00 it seems to have gone out so it's in
0:15:02 total pitch darkness for who knows why
0:15:05 very likely something to do with what
0:15:07 you found down here
0:15:11 what's the difference
0:15:12 difficulty seven oh thank god
0:15:15 three successes two successes no
0:15:17 successes one success four successes
0:15:20 actually does being swift count yes oh
0:15:23 uh four successes six successes okay if
0:15:26 you have ruled one or more success you
0:15:29 avoid their reach
0:15:31 so everyone but the person that can see
0:15:32 them
0:15:34 yeah
0:15:35 there's by the way
0:15:37 manages to help the group of you i guess
0:15:39 that must be what it is get to the door
0:15:41 and when she pulls the door open you
0:15:44 guys can actually see the light from the
0:15:45 stairwell ahead of that it leads into
0:15:48 but then when it's grabbed
0:15:57 let go of me win
0:16:00 win will lose three points of willpower
0:16:03 what if that takes me into negatives
0:16:05 then you are unconscious the group of
0:16:07 you see her pulled away from the door
0:16:09 and drag along the cement wall question
0:16:12 because i actually don't know um
0:16:15 what does it look like when a vampire
0:16:17 goes unconscious from loss of willpower
0:16:19 is that like torpor uh that's not
0:16:21 actually something you've seen
0:16:22 her eyes simply close like she's asleep
0:16:25 and she's pulled away yeah because
0:16:27 normally when you run out of willpower
0:16:28 it doesn't knock you out right something
0:16:31 has clearly happened to her and whatever
0:16:33 it is that did this to her is dragging
0:16:35 her along the cement wall of the tunnel
0:16:37 away from the door johnny neal get her
0:16:39 back
0:16:40 uh johnny doesn't waste a moment goes
0:16:43 and and uh grabs win johnny is much
0:16:46 faster than neil but neil also seeing uh
0:16:49 wind get pulled away is
0:16:51 uncharacteristically like also right
0:16:54 behind him do you realize i'm the worst
0:16:55 person to send in right now they touch
0:16:57 me i'm not i'm out too
0:16:59 both of you i have no babies
0:17:01 okay i am also going to yell let go of
0:17:04 her as i'm going in there but i'm gonna
0:17:06 spend the blood to put a little oomph
0:17:08 behind it okay uh johnny give me a dex
0:17:11 plus athletics difficulty eight you're
0:17:13 both the worst and the best yeah it's
0:17:15 very true
0:17:17 three successes with three successes you
0:17:20 managed to pull her away from whatever
0:17:22 it is then she's in the grasp of but you
0:17:24 do feel you know some sort of
0:17:26 otherworldly presence pulling at her and
0:17:28 she is very cold to the touch why don't
0:17:31 you go ahead and give me the
0:17:32 ruler neil
0:17:36 diff7 for successes which technically
0:17:38 means four targets if i want them i
0:17:40 don't know how many there are but i
0:17:42 don't know how that affects ghosts may
0:17:44 have no effect at all
0:17:48 all right so make your right track check
0:17:49 i'm bad at this so i'm going to spend
0:17:51 willpower because i don't need to run
0:17:53 off screaming into the black tunnels
0:17:54 right now
0:17:55 i mean the good news is you probably run
0:17:57 away from whatever it is okay i'm fine
0:17:59 two successes
0:18:01 for a moment it seems like the group of
0:18:03 you might end up having to struggle
0:18:05 against this unseen unknowable thing
0:18:07 while when the only one who can actually
0:18:10 see this threat is unconscious but
0:18:12 seconds start to go by and nothing
0:18:14 happens and you start to think maybe
0:18:16 you're safe let's uh let's go come on
0:18:19 get johnny you gotta let's get let's get
0:18:21 into the light
0:18:22 johnny starts moving through the flight
0:18:23 with all due haste come on yeah and then
0:18:26 we'll figure out if we can get wind back
0:18:28 on our feet what what the hell happened
0:18:29 to her unfortunately i think she's the
0:18:31 one who knows maybe we can i i try
0:18:34 here
0:18:35 britta we'll take a look at her why
0:18:37 don't you go ahead and give me a
0:18:38 perception medicine
0:18:39 johnny's going to keep on moving and be
0:18:41 like no let's do this further up the
0:18:43 stairs and he's gonna actually get her
0:18:45 to just to hold off on the check until
0:18:47 we can get to like a room that's in
0:18:50 light that we can actually like guard an
0:18:52 entrance from as you guys uh start to
0:18:54 make your way onto the stairwell like up
0:18:56 the stairs the metal door that leads to
0:18:58 the tunnel suddenly
0:19:00 slams
0:19:02 and then it's quiet again Brittain's
0:19:04 ready to move how far do these stairs go
0:19:06 up uh they seem to head up towards
0:19:09 surface level so maybe just kind of a
0:19:11 some kind of weird little auxiliary
0:19:13 staircase nothing more right okay so i
0:19:16 can't see
0:19:18 ghosts and i i can't i don't know if i
0:19:20 can see the person chasing us well let's
0:19:22 see if we can get another door between
0:19:24 us and then we'll stop and take a look
0:19:25 at when well the door closed so let's
0:19:27 get out of the staircase so britta we'll
0:19:29 start walking up with johnny to leave
0:19:31 keeping an eye out for anything that
0:19:33 she could like put in between the coast
0:19:35 seems to be pretty clear uh although uh
0:19:38 you are also about 20 minutes away from
0:19:40 quincy market miles you need to call who
0:19:43 we're meeting with yeah i'll handle that
0:19:44 in a minute okay along with also getting
0:19:46 us a car
0:19:48 johnny ready to keep a lookout while i
0:19:49 check yeah absolutely all right and bro
0:19:52 we'll do her medicine check
0:19:55 three successes
0:19:56 her body seems fatigued in a way that
0:20:00 kindred don't really experience
0:20:02 and in addition to this she actually
0:20:04 seems like rather hypothermic like her
0:20:06 lips are blue she has kind of like a lot
0:20:08 of those signs
0:20:10 she seems
0:20:11 tired like more than i've ever seen any
0:20:13 of us uh almost like she's more dead
0:20:16 somehow
0:20:18 you see the way that her lips
0:20:20 she almost looks cold i've never seen
0:20:22 anything like this i don't know the the
0:20:24 one person who knows about this kind of
0:20:26 stuff is win i guess we could contact
0:20:28 the giovanni that we got the number four
0:20:30 if this continues but
0:20:32 if this keeps going then maybe we call
0:20:34 them but for now well we've got bigger
0:20:37 issues don't we yeah uh but we we can't
0:20:40 bring win into him into a meeting with
0:20:42 arabella Rowlands like that i so we need
0:20:45 to find a place to drop her off keep her
0:20:48 safe i'll i'll stay with her it's it's
0:20:50 fine if you guys go hell with that i'm
0:20:52 staying with her but if something
0:20:54 happens how are you getting her out of
0:20:56 there i'll just i can carry her out but
0:20:58 if something happens with arabella
0:21:00 i mean johnny you and you and win are
0:21:02 the ones who protect us like that i
0:21:04 can't can you disappear with her
0:21:06 give me 15 minutes and i can do it i can
0:21:08 make it so that people aren't going to
0:21:10 notice me and when i don't think
0:21:11 arabella means any harm and a lot of us
0:21:14 are looking kind of tapped look
0:21:16 i'm not
0:21:17 to be perfectly honest i'm not gonna be
0:21:19 particularly good in a fight but i can
0:21:20 get the hell out of somewhere i think i
0:21:22 might be better off with win your
0:21:24 talents might be better used at the
0:21:26 meeting with arabella you see things
0:21:28 that i don't see at the end of the day
0:21:30 i'm just some muscle yeah but sometimes
0:21:32 that's what the best thing i can do
0:21:34 right now is make sure that she's safe
0:21:37 i think you need to be with them to make
0:21:39 sure that we're getting the right
0:21:40 information here all right split the
0:21:42 difference and we stay nearby yeah all
0:21:44 right and if you keep her hidden all
0:21:46 right don't worry i'm pretty good at
0:21:48 blending into into city areas i'm just
0:21:51 worried about you know all the eyes that
0:21:54 we've got on us here i hate to say it
0:21:56 but down in the quincy area it wouldn't
0:21:58 be that weird to see some guy walking
0:22:00 around with a girl who's so drunk she
0:22:02 can't stand up i can play that card for
0:22:04 the time being as long as we're not here
0:22:06 too long you keep that door closed i'm
0:22:09 gonna step away
0:22:10 call a cab tell the cab that there is a
0:22:13 significant bonus if they can get here
0:22:15 quick and get me to quincy market quick
0:22:16 bill you know they're on their way look
0:22:19 if we have 15 minutes in a quiet spot
0:22:21 and johnny you can
0:22:23 forgive me for suggesting it i can hide
0:22:25 the two of you
0:22:26 i don't think we have time for it i
0:22:28 appreciate that but i don't think we
0:22:29 have time and i think i'd rather be able
0:22:32 to move rather than hide in one place no
0:22:34 you could move you just have to move
0:22:36 like i move gives you nervous eyes let's
0:22:39 get to the uh spot first and see how
0:22:40 much time we have left okay yeah all
0:22:43 right fine
0:22:44 what do we got for inventory uh i got i
0:22:46 have not you okay i don't i don't need
0:22:48 to know what's in there unless it's
0:22:49 particularly helpful to me maybe if you
0:22:51 have a sword in there or something uh i
0:22:54 have a little knife six cigarettes he
0:22:56 takes a dragon one that he just lit up
0:22:58 is it five knife
0:23:00 no that i already included this one does
0:23:02 it wouldn't have a knife on her uh if
0:23:03 you're searching when she has three
0:23:05 joints and
0:23:07 a pencil with uh a notebook and a pencil
0:23:12 and a set of brass knuckles cell phone
0:23:15 knife
0:23:16 and honestly if if you really want some
0:23:18 muscle just lie to her and say that that
0:23:21 wen and johnny are nearby ready to kick
0:23:23 her ass i don't think i'm going to come
0:23:25 to immediate threats but i'll keep that
0:23:27 in mind just keep it in your back pocket
0:23:29 i don't know she's anything like me you
0:23:30 should be able to tell you're lying
0:23:31 maybe so stick to like johnny and win or
0:23:33 nearby well johnny's ready to kick her
0:23:35 ass pretty proficient in this camaro
0:23:37 your knife Brittain freda hands it over
0:23:39 thank you i do have pepper spray no okay
0:23:41 honestly not worried about being mugged
0:23:43 do you want my knife no you're also
0:23:45 gonna pop you might possibly need it
0:23:47 fair but of the things that i can use a
0:23:50 knife is decent on the list Britta
0:23:52 further checks her pockets but all she's
0:23:54 really got are her gloves some colored
0:23:57 pencils johnny finds a cash johnny finds
0:23:59 a bench somewhere so he can at least sit
0:24:01 when down so he's not just walking
0:24:02 around carrying her well we're waiting
0:24:04 for the car but if you could just keep
0:24:06 that door closed this was clear what i'm
0:24:08 worried about until we can get into a
0:24:10 car it's actually not very long at all
0:24:12 before a car arrives it's going to be a
0:24:13 tight yellow suv oh brito looks over and
0:24:17 makes sure that wyn's hood is pulled
0:24:19 down over her less uh humane features
0:24:22 all right violin is this cab orbament
0:24:25 sunset
0:24:28 i do
0:24:29 i do approve of the ostentatious
0:24:31 coloring all right
0:24:33 all right the group of you board into
0:24:34 the cab and head out to the meeting
0:24:37 [Music]
0:24:43 a group of you travel through boston
0:24:45 much easier in the cab rather than an
0:24:48 awkward walk with an unconscious wind
0:24:50 through the streets of boston and
0:24:51 ultimately you arrive to uh what
0:24:55 actually seems like a largely open space
0:24:57 quincy mark has tons of tons of room for
0:24:58 walking around there are women who are
0:25:01 tripping on cobblestone repeatedly
0:25:03 saying i'm so drunk i'm so drunk i'm so
0:25:05 drunk right now and being harassed by
0:25:08 other drunks and on the other side
0:25:10 across the street is the water and a
0:25:14 large aquarium it is around then that
0:25:16 miles you receive a phone call i'll pick
0:25:18 it up hello this is miles maybe on the
0:25:20 roof of the aquarium
0:25:22 she hangs up on you rude as uh as johnny
0:25:25 gets out of the uh the cab he turns to
0:25:27 miles who just hung up his phone all
0:25:29 right if you want to gloat about this
0:25:31 i'll give you your shot right now
0:25:33 we definitely should have taken a cat in
0:25:35 the first place
0:25:37 johnny kind of like grits his teeth and
0:25:39 just nods i mean our compatriot being
0:25:42 down i wasn't gonna say anything right
0:25:43 now but i'll take it talking about that
0:25:46 do we know anyone that would know what
0:25:47 to do with this i'm gonna give kabir a
0:25:49 call he's kind of uh he's got his
0:25:52 fingers and all kinds of weird [ __ ]
0:25:54 i have to get onto the roof of the
0:25:55 aquarium all right that's where the
0:25:56 meeting's taking place the aquarium yeah
0:25:58 that that building right behind us wait
0:26:00 we're over there it is 100 close we have
0:26:03 to break into the aquarium apparently i
0:26:05 was going to ask her if she had set up a
0:26:06 path but she didn't so yeah why would
0:26:09 she johnny fishes out uh wynn's phone
0:26:12 kind of looks at it
0:26:14 neil how do you use this dumb thing oh
0:26:15 it just does she have him i don't know
0:26:17 his number what
0:26:19 i'll i'll tell you the number you put it
0:26:20 in it you just press okay he
0:26:23 we should probably get off the street
0:26:25 before we do this yeah maybe we should
0:26:27 take a look around see if there's a
0:26:28 quieter entrance uh hey
0:26:30 the uh taxi cab driver speaks up there's
0:26:32 a bonus for arriving quick yes there's a
0:26:35 extra hundred dollars it's not bad for
0:26:37 like a five-minute cab ride you fellas
0:26:39 have a nice night
0:26:40 you too i enjoy the aquarium just kind
0:26:42 of drives off

0:27:07 because it might take him a while to get
0:27:08 back to me just just type the numbers in
0:27:10 and then press the green button johnny
0:27:12 kind of awkwardly johnny starts typing
0:27:14 some of the numbers already in there he
0:27:15 has to clear the board again uh with the
0:27:18 red button but eventually uh
0:27:20 you already put three of the numbers in
0:27:22 i gotta delete it now how do i how do
0:27:24 you go back nah just just hit the red
0:27:26 button and then where you type it so
0:27:28 after a frustrating few minutes

0:27:32 manages to call the number you can push
0:27:34 numbers on a button wait there's an
0:27:36 answer immediately
0:27:38 no it's johnny buddy

0:33:21 together we're gonna be around here okay
0:33:24 okay just keep uh keep an eye out for me
0:33:26 yes just make sure eyes are on you yeah
0:33:28 i'll be taking a look out too okay
0:33:30 thanks and neil goes over towards the
0:33:31 front door to the aquarium which is
0:33:33 presumably closed oh it is very closed
0:33:35 okay it's closed it is locked there's a
0:33:38 light on it neil really the front door
0:33:41 oh
0:33:42 yeah i'm used to just sort of i forget
0:33:44 everybody can be seen um yeah i guess we
0:33:46 can look around
0:33:48 that's a good point
0:33:49 neil who clearly just obfuscates his way
0:33:51 into people's homes all the time is just
0:33:52 not thinking about it and he was like oh
0:33:55 yeah okay and follows Britta's lead to
0:33:57 like find another place to break in
0:34:00 that makes more sense
0:34:01 brett is keeping an eye out for like
0:34:03 side entrances maybe like an employee
0:34:05 entrance something like that why don't
0:34:07 you go ahead and give me a perception
0:34:08 plus larceny roll i have no larceny that
0:34:11 puts it at plus one difficulty
0:34:13 we found that out guys
0:34:16 what is my difficulty seven two
0:34:18 successes never mind we did not find
0:34:20 that out
0:34:21 we found out nothing
0:34:23 you uh expertly start leading them
0:34:26 around the corner kind of nervously
0:34:27 looking around and not really sure what
0:34:29 to find
0:34:30 uh but there's just a ladder that kind
0:34:32 of goes up to the roof uh actually this
0:34:35 just looks perfect oh
0:34:37 yeah i guess it's a way simpler way to
0:34:39 do that hey guys neil like zips his
0:34:41 fanny pack back closed
0:34:43 i'm sure there's a lock or something on
0:34:45 these usually these exterior ladders
0:34:46 have something on them unless it's just
0:34:48 straight up they do but it's like a
0:34:50 little fence space that you can just
0:34:51 climb over and you guys should be
0:34:53 sufficiently athletic to where that's
0:34:55 not really a solid obstacle for you
0:34:58 we should be a lot of things or you can
0:35:00 unlock that
0:35:02 [Laughter]
0:35:03 and that's where the party was killed
0:35:05 so yeah so we'll we will um connect with
0:35:08 our
0:35:09 field scouts and go to the ladder while
0:35:12 we're waiting around uh while Britta and
0:35:14 neil are waiting for the others to sort
0:35:16 of like catch up at the ladder neil
0:35:17 starts poking around like the bushes and
0:35:19 and stuff nearby like just some of the
0:35:21 weird stuff nearby looking for
0:35:23 a
0:35:24 spider just see if i can find one yeah
0:35:26 you usually find a spider and then as
0:35:28 everyone is coming by uh britta will
0:35:31 probably be the only one because he'll
0:35:32 like try not to let everybody know but
0:35:33 brett is right there and has husbacks
0:35:35 and it's definitely paying attention to
0:35:36 the weird thing that you're doing just
0:35:38 takes one from like a spider leg and
0:35:40 just takes a live spider and puts it
0:35:42 directly under his tongue like in his
0:35:44 mouth i was like i really hope he
0:35:46 doesn't eat that he does not eat it
0:35:48 that's such vampire [ __ ] i'm just like
0:35:50 we're like trying to do like a like
0:35:51 crazy stealthy b and e and meanwhile
0:35:53 you're just like weird oh spider good
0:35:56 [Laughter]
0:35:58 i imagine he makes like um
0:36:02 britta
0:36:03 makes eye contact with neil as he does
0:36:06 this
0:36:07 uh
0:36:08 don't worry about it
0:36:09 freda looks away as the group approaches
0:36:11 [Laughter]
0:36:15 all right let's get on this roof
0:36:19 i see you've secured us a nice ladder
0:36:21 entrance uh-huh yeah we should be able
0:36:23 to jump for it now we can certainly
0:36:25 climb it let's give it johnny you're
0:36:27 willing to ferry us into the onto the
0:36:29 ladder there sure or uh
0:36:31 jenna looks is is it like just is it
0:36:33 like a padlock on the on the fence door
0:36:35 could i open it from the inside to
0:36:36 padlock okay just kind of dangle in
0:36:38 there actually johnny could you just rip
0:36:41 that off yeah but i'd rather not leave
0:36:43 it yeah messed up here he'll just kind
0:36:46 of like scoop two of you under the arms
0:36:48 and just kind of like
0:36:49 hop over the fence
0:36:51 could you grab i will grab the two of
0:36:53 you first
0:36:54 um so that's uh Britta and neil yeah
0:36:57 okay and then i will just bound back
0:37:00 over the the uh the fence look at the
0:37:02 two of you
0:37:03 mind yeah might as well
0:37:06 scoops the two of them and also we'll
0:37:08 hop back over thank you i mean it was a
0:37:11 bit odd but sorry if i got you wet that
0:37:13 was my fault sure
0:37:16 all right i'm climbing this ladder now
0:37:19 remember let me try to deal with
0:37:20 arabella
0:37:22 without engaging in escalating conflict
0:37:24 all right so you should go first so that
0:37:27 she sees you i start climbing the ladder
0:37:29 when you make it to the top of the
0:37:30 ladder there is a woman there who is
0:37:32 wearing like a like a long peacoat
0:37:35 she does not
0:37:36 look like arabella and is wearing these
0:37:39 like sunglasses but as
0:37:42 you kinda make it to the top of the
0:37:44 ladder she takes the sunglasses off
0:37:47 and fixes you a stare and
0:37:50 despite it being a completely different
0:37:52 person her body language is without a
0:37:55 doubt arabella
0:37:57 i get up i straighten my jacket out
0:38:00 really not even in person
0:38:02 really
0:38:03 all right
0:38:04 see you bro your friends it's a hostile
0:38:07 city
0:38:08 if you say so
0:38:10 there's
0:38:11 a lot of weird things in boston so far
0:38:14 that we've encountered it's been an
0:38:15 interesting
0:38:16 two days including
0:38:18 people who tried to light our sleeping
0:38:20 accommodations on fire
0:38:22 the world is a strange place when you
0:38:24 leave your sleepy little town
0:38:26 you called this meeting i did
0:38:28 at this point
0:38:30 on the subject of strange things you've
0:38:32 found
0:38:33 you've certainly reached a point now
0:38:35 where you have to realize
0:38:37 that the jihad that exists between
0:38:39 kindred is more complicated
0:38:41 than simply doing what your prince asks
0:38:44 and if you were to survive it you must
0:38:47 make choices
0:38:49 some good
0:38:51 some not so
0:38:54 yes
0:38:55 i
0:38:56 wasn't always acting on Rowlands orders
0:38:59 in the first place
0:39:01 i'm not convinced of that
0:39:03 but
0:39:04 admittedly there was a time when i was
0:39:06 quite loyal to him as well
0:39:08 loyal to the ventrue
0:39:10 and i believed that we were a clan of
0:39:12 kings each of us peers and mentor for
0:39:15 great destinies
0:39:17 i believe they're [ __ ]
0:39:20 the same crap you're following for your
0:39:21 little iron circlet
0:39:23 our clan is lying to us
0:39:26 they have lied to the camarilla
0:39:28 in the same way that they lie to the
0:39:30 kind
0:39:31 and which way
0:39:33 the world is dying
0:39:35 and it is our elders that hope to
0:39:37 survive
0:39:38 and we are but a currency that they are
0:39:40 willing to pay to sleeping gods
0:39:44 so that they might be able to afford a
0:39:45 few more nights
0:39:47 and so long as you do their bidding this
0:39:49 this pointless war
0:39:51 you're just going to be a pawn and this
0:39:53 is not the sort of game that pawns
0:39:55 survive
0:39:57 miles you might have interject here for
0:39:58 a second
0:40:01 maybe
0:40:02 i'm just sick and tired of this [ __ ] we
0:40:04 come all the way out to the aquarium
0:40:05 roofed it to to parlay with you and you
0:40:08 start off by just throwing insults at
0:40:10 miles look just because your shitty
0:40:12 little praxis didn't go the way you
0:40:14 planned don't start taking it out on him
0:40:17 alright i if i recall correctly you
0:40:19 didn't just decide to frag the prince
0:40:21 you tried to frag his sire too that case
0:40:23 that kind of [ __ ] doesn't go unanswered
0:40:25 you know
0:40:26 his sire is one of the people most
0:40:28 responsible for this lie and i will not
0:40:30 apologize for what i did most certainly
0:40:32 not to some
0:40:33 punk peon bully boy
0:40:35 i think he meant apologize to me i
0:40:38 certainly did
0:40:39 regardless i am interested in hearing
0:40:42 what you have to say
0:40:43 thank you johnny and i'm pretty sure
0:40:44 this punk bully boy is the reason she
0:40:46 showed up in a possession suit because
0:40:49 if your ass was here right now i'd knock
0:40:50 your fangs out your [ __ ] head all
0:40:52 right what do we say about escalation he
0:40:54 puts his hands up like he's surrendering
0:40:56 and kind of walks away
0:40:57 he means well that's okay i sometimes
0:40:59 have to keep my breath online too
0:41:01 anyways
0:41:05 i'm gonna need a self-control roll for
0:41:07 johnny
0:41:09 wynn kind of preemptively reaches out
0:41:11 and grabs his shoulder
0:41:12 [Laughter]
0:41:15 johnny just punches the skid suit out
0:41:23 there's a reason i don't like using them
0:41:25 i'll spin a willpower
0:41:27 that's three successes
0:41:29 not two you're a plus two diff i'm at uh
0:41:32 minus one diff because of passion oh
0:41:34 yeah
0:41:35 hi
0:41:37 neil back down to wumbo power she
0:41:39 doesn't really acknowledge uh johnny any
0:41:41 further beyond some like slightly smug
0:41:44 smirk that appears at the corner of his
0:41:46 lips when he gets frustrated i've been
0:41:48 hearing a lot of things from a lot of
0:41:49 people
0:41:51 i've heard
0:41:52 through win from raven saying similar
0:41:54 things to what you were saying
0:41:56 so you know about the house that they've
0:41:58 been trying to conceal i've been to the
0:42:00 house
0:42:01 that house
0:42:03 is just a piece
0:42:05 of something much greater
0:42:07 seems to be infecting the land around it
0:42:09 from what i've heard
0:42:10 it was shipped from the carpathian
0:42:12 mountains
0:42:13 centuries ago but
0:42:15 like dracula
0:42:19 but more right they were called the
0:42:21 stanovich family later renaming
0:42:23 themselves the zantosa and it was
0:42:26 through new haven that they brought the
0:42:29 corpse of their sleeping god to america
0:42:33 and it is an america that they have fed
0:42:35 it
0:42:36 and nurtured it and it has only grown in
0:42:39 power
0:42:41 and soon it will awaken
0:42:43 miles nods our elders have no idea what
0:42:46 to do about it they have no answers but
0:42:48 they cling to control desperately
0:42:52 seeking santosa this war
0:42:54 it means nothing it is an illusion the
0:42:57 sabbat yes
0:42:59 unfortunately it's a very real something
0:43:02 regardless of the stakes
0:43:04 are they marching here just for what's
0:43:06 in that house they don't really
0:43:07 understand it they think they do
0:43:10 but most don't even acknowledge that it
0:43:12 exists they look the other way too
0:43:14 frightened to imagine what might be down
0:43:16 there i mean the sabbat so do i
0:43:20 does anyone know what happens when that
0:43:24 god
0:43:25 wakes
0:43:27 we only know that it is soon who's we
0:43:30 myself
0:43:31 and a handful of others who are
0:43:34 studied
0:43:36 in mystical arts does your book club
0:43:38 have a name yes
0:43:41 and then without answering as to what
0:43:42 that was she just kind of moves on does
0:43:44 this have something to do with the club
0:43:46 you're hunting down
0:43:47 the book i'm hunting down contains
0:43:50 information belonging to a coven of
0:43:53 witches
0:43:54 which is who knew what the zantosa were
0:43:56 doing
0:43:57 who understood the secrets that they
0:43:59 used to keep the corpses sleep so they
0:44:01 might survive it in order to transport
0:44:04 it to somewhere where it can be more
0:44:05 safely fed
0:44:06 it is our intention
0:44:08 to put it to sleep
0:44:11 is there no way to kill it that is a
0:44:13 childish question it is already dead but
0:44:16 it is beyond death and therefore a dying
0:44:19 does not matter which of the houses are
0:44:21 you from
0:44:22 of the coven of witches that split
0:44:24 which one do you represent
0:44:26 she gives you this look kind of
0:44:29 impressed
0:44:32 i am a member of the cloven hoof
0:44:34 and you s what is it you're seeking to
0:44:36 do with the ercodex you're seeking to
0:44:38 put it back to sleep i intend to wield
0:44:40 the magic of the ur codex
0:44:42 to put this creature to sleep and then
0:44:44 what
0:44:46 and then hope
0:44:48 hope that
0:44:49 this thing
0:44:51 this thing being thwarted from whatever
0:44:54 it is that it it intends is enough to
0:44:57 avert the end of all things
0:44:59 so you believe the end of all things
0:45:01 comes from
0:45:02 ogden street in new haven
0:45:05 yes
0:45:06 i believe that
0:45:08 if
0:45:08 this creature
0:45:10 can be dealt with
0:45:11 we can return to
0:45:13 the childish games that kindred have
0:45:15 become so accustomed to has johnny ever
0:45:17 heard the term gahanna before uh roll
0:45:19 your sabator so i don't i don't i mean
0:45:21 either way i don't think he believes it
0:45:23 but i know wynn and neil have both
0:45:26 mentioned the end of days in the book
0:45:28 when we talk about the book of nod
0:45:30 but i don't think
0:45:42 you know this this whole
0:45:44 nonsense about some beast being smuggled
0:45:46 to america from the old world this
0:45:49 smacks of just gehenna nonsense even
0:45:51 listening to some crazy sabbat priest
0:45:53 talking about cain rising up his
0:45:56 children eating the world his
0:45:58 grandchildren wow oh god this is exactly
0:46:01 what this is you're you've actually
0:46:03 bought into this [ __ ] gehenna cult
0:46:05 nonsense don't you
0:46:08 know johnny
0:46:10 even the camera is aware
0:46:11 that certain clans rose up and rebelled
0:46:13 against their elders at the beginning of
0:46:15 the anarch revolt one of them was the
0:46:18 zimizi the flashcrafters the fiends and
0:46:22 the story goes
0:46:23 that they rose up
0:46:24 and they slew the eldest of their blood
0:46:27 what i am telling you is that what they
0:46:30 thought they killed cannot truly die and
0:46:32 it was the stanovich now the zantosa
0:46:35 your very child
0:46:37 who is involved in smuggling the corpse
0:46:40 of that unspeakable thing
0:46:43 and brought it
0:46:44 to america
0:46:45 to your backyard
0:46:47 where now you
0:46:49 you johnny the
0:46:51 simpleton Brujah
0:46:53 must contend
0:46:54 with a power that can consume every
0:46:57 little thing on the east coast that is
0:46:59 your reality
0:47:01 it does not matter whether or not you
0:47:02 accept it however you
0:47:05 miles
0:47:06 of influence
0:47:08 a voice
0:47:09 and even i must admit that if you can
0:47:11 accept the truth
0:47:13 a difference can be made
0:47:15 do you mean convincing the courts
0:47:17 to help
0:47:18 the courts will not
0:47:20 change their mind your friend miles his
0:47:23 sire Jan Pieterzoon is the leader of a
0:47:25 secret organization in service to the
0:47:27 camera
0:47:28 josiahs
0:47:30 and it is them
0:47:31 who silence those who speak of gehenna
0:47:35 those who would warn of the truth
0:47:37 think about it miles why would they care
0:47:40 why does it matter whether or not
0:47:41 kindred believed this
0:47:44 a lot of the things you said
0:47:46 are very similar to the same stuff
0:47:48 santosa said as we were trying to drag
0:47:50 him out of there
0:47:51 it lines up with much we've been hearing
0:47:54 reports of the spreading the
0:47:55 mysteriousness that's going on
0:47:58 regardless if i think this is a dead god
0:48:01 rising or not it is a problem in my area
0:48:04 and we need to put it down and i would
0:48:07 love to kill it but if
0:48:09 slumber is our only methodology that i'm
0:48:12 open to it
0:48:14 and if you're open to it
0:48:17 i believe i know
0:48:18 where the fragments of the ur codex that
0:48:20 are needed lie
0:48:22 all right part of this coming up here
0:48:24 too though was for your return to new
0:48:26 haven i will not be returning i don't
0:48:30 think
0:48:31 that Rowlands in the end will do much i
0:48:34 i don't care right but jihad is beneath
0:48:37 me it is a distraction from much more
0:48:39 important things unfortunately i still
0:48:41 operate and exist there
0:48:44 then you are at a crossroad
0:48:46 is there not a way you can make
0:48:48 some sort of
0:48:49 showing no how about dying
0:48:52 no i don't mean for real just enough to
0:48:55 convince everybody else
0:48:57 sure looks like she actually considers
0:48:59 that if you have a suggestion i would
0:49:01 hear it well we're going hunting for
0:49:03 this er codex
0:49:04 maybe we can use that and it's something
0:49:06 else i would strongly advise against
0:49:09 letting your elders know that you seek
0:49:11 fewer codex well we're going to
0:49:14 chase after you who happens to go into
0:49:17 some sort of i don't know
0:49:19 let's say mysterious ruins or something
0:49:22 and if you die there
0:49:24 then
0:49:25 you die there are bella
0:49:27 an actual
0:49:29 question for you
0:49:30 how have you avoided summons
0:49:33 secrets of The Ventrue
0:49:35 i am not so easily manipulated is that a
0:49:38 secret you're willing to share with us i
0:49:40 am not if we can convince Rowlands to be
0:49:43 appeased
0:49:44 that you are no longer a threat
0:49:47 would you share it with miles
0:49:49 i would share with my cousin
0:49:52 and then he would be able to help you
0:49:54 with
0:49:54 whatever it is that you need
0:49:56 because no in the end i don't
0:49:59 necessarily fault all the actions that
0:50:01 went down
0:50:02 we always had a pretty good
0:50:03 understanding
0:50:05 i wish
0:50:08 i wish you had reconsidered my offer
0:50:11 i wish i hadn't been directly told to
0:50:13 oppose it
0:50:18 [Music]
0:50:23 the euro codex is in salem of course it
0:50:26 is
0:50:27 there there is an order
0:50:30 of tremere that maintain a chantry is it
0:50:32 called the house of high saturday by any
0:50:34 chance
0:50:35 yes
0:50:36 johnny gives win a look like damn you
0:50:38 have the [ __ ] esoteric knowledge
0:50:42 publicly among the tremendous they are
0:50:44 known as high saturday but they harbor a
0:50:47 secret
0:50:49 those who hold the oracle decks are part
0:50:50 of a group called the order of the worm
0:50:52 that sounds bad how many [ __ ] orders
0:50:55 are there you live in new england johnny
0:50:57 secret organizations are all over the
0:50:58 place too you're part of one but the
0:51:00 order of the worm they're the ones
0:51:03 who
0:51:04 keep it who understand it high saturday
0:51:06 controls multiple chantries in new
0:51:07 england but when in salem was shut down
0:51:10 and the tremere that were there
0:51:11 supposedly killed
0:51:13 apparently the order of the worm is
0:51:16 taboo even among tremere why because
0:51:19 they deal with things not of this world
0:51:21 i deal with things not of this world yes
0:51:24 what you deal with is of this world but
0:51:26 a different plane within it what they
0:51:28 tapped it into was something else
0:51:30 something wrong and the faustian deals
0:51:32 that they made there resulted in their
0:51:34 execution
0:51:36 even with the chantry abandoned it will
0:51:38 have defenses
0:51:40 there will be dangerous but within it is
0:51:42 the ercodex
0:51:43 and
0:51:45 you haven't
0:51:46 gone to get it yourself i am capable of
0:51:49 many things but i am not a cordery
0:51:51 johnny's uh pacing kind of around
0:51:54 smoking a cigarette on the outskirts of
0:51:55 this convert whole conversation he'll
0:51:57 stop over at kneel and kind of lean in
0:52:00 and just kind of quietly whisper
0:52:02 you pick up anything weird or seeing
0:52:04 anything bizarre out around here so the
0:52:06 whole time that she's been talking
0:52:08 neil's just kind of been standing in the
0:52:10 back not really like just his natural
0:52:12 like don't really look at me positioning
0:52:14 the whole time she was talking about
0:52:16 gehenna he got a really weird look on
0:52:20 his face
0:52:21 like a knowing sort of
0:52:24 not like surprise that she's talking
0:52:26 about gehenna but a just a very peculiar
0:52:29 look and he's just staring directly at
0:52:31 her not really focused on looking around
0:52:34 like he was looking around the whole
0:52:35 roof like oh i gotta keep an eye and
0:52:37 then as soon as she started talking
0:52:38 about that stuff he just got like
0:52:39 weirdly focused in
0:52:41 particularly the parts where she was
0:52:43 talking about ancient things arising you
0:52:45 got that insight that i don't like but i
0:52:48 trust
0:52:49 what are you thinking
0:52:50 i think
0:52:52 that she's thinking too small
0:52:55 and not small
0:52:57 enough
0:52:58 that's what i think and actually while
0:53:00 we're doing this lex like while he's
0:53:02 looking at her i do want to spend a will
0:53:04 and try and pull a thought out of her
0:53:06 brain while we were
0:53:08 in discussion
0:53:10 you are at plus two difficulty for this
0:53:12 role as you actually feel like
0:53:14 pharmaceutical defenses
0:53:16 difficulty is her current willpower okay
0:53:18 difficulty 11. so i'm deaf six then yep
0:53:22 gross and stand on my brain
0:53:25 fyi
0:53:26 two successes okay which means i can get
0:53:29 to like two layers deep the the
0:53:31 questions i've got here number one is
0:53:33 that surface levels like hey where's
0:53:35 your body where are you right now her
0:53:37 body is nearby
0:53:39 being protected and then because i'm
0:53:42 getting a little bit deep here with the
0:53:43 successes she said she wants the er
0:53:45 codex to stop the rise of this thing i
0:53:48 want to know why she really wants it she
0:53:51 is telling half truths the er codex does
0:53:55 not actually directly give a means of
0:53:56 stopping this thing that's
0:53:58 why
0:53:59 xentes has succeeded but there are
0:54:02 things
0:54:03 that want the er codex that she has
0:54:05 brokered an arrangement with and by
0:54:07 helping them in exchange
0:54:11 they will pull this this thing they're
0:54:14 confident in their belief that they can
0:54:15 pull this thing out of reality and she
0:54:18 is kind of trying to her concealing this
0:54:20 is actually sort of a mercy like if i
0:54:23 tell you what you're getting yourselves
0:54:24 into i'll just scare you and you'll fail
0:54:26 and this thing will not be stopped to
0:54:28 her it's like a ventrue burden like
0:54:30 she's trying to tell the truth by lying
0:54:32 but not telling the truth
0:54:35 so neil like having had all those weird
0:54:38 looks on his face uh as johnny is
0:54:39 talking to him is just looking right at
0:54:41 arabella in that kind of creepy
0:54:44 malkavian way he does sometimes and just
0:54:46 sort of reiterate maybe at a level that
0:54:49 she can hear because he's just kind of
0:54:50 zoned out a little yeah she's thinking
0:54:53 so
0:54:54 small
0:54:55 but not small enough because that's not
0:54:57 what kahana is
0:55:00 not according to the people i talk to
0:55:01 anyways um
0:55:04 arabella i hi neil i don't know if you
0:55:07 yes neil um i think you're
0:55:10 underestimating
0:55:12 us
0:55:13 as as people
0:55:15 i mean
0:55:16 i know
0:55:17 that you think
0:55:19 you're
0:55:20 you know sacrificing here
0:55:23 but
0:55:24 that level of brokering and shadow plays
0:55:28 and
0:55:28 and trying to make back room deals to
0:55:31 get things done i mean i know you said
0:55:33 the jihad's [ __ ] but you're doing a
0:55:36 lot of it right now
0:55:37 no kindred can truly escape it
0:55:40 oh
0:55:41 you can only go so far right
0:55:43 problem if we try and leave the city
0:55:45 we're stuck here we can't go to salem
0:55:48 and i'm i'm curious if you can leave the
0:55:50 city too i mean since you're right here
0:55:52 at all what do you mean i mean there's
0:55:55 no reason for you
0:55:57 to physically be here to talk to us like
0:55:59 this
0:56:00 i know you're not you obviously you're
0:56:03 riding inside but you're still close by
0:56:06 why
0:56:08 why are you in boston if you know
0:56:10 whether your codex is
0:56:12 in a city that hates you this city is
0:56:15 probably the safest from the sabah
0:56:17 it's still a city
0:56:19 it's still a target on a list
0:56:22 why
0:56:24 why are you just laying and he like
0:56:26 gestures in a vague direction because he
0:56:28 doesn't know directly where her body is
0:56:30 but like sort of like why are you here
0:56:32 gesturing around i don't see how that's
0:56:34 any business of yours because
0:56:37 i understand your goals i understand
0:56:40 what you say the goals here are who
0:56:44 wants the book
0:56:46 if they can stop it and it's such a big
0:56:48 deal
0:56:49 why don't they just do it why can't you
0:56:51 convince them without it
0:56:53 not all objectives are altruistic
0:56:56 i know
0:56:57 but the more that the nights get darker
0:57:00 the more i think all of us here
0:57:02 appreciate a little bit of honesty
0:57:04 forced or not
0:57:06 i don't think you understand quite what
0:57:08 you're asking
0:57:09 and you're mistaking kindred disciplines
0:57:12 for insight
0:57:13 maybe but the thing that you are trying
0:57:16 to have us focus on that's waking up is
0:57:19 not the only thing that's waking up
0:57:22 do you know
0:57:24 how this goes were we to
0:57:27 [Music]
0:57:28 attempt to
0:57:30 create counter measures for everything
0:57:32 we would still miss something
0:57:34 for all our interlinked and
0:57:37 understanding
0:57:38 we're newcomers to a very old game
0:57:41 so i'm going to do
0:57:43 the thing that i know i can accomplish
0:57:46 what i am confident in and i will not
0:57:48 fly higher
0:57:50 only to drown
0:57:53 miles walks over to the edge of the roof
0:57:54 looks out over the bay i don't know what
0:57:57 exactly this is that you're talking
0:57:59 about but
0:58:01 i do have a few questions before we go
0:58:02 too much further did you try to kill us
0:58:05 yesterday
0:58:06 no that wasn't you that set fire to our
0:58:08 i don't actually know what you're
0:58:09 talking about we were staying in a haven
0:58:11 it was felt very much like a set of
0:58:13 people who have been
0:58:15 had their brains messed with an
0:58:17 adventure kind of way i'd rather
0:58:19 specifically need you in order to
0:58:20 accomplish something well then that
0:58:22 means there was somebody else in the
0:58:23 city messing with people's minds in a
0:58:25 way that tried to kill us
0:58:26 with a whole network of individuals
0:58:28 reporting
0:58:30 brainwashed individuals
0:58:31 how truthful is she being right now
0:58:33 she's telling the truth oh you're
0:58:34 looking at aurora yeah
0:58:36 okay so a few things now you're now
0:58:39 you're blind there is a pale aura
0:58:41 overlaid on top of a frightened mortal
0:58:44 aura so uh you definitely get the
0:58:46 impression that in the subconsciousness
0:58:49 of her host they're like deep down aware
0:58:51 that their body is being ridden by this
0:58:53 this vampire in addition to this there
0:58:56 are splotches of hatred and
0:58:58 her aura undulates in like these like
0:59:01 perfect waves like it's almost hypnotic
0:59:03 to watch and then you see something you
0:59:05 have not seen before
0:59:07 which are green flames that lick and
0:59:11 corrupt her aura leading like
0:59:14 acidic pits in her spirit [ __ ] knew
0:59:18 it question
0:59:21 question having been taught and raised
0:59:23 by asamites how much do i know about
0:59:26 that
0:59:27 you would know that based upon asthmatic
0:59:29 propaganda
0:59:30 the truth yes i hear you
0:59:33 the entered olympians i'm down for wrong
0:59:35 perspectives here haynes arrogant
0:59:37 grandchildren were unable to stand
0:59:39 against the rise of an unstoppable
0:59:43 bloodline that drew upon the power of
0:59:44 demons and it was the assamites who rode
0:59:49 into battle against them along with a
0:59:51 long forgotten bloodline that they don't
0:59:52 bother to mention to you um
0:59:54 together under the leadership of the
0:59:56 great manchester they vanquished many of
0:59:59 these creatures these these vampiric
1:00:01 imps that draw upon demonic power but
1:00:04 they could not
1:00:06 quite win and even then despite their
1:00:09 bravery they were slowly overrun by
1:00:11 these blood sorcerers and brutes until
1:00:15 their hero great hakim wise hakeem
1:00:20 the judge
1:00:21 created a weapon and i need you to make
1:00:23 a rule lower your all to know the name
1:00:26 of that weapon so i was going to bust
1:00:28 out a name on her either way but i am
1:00:31 very happy to not do that if i just
1:00:33 [ __ ] this up coming together now
1:00:35 uh
1:00:36 i don't suppose a cult is the they're
1:00:38 like sorcery is the right one for this i
1:00:40 i will actually take in a cult rule from
1:00:42 you difficulty nine like a lot of the
1:00:44 spells you've cast kind of like worship
1:00:47 and play homage to this thing so i've
1:00:49 seen it yeah
1:00:52 four successes if my sorcery spec
1:00:55 applies if it doesn't it's two it does
1:00:57 it does
1:00:59 so you know that the great weapon
1:01:01 wielded by hakeem was a boy named
1:01:04 ursulgi and or shulgi
1:01:06 laid waste to the ancient bali and ended
1:01:10 a war that the even the ancients would
1:01:13 not win were not for this weapon
1:01:16 neil will be continuing to stare at her
1:01:18 and like get a very puzzled like his
1:01:21 expression will become more puzzled and
1:01:24 weirdly knowing and an important thing
1:01:26 is though uh or shrugi like got rid of
1:01:29 them they're gone so the benefit of
1:01:31 being a mulcavian asymmet
1:01:34 that's a problem we're hopefully on top
1:01:36 of but
1:01:37 it's kind of unfortunate now because i
1:01:39 thought it was you
1:01:41 and i thought we'd come to some sort of
1:01:42 agreement at this point
1:01:44 so now that's something else i have to
1:01:45 keep an eye out on two
1:01:48 sorry what is the context of what you're
1:01:49 saying
1:01:53 roman
1:01:54 pendragon has also told us that we can't
1:01:56 leave the city currently which mostly
1:01:58 means he'll probably try to summon us
1:01:59 back i don't know what happens if we
1:02:02 from our perspective you need to either
1:02:05 disappear
1:02:07 or we need to achieve our objective
1:02:09 well i mean pendragon's not really
1:02:11 worried about either of those he wants
1:02:13 us to agree with what he wants i think
1:02:15 he also wants to keep us away from new
1:02:16 haven that's correct because it'll
1:02:18 destabilize without us there but either
1:02:20 way trying to get to salem
1:02:22 that's Ventrue right plus i mean it's
1:02:25 close um and neil like looks directly at
1:02:27 her at arabella
1:02:29 the uh the children of hakeem are in the
1:02:31 city so
1:02:33 you know it's not safe here either she
1:02:35 reaches into her coat and clicks
1:02:38 something and she takes out a brooch
1:02:41 that has the mark of a scepter on it
1:02:44 with an iron circle around the brooch
1:02:47 and she tosses it to you i'm gonna
1:02:49 assume that i catch it you are now
1:02:50 holding you know the mark of her
1:02:52 dignitas an important note on that
1:02:54 scepter there is a morning star on it i
1:02:56 assume that means something among the
1:02:58 Ventrue it means that she was an
1:03:00 extremely prestigious kindred throughout
1:03:04 her ego she's just like a hugely
1:03:06 important thing no Ventrue would give
1:03:08 that up willingly and yet she has tossed
1:03:10 it to you now cousin
1:03:12 i implore thy aid
