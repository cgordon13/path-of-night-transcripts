0:00:26 path of night
0:00:26 [Music]
0:00:34 last time on path of night
0:00:36 [Music]
0:00:37 tensions are in highs the coronary drove
0:00:40 to Salem to meet with Arabella Rowlands
0:00:42 and retrieve the urquhodex from an
0:00:43 abandoned tremir Chantry
0:00:46 binding of the Chantry sunk deep into
0:00:48 the Earth the quotery in a pair of
0:00:50 arabella's Premier allies descended into
0:00:53 the broken Mansion only to be met by
0:00:55 Stone Guardians
0:00:57 and a terrifying presence stalking them
0:00:59 in the dark
0:01:09 [Music]
0:01:12 way off in the dark
0:01:14 here
0:01:16 who has come here
0:01:18 so when we pick up it is the group of
0:01:21 you in the dark accompanied by Carrie
0:01:23 and Constance
0:01:25 squaring off against you is a pair of
0:01:27 these big gray stone skinned dogs
0:01:32 I use the term dog Loosely because the
0:01:36 way their ears are tucked back kind of
0:01:38 has the the sensation of like the
0:01:40 impression of Frills and spines and has
0:01:43 spikes that go down they're like that
0:01:46 their spines their shoulder blades kind
0:01:48 of like actually make like jutting Stone
0:01:51 edges their tails while standing
0:01:54 straight like like a like an anger dog
0:01:56 have a series of small razor like bones
0:02:00 attached to them they growl their eyes
0:02:03 glow red in the dark uh when you
0:02:05 immediately recognize that these
0:02:07 monsters whatever they are specifically
0:02:09 no protein they definitely give me Vibes
0:02:11 like they were sent by goza to find the
0:02:13 key master
0:02:14 yeah they're probably almost as big
0:02:19 and they kind of move with the
0:02:22 intentions of encircling and killing the
0:02:26 group of you when this body language is
0:02:28 not like
0:02:30 like an actually natural born dog
0:02:32 whatever this is it was constructed so
0:02:34 now animalism is probably not gonna work
0:02:36 on that animalism is probably not going
0:02:38 to work on these things
0:02:39 so we're gonna pick up with the group of
0:02:42 you making initiative rules
0:02:45 it's been blood yep
0:02:48 can we see the voice or can we only see
0:02:50 the dogs you can't see the voice now
0:02:52 okay 18. China you got 16. and a
0:02:57 celebrity spent for a single extra
0:02:58 action win eight miles 19 for the one
0:03:02 celebrity spent for an action
0:03:03 oh yeah I have one celebrity spent for
0:03:05 an extra action as well Neil 14. I
0:03:08 thought I rolled pretty good man
0:03:10 honestly I've got a couple people with
0:03:12 Celerity now but recruiter he's popping
0:03:14 off with our [ __ ] initiative that's
0:03:15 that's one all of us that's one less
0:03:18 than my Max I'm not gonna my base
0:03:20 initiative was 11 to be fair I mean
0:03:22 that's still pretty good with a quick
0:03:24 draw for me it's usually 10 plus die
0:03:27 Roll All right we are starting with
0:03:28 Miles what are you doing this thing is
0:03:30 not seen yet so I will draw and strike
0:03:34 in one movement as part of my Quick Draw
0:03:36 as the closest of the two Stone dogs
0:03:40 foreign
0:03:42 five successes four carry overall damage
0:03:45 God damn wasashi Davenport over here
0:03:47 thank you that'll be five successes okay
0:03:50 uh it looks pretty wounded by the strike
0:03:52 it kind of gives like uh kind of like
0:03:54 the Monstrous equivalent of like a dog's
0:03:56 whimper it Bears its teeth and behind
0:03:59 its teeth you can kind of see other rows
0:04:01 of like black obsidian like teeth so I
0:04:06 guess I'd move position myself to defend
0:04:08 the inevitable attack from something as
0:04:11 we go along here Britta Bretta is going
0:04:13 to attempt to dread gaze the one that
0:04:16 miles did not attack you bear your fangs
0:04:19 dread Gaza it seems unfazed by your
0:04:21 attempt to strike fear into it seeing
0:04:23 that Miles has gone on the offensive
0:04:24 Bretta turns to the other dog-like
0:04:27 creature and though she lets her
0:04:29 vampiric nature show it doesn't seem to
0:04:31 have any reaction and she kind of like
0:04:33 amps it up a bit and watches and
0:04:36 confusion as it has no reaction Johnny
0:04:39 Johnny is going to LEAP on top of the
0:04:42 one that did not get struck with the
0:04:44 katana and attempt to uh pin it with a
0:04:46 grapple
0:04:48 foreign
0:04:49 successes you successfully grab a hold
0:04:52 of the and it feels like you're
0:04:55 wrestling a marble statue understood
0:04:57 everything's completely solid it has all
0:04:59 of the weight that you would have
0:05:00 expected this thing is made from like
0:05:02 solid Stone Neil we can't directly see
0:05:05 the big thing that's coming at us but we
0:05:08 kind of know it's there right uh yes
0:05:10 okay and Neil's gonna sort of look down
0:05:12 the hallway I watch everybody sort of
0:05:13 spring into Combat Action faster than he
0:05:15 can react I just looked down the hallway
0:05:17 and you know hey um it's okay we're
0:05:22 we're allowed to be here
0:05:24 you you don't have to this doesn't have
0:05:26 to be a fight hi I'm hi I'm Neil and
0:05:29 just kind of talk to whatever it is down
0:05:31 the hallway and as he's doing that going
0:05:34 to use passion to just try and keep it
0:05:36 kind of calm and chill so everybody can
0:05:39 okay give me a roll
0:05:42 uh the difficulties based on its
0:05:44 Humanity or path rating difficulty four
0:05:46 oh
0:05:49 five successes okay uh you succeed with
0:05:52 five successes things move to the dogs
0:05:56 uh the first dog is going to attempt to
0:05:58 break free of Chinese hold I will be
0:06:01 utilizing its potents so that's going to
0:06:03 be an opposed brawl plus a strength plus
0:06:05 potence yes
0:06:10 seven successes
0:06:12 I you both tie it does not break free of
0:06:16 your hold I had three ones on that roll
0:06:20 oh feels good being a strong boy
0:06:26 uh Johnny kind of threw gritted fangs no
0:06:30 you don't
0:06:31 it growls and gnashes its teeth at you
0:06:33 miles will attempt to return the favor
0:06:36 uh I will spend my other action to Perry
0:06:39 that has eight successes to attack
0:06:44 eight nine successes
0:06:49 blessed by your friend Arabella the
0:06:52 enchanted sword parries
0:06:55 the massive dog made of stone holy [ __ ]
0:06:59 dude that was an amazing Perry you I I
0:07:02 have to actually confirm one thing
0:07:03 because it does have a very high
0:07:04 strength rating you have strength three
0:07:05 I have strength three right now then you
0:07:07 are able to Parry nice strength two or
0:07:11 less cannot
0:07:12 that is the dogs so we go to win
0:07:15 question about how this would work um if
0:07:17 Johnny's got something grappled can I
0:07:19 smack
0:07:20 yes you can all right that's the plan uh
0:07:22 wind's gonna pop Claws and if you go
0:07:25 from behind you get some bonus Dice from
0:07:26 behind she will attempt to Grapple or
0:07:29 not grapples she will test him to take a
0:07:30 swing at the
0:07:32 grappled Stone dog sounds good why don't
0:07:34 you go ahead and give me an attacker
0:07:39 four successes okay three dice you're
0:07:41 gonna carry over okay so you're looking
0:07:42 at strength plus three
0:07:44 and then Clause add an extra plus one
0:07:46 die of damage I think she's I have the
0:07:48 fenra claws I think that's three dice of
0:07:50 damage yeah so so you're at it you're
0:07:52 rolling strength plus six dice okay
0:07:57 five damage it'll take three levels of
0:08:00 aggravated damage uh you start rending
0:08:02 into it and if you're digging through
0:08:05 Stone concrete and like marbled some
0:08:08 unusual alien Stone but even as you're
0:08:10 digging through you can see that it's
0:08:12 got like veins made of stone muscle
0:08:15 tissue Made of Stone bones made of stuff
0:08:17 there's nothing natural about this
0:08:19 there's nothing natural about this uh
0:08:21 miles your Celerity action sir uh are
0:08:23 you aborted to defend oh yes you did uh
0:08:26 we will go to Britta
0:08:29 let's do it
0:08:30 that is six successes five will roll
0:08:34 over into damage you hit but I'm sorry
0:08:35 which one are you shooting at I'm
0:08:37 shooting at the one that got a katana to
0:08:38 it okay
0:08:42 five successes it takes the blow and the
0:08:46 bullet seem to Ricochet off of it even
0:08:49 like the armor-piercing rounds don't
0:08:50 seem to be having an impact on this
0:08:52 walking slab of stone so Bretta noticing
0:08:55 that dread gaze will have no effect
0:08:56 shift stance takes aim with her assault
0:08:59 rifle and gets a few shots in that ought
0:09:04 to be lethal instead they tear up the
0:09:07 room as they knock off this dog creature
0:09:10 so Johnny has an interesting idea I have
0:09:12 this thing grappled what I want to do is
0:09:15 widen out into a horse stance straighten
0:09:18 out my back and lift it up into a suplex
0:09:21 onto the other or other dog I figure if
0:09:25 these things are resilient maybe they'd
0:09:26 be good to break each other with
0:09:28 go ahead and give me a roll I'd like to
0:09:31 note that the potential for Ricochet is
0:09:33 why I didn't shoot the one with Johnny
0:09:34 appreciated
0:09:40 five successes to suplex Ford Ice
0:09:42 carryover uh I'll spend blood to convert
0:09:45 the uh four potents into damage okay
0:09:48 with the four potents converted over
0:09:50 that's seven damage okay uh the first
0:09:53 one takes four the one that you're
0:09:54 hitting with the stone dog takes four
0:09:56 and then the stone dog you hit takes uh
0:10:00 all of it between you and win the first
0:10:02 stone dog uh goes down and the big one
0:10:05 that you're holding uh goes limping your
0:10:07 hands that was the most successful
0:10:09 suplex I've ever made in a game
0:10:13 I'm very happy it was in ours
0:10:17 I'm trying suplexes for decades
0:10:21 British hit with six successes on a slam
0:10:23 maneuver oh no British getting welcome
0:10:25 to the gym
0:10:27 Britta is hit for eight levels of lethal
0:10:30 damage uh you're going to want to go
0:10:31 ahead and roll some soak on that
0:10:33 how do you roll silk again uh stamina
0:10:35 plus any bonus Dice from armor does that
0:10:38 layer with the jacket yeah okay so the
0:10:40 leather jacket's one additional die okay
0:10:45 foreign
0:10:46 successes okay uh British suffers four
0:10:49 levels of lethal damage as she is
0:10:50 slammed into the stone wall now in view
0:10:55 towering at nearly eight feet tall is
0:10:58 this massive horned monster with big
0:11:02 leathery wings and its entire form is
0:11:05 made from the same Stone as these dogs
0:11:08 except it's bipedal that has a long tail
0:11:11 that kind of like moves and assists with
0:11:13 balance and has glowing red eyes Britta
0:11:18 you can feel claws like the same sort
0:11:21 that uh when used to frequently use kind
0:11:25 of dug up into your neck and he turns
0:11:29 looking at Johnny with this completely
0:11:32 vengeful expression after Johnny knocked
0:11:35 out his dog oh God we got the John Wick
0:11:37 of gargoyles oh no
0:11:40 round two
0:11:49 am I considered grappled yes okay I had
0:11:52 it performed a slam maneuver okay uh so
0:11:55 it gets like lots of bonus Dice and
0:11:56 you're like pinned yep acting on a 22
0:11:58 the gargoyle uh presses its claws up
0:12:02 into British throat and kind of gives
0:12:05 this warning look he'll hold his actions
0:12:07 to preempt anyone that attempts to act
0:12:09 against him uh we will go to miles I I
0:12:12 turned back while leaving the hand of
0:12:14 the guitar and like we just mean to
0:12:16 enter the domain to get something to
0:12:19 help the outside world you are not
0:12:21 welcome I'm sure but I think we can come
0:12:24 to some sort of agreement we can no what
0:12:27 would you like then no trespassers Freda
0:12:30 so what I would like to do is slowly go
0:12:36 limp while looking at him than I'd like
0:12:38 to be functionally that's my appearance
0:12:40 spec but I feel like it's more I feel
0:12:43 like it happens that there is doe eyes
0:12:45 but that's not exactly the role that I'm
0:12:48 trying to go for here essentially what
0:12:51 I'm trying to do with my body language
0:12:53 as I go limp and I drop the gun down if
0:12:58 I even am able to hold it is to look
0:13:00 towards this creature and say can we
0:13:04 talk about this
0:13:06 it kind of gives like this frustrated
0:13:08 noise as for some reason the the rage it
0:13:12 leans on to fight is kind of stolen from
0:13:14 it no people here
0:13:17 this place
0:13:18 is mine to protect
0:13:22 yours
0:13:24 we weren't told it was yours this is my
0:13:27 home
0:13:28 how long have you been here
0:13:31 it doesn't completely understand the
0:13:33 question but tosses you and Britta goes
0:13:38 sailing off into the dark and tumbles
0:13:41 Far Far Away
0:13:44 um Mr Guardian is while this is yours
0:13:48 and we don't mean to trespass but we do
0:13:52 need something here so is there any way
0:13:54 we could help you with something that
0:13:57 might be bothering you here nothing here
0:13:59 should leave Johnny kind of uh seeing
0:14:02 Britta get tossed off in the darkness
0:14:04 takes a step forward an aggressive step
0:14:06 forward towards the gargoyle cracks his
0:14:10 knuckles and goes all right big boy you
0:14:12 want a shot at the belt I'll give it to
0:14:14 you but we're here with Premier and he
0:14:17 points over at Constance and Carrie uh
0:14:20 they kind of like give this little kind
0:14:22 of uh kind of this cocky cruel smile and
0:14:27 like little wave to the gargoyle and you
0:14:30 visibly see his ears sort of kind of
0:14:32 tucked back and he takes a few steps
0:14:34 away into the dark
0:14:36 um by uh by nothing leaves what about I
0:14:39 mean I don't know about everybody else
0:14:41 I'm actually really curious do you think
0:14:42 you just show us around while we're here
0:14:44 you probably haven't had company in a
0:14:45 while don't want company
0:14:48 all right are you sure because
0:14:50 I I know what it's like to be kind of
0:14:52 like just you know lonely and like
0:14:55 living in a basement and you know just I
0:14:58 don't know if you're curious if you if
0:14:59 you you know it'd be cool but I get it
0:15:03 if you don't it kind of like lowers its
0:15:04 head Johnny backs away from the dogs
0:15:07 that he's put down to give them space
0:15:09 and kind of like give the body language
0:15:11 that if the gargoyle wants to go tend to
0:15:13 them he can uh catching on on to what
0:15:16 you're doing
0:15:17 um Constance extends a hand and begins
0:15:21 to speak in Latin when she does the dogs
0:15:24 are kind of Swept Away by some unseen
0:15:27 telekinetic energy and they kind of just
0:15:30 go tumbling off against the wall the
0:15:31 gargoyle kind of like Twitches but seems
0:15:34 completely unwilling to challenge the
0:15:37 will of the tremeer it's then that
0:15:39 Carrie reaches out and rests a hand on
0:15:43 Johnny's bicep
0:15:45 um it's okay or we have control of this
0:15:48 this it's just a gargoyle
0:15:51 um why don't we just move on he's not
0:15:54 going to do anything I was really nice
0:15:56 by the way what you did there Johnny
0:15:58 kind of [ __ ] an eyebrow at the
0:16:00 attention that they're giving him the
0:16:01 hand does not leave your bicep he gives
0:16:03 an uncomfortable glance over to the rest
0:16:05 of the Coterie when
0:16:10 holds her head and calls Britta where
0:16:13 uh you are way down the hallway
0:16:17 can I see her with protein eyes yes okay
0:16:20 she basically smashed into some debris
0:16:22 okay and you can kind of see her kind of
0:16:24 like looking around getting her bearing
0:16:25 and finding the light source that was
0:16:28 Johnny with the torch so I assume Bretta
0:16:31 like smacks into the wall and mostly is
0:16:34 just trying to take this moment to
0:16:36 recollect herself uh so I'm gonna ask
0:16:39 how healing uh lethal with blood works
0:16:41 one for one and are you able to do it
0:16:44 over time all at once or how does how
0:16:46 does it work time you're not in rounds
0:16:48 so you can spend however you want okay
0:16:49 so I honestly think then that as this is
0:16:52 happening she is taking a moment to kind
0:16:55 of like curl by the wall and just focus
0:16:58 on putting her blood towards the purpose
0:17:01 of mending her body because she
0:17:03 recognizes that she is not all right she
0:17:06 can see through her ribs yeah Britta can
0:17:08 hear the sounds of her bones snapping
0:17:10 into place as her ribs kind of
0:17:12 reconstitute themselves and I am going
0:17:15 to heal all of that for four blood okay
0:17:18 the gargoyle kind of Crouch crouches
0:17:20 down and starts tending to his big like
0:17:24 horrible Stone monsters I think it was
0:17:26 safe to proceed now so I'll slide my
0:17:29 Katana edits and then uh
0:17:31 check around and see where everybody is
0:17:33 and start moving towards whatever it is
0:17:35 Britta kind of stumbles up still healing
0:17:38 and you can see like the volume of blood
0:17:43 that she's had to put towards uh The
0:17:45 Mending the rips into her body and
0:17:49 towards her throat she looks a little
0:17:52 more vampiric a little more hungry but
0:17:54 she's still got some level of control
0:17:56 over that hunger I've got eyes on her
0:17:58 she looks like she's up
0:18:00 um well Carrie's got a hand on Johnny's
0:18:04 bicep Constance heads over to the
0:18:07 gargoyle and she rests both of her hands
0:18:10 on the monsters like cheeks forcing him
0:18:13 to look at her and then she begins to
0:18:15 speak in Latin does anyone here speak
0:18:16 Latin no God no the gargoyle gives like
0:18:19 a nod where he was once kind of like
0:18:22 vicious and battle hardened he seems
0:18:26 completely subservient to the witch
0:18:28 after giving this nod she lets go of him
0:18:31 and he seems to meld into the wall and
0:18:36 this weird outline of this huge winged
0:18:40 monster can kind of be seen in the stone
0:18:42 and that image moves like flying through
0:18:46 the stone away Bretta goes to pick up
0:18:48 her gun to recollect herself and as
0:18:51 she's looking towards the wall that must
0:18:53 have been who we saw before well I'm
0:18:55 hoping there isn't another one next time
0:18:58 could you two please talk to it first
0:19:02 I kind of look between each other and
0:19:04 shrug Johnny kind of pulls his arm away
0:19:07 gives a hard glance at them and goes I'd
0:19:10 appreciate if you heeded my Kota
0:19:12 roommates words yeah we're totally
0:19:15 listening it's just you know uh miles
0:19:18 agreed that you guys would be the muscle
0:19:20 not us we didn't need muscle right then
0:19:23 I don't know it's all muscle we can get
0:19:26 into that debate later we've got [ __ ] to
0:19:28 do now all right you guys are back on
0:19:30 then
0:19:31 she kind of gives win a thumbs up Johnny
0:19:32 flashes a snarl at the two of them and
0:19:34 kind of heads back over to where we're
0:19:36 headed down the hall
0:19:40 [Music]
0:19:42 foreign
0:19:45 to each other in Latin and otherwise
0:19:48 follow closely behind you seemingly
0:19:52 focusing on Johnny as their like
0:19:54 personal protector while the rest of you
0:19:57 Wade through debris and have to find
0:20:00 your paths through these lopsided
0:20:02 hallways bretta's trying to smooth out
0:20:05 her dress but even the sweater beneath
0:20:08 it has been completely ruined there's no
0:20:11 way to get back to like looking sort of
0:20:14 Prim she's looking around at the codery
0:20:16 and her eyes land on Neil and she says
0:20:19 please tell me that we have
0:20:23 a higher rate of having our ribs on the
0:20:25 outside than other vampires uh if it
0:20:28 makes you feel any better in in 30 years
0:20:32 since my embrace it's only ever happened
0:20:34 to me once I don't get in a lot of
0:20:36 fights though I can't we can't get into
0:20:39 a fight with him no no no no no no no no
0:20:43 no no no no that is not no we should
0:20:46 absolutely not do that I mean that could
0:20:49 have killed me I felt it I was able to
0:20:51 maybe block a little bit of it but or
0:20:53 maybe sent me into torper I don't know I
0:20:55 I'm just saying yeah he
0:20:58 um I mean the way he moves through walls
0:21:00 like that I he could just hit and run
0:21:02 tactics like a shark all day and you
0:21:04 know what are we supposed to do about it
0:21:06 uh basically nothing so hopefully
0:21:08 nothing really is a problem here
0:21:12 I'm
0:21:14 hoping that he is under their control
0:21:18 and that that is not a bad thing yeah
0:21:21 and then in Arabic we'll whisper to
0:21:25 Britta because he has no idea what
0:21:28 languages British speaks we'll just
0:21:30 whisper something to Britain in in
0:21:32 Arabic while they're chattering and
0:21:34 Latin kind of hoping that maybe she
0:21:36 understands what he's talking about
0:21:37 anything I don't know about Lex lacks
0:21:40 the language he's speaking does sound
0:21:42 very familiar to you but you have
0:21:44 trouble making out exactly what he's
0:21:45 saying it sounds familiar as in I know
0:21:49 it's Arabic or sounds familiar as in I
0:21:51 almost catch myself understanding like
0:21:53 you almost catch yourself understanding
0:21:55 all right so as Anil Whispers in Arabic
0:21:58 Britta gets a strange expression on her
0:22:00 face so she kind of traces out the steps
0:22:03 in front of her the kind of expression
0:22:05 that someone may takes when they're very
0:22:07 close to remembering something and it's
0:22:10 bothering them so she's trying to focus
0:22:12 on the idea of what he's saying but it
0:22:15 might not seem to click she turns and
0:22:18 she looks at you and she scans your
0:22:21 expression trying to figure out what
0:22:22 you're up to his eyes flick over towards
0:22:26 the tremair as they're sort of you know
0:22:28 clucking around Johnny he looks you know
0:22:31 simultaneously disappointed and curious
0:22:33 that we don't seem to be understanding
0:22:36 what he's saying and then just give sort
0:22:37 of a little shrug and back in English is
0:22:39 like yeah you know I just I'm hoping we
0:22:41 can we can all get this done quickly and
0:22:44 and safely uh and there's not a whole
0:22:46 lot more for us to do here there's a
0:22:48 strange motion from Britta at that
0:22:50 bretta's eyes go from Neo to the two
0:22:53 tremair and she kind of straightens up
0:22:56 and she stops messing with uh the
0:22:59 destruction in her clothes as she
0:23:01 follows the slight hint that she's
0:23:04 getting she takes a hair band off her
0:23:07 wrists and ties her hair up out of the
0:23:09 way while she's looking at the premiere
0:23:11 almost like you might when you're
0:23:13 looking at a problem and after you know
0:23:16 her ponytail swings done and ready she
0:23:19 looks some miles and she says all right
0:23:23 do we know how much deeper we have to
0:23:25 get in here no I was hoping maybe Neil
0:23:28 might be able to see something in the
0:23:29 patterns to let us get an idea about
0:23:31 this place and where we might find the
0:23:33 error codex right a tilts her head to
0:23:35 kneel uh
0:23:37 I don't know
0:23:38 if I gotten a sense of like we know that
0:23:41 there are three libraries in this place
0:23:43 and that the error codex is in one like
0:23:45 one of the libraries this place was an
0:23:49 insane like Spencer mansion that has
0:23:51 collapsed in a very particular way so
0:23:53 Neil stops and sort of looks around at
0:23:55 his surroundings as best as the
0:23:57 Torchlight and his Titan senses will
0:23:59 allow him to try and get a sense of
0:24:01 maybe where they should be going with no
0:24:04 understanding of whether or not that's
0:24:05 something that's a cast I will be using
0:24:08 eyes of chaos famously unreliable what
0:24:10 diff do you want on this difficulty
0:24:12 eight okay so difficulty three
0:24:15 nine successes
0:24:18 you kind of focus
0:24:19 and underneath
0:24:21 where you guys are gathering the group
0:24:24 of you kind of noticed that Neil's
0:24:27 attention seems to focus on it and it
0:24:29 gets down on his knees and he rests his
0:24:31 hand on like the dirt and grime covered
0:24:35 floor which is used to be the wall kneel
0:24:39 you can feel a warmth and the scent of
0:24:43 Brimstone and it kind of occurs to you
0:24:46 the deeper you go
0:24:48 the hotter it's going to get and the ER
0:24:51 codex is where it's hottest
0:24:55 so Neil gets down on his knees and puts
0:24:59 his hand like rubs it in the grime
0:25:01 and then sort of
0:25:03 like he realizes that this is the wall
0:25:05 even though it's supposed to be the
0:25:07 floor that they're walking on or rather
0:25:08 it is the floor that they're walking on
0:25:10 it's supposed to be a wall
0:25:11 sort of lays on his side with his
0:25:13 shoulder on the ground and puts his feet
0:25:15 up on the wall like he's sort of walking
0:25:18 sideways Inception style I was like oh
0:25:21 okay this makes a lot more sense
0:25:23 actually when you look at it this way
0:25:26 um Johnny who has since recovered the
0:25:28 torch that dropped the second the
0:25:31 fighting with the with the stone dogs
0:25:32 began he's kind of just tilting his head
0:25:35 and looking down at Neil
0:25:37 um he has a shake and looks over at when
0:25:39 with a skeptical look and kind of just
0:25:41 continues watching what he's doing win
0:25:43 kind of gives Johnny a shrug like hey
0:25:45 this is just what he does so um look
0:25:49 I mean and he looks up
0:25:52 from his position on the floor for a
0:25:54 second he looks at Britta and then looks
0:25:57 over at the tremeer
0:25:59 and then looks back at Bretta uh we
0:26:02 green super green you guys Fifth Element
0:26:04 you guys seen Fifth Element it was like
0:26:06 okay it doesn't matter no I've never
0:26:09 seen most things yeah I know I wish you
0:26:12 had seen that though or or would see
0:26:13 that and then starts you know sort of
0:26:17 pseudo walking but he's not like
0:26:18 athletic enough to [ __ ] sideways walk
0:26:20 uh and then gets back up and goes yeah
0:26:22 okay so if we keep going down like this
0:26:24 is the he looks over at Kerry you said
0:26:27 there were three libraries in this place
0:26:29 yeah okay which one's the lowest one I
0:26:33 she kind of thinks about it uh either
0:26:35 physically or metaphorically probably
0:26:37 right wing okay uh I think that's
0:26:41 probably the way we're gonna go then
0:26:45 um down you know down the steps to hell
0:26:51 well that wasn't ominous or anything
0:26:53 yeah
0:26:54 right so can you help lead us to there
0:26:58 you got an idea no I don't know this
0:27:00 place is destroyed but I I can we I
0:27:02 probably figured it out I mean it's
0:27:03 great a good idea maybe Johnny noticing
0:27:06 that we're for the first time that that
0:27:08 the hallway has unnaturally turned so
0:27:11 that we're walking on the walls kind of
0:27:14 puts together that there very well might
0:27:16 be a pit coming up when we when we get
0:27:19 to the end of this hallway into like a t
0:27:21 and kind of looks over to win are you
0:27:24 going in front or am I
0:27:26 if you go in front everyone else can see
0:27:28 all right
0:27:29 if this is uh this is a hall just like
0:27:34 Neil pointed out everybody watched their
0:27:36 step because this might just fall away
0:27:38 to nothing I don't really want to be
0:27:41 anywhere near the torch but Johnny I'll
0:27:42 walk next to you if you want some Johnny
0:27:45 kind of pushes past everybody he uh he
0:27:48 stops when he walks past Britta kind of
0:27:51 like nods to the the the new character
0:27:53 scuffed into the side of the jacket
0:27:55 she's wearing kind of gives her a
0:27:58 knowing nod walks past miles and kind of
0:28:00 like Taps him on the back gets to the
0:28:02 front and starts slowly moving down the
0:28:05 hallway being very careful to look out
0:28:07 for us where we might just find a pit
0:28:10 Neil uh moves to walk with Johnny
0:28:13 because he's got better eyes than
0:28:15 Johnny's got uh and as he moves near
0:28:17 Bretta does the like point at your eyes
0:28:20 point at her eyes thing uh and does his
0:28:24 like really bad imitation of like a ruby
0:28:26 Rod backwards walk
0:28:29 super green and then looks back over at
0:28:31 the premiere again before like turning
0:28:33 around and following Johnny is that a
0:28:35 show or it's a movie Bretta it's it's a
0:28:37 it's a space movie I don't remember if
0:28:40 I've seen it it's about saving the world
0:28:41 from evil as you guys are talking you
0:28:45 come to a right turn in the hallway
0:28:48 which is actually a terrible pit that
0:28:52 seems to kind of drop straight down and
0:28:55 when you look down the torch does not
0:28:59 seem to make it quite far enough in
0:29:01 terms of Illumination and when you look
0:29:03 up you see kind of the similar thing but
0:29:06 going straight up and you start to
0:29:08 wonder just how deep you've gone at this
0:29:10 point
0:29:14 [Music]
0:29:18 sort of Passage forward besides of it
0:29:20 yep okay so we see the sky upwards or
0:29:24 does there appear to be some form of
0:29:26 ceiling uh there's no light up there
0:29:28 okay Johnny uh moves the torch around to
0:29:31 see if there's maybe a sconce somewhere
0:29:33 on the ground that we've walked past or
0:29:35 maybe on the ceiling so you've stepped
0:29:37 over doors and you have stepped over
0:29:40 response hey uh somebody snatch up one
0:29:42 of those sconces for me when bends down
0:29:44 and just kind of pulls it off the wall
0:29:47 with a kind of like a wet noise it all
0:29:49 kind of pulls up he uh he touches the
0:29:52 burning torch to the uh to the new one
0:29:54 that she's grabbed
0:29:56 um and tries to light it on fire I had
0:29:58 lights kneel and despite the presence of
0:30:01 the two torches it is down to there that
0:30:03 feels warmest I was about to ask uh if
0:30:05 this is a t but it's been Twisted so one
0:30:08 goes up and one goes down Neil's gonna
0:30:10 sort of look to see which wall the floor
0:30:13 is on to tell you which way is the right
0:30:15 wing um and it goes straight down so
0:30:18 knee deal looks around in the Torchlight
0:30:20 the gulp that he gives would be almost
0:30:23 comical if it wasn't actually deeply
0:30:25 afraid and he just points a finger down
0:30:28 the pit Johnny kind of nods knowingly
0:30:30 the new torch we've made looks like it's
0:30:32 got more life than the one that I've
0:30:34 been using right yes so Johnny tosses uh
0:30:37 the the torch he's been using down the
0:30:40 hall to see how how far down it goes you
0:30:42 drop the torch and it kind of goes for a
0:30:45 bit then you notice a few strange things
0:30:46 there are tunnels that have been
0:30:49 borrowed through the walls or whatever
0:30:51 did it is probably about the size of
0:30:54 like at least in terms of like uh width
0:30:57 is like that of like a dump truck
0:30:59 there's just these like swiss cheese
0:31:02 holes in the walls and far enough down
0:31:06 it eventually clatters against big
0:31:09 bronze doors that are kind of covered in
0:31:11 muck and dirt Neil you definitely
0:31:14 immediately get the sense that those
0:31:16 bronze doors of the library you're
0:31:18 looking for and they're like pitted with
0:31:20 like acid and like it just it does not
0:31:23 look good you get bad bad bad feelings
0:31:25 okay so um good news if this thing is
0:31:29 still here it's down there it's through
0:31:31 those doors bad news literally
0:31:34 everything else
0:31:35 um what do you think burrowed those
0:31:37 holes uh that
0:31:39 I don't know whatever it is as some sort
0:31:43 of you ever seen alien yeah like you
0:31:47 know how the blood just eats its way
0:31:49 through the metal and sure
0:31:51 yeah right so whatever's down there has
0:31:54 acid blood no I don't know don't add
0:31:56 don't ask me why sure well that's what
0:31:58 you just said and we might yeah but I'm
0:32:00 clearly she's a glance back at our
0:32:03 tramir companions uh they actually seem
0:32:06 pretty distracted and I'm just kind of
0:32:08 letting you guys do all the work and
0:32:09 frowns looks back so is the way down
0:32:12 besides climbing down the shaft how how
0:32:15 far down is that shaft probably 300 feet
0:32:18 do we have any rope 300 feet of it no
0:32:20 well I do not
0:32:23 that was not on the list of things Yes
0:32:24 actually
0:32:26 Johnny bought 50 feet of rope
0:32:32 um he's probably got it tied around his
0:32:34 like around his like uh chest like a
0:32:36 chandelier he's like a bandolier on the
0:32:38 shoulder I think probably the ax is
0:32:40 actually like tied up in the Rope to
0:32:41 carry it judging some of the tunnels
0:32:44 those look like I'm gonna be able to
0:32:45 catch with 50 feet of rope yeah you
0:32:47 think so okay Johnny if you want give me
0:32:50 the end of the rope and I'll fly down
0:32:51 that will make sense and then I can I
0:32:53 can secure the top yeah and then I can
0:32:55 jump down to the tunnel yeah so what
0:32:57 we're gonna have to do is we're gonna
0:32:58 have to go from from tunnel to tunnel to
0:33:01 get down to the length of this we'll
0:33:03 have you grab the end of the Rope fly
0:33:06 down to there I'll Be the Anchor Point
0:33:08 and you guys will all shimmy down the
0:33:10 Rope all right
0:33:12 um I guess I mean I don't like this but
0:33:15 do you have a better idea unless you
0:33:16 think that might be an easier
0:33:18 methodology this is the fastest but I'm
0:33:21 not a strong climber
0:33:23 I mean I can also just fly down and do
0:33:25 Recon and we see if this is actually
0:33:27 right if it's something that shows up on
0:33:29 you we have no way to help you out at
0:33:31 that point I know it's not a good idea
0:33:33 it's just an idea so I guess the
0:33:35 question is do we go down here or do we
0:33:37 want to go look for stairs I don't think
0:33:39 this place is designed with stairs in
0:33:42 mind I think if this place was a
0:33:43 multi-tiered mansion there's got to be
0:33:45 stairs somewhere I just don't know if it
0:33:46 leaves
0:33:49 Neil looks over at the premiere hey you
0:33:52 like threw those dogs around with your
0:33:53 mind earlier can you just like lift
0:33:55 people down to the bottom
0:33:57 could
0:33:58 please
0:34:00 all right fine who wants to be lifted
0:34:03 she looks like really annoyed
0:34:05 I mean I'd rather do that than climb
0:34:07 because I'm I'm not a good climber Okay
0:34:10 who wants to be lifted
0:34:12 Neil puts his hand up like a kid in
0:34:14 elementary school
0:34:15 um the first people down there should
0:34:18 probably be either winner myself
0:34:20 probably win because she can get back
0:34:22 out of there and I can see in the dark
0:34:25 without a torch you all right with that
0:34:27 no but I don't think we have a lot of
0:34:28 options I'm sorry I put your name first
0:34:30 on this that's what my name is for man
0:34:33 I'm gonna give you a half-hearted smile
0:34:34 so when spends the blood passes her bag
0:34:37 to Johnny so all of her gear is still
0:34:40 not bound into her and she gradually
0:34:43 shifts her body creaks and cracks and
0:34:46 unnaturally shifts until it's smaller
0:34:49 and smaller and until she is a bizarre
0:34:52 looking barn owl with snake fangs and
0:34:54 Cobra patterns on her head the world's
0:34:56 raddest van mural
0:35:05 karate symbol
0:35:09 oh no
0:35:11 and Wynn kind of gives a nod and flies
0:35:14 down to the first tunnel okay the woman
0:35:16 begins gesturing again and speaks in
0:35:19 Latin and unless uh you're resisting I
0:35:22 am not Neil gets telekinetically lifted
0:35:25 off the ground gets brought to the
0:35:27 tunnel and just kind of gets tossed in
0:35:29 when Dodge is out of the way of the
0:35:32 flying malkavian male lands like pretty
0:35:34 close right beside you she kind of [ __ ]
0:35:36 her head like are you okay yeah I'm fine
0:35:38 they are now like 300 feet away from us
0:35:41 right yeah I thought we were 50 feet
0:35:43 away we were going down to the first I
0:35:45 think they're not gonna oh they skipped
0:35:47 the Rope oh okay yeah I'm
0:35:49 fine are you
0:35:51 okay she not
0:35:52 um who hey uh okay so I don't know what
0:35:57 the plan is here for us to do next
0:35:59 um but I I wasn't I just I just want you
0:36:02 to know any kind of Whispers to win now
0:36:03 that they're like 300 feet away but he
0:36:05 knows that all specs means like it maybe
0:36:07 still be heard I was not being
0:36:09 metaphorical when I was talking about
0:36:11 hell just as an FYI through those doors
0:36:15 win's head kind of tilts slowly like
0:36:18 okay just you know I'm also not strong
0:36:21 enough to open these doors I just I
0:36:23 don't I do think we need Johnny down
0:36:25 here at this point
0:36:27 um I'm gonna look around uh when we
0:36:29 figure out how to get everybody else
0:36:30 down here
0:36:32 um getting back out might be an issue
0:36:34 but you know okay so who's next alrighty
0:36:39 um Bretta steps forward she does not
0:36:41 look super comfortable with the concept
0:36:44 but she's still got her arms wrapped
0:36:46 around herself like she's expecting to
0:36:47 get tossed again but she's stepping
0:36:50 forward she gestures again and seems to
0:36:52 be casting the same spell and you are
0:36:56 lifted up off the ground brought to the
0:36:57 tunnel and she telekinetically moves you
0:36:59 down this time probably a little more
0:37:01 slowly than how they tossed Neil but as
0:37:04 you're moved slowly you start passing by
0:37:06 those tunnels and every now and again
0:37:09 you can like see chunks of like dirt
0:37:13 drop from the ceiling in those tunnels
0:37:15 or like see what looks like a wall but
0:37:18 it kind of like moves
0:37:20 so I think that that might be a good
0:37:23 time actually to introduce the fact that
0:37:25 I've newly put uh oral perception on my
0:37:28 sheet because I think that Brito would
0:37:30 be using her heightened senses to try
0:37:32 and get a sense of what the heck is
0:37:35 going on over there give me a roll div
0:37:36 six
0:37:39 successes okay you're not quite sure
0:37:42 what you're looking at but you continue
0:37:44 on down and you make it to win and kneel
0:37:47 Brothers you are dropped dump against
0:37:49 the big bronze doors bruh looks at the
0:37:54 strange shifts in the Rock and like what
0:37:55 looks like walls moving and for a moment
0:37:59 she almost feels more capacity within
0:38:02 herself but the moment slips by and she
0:38:05 gets shaken out of it by the clang as
0:38:07 she lands in response to the damage done
0:38:10 earlier there is a jolt as if she's
0:38:12 expecting claws to come out of her again
0:38:14 but she writes herself and she looks at
0:38:16 the two all right um
0:38:19 these look heavy um we'd have to pull
0:38:22 them up to even try to open them yeah
0:38:24 this feels like a Johnny job
0:38:27 a curiosity on on the way that this is
0:38:29 built so as I understand it the deeper
0:38:31 we go into this Chantry the the
0:38:35 architecture of the Mansion makes less
0:38:38 sense and is more of just the palette
0:38:40 out of which this place is constructed
0:38:43 correct how wide is this hallway that's
0:38:47 now in the way that it inverts a tunnel
0:38:51 dropping down 300 feet into the uh below
0:38:54 us it's probably like 15 by 15. okay the
0:38:58 doors the bronze doors are placed at the
0:39:01 end of this hallway so that when we get
0:39:03 to the bottom of it we're literally
0:39:05 standing on the doors correct correct is
0:39:08 there anywhere to stand not on those
0:39:11 doors uh narrowly yes okay hey
0:39:16 um
0:39:16 not be the bearer of
0:39:19 news that no one wants to hear but I
0:39:22 think there's still something moving in
0:39:24 those tunnels
0:39:25 I I didn't really get a glimpse of it I
0:39:27 can't tell if it's just the building
0:39:30 falling apart or you know I mean dirt
0:39:33 moving but I thought the walls were
0:39:35 moving and I I not in the way earlier I
0:39:38 know there was the
0:39:40 Stone man but
0:39:43 um
0:39:45 yeah
0:39:46 we should keep an eye out wind gives a
0:39:49 nod uh yes
0:39:52 full agreement are these stores warm no
0:39:56 they're ice-cooled Britta had like landed
0:39:59 uh pretty poorly and her hand had landed
0:40:02 on the metal doors she notices that
0:40:04 their ice cold kind of because her hands
0:40:07 are ice cold so there's not actually no
0:40:10 the coldness of your hands is a
0:40:11 supernatural curse it's not something
0:40:13 you are aware of it only happens when
0:40:15 humans uh touch you they feel it all
0:40:18 right so nothing is like comparatively
0:40:19 cold or warmer to me right okay but this
0:40:22 still is very cold yes okay so
0:40:25 regardless uh it does strike her that
0:40:28 these doors are strangely strangely cold
0:40:31 it kind of flies up and perches on
0:40:33 Neil's shoulder Neil buckles under the
0:40:35 way
0:40:42 [Laughter]
0:40:44 first time
0:40:47 so you wanna I'm looking for him at
0:40:49 Johnny and which one basically without
0:40:50 who's next I'm wondering if you're just
0:40:53 gonna jump down I think Johnny might
0:40:54 just jump down because he's he's still
0:40:57 squirrely about letting people cast
0:40:59 Magic on him I mean I feel better if you
0:41:01 were jumping down while I was going down
0:41:02 but it's 300 feet well I'm gonna jump
0:41:05 from tunnel I'm gonna try and like jump
0:41:07 down onto one of the tunnels to kind of
0:41:09 like make him shorter jumps but consider
0:41:12 this Cannonball we don't have any
0:41:14 strength uh my new potents uh plus
0:41:18 Athletics
0:41:20 strength potents and Athletics you said
0:41:22 that is correct so channeling his
0:41:24 Supernatural strength into his body and
0:41:28 allowing him to make these superhuman
0:41:30 Feats of Strength Johnny will as his uh
0:41:33 friend miles is telekinetically dropped
0:41:36 he will go down with him using the
0:41:39 tunnels as like small handholds and try
0:41:40 to make it down himself without the aid
0:41:43 of magic
0:41:45 seven successes what is the lower of
0:41:48 your Celerity impotence Celerity three
0:41:50 three okay so Johnny casually hops to
0:41:53 the bottom okay well if you're just
0:41:54 gonna make it look easy he kind of
0:41:56 flashes you a cocky smile all right divs
0:41:58 on piggyback out of here it starts
0:42:00 taking a look at down at the doors okay
0:42:03 so we're gonna wait here and uh you just
0:42:06 you know do the thing that you do sounds
0:42:09 pleasant thank you much
0:42:11 I assume they put me down without too
0:42:13 much of a
0:42:14 kerfuffle yeah no they they land gently
0:42:17 just not Neo um Johnny just look at the
0:42:19 at the doors can you can he see any
0:42:22 hinges on your end you do not see hinges
0:42:26 so that means these open down yep hmm
0:42:30 all right if I open these they might
0:42:34 fall in like some kind of trap door
0:42:36 perhaps you guys should try and get to
0:42:39 the edges where there's still some wall
0:42:41 before before Johnny has finished
0:42:43 talking Neil has pressed himself up
0:42:45 against a wall wind flies over to Johnny
0:42:47 and uses her beak to grab the Rope
0:42:50 that's wrapped around him
0:42:53 um and kind of gestures you know use the
0:42:55 rope Johnny kind of nods takes the Rope
0:42:58 off of him ties it around his waist and
0:43:02 I guess uh what do these doors have like
0:43:07 handles or like big Iron Rings or
0:43:10 something how are they uh so they have
0:43:13 the the really old school like knobs
0:43:16 doors the skeleton keys but they're like
0:43:18 way huge and oversized and like ornate
0:43:22 so he'll tie the rope off just like a
0:43:25 short length to one of the handles so
0:43:27 that way if he opens this and basically
0:43:29 falls through he'll the Rope will at
0:43:32 least catch him on one of those handles
0:43:34 he takes a look at the other one make
0:43:36 sure everybody's backed off Bretta house
0:43:38 yep oh yeah win has and tries to open
0:43:42 the doors the doors
0:43:45 open and they do swing wide open and
0:43:50 kind of make like a lot of banging noise
0:43:52 as it exposed this huge vast dark space
0:43:56 below
0:43:58 [Music]
0:44:03 it looks like there's tons and tons and
0:44:06 tons of bookshelves that were built into
0:44:07 the ground so now they like protrude
0:44:11 from the walls
0:44:13 and kind of down the line like like this
0:44:16 pathway that's open where you can kind
0:44:18 of like walk past the the bookshelves or
0:44:21 in your case climb down past there is
0:44:23 what looks like an open space that has a
0:44:28 set of brass rings
0:44:31 built into the floor which is now a wall
0:44:34 and within it is a series of intricate
0:44:38 symbols of very much reminiscent of
0:44:41 hermetic uh Magic
0:44:43 do I get a sense of what that is whether
0:44:46 or not that's a ward or
0:44:48 uh you're not completely clear so how um
0:44:51 so does Johnny immediately kind of like
0:44:52 swing down into this room and like get
0:44:55 caught on the rope that he's tied right
0:44:58 you're you're basically dangling from
0:44:59 the Rope looking down at it yeah you
0:45:00 hear Johnny kind of pulled up the Rope
0:45:03 catches him and he kind of grunts a
0:45:06 little bit and puts a thumbs up and kind
0:45:08 of like Winks it when
0:45:10 ah yeah I couldn't have said it better
0:45:12 myself how far is the nearest set of
0:45:14 bookshelves yeah Johnny can we get out
0:45:16 of here or what what's the he takes a
0:45:18 look around could maybe he um give the
0:45:21 other length of the the Rope the other
0:45:23 side of it to like one of them and like
0:45:24 swing somebody over to a bookshelf or
0:45:26 something yeah yeah so he'll do that
0:45:28 he'll kind of like take out the slack on
0:45:30 the opposite side of his waist and toss
0:45:33 it up and be like well
0:45:36 somebody want to tie that around
0:45:37 themselves and I'll swing them down to a
0:45:38 bookshelf I mean not really but let's do
0:45:41 it I'm the least useful in the
0:45:43 circumstance so anyone else
0:45:45 Britta picks up the end and ties it
0:45:48 around her waist and looks over to
0:45:51 Johnny
0:45:53 I guess this is uh
0:45:55 do a do another loop I'll do it do we uh
0:45:58 sheepshank
0:45:59 uh all right she looks at you puzzled
0:46:04 looking for instructions
0:46:06 Johnny kind of directs her to tie a
0:46:08 better knot around her waist she does it
0:46:11 uh that looks that looks good enough
0:46:13 okay please don't drop me no I won't he
0:46:17 uh really grabs onto the uh to the the
0:46:21 um he kind of like pulls himself up to
0:46:22 like where the handles are on the door
0:46:24 really grips good on those and gets
0:46:27 ready to kind of support Britta jumping
0:46:29 down and Swinging her over to the
0:46:31 Bookshelf
0:46:32 win kind of perches on britta's shoulder
0:46:35 and doesn't like dig in
0:46:37 but holds on she's ready to pull a New
0:46:40 York maneuver yeah she's ready to slow
0:46:42 acceleration if absolutely need
0:46:45 okay
0:46:46 once everyone looks to be in position
0:46:48 will as instructed jump give me a DEX
0:46:52 Athletics uh because of the teamwork
0:46:55 efforts your difficulties five okay does
0:46:57 graceful count yes okay
0:47:02 five successes okay with five successes
0:47:05 you easily make it to that next point oh
0:47:07 look around I have heightened senses up
0:47:09 any more information uh down below
0:47:13 um you now smell the scent of brimstone
0:47:16 and this place
0:47:19 is very warm particularly by the ring
0:47:23 with their heightened senses you see
0:47:25 what looks like wisps of smoke that
0:47:29 occasionally move within that Circle and
0:47:33 there's a couple of moments where they
0:47:35 take on an almost humanoid shape but
0:47:39 dissipate again into nothing there's
0:47:41 something in that ring can wind see
0:47:44 anything different did you go down with
0:47:46 her yeah she was flying down yeah you
0:47:47 see the same thing okay what's the
0:47:49 illumination down here like none it's
0:47:52 like the Torches and that's about it and
0:47:54 that's barely giving us a sense of this
0:47:56 room well or um the floor which is like
0:47:59 the far wall uh is just a like massive
0:48:04 pile of books that are all like Dusty
0:48:07 and like kind of grimy and like kind of
0:48:10 melted from years of like residue and
0:48:12 like black mold and water
0:48:15 we're getting warmer see if we can get
0:48:17 nailed down next well guys there's
0:48:20 something
0:48:22 ugh I mean the smell alone but there's
0:48:24 something I don't
0:48:26 [Applause]
0:48:26 [Music]
0:48:28 hello
0:48:30 I don't want the smoke kind of like
0:48:32 takes on the silhouette of a person and
0:48:34 then just oh you're talking to
0:48:36 there's someone don't listen to it down
0:48:40 here untie that rope so I can toss it
0:48:42 back up
0:48:43 all right
0:48:44 uh fumbles with the Rope but she does
0:48:46 not take her eyes off of where the smoke
0:48:49 might be talking to her
0:48:51 when you got your eyes on a swivel down
0:48:53 there
0:48:55 try again with uh or a perception
0:49:01 one success
0:49:03 you see a pitch black silhouette of an
0:49:08 aura do I have any knowledge or
0:49:10 understanding of what auras mean this is
0:49:12 your first time really kind of like
0:49:13 using it so you're not completely sure
0:49:15 but you do get a bad feeling what does
0:49:19 it look like silhouette wise so what you
0:49:22 see is a black a black black like a deep
0:49:26 like Ultra black Aura and it kind of
0:49:29 takes the shape of a person rail fin
0:49:33 with bony wings that kind of protrude
0:49:37 from its back like the bones of a bird
0:49:39 and on its head is this like crown of
0:49:43 black veins
0:49:45 Britta keeps her eyes on the figure
0:49:51 a very hesitant nod to the thing that's
0:49:55 talking to her Brett is looking over
0:49:57 with pretty big doe eyes and tosses the
0:50:01 Rope back to Johnny Johnny immediately
0:50:03 hooks that back up to where Miles and
0:50:06 Neil are wind flies back up to make The
0:50:10 Descent with the next person Neil I
0:50:11 think she's talking to something down
0:50:12 here you should get down here ASAP oh
0:50:15 God I said okay there there's definitely
0:50:18 like a demon down here so let's not a
0:50:21 what you just tie it
0:50:23 less talking more doing uh Neil tries
0:50:26 his best to to tie a knot around himself
0:50:28 Johnny cranes his neck to make sure he's
0:50:31 doing a proper job
0:50:33 giving giving those dad Vibes of hey
0:50:35 you're not tying good enough knot
0:50:37 he tries his best
0:50:40 give me a DEX plus Athletics difficulty
0:50:43 five here's my Athletics I always better
0:50:46 willpower
0:50:47 two successes
0:50:49 Neil does his best and he makes it
0:50:52 unlike Britta who like sort of gracefully
0:50:55 Tomb Raider cat burglared her way onto
0:50:58 these things Neil slams into the
0:51:01 bookshelf and like scrabbles for a
0:51:03 handhold but manages to do it uh and
0:51:06 then gets his way down towards the
0:51:08 bottom to stand next to Bretta
0:51:11 hey um I've waited for you you don't ah
0:51:16 so that's the best thing to do here is
0:51:18 just um
0:51:19 not acknowledge and and don't talk to
0:51:22 them and do not touch or stand inside
0:51:24 that Circle Brenda the smoke dissipates
0:51:28 for a moment it's hard to keep track of
0:51:29 the aura yeah and where the smoke was
0:51:33 you see this like broken
0:51:37 ugly tome
0:51:39 you guys see that right
0:51:41 do I yeah yeah
0:51:44 do I oh yeah okay so here's what you
0:51:48 want
0:51:49 is
0:51:51 the deal
0:51:52 we knew we knew that this was something
0:51:58 I mean do not presume to know me
0:52:05 you are a master of Heaven and Earth but
0:52:08 I am beyond that yeah I know
0:52:11 um
0:52:12 Neil's weird right now because he's he's
0:52:15 like very clearly terrified but also
0:52:18 weirdly feels like he's in his elements
0:52:21 but also doesn't know what he's doing
0:52:23 it's a very weird combination you know
0:52:26 what's I she is she oh she poo that's me
0:52:33 um
0:52:33 the Neil is sort of going to start while
0:52:36 waiting for like miles and Johnny and
0:52:37 everybody make it down Neil's gonna
0:52:39 start sort of pacing back and forth in
0:52:41 front of where this thing is bound yeah
0:52:43 I need that rope back
0:52:45 win oh what oh yeah yeah win takes the
0:52:48 end of the rope in her beak so he
0:52:49 doesn't have to throw it he will untie
0:52:51 it but seems completely distracted and
0:52:54 absorbed now as he's looking at this
0:52:56 like these rings and the bindings and
0:52:58 like trying to get as best as his little
0:53:02 like amateur sorcerer heart can do get a
0:53:05 figure of what the hell is going on and
0:53:08 what he's looking at here when brings
0:53:10 the Rope back up to miles
0:53:12 miles I don't know if you want to be
0:53:14 down here if you want to be our lifeline
0:53:16 on the outside I think it might be okay
0:53:18 for me to stay up here so I will tie
0:53:21 this to myself and you can you give me a
0:53:23 heads up when you're ready to jump right
0:53:25 I mean you can go on down right me I
0:53:28 don't know from the way I'm I'm hooked
0:53:30 up here wind brings the Rope back down
0:53:33 to Johnny and kind of motions for him to
0:53:35 tie it
0:53:36 the loose end around the doorknob so he
0:53:39 can lower himself Down Johnny will pick
0:53:41 up some of the slack that's going up to
0:53:43 where miles is because he's got 50 feet
0:53:44 of rope so he can kind of play with this
0:53:47 tie it around the the door handle as
0:53:50 kind of our Anchor Point and cut him
0:53:52 some more self some more slack so that
0:53:55 he can kind of slowly lower himself down
0:53:57 and start swinging a little bit back and
0:53:59 forth to get out over onto the uh
0:54:01 bookshelf wind pushes him she just as
0:54:04 the owl just kind of puts her head into
0:54:06 his back and pushes him back and forth
0:54:10 trying to build his momentum as best she
0:54:12 can awesome Johnny I minus one death
0:54:15 eight successes Johnny describe your
0:54:18 extraordinary success
0:54:20 I mean Johnny just kind of seems like
0:54:22 this might be old hat for him for some
0:54:24 weird reason spelunking down into a a uh
0:54:27 invert weird gravity affected Mansion
0:54:32 nightmare realm just kind of casually
0:54:35 picks up some momentum swinging back and
0:54:37 forth
0:54:38 and manages to kind of let go of the
0:54:41 Rope the second he has the right amount
0:54:43 of momentum to basically just step over
0:54:45 down onto the uh to the Bookshelf with a
0:54:49 a few Deft hands he just kind of quickly
0:54:52 uh undoes the rope from around his waist
0:54:55 is there a spot down on this bookshelf
0:54:57 where he can tie it off again yes and
0:55:00 we'll then tie it off so that we have
0:55:01 the uh the Rope there if we need if we
0:55:04 need to get out so the the anchor points
0:55:06 in this rope are the bookshelf the
0:55:09 handle on on the door that's swung in
0:55:11 and then the other end is up on Miles
0:55:14 I have waited for you
0:55:17 why
0:55:19 because you are of Worth to me
0:55:22 and I know your secrets better
0:55:26 I know
0:55:28 I know who you were
0:55:31 I know who you are yet to be
0:55:34 look upon your mark and know that I
0:55:38 speak the truth
0:55:39 Britta stands facing has the figure
0:55:42 operated again it's a voice so britta's
0:55:45 not britta's staring at the spot where a
0:55:48 figure was standing there's a twitch of
0:55:51 the hand that has are you going into the
0:55:53 circle I have not moved okay no no so
0:55:56 can you explain so I understand the way
0:55:58 the room is the room is oriented on its
0:56:00 side with gravity going towards the far
0:56:04 wall of this room if it were oriented
0:56:07 the way we think
0:56:08 right yep how is this binding Circle
0:56:12 oriented within that how is it how is it
0:56:15 suspended it whenever it appears it is
0:56:17 standing in the middle of the circle
0:56:18 well can you explain the circle again to
0:56:20 me the circle is a brass set of rings
0:56:22 that have hermetic symbols drawn all
0:56:25 over it and it's like set into the
0:56:27 ground it's like they had built a
0:56:29 summoning circle into the library itself
0:56:31 into the floor of the library yes so in
0:56:34 the way the room is oriented it's
0:56:35 basically in the middle of one of the
0:56:37 walls yes and the brass rings are all
0:56:41 flat in the in built into that ground
0:56:43 it's not like a astrolabe correct okay
0:56:46 do the brass Rings remind us of the
0:56:49 pieces of an astrolabe that we saw
0:56:51 upstairs yes so Britta remaining where
0:56:55 she was is just looking towards where
0:56:58 the figure was in order to kind of have
0:57:00 a focal point and as she's kind of
0:57:03 looking at the focal point hearing these
0:57:05 claims there is a twitch of the hand
0:57:08 that there's the mark but she doesn't
0:57:10 take off her glove
0:57:12 she remains looking at the focal point
0:57:15 her expression her brows are furrowed
0:57:19 um her eyes are wide she's listening but
0:57:21 she's trying to figure out the copper
0:57:24 rings and like the arrangement in
0:57:28 relation to the book
0:57:36 you know you know enough
0:57:41 that you hide from your friends
0:57:44 your family
0:57:47 and when they learn the truth
0:57:49 when they learn without you they will
0:57:53 Aid you
0:57:54 as that said for all of us to hear or
0:57:57 just Britta everyone can hear what I am
0:57:58 saying okay
0:58:00 by the way the Chimes going off
0:58:02 uh this is not that kind of spirit okay
0:58:05 those next to Johnny can notice that he
0:58:08 is tensed up
0:58:10 and bristling in a way that reminds you
0:58:13 of when a dog
0:58:15 sees something it doesn't like and it's
0:58:18 hackles kind of rays and it's back kind
0:58:21 of
0:58:22 swells a little bit its hair stands on
0:58:25 end he has that same
0:58:27 feeling kind of just dripping off him
0:58:29 even if you didn't have Aura perception
0:58:31 you could tell that
0:58:33 we share an enemy who
0:58:37 what
0:58:39 what then you know what sleeps in the
0:58:42 Earth
0:58:43 what hungers for flesh nothing
0:58:47 of Creation in carrots nothing can end
0:58:52 the thing that is already dead but lives
0:58:56 but I am beyond creation
0:59:03 so I say this to you
0:59:08 what
0:59:10 will you give in exchange
0:59:13 for the Codex
0:59:16 and once
0:59:18 will you give to be freed of your marker
0:59:24 so soon
0:59:26 they will know who you are
0:59:31 and Johnny
0:59:33 will be your Pretender no more and you
0:59:37 know this
0:59:38 you know he'll kill you
0:59:41 you will hate you
0:59:43 they will all hate you what the [ __ ] is
0:59:46 this thing and you'll be alone that
0:59:48 lands on Bretta like emotionally you can
0:59:51 see her kind of like tilt her shoulders
0:59:54 back and kind of pull in words and she
0:59:57 starts messing with sort of like running
1:00:01 her fingertips nervously over where over
1:00:04 the marking in her glove and she's still
1:00:08 using that focal point to look into but
1:00:11 she kind of takes in a shaky breath and
1:00:15 looks over and says I'm not hiding it
1:00:18 from them it's Johnny puts a gentle hand
1:00:21 on Bruce shoulder just because this
1:00:25 thing can spit poison
1:00:27 doesn't mean any of it's true
1:00:29 kneel what the [ __ ] is this thing and
1:00:32 how do we get that book you know the
1:00:34 mark Johnny
1:00:37 Neil who has been still like studying
1:00:42 the Rings but also occasionally throwing
1:00:44 glances over to the big stupid pile of
1:00:46 like scattered books internally
1:00:50 Neil has sort of that weird mulcavian
1:00:53 sideways think of like this thing is
1:00:56 saying it's giving us the book but it's
1:00:58 entirely possible that it's just in that
1:01:01 pile of shitty books and it's just lying
1:01:03 looks over ass Crusade yeah
1:01:09 looks over at Britta and Johnny and in
1:01:12 like a weirdly confident voice
1:01:15 for Neil who is a walking panic attack
1:01:18 just goes the weird part about a lot of
1:01:21 prophecies and future telling is the
1:01:25 sheer number of them that becomes
1:01:27 self-fulfilling and there's something in
1:01:29 like the tone of his voice and the way
1:01:30 he sort of looks at Britta and Johnny and
1:01:33 the rest of the codery that makes it
1:01:35 seem like like he's saying that directly
1:01:38 to Britto without directly saying that
1:01:40 to Britta you see something very weird
1:01:43 happening Johnny that I don't know if
1:01:45 you've ever actually seen he gives you
1:01:47 this weird kind of confident like look
1:01:52 when you show how confident you're being
1:01:54 and immediately kind of relaxes his
1:01:57 bristling pose it kind of gives this
1:02:00 like reassuring nod like holy [ __ ] there
1:02:03 he is hey what's your name
1:02:06 it's not possible to hear a capital N
1:02:09 when someone says stuff out loud
1:02:11 but
1:02:13 Neil clearly says the word n with a
1:02:15 capital or a name with a capital N
1:02:19 okay I am gonna look around just to see
1:02:22 if like hey that book that he claims to
1:02:25 have inside that ring which would be
1:02:27 just sort of floating in midair on the
1:02:28 wall is that really there and where it
1:02:31 is because there's a huge chance that it
1:02:33 is or is that a fake out that we might
1:02:38 be able to grab somewhere else a role
1:02:39 perception plus alertness your
1:02:41 difficulty is nine I will be at div four
1:02:44 yep
1:02:47 that is for successes with four
1:02:50 successes uh you do see that there are
1:02:54 chunks of uh the Codex that are
1:02:57 scattered among those books but he does
1:03:00 in fact have the majority of it it is
1:03:03 real and it looks like he may have
1:03:05 gotten his hands on it because he knew
1:03:09 you were coming
1:03:11 hmm
1:03:13 Johnny do you remember
1:03:15 the the marking on my my hand
1:03:20 the one that can't came up and like it
1:03:24 was under my skin Rita
1:03:26 do not listen to this wispy shadowy
1:03:30 piece of [ __ ] you want to talk about
1:03:32 stuff let's do it after we're out of
1:03:34 here
1:03:35 and a nice safe place under the moon all
1:03:39 right
1:03:43 you or your dog
1:03:46 there is a reckoning coming when he says
1:03:49 that wind goes over and perches on
1:03:51 Johnny's shoulder Johnny's making a
1:03:53 frenzy check yeah boy
1:03:55 I'll spend the point of willpower now
1:03:56 I'm gonna call it base stiff seven uh so
1:03:58 that'll be that'll be six actually
1:04:00 because I've been passing down against
1:04:01 frenzy you're welcome rock it off that
1:04:04 wallpaper absolutely uh frenzying on a
1:04:07 bookshelf and an inverted gravity room
1:04:08 is probably not the best place to frenzy
1:04:10 yeah you guys probably don't watch
1:04:11 Johnny just walking into the circle no
1:04:12 probably not
1:04:16 one success oh yeah that was The
1:04:19 Willpower okay
1:04:22 yeah you see his his eyes kind of glaze
1:04:25 over and go white for a second and then
1:04:27 he kind of like his jaw sets and he
1:04:31 blinks a few times and he's with you
1:04:33 Johnny
1:04:35 but the jaw is drawing her in any way
1:04:39 and she will be chosen
1:04:42 and she will suffer
1:04:46 and all that you have done to show
1:04:49 local crashing back down upon her
1:04:55 when shifts back into her human form and
1:04:59 turns to the figure
1:05:01 you shut the [ __ ] up
1:05:04 if you're gonna come for someone you
1:05:06 come for me you leave them out of this
1:05:08 you are
1:05:10 you are I ain't afraid of [ __ ] but Joey
1:05:15 I feel like these discussions are
1:05:17 unproductive so let's just ignore him uh
1:05:21 win Johnny there's uh there's a few
1:05:23 pages and and some chunks of the Codex
1:05:25 over in that pile
1:05:27 um and Neil kind of like points them out
1:05:29 could you guys I I don't want Arabella
1:05:32 to get pissed on a technicality that we
1:05:34 didn't bring her the whole thing do you
1:05:36 mind and Neil kind of like directs them
1:05:38 to maybe go like hey go over there near
1:05:41 the other books Johnny kind of his chest
1:05:44 heaves like a unnecessary breath
1:05:49 something he doesn't he hasn't done in a
1:05:51 long time it's something he used to do a
1:05:53 lot but he takes kind of a a heavy sigh
1:05:57 nods grabs win by the back of the head
1:06:00 and kind of like touches uh foreheads
1:06:03 thanks win anytime buddy he'll turn uh
1:06:07 back how far is it down to the pile of
1:06:09 books like 20 feet you can probably oh
1:06:12 you you can maneuver around this room
1:06:14 pretty easily okay fantastic so he'll
1:06:16 jump down to go kind of start looking in
1:06:18 the books and try to just tune out this
1:06:21 voice win goes with Johnny
1:06:29 they know you are
1:06:32 and the moment you return to New Haven
1:06:36 they will be looking for you
1:06:38 there in your even now
1:06:41 searching through it
1:06:44 for the proof that they need
1:06:48 tear him upon your belongings
1:06:51 um
1:06:52 it the first thing
1:06:55 that truly gets to kneel is not even
1:06:59 like the premier note it's that like
1:07:01 they're wrecking your house and like
1:07:03 throwing all your stuff in a pile
1:07:05 a different file and like this whole
1:07:08 time Neil has been putting on this front
1:07:10 of like okay I'm the yoshibu here I know
1:07:13 how to deal with demons I do not know
1:07:15 how to deal with demons but I know how
1:07:16 to like I know what I'm doing and then
1:07:19 as soon as they as soon as he sidesteps
1:07:22 around the ishibu part and starts
1:07:24 talking to the mulcavian Neil just is
1:07:27 not okay suddenly
1:07:30 um and it's now like hesitates for the
1:07:32 first time
1:07:33 that will cause Britta to turn from the
1:07:36 focal point and look to kneel and
1:07:40 just kind of reach out and like touch
1:07:42 his wrists
1:07:46 every newspaper clipping right I'm kind
1:07:50 of struggling from Down Below in the
1:07:52 books uh Johnny starts humming dude dude
1:07:58 dude
1:08:03 and then start singing Moon Dance by Van
1:08:06 Morrison Well it's a glorious night for
1:08:09 and it's he's horribly off tune okay
1:08:12 Johnny absolutely cannot sing or carry a
1:08:15 tune but he just is just kind of
1:08:18 being as loud and obnoxious with singing
1:08:21 Moon dance as he possibly can wind joins
1:08:24 in it's not good so with the two of them
1:08:27 singing down there and then particularly
1:08:29 when Brenna takes his wrist Neil just
1:08:31 goes
1:08:32 having uh having a little bit of trouble
1:08:34 taking my own advice right now
1:08:36 um it's good advice
1:08:40 the room goes completely silent and
1:08:42 those who attempt to speak find
1:08:44 themselves unable to do so
1:08:46 mmm
1:08:47 smile
1:08:49 foreign
1:09:04 T his Vengeance against you
1:09:08 it is Marcos who suffers
1:09:12 Marcos who is possessed
1:09:15 and worn
1:09:18 it is Marcus
1:09:21 or you will lose
1:09:24 well nothing to do about that down smoke
1:09:26 monster so
1:09:28 once we figure out this whole error
1:09:30 codex thing
1:09:31 I'm sure
1:09:33 I can help you
1:09:35 and your help comes with an awful price
1:09:46 if you are as a student so I do not
1:09:49 request that
1:09:51 you need to bend the brass
1:09:55 and I will protect Marcus
1:09:57 and I will break the breeze
1:10:00 and I will break Roman
1:10:03 and I will undo your enemies
1:10:07 I mean you're pretty good there until
1:10:08 you've like really raised the scale
1:10:11 we're gonna figure out this codex and
1:10:13 we're probably not going to need your
1:10:15 help so I hope you enjoy the dusty
1:10:17 basement of this minor hell I will
1:10:20 remember that all right Neil
1:10:23 do you think that can uh can we talk oh
1:10:26 we can okay
1:10:28 Neil and Bretta isn't sure if the word
1:10:31 will come out
1:10:33 um but as she hears herself able to say
1:10:35 his name
1:10:37 do you think the tramir up there
1:10:41 know that he's down here yeah I think
1:10:44 we're a little bit past subtlety at this
1:10:46 point if they can hear us it doesn't
1:10:48 really matter
1:10:49 um well but do you think that they knew
1:10:52 do you think that they wanted
1:10:54 I think there is completely a reason
1:10:56 that they did not just come get this
1:10:58 themselves considering nothing
1:11:01 that we have encountered except for this
1:11:04 has been something they couldn't have
1:11:06 just walked straight past but if they
1:11:08 knew that he was here do you think they
1:11:10 wanted him
1:11:12 out
1:11:14 um
1:11:15 they are
1:11:17 super green
1:11:18 they're like Arabella both of them
1:11:21 they've made packs with demons already
1:11:24 so
1:11:27 here we are I'm pretty sure they're
1:11:32 they're just gonna pull a um
1:11:34 pull Last Crusade on us
1:11:36 as soon as we get out of here
1:11:39 um I don't think any of us are intended
1:11:40 to walk back out
1:11:42 uh but I don't know that for a fact
1:11:44 so let's not you know do the get the
1:11:46 jump on them thing because
1:11:49 I don't know but I
1:11:53 one problem at a time just to clarify
1:11:56 the smoke monster is a bad deal right
1:11:57 yes yeah don't make packs with demons
1:12:00 that's
1:12:01 or doing as much as you as much as you
1:12:03 really really want to Miles yeah
1:12:05 one Neil answers that is not what he
1:12:08 says oh you hear something different and
1:12:11 when Neil calls out to you he says it is
1:12:13 dangerous you would have to be careful
1:12:15 and you would have to be very very good
1:12:18 at what you do oh boy okay for those
1:12:22 listening at home the expression that
1:12:24 Tim just made uh there's a break crying
1:12:27 on his face and he just looked away from
1:12:29 the microphone no
1:12:31 oh no he's gonna touch the butt look
1:12:37 look it's been well established the
1:12:39 stick never works on me but the camera
1:12:45 oh no infernal Venture what is wait do
1:12:51 we hear that or do we hear what he said
1:12:52 you hear what Neil said okay as all this
1:12:55 has been going on
1:12:57 um Neil thinking he has answered
1:12:58 properly
1:13:00 I have been looking to think is there a
1:13:02 way that I'm aware of through my occult
1:13:05 knowledge through my general perceptions
1:13:07 to get that book out of the circle
1:13:09 without either letting it go or just
1:13:14 walking in there which is also equally
1:13:15 bad
1:13:16 you have to trick it yeah it's afraid of
1:13:19 that without uh the proper training to
1:13:23 specifically handle something like this
1:13:25 which I do not have right if it gets
1:13:27 pretty dicey I mean the easy way is
1:13:30 obviously to just you know broker a deal
1:13:32 but that's a problem sort of it depends
1:13:35 on what the deal is yeah
1:13:37 how big are the pieces that we have
1:13:39 are they enough to make up for what we
1:13:42 have no already down below in the most
1:13:45 amidst the pile of books
1:13:47 um we were silenced do we still hear
1:13:51 what we're doing down here and we're
1:13:52 just kind of like uh unable to hear the
1:13:54 rest of the room or like can we we've
1:13:56 actually like been muted you guys hear
1:13:59 each other okay okay
1:14:01 but so that he kind of isolated our
1:14:04 portion of the room while he spoke to
1:14:06 everyone else or the thing did
1:14:08 yeah it basically it separated the sound
1:14:12 between the group of you and Miles
1:14:14 understood so my response to Nia would
1:14:17 be very good in which way Neil responds
1:14:21 I'm sure that you would need to be clear
1:14:23 about what the arrangement is because it
1:14:26 cannot break a deal
1:14:28 oh my God
1:14:31 I was an 80s power broker
1:14:34 I have I've worked with rock star
1:14:38 primadonna's before
1:14:41 I was so busy being an 80s guy I forgot
1:14:43 to cure my demonitis
1:14:47 okay now Neil talk to me what do we need
1:14:50 to do here
1:14:52 do we even know that it's the real thing
1:14:54 I'm thinking it's the real thing it is
1:14:55 it is completely the real thing he's got
1:14:57 it
1:14:59 he's got it
1:15:00 we cannot go inside the circle we cannot
1:15:04 break the circle
1:15:05 what happens if we break the circle it
1:15:07 gets out which is worse than one of us
1:15:10 going in which is also bad
1:15:13 so the way to I'm thinking I'm thinking
1:15:15 Neil is trying very hard not to say the
1:15:17 words let's just trick it out loud in
1:15:20 front of it
1:15:21 you know because he's not that'll make
1:15:22 it a little more difficult a complete
1:15:23 [ __ ]
1:15:25 okay uh can you
1:15:28 give me some ideas of some of the things
1:15:29 I want to take off the table here calls
1:15:32 out if all of the quotery ends up
1:15:35 agreeing to eat it Neil basically
1:15:38 explains that like it would risk the
1:15:40 deal becoming way too complicated and
1:15:43 allowing it to slip things in so
1:15:45 Simplicity is key
1:15:48 Johnny pulls out of Morley pops into his
1:15:50 mouth and uh lights it up while he's uh
1:15:53 fumbling through the rotten pile of
1:15:55 books
1:15:56 and Neil why don't you have one of your
1:15:58 uh smokes that usually helps clear your
1:15:59 head hmm
1:16:04 to get back up to where Neil and Britta
1:16:06 are would we have to climb the bookshelf
1:16:08 yeah but it's not super difficult okay
1:16:11 there's enough debris that you could
1:16:13 probably work with him
1:16:15 Neil uh takes out one of those like
1:16:20 shitty clothes that had been in his
1:16:23 pocket since Baghdad
1:16:25 and does doesn't like light it just kind
1:16:27 of puts in his mouth and just sort of
1:16:29 like plays with it with his tongue like
1:16:31 he's thinking
1:16:32 Julia's not holding in his mouth like a
1:16:34 cigarette smoker and it just sort of
1:16:36 rolls and thinks
1:16:38 wind climbs the bookshelf how much
1:16:42 is one night
1:16:45 worth
1:16:47 to you
1:16:50 the remainder of this night
1:16:53 which is Neil looks at like a watch and
1:16:55 he's got what probably like six hours at
1:16:58 this point it like tells you down to the
1:17:00 second how much time remains seemingly
1:17:03 like very intimately familiar with the
1:17:05 process of time
1:17:07 one night
1:17:10 of
1:17:11 I don't know if this is something Neil
1:17:13 would know or not feel free to say no uh
1:17:17 if one were to allow an entity like this
1:17:20 to possess you after the time is up
1:17:22 would it then return to the like the
1:17:25 circle or like once it's out can it just
1:17:26 be like haha and like [ __ ] off
1:17:29 So within the terms of the contract
1:17:32 if you make an agreement it will
1:17:34 probably stick to the agreement
1:17:36 if you just let it out
1:17:39 it is going to do whatever the [ __ ] it
1:17:41 wants but if it agrees to terms if it's
1:17:44 like it is not outside the bound because
1:17:46 this is sort of like stretching the
1:17:47 bounds of what Neil knows I'm fully
1:17:48 aware of that but in concept from Neil's
1:17:52 understanding of like all his no they
1:17:54 keep their promises they keep their
1:17:55 promises so if I were to say something
1:17:57 like yo you get full free reign for the
1:18:01 next six hours
1:18:03 inside my body and then afterward you
1:18:07 know in exchange for the book and then
1:18:08 after that time whatever you do with
1:18:11 that time
1:18:12 you go back to the circle
1:18:14 that is like you you you you return to
1:18:17 being bound within this circle yeah that
1:18:19 is something that as far as Neil is
1:18:21 aware is something that could happen yep
1:18:23 up on the bookshelf when kind of looks
1:18:26 at Neil for a minute trying to figure
1:18:28 out how to express something without
1:18:29 actually saying it out loud
1:18:33 um
1:18:33 and is visibly thinking at you you can
1:18:37 see the think race
1:18:39 um and she kind of grabs his forehead
1:18:41 and kisses it
1:18:43 and like puts her forehead against his
1:18:46 weird
1:18:51 [Music]
1:18:53 Miles trying to figure out with Neil
1:18:57 what the smoke monster may like
1:18:59 or may want
1:19:01 do we hear miles's responses uh no he's
1:19:05 just chilling up there waiting yeah he
1:19:06 mouthed off to the demon and that was
1:19:08 the end of it sounds about right yep now
1:19:11 is he taking for a ride of course
1:19:15 uh Neil calls out to you yep
1:19:18 and he goes
1:19:20 um so the main thing that it will
1:19:23 probably want is some sort of human host
1:19:26 something that can ride for a while but
1:19:29 whatever this is it's so powerful that
1:19:31 its presence can only be temporary
1:19:32 anyways yes you're kind of looking down
1:19:34 and you kind of see Britta like go rigid
1:19:39 nervous as like the group of them you
1:19:42 just hear them arguing and arguing and

1:21:17 see you next time Kendrick
1:21:19 [Music]
1:21:26 suplex is a maneuver that you do if you
1:21:28 grapple like a dude like Neil like I'm
1:21:31 not losing this you cannot get away from
1:21:33 me I'm just gonna throw you around
1:21:34 because it's fun I'm pretty sure they
1:21:35 could you can sue city [ __ ]
1:21:38 it's a cartoon where
1:21:39 you pick color just slam
1:21:42 I mean that's the next maneuver Johnny
1:21:45 has to do is choke slam somebody
1:21:47 nah it's 1999 he's a stone cold stunner
1:21:51 okay what is that again the stone cold
1:21:53 stunner that's where you grab them by
1:21:55 like the head and you like okay drop
1:21:57 down and you like smash their face into
1:21:59 your shoulder it's not that not it is
1:22:02 not effective at all but it is very
1:22:04 19.99 and it looks cool
1:22:06 what's the Undertaker one oh or
1:22:09 Tombstone
1:22:11 for safety actually he's the only one
1:22:14 allowed to is he still alive everyone
1:22:16 else was no longer allowed to Tombstone
1:22:18 but because of his height he can
1:22:20 actually pretty safely do it so you'll
1:22:22 just let him do it but there was a while
1:22:24 where it was like are you almost six two
1:22:26 I doomed someone oh you have a
1:22:28 concussion you almost died well see you
1:22:30 next month what is Tombstone uh you
1:22:32 basically grabbed someone you flip them
1:22:34 upside down so that their chest is
1:22:37 against like your stomach and your whole
1:22:39 and you hold their head between your
1:22:41 knees and then you simply all you're
1:22:44 doing is actually dropping to your knees
1:22:45 and letting go of them and they fall and
1:22:47 it looks very dramatic the problem
1:22:49 hitting there is if they're not tall
1:22:51 enough
1:22:53 the way you're holding their head
1:22:55 between your knees can actually kind of
1:22:57 cause them to slam their head hit the
1:23:00 table or the the mat with the top of
1:23:02 their head and actually perform the
1:23:04 moves yeah yeah and the thing about it
1:23:08 is you know being slammed down and
1:23:10 weighing like you know 250 pounds
1:23:12 yourself straight onto the top of your
1:23:13 skull is like it's real bad for your
1:23:15 spine it's actually kind of dumb it
1:23:18 turns out not a deal bad times
1:23:20 that's why I like all of the best uh
1:23:22 wrestling moves are the ones that have
1:23:24 no shot of like actually hurting someone
1:23:25 yeah because then they can spam it they
1:23:27 can be dramatic they can like like the
1:23:30 Rock Bottom is not it's like a like I
1:23:33 was gonna say I'd rather Rock Bottom
1:23:34 yeah oh yeah okay
1:23:38 black bottom rock bottom rock bottom
1:23:42 Johnny slowly pulls up his sunglasses
1:23:44 and tosses them to the side I mean that
1:23:46 has to happen at some point man it makes
1:23:48 a lot of sense that Johnny would be the
1:23:49 most electrified podcast entertainment
1:23:52 yo we're going back to New York at some
1:23:55 point we gotta pass by Stanford right
1:23:57 now
1:23:58 oh it's yeah but you don't meet those
1:24:00 wrestlers if you go there did you think
1:24:02 I was gonna let you message
1:24:03 do you think I was gonna let you mess
1:24:05 with my Coterie well it doesn't matter
1:24:08 which is what a crazy Journey Johnny
1:24:11 trying out gimmicks just looking in the
1:24:14 mirror fresh out the shower slicking his
1:24:17 hair back they call me Huntress
1:24:20 [Laughter]
1:24:38 and that she practices it just just my
1:24:42 favorite
1:24:43 I love banter characters but I I do have
1:24:46 a soft spot for deliberate like like
1:24:49 purposely written I wanted to be
1:24:51 adventurer
