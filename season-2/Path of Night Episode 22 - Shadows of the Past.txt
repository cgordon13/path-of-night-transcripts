0:00:00 path of night is an actual play vampire
0:00:02 the masquerade podcast set in the
0:00:03 classic world of darkness we're all
0:00:06 friends we're here to have fun but our
0:00:07 story can include graphic violence drug
0:00:10 use sexual content and other mature
0:00:12 themes we've talked at our table about
0:00:14 safety comfort and consent both as
0:00:16 players and storytellers
0:00:18 we know what to expect we're all excited
0:00:20 to be here and we want you to feel the
0:00:21 same so listener discretion is advised
0:00:24 now let's walk the path of night
0:00:31 after several long nights alone miles
0:00:34 johnny nguyen and bretta reconvened at
0:00:36 the jewelry savings
0:00:38 they discussed the troubles they faced
0:00:39 and the domain's future clearly told the
0:00:41 quarterly about her encounter with vito
0:00:43 zantosa and the ghost of romeo wynn
0:00:46 explained about the fresh horrors of the
0:00:48 shadowlands and miles his new position
0:00:50 as sheriff had left a rift between him
0:00:53 and johnny as the burjab bristled
0:00:54 against this light to his mentor
0:00:56 weathers as brett and miles deal with
0:00:58 the problem of detective suarez johnny
0:01:01 and nguyen take a drive to have an
0:01:03 uncomfortable conversation with the
0:01:04 former bruja sheriff
0:01:09 [Music]
0:01:11 johnny and wynn the two of you get ready
0:01:13 to head out meet with weathers and have
0:01:16 a conversation about the future and his
0:01:18 place in it who's driving johnny is that
0:01:20 you yeah absolutely it should be johnny
0:01:22 what are you driving johnny's got an old
0:01:24 pickup truck just some beat up old thing
0:01:28 single cab maybe a little bit of a space
0:01:30 in back for a few items but it's one of
0:01:33 one of the vehicles that he often gets
0:01:34 assigned to him doing work for the
0:01:36 domain i don't think johnny actually
0:01:38 owns a personal vehicle he kind of just
0:01:41 gets different things for different days
0:01:44 so johnny have you cooled off a little
0:01:46 bit he gives a sideways glance at you
0:01:49 for just a second before eyes going back
0:01:51 to the road
0:01:52 yeah i'm cool as uh
0:01:55 cool as can be when why because you got
0:01:58 into it with miles and you usually don't
0:02:00 get into it you defended miles from me
0:02:03 and this time i had to do it for you
0:02:06 and normally that's not the case
0:02:08 so it takes a lot to push that button
0:02:11 for you you don't think the past few
0:02:13 weeks have been a lot i do think the
0:02:15 last few weeks have been a lot because
0:02:16 this domain doesn't look anything like
0:02:18 it used to
0:02:19 no
0:02:20 it doesn't so what's your point my point
0:02:23 is i need you to be okay if we're going
0:02:25 to go and try to talk sense into bru
0:02:27 into weathers
0:02:29 johnny uh
0:02:30 grabs his pack of cigarettes pulls out
0:02:32 of morley and pops it into his mouth
0:02:35 flips open his his zippo and lights it
0:02:38 up puts the uh the zippo back away
0:02:42 i don't even know what the hell weather
0:02:44 is gonna say i don't i don't even know
0:02:45 what miles wants me to get out of
0:02:47 weathers
0:02:48 honestly i think if you can get him to
0:02:50 stay however begrudgingly i think that's
0:02:52 all miles expects and what if what if
0:02:54 weathers gives me an offer for some
0:02:56 place better than than uh than new haven
0:02:59 i i can't give you that answer donnie
0:03:01 that's
0:03:02 that's on you i have all the reasons in
0:03:05 the world to leave johnny pops a morley
0:03:07 into his mouth
0:03:09 snaps open his zippo
0:03:10 lights it
0:03:12 snaps it and puts it back into his
0:03:13 pocket
0:03:15 look
0:03:16 the domain has changed
0:03:19 all of the
0:03:21 the [ __ ] is being dumped right on
0:03:24 our heads
0:03:25 and it feels like miles is part of the
0:03:27 wheelbarrow doing the dumping now
0:03:30 that's never been the case but it's all
0:03:32 different now yeah is he my boss now no
0:03:36 i really might has miles ever been our
0:03:38 boss yeah but he wasn't the sheriff
0:03:40 before now he is does that matter to you
0:03:43 i have been working for the sheriff's
0:03:46 office of this domain so what how what
0:03:48 what is that how does that change things
0:03:50 here and apparently the sheriff the
0:03:52 sheriff's office isn't even a an actual
0:03:55 thing anymore it's it's just apparently
0:03:58 Reiss's bag agency because orders from
0:04:01 Reiss are coming directly through miles
0:04:03 now do you trust miles
0:04:05 right now
0:04:06 generally speaking have do you trust
0:04:08 miles
0:04:09 has he done
0:04:11 done us dirty before
0:04:13 no but things change when
0:04:15 you're talking to someone who knows that
0:04:17 really well johnny
0:04:18 you're talking to someone who's the last
0:04:20 one in the domain
0:04:23 yeah
0:04:24 i know how fast things change
0:04:27 and i know how shitty it must feel right
0:04:29 now
0:04:31 i don't know there's
0:04:32 there's other brew ha i guess but i
0:04:34 think you're the last good one
0:04:36 maybe
0:04:38 so
0:04:39 i'm gonna stay
0:04:41 i would love if you stayed
0:04:43 because i don't want to be the last line
0:04:45 of defense
0:04:46 between brita and between miles
0:04:50 i want someone standing beside me
0:04:52 so if weathers makes you an offer you
0:04:54 feel like you can't refuse who the [ __ ]
0:04:56 am i to say don't take it but
0:05:00 i'm really hoping that you have better
0:05:02 incentives to stay
0:05:04 because i have to go be in boston at
0:05:06 some point
0:05:07 and i don't want to leave these guys
0:05:09 undefended i'll keep that into
0:05:10 consideration when but
0:05:12 why why are you planning to go to boston
0:05:14 i know you said mentioned that some with
0:05:16 the giovanni there's something wrong
0:05:18 with the shadowlands
0:05:19 okay you're gonna have to give me a
0:05:21 little bit more than that because
0:05:23 it doesn't mean much to me
0:05:24 so tell me exactly what you mean by
0:05:27 something's wrong with the shadow lands
0:05:29 because that means very little to me all
0:05:31 right so
0:05:32 there are things in this world called
0:05:34 wraiths rays are the spirits of people
0:05:36 who have died and can't move on
0:05:38 basically ghosts ghosts okay it's a way
0:05:41 of looking at it i'm with you so far
0:05:42 okay something is wrong with the place
0:05:46 they call home and i use that term very
0:05:48 loosely because the shadow lands is
0:05:51 life as a wraith
0:05:52 so to speak
0:05:53 is
0:05:55 hard the only way to make new things
0:05:58 as a wraith
0:06:00 is to use other wraiths as the material
0:06:02 so it'd be like if i walked up to you
0:06:04 and skinned you and used your skin to
0:06:06 make a coat
0:06:07 so raves already don't have a whole lot
0:06:09 going for them
0:06:10 and what i saw in the holy land was that
0:06:13 the i'm sorry what's the holy land the
0:06:15 old abandoned amusement park in
0:06:17 waterbury or something oh
0:06:20 yeah yeah it um
0:06:22 what were you doing out there there's a
0:06:24 wraith i know who told me that there was
0:06:26 something honky going on there hinky not
0:06:28 honky
0:06:30 okay
0:06:32 um
0:06:33 and you can trust this race oh no he's
0:06:35 not trustworthy that's why i went out to
0:06:37 see what was going on and what i saw was
0:06:39 wraiths getting called back to their
0:06:40 bodies
0:06:42 and the bodies reanimating but they
0:06:44 weren't really there
0:06:45 zombies night of the living dead sort of
0:06:48 zombies the hell yeah
0:06:50 and then i talked to raven about what i
0:06:52 saw
0:06:53 and she said that that tracks with
0:06:55 something that's been going on in boston
0:06:57 that the giovanni are
0:06:59 looking into
0:07:00 giovanni are necromancers
0:07:03 i'm a medium
0:07:04 i can see what's going on there i can't
0:07:07 use magic to impact it or anything like
0:07:09 that but i can see what's going on and i
0:07:11 know what
0:07:12 how to interact with the ghosts
0:07:15 so if boston's a city full of
0:07:18 necromantic
0:07:20 vampires
0:07:21 and you're a medium
0:07:23 are you sure that it's a good idea to go
0:07:25 up there trying to ask them why they're
0:07:27 zombies in waterbury as the two of you
0:07:30 discuss you
0:07:32 head down the road uh right on dixwell
0:07:36 and
0:07:38 you can see what looks like
0:07:41 people fleeing
0:07:43 from a dunkin donuts the sign out front
0:07:46 it's still
0:07:47 you know shining with that pink light
0:07:50 but inside it's totally dark
0:07:52 the hell is that that looks like a
0:07:54 masquerade breech to me all right
0:07:57 johnny uh pulls the truck over onto the
0:08:00 sidewalk and puts it in the park and
0:08:02 kills the the uh the headlights and just
0:08:04 kind of stares at what's going on trying
0:08:06 to see if he can see anything to give
0:08:08 him any kind of indication about what's
0:08:10 causing the commotion it's it's like
0:08:12 when you look in the window
0:08:13 even knowing that on the other side is a
0:08:16 window that you should be able to see
0:08:17 out of it's just
0:08:19 dark uh when does a quick look around
0:08:22 she's looking to see if anyone is paying
0:08:24 any attention to the truck itself it
0:08:26 looks like everyone who is aware of
0:08:28 what's going on has already started to
0:08:30 flee and this place has already kind of
0:08:32 abandoned wynn cups her hands around her
0:08:35 eyes and activates her uh gangrel eyes
0:08:39 okay uh and tries to see through the
0:08:41 darkness it does not help as much as it
0:08:43 normally would
0:08:45 what you see is like this murky black
0:08:48 inky cloud that obscures all objects
0:08:52 that are inside what do you see nothing
0:08:55 nothing nothing
0:08:56 like you don't see anything in there i
0:08:59 see more darkness johnny uh narrows his
0:09:02 eyes uh and reaches around back into the
0:09:05 cross uh the little storage space and uh
0:09:08 pulls out a bag
0:09:10 in which he pulls out a uh ceramic
0:09:13 barreled shotgun
0:09:15 that's still got the uh
0:09:17 dragon's breath rounds he he cracks it
0:09:19 and takes a look inside
0:09:21 yep snaps it shut
0:09:23 all right let's fix this [ __ ] when
0:09:25 if you don't see anything in there and
0:09:27 it's l looks is just inky
0:09:30 i think that's what they call
0:09:31 obteneration
0:09:33 it's uh
0:09:35 it's something that sabbat can summon
0:09:37 it's it's like living darkness how does
0:09:40 living darkness hold up to
0:09:42 a flare well
0:09:44 it doesn't much like light
0:09:46 and anything that's not the sun
0:09:49 is just devoured
0:09:51 nothing pierces through this
0:09:53 nothing
0:10:01 so what's our plan
0:10:03 just i open the door and you start
0:10:04 firing johnny uh
0:10:06 takes his cigarette and throws it out
0:10:08 the window and licks his lips i have no
0:10:10 idea do you have another one of those by
0:10:12 chance
0:10:13 johnny looks down and and uh
0:10:16 looks over at win
0:10:18 no but tell you what you take this one
0:10:20 he uh he reaches around and pulls out
0:10:23 the uh the matte black axe
0:10:25 all right if i drop this one
0:10:27 i'm sorry
0:10:29 we'll tell miles i did it
0:10:31 he's already pissed at me
0:10:33 cross that bridge when we come to it man
0:10:35 so the two of you pull in
0:10:37 right up to buy that dunkin donuts and
0:10:39 again
0:10:41 there's no light coming from within
0:10:43 you can kind of get the light from like
0:10:45 the truck as the doors pop open
0:10:47 and the two of you step out
0:10:50 what are you planning to do
0:10:52 my plan is to
0:10:55 open the door and
0:10:56 fire
0:10:57 because if i can't see them hopefully
0:10:59 they can't see me
0:11:01 and if they can maybe they'll come out
0:11:04 of this shroud
0:11:05 and johnny what are you going to do
0:11:08 when
0:11:09 we'll stay in the truck
0:11:12 going into that shroud
0:11:14 is a death sentence
0:11:16 we gotta see if if we can get any of
0:11:18 them out of there
0:11:19 how would you feel about wrecking the
0:11:21 truck
0:11:22 i'd rather have a way of getting out of
0:11:24 here if things get real bad
0:11:25 okay
0:11:26 this pack keeps a lot of city Gangrel
0:11:29 around
0:11:30 and if it was if it was maybe eat if it
0:11:32 maybe if it's even odds i might not feel
0:11:34 bad about possibly getting into a fight
0:11:36 but if we're outnumbered two to one
0:11:38 three to one i'd rather just put my my
0:11:40 pedal in the metal and get out of here
0:11:42 okay then you take the gun hold on to it
0:11:44 for the moment
0:11:47 johnny's gonna lean out of the window
0:11:49 and just call at the uh the duncan
0:11:54 anybody in there want to talk
0:11:57 you call out and
0:11:59 for a long
0:12:02 moment
0:12:03 there's just this
0:12:05 silence maybe nothing hurt you
0:12:08 and then
0:12:10 you hear this creak under the truck
0:12:14 and it shifts slightly jostling the two
0:12:17 of you
0:12:18 and i need an initiative rule
0:12:21 [Laughter]
0:12:23 all right
0:12:26 i wish it was possible to truly capture
0:12:29 on audio how tense these like moments of
0:12:31 silence before [ __ ] happens are
0:12:35 i may have just saved our lives we'll
0:12:36 see
0:12:37 i definitely didn't
0:12:40 johnny what's your initiative 21. hell
0:12:42 yeah i think you win what's your
0:12:44 initiative
0:12:45 10.
0:12:46 johnny you are completely certain that
0:12:48 there's something underneath the truck
0:12:50 and you feel this like
0:12:53 jostling and shaking underneath the
0:12:55 vehicle what do you do i throw the uh
0:12:58 the truck uh into drive and i peel out
0:13:01 uh just crushing whatever's underneath
0:13:03 the truck
0:13:04 let's say your
0:13:07 truck has we'll say strength eight going
0:13:10 straight we'll say your truck has
0:13:11 strength eight going to pull out
0:13:13 so you're gonna roll your dice and the
0:13:15 things you're attempting to escape we'll
0:13:17 roll for its dice and i get to add my my
0:13:20 drive plus strength
0:13:22 yes
0:13:25 difficulty uh the difficulty of your
0:13:27 roll is six
0:13:29 that is six successes okay nice i've got
0:13:32 a set of rules because they are working
0:13:34 in unison gross very grass
0:13:44 they have 12 successes
0:13:46 as they tear the axles
0:13:50 clean off the truck
0:13:52 it's turned over on its side and you can
0:13:54 see the long black tendrils made of pure
0:13:56 darkness
0:13:58 starting to pull the truck apart
0:14:02 their turn
0:14:04 there are eight tentacles in all
0:14:06 four of them are going to just lash out
0:14:08 at each of you weren't there action to
0:14:10 pull my truck apart
0:14:12 no that was them starting combat in your
0:14:14 attempt to get out gotcha
0:14:18 when they have six successes to hit you
0:14:21 okay
0:14:23 that's way too many dies buddy uh seven
0:14:26 levels of lethal damage are coming at
0:14:27 you i need you to roll soak
0:14:30 am i down two levels of stamina
0:14:32 yes you are okay uh no you're not in a
0:14:35 shot of night okay cool so i imagine you
0:14:37 can see how that kind of stacks
0:14:40 [Music]
0:14:43 five successes you will take two levels
0:14:45 of lethal image i just need a
0:14:46 self-control check
0:14:49 one success
0:14:50 you maintain control of yourself as your
0:14:53 beast rattles within its cage
0:14:56 and you are lashed uh some of your flesh
0:14:58 is kind of torn open by this like
0:15:00 very sharp tentacle meat of pure
0:15:03 darkness [ __ ]
0:15:06 uh johnny you're missed all right a bit
0:15:08 of luck
0:15:10 those are the two that are like have
0:15:11 reach of you
0:15:13 what we're gonna do now is go to wins
0:15:15 action
0:15:16 when
0:15:17 kind of forgets about the shotgun and
0:15:19 goes on instinct since she was pretty
0:15:21 close to having her beast take control
0:15:24 and she pops
0:15:26 her claws which are now
0:15:28 much longer and kind of
0:15:31 gross looking uh they're not just long
0:15:33 fingernails like they used to be these
0:15:35 are
0:15:36 these are killing talons they call the
0:15:38 hawk talons of an eagle yeah they're
0:15:40 they're no good and she swipes
0:15:43 at the thing in front of her okay uh
0:15:46 give me your attacker on the appendage
0:15:50 three successes
0:15:52 to carry over into damage
0:15:56 five successes
0:15:59 with
0:16:00 five successes
0:16:02 uh you shred and destroy the first of
0:16:05 the tentacles
0:16:06 johnny this is the top of the round now
0:16:09 yep
0:16:10 i'm gonna spend three blood for extra
0:16:12 actions
0:16:12 so how many tentacles do i see
0:16:15 a rather better question i'm ejected
0:16:17 from the truck right yes and how many
0:16:19 tentacles do i see still pulling it
0:16:21 apart seven
0:16:24 firing a shotgun into the uh into the
0:16:27 darkness of the dunk donuts is like
0:16:30 throwing a a dart
0:16:32 in the in the in the black right right
0:16:35 and if they're obfuscated you're
0:16:36 automatically going to miss right
0:16:38 yeah i'm trying i'm trying to think of
0:16:40 the what i could do with the most
0:16:41 destruction with at the moment yes
0:16:43 is that johnny way of life
0:16:45 all right so what's the most destruction
0:16:47 i can cause with a single die roll all
0:16:49 right i think what i want to do is i
0:16:51 want to split my action
0:16:53 i think i want to grab up the shotgun
0:16:56 that that wind ditched and
0:16:59 try and grab the explosive half of the
0:17:01 truck
0:17:02 and throw it into through the uh the
0:17:05 plate glass of the of the dunkin donuts
0:17:07 so it's gonna take one action to draw
0:17:08 the gun
0:17:10 one action to chuck the tank one action
0:17:13 to shoot the tank this is a three action
0:17:16 job you can split i can split up the
0:17:18 three times right yep you also have all
0:17:21 your extra actions yeah but i i want to
0:17:23 keep who wants to say i want to save
0:17:24 those for dodging things and potentially
0:17:26 killing things that come out after me
0:17:28 yeah you basically want to take your
0:17:30 decks plus firearms and divided by three
0:17:32 because to be perfectly honest it's not
0:17:33 the uh it's not the tentacles i'm
0:17:35 worried about that's worrisome but
0:17:38 definitely not the act like those are
0:17:40 minions the do you need me to make a
0:17:42 strength check for the uh for throwing
0:17:44 or anything like that i assume i can
0:17:45 grab the shotgun without a problem
0:17:47 actually if you're not throwing it at
0:17:49 someone if there's no target you can
0:17:51 just chuck okay perfect you're plenty
0:17:53 strong enough um then i'm gonna spend a
0:17:54 willpower on this on this firearms
0:17:56 attack
0:17:58 because i only have two dice
0:18:02 then we're looking at three successes
0:18:04 the tank smashes through the window oh
0:18:06 well i mean the tank part of an axle and
0:18:08 like that's
0:18:11 uh well we'll get there
0:18:14 smashes through and then you fill the
0:18:16 area where the dragon's breath round and
0:18:19 the tank goes the tank does not actually
0:18:21 explode
0:18:22 instead uh
0:18:25 accelerant sprays all over a portion of
0:18:27 the dunkin donuts
0:18:29 which immediately goes up a massive
0:18:32 amount of smoke starts billowing out of
0:18:33 the broken window and the entire
0:18:37 area
0:18:38 goes up in flames
0:18:40 with that said i need a raw track check
0:18:43 from all vampires present so i'm going
0:18:45 to need to make four rolls myself and
0:18:46 then you guys are your boy uh courage
0:18:49 yep
0:18:51 difficulty
0:18:53 uh
0:18:54 seven
0:18:56 pens do not explode on that right no but
0:18:58 they do two successes all right i'm
0:19:01 gonna spend a willpower on this okay
0:19:04 vampires so at odds with my normal stuff
0:19:07 uh two successes succeed
0:19:11 very much succeed
0:19:14 so johnny uh at the moment after he
0:19:17 lights the dunkin donuts on fire i tried
0:19:19 to be civil but i guess we can do this
0:19:21 the hard way
0:19:25 what screeches and flutters like bats
0:19:29 are these wisps of darkness that come
0:19:31 from inside the dunkin donuts
0:19:34 they smother the flames
0:19:36 they come out and pop the street lights
0:19:38 around the area
0:19:40 and a whole section of the street
0:19:42 all light is snuffed out the fire is
0:19:46 gone when your turn
0:19:49 are there more tentacles
0:19:51 seven of them all right
0:19:53 i'm gonna slash at one of them
0:19:57 oh that's a lot of ones
0:20:00 no successes
0:20:02 when
0:20:03 there's a group of tentacles that are
0:20:05 going to attempt to initiate a grapple
0:20:07 with you okay
0:20:09 okay the first one has you uh once the
0:20:12 first one has you the rest start
0:20:13 latching on
0:20:15 and johnny you start seeing wind being
0:20:18 pulled into a mass of writhing tentacles
0:20:20 made of pure darkness
0:20:23 when is attempting to bite them futilely
0:20:25 but yeah the more she thrashes the worse
0:20:28 it seems to get
0:20:30 and johnny it's your turn well i have
0:20:33 three celebrity actions and whoever is
0:20:36 conducting these are staying safely
0:20:38 within their shroud right you're not
0:20:40 sure whether could i wrench win out of
0:20:43 the grasp of the tentacles there will be
0:20:45 a contested strength roll against all of
0:20:46 them we'll strengthen a sprawl
0:20:51 i want to get out of here
0:20:53 all right let's go
0:20:55 get it johnny
0:20:56 johnny runs over to where wynn is under
0:20:59 the pile of tentacles and just reaches
0:21:01 down a meaty arm
0:21:02 until he finds something solid and tries
0:21:05 to pull her loose
0:21:08 so i'm gonna spend uh blood for potence
0:21:11 and i'm gonna spend a willpower
0:21:15 uh 11 successes plus
0:21:18 four points of potence so 15 successes
0:21:21 15 successes
0:21:25 i'm gonna dislocate something but i'm on
0:21:27 board
0:21:28 you may not get all for this rate but
0:21:30 you're definitely going to get the
0:21:31 lion's share
0:21:35 look if i lose a shoe that's fine
0:21:36 they've they've lived together two dice
0:21:39 miles might even prefer if one loses a
0:21:41 shoe
0:21:42 yep uh i'm just rolling for all of them
0:21:46 at once it's going to be uh one main
0:21:48 dice pool and then just plus one for
0:21:49 every helper absolutely
0:21:51 rather than i'm assuming that you're
0:21:53 gonna go against all of them yeah
0:21:57 three successes
0:21:59 you rest her free up onto your shoulder
0:22:02 like fireman's style and then i use two
0:22:04 celebrity actions to get the [ __ ] out
0:22:07 the tentacles writhe reaching for her
0:22:10 and uh but they only have a six four
0:22:11 each so uh you back out pretty quickly
0:22:14 when flashes a couple middle fingers
0:22:16 with giant claws as they run away as
0:22:19 you're flashing your middle fingers and
0:22:21 johnny runs away there are two people
0:22:24 on the roof of the dunkin donuts staring
0:22:28 at you one of them is this guy with like
0:22:31 a thick beard
0:22:33 and like this high and tight
0:22:35 kind of clad in like late 90s early yeah
0:22:39 like late 90s attack gear
0:22:42 he's got this like
0:22:44 meaty like bulk to him he's not like
0:22:47 insanely tall but the guy like
0:22:49 looks like he weighs 250 pounds easy and
0:22:52 the other one is a spanish woman with
0:22:56 curly hair with a cutlass on her hip and
0:22:59 the two of them together watch you go as
0:23:02 if analyzing your every move
0:23:05 i'm not trying to get off of his
0:23:06 shoulder i'm not trying to stop all
0:23:09 right the two of you make it away
0:23:18 you journey down dixville avenue and it
0:23:20 definitely seems that you've gotten away
0:23:22 from the heat if you're being stalked
0:23:24 there's no sign that it's happening
0:23:27 johnny you can put me down now no i
0:23:28 don't think i can
0:23:30 johnny take a breath trust me for a
0:23:32 second on this win we gotta get real far
0:23:34 away from here all right i trust you man
0:23:37 johnny
0:23:39 you're a whisper from nowhere
0:23:41 all of a sudden he stops abruptly and uh
0:23:45 looks down at what he's got for weapons
0:23:47 and realizes he probably dropped the
0:23:49 shotgun and left it back there so he
0:23:51 grabs the matte black axe and a two hand
0:23:54 and kind of looks around nervously did
0:23:56 you hear that
0:23:57 you hear what sounds like the distant
0:24:00 laugh of a hyena
0:24:02 but you're certain that it's much closer
0:24:05 johnny you were immediately given
0:24:06 flashbacks
0:24:07 of the night you were embraced and that
0:24:10 the heckling laughter that came from
0:24:12 these things
0:24:13 does win hear that oh yeah all right man
0:24:16 keep
0:24:16 running johnny all right move
0:24:20 uh johnny starts uh moving but he's he's
0:24:22 at this point he's going out of celerity
0:24:24 and he and he and wynn are just moving
0:24:26 quickly
0:24:27 johnny as you round one of the corner
0:24:28 you nearly bump into someone and it's a
0:24:31 familiar face
0:24:33 johnny
0:24:34 uh you immediately recognize kabir who
0:24:37 is
0:24:38 wearing like this very fluffy kind of
0:24:40 like poodle like coat
0:24:42 uh he's got like this really sick gold
0:24:46 medallion that's hanging on a chain
0:24:48 around his neck
0:24:50 and he looks like he's been clubbing all
0:24:53 night he looks very ecstatic to see
0:24:54 johnny i have so much to tell you my
0:24:56 friend big meaty arm grabs this him by
0:24:58 the scruff and slams him with potence
0:25:01 four into the brick he gasps
0:25:05 johnny
0:25:06 johnny my friend i you don't have to
0:25:08 attack me i
0:25:10 i got the sabbat in my heels right now
0:25:12 and you just happened to turn the corner
0:25:14 into my face you got one chance to say
0:25:17 something before i take your goddamn
0:25:19 head off i can hide you he looks over it
0:25:21 when
0:25:22 yeah
0:25:23 he looks ever at wind like recognizing
0:25:25 she's a gangrel and there's this moment
0:25:27 between them but beyond that everything
0:25:29 seems okay
0:25:31 okay
0:25:32 okay you come with me i like you it'll
0:25:34 be fine don't worry johnny i know you're
0:25:36 very upset he kind of like tries to get
0:25:38 behind you and like push you with his
0:25:39 hands like just way too like touchy and
0:25:43 and like
0:25:44 not taking the situation quite seriously
0:25:46 enough this is not permitted
0:25:48 he does not get behind win johnny kind
0:25:50 of moves along with him but is okay okay
0:25:53 he is exuding
0:25:55 near frenzy at this point as the two of
0:25:57 you
0:25:58 get into the alley
0:26:00 he waves his hand and what looks like a
0:26:04 simple
0:26:05 brick wall
0:26:07 manifests at the edge of the alley
0:26:09 hiding the two of you from
0:26:12 the streets beyond
0:26:14 i'm sorry kabir
0:26:15 it's okay my friend what

0:26:41 somebody's just using your identity
0:26:43 they're dead now though
0:26:45 well good
0:26:46 so um
0:26:48 i am here
0:26:50 uh actually needing a drive is this is
0:26:53 now a bad time for what i need someone
0:26:56 to get me to jfk
0:26:58 i have to pick up someone for a contact
0:27:00 of mine
0:27:03 you need to ride the jfk
0:27:05 yes i'm not going to jfk alone this is
0:27:07 dangerous come here the sabbat is in the
0:27:10 midst of a crusade coming up the east
0:27:12 coast for all i know they've got an
0:27:14 entire army coming out of new york i
0:27:16 don't think trying to drive they're
0:27:18 going to crusade the camarilla
0:27:20 we will be fine
0:27:22 all we have to do is lay low and let
0:27:24 this blow over i will show you how
0:27:26 johnny we still got people to talk to
0:27:28 man i need to find weathers right now
0:27:30 kabir i don't know if i can help you
0:27:31 with that ah
0:27:33 yes i can uh
0:27:35 do you need a ride well considering that
0:27:37 my truck just got pulled apart by arms
0:27:40 of an obteneration
0:27:41 i think i could probably use a ride very
0:27:43 good i'll give you a ride to give me a
0:27:44 ride let's go
0:27:46 he kind of rolls his eyes and and kind
0:27:48 of looks at when like
0:27:49 just
0:27:50 roll with this for the moment she gives
0:27:52 him a look like okay
0:27:54 two two let's hop on this crazy train
0:27:57 so johnny i don't know if you're allowed
0:27:59 to talk about this but you know what the
0:28:00 book of not is he kind of like just kind
0:28:02 of asks walk walking with you
0:28:05 how much does johnny know about what the
0:28:07 book of not is you only know that
0:28:09 because i feel like i feel like kabir is
0:28:11 actually the source where johnny gets
0:28:13 all of his like weird like obscure
0:28:16 knowledge so if if kabir hasn't told me
0:28:18 about it i feel like he probably has
0:28:19 never heard of this so uh
0:28:22 not exactly in this okay so so kabir has
0:28:25 never brought this up to you he has
0:28:27 brought up many other things to you this
0:28:29 is one of that rare occasion where he's
0:28:30 asking you if you know about something
0:28:32 it just so happens that the priest of
0:28:35 the killing spree reads passages from
0:28:38 the book of nod
0:28:40 to those who are being inducted and
0:28:42 taught it's a part of their writing
0:28:44 so you would definitely know that uh
0:28:47 this is
0:28:48 uh an item of interest to the sabbat
0:28:52 i might know a thing or two about it
0:28:54 very good i have a friend who is an
0:28:56 artist he's coming into the area and
0:28:58 he's going to need a place to stay i'll
0:29:00 cover the place to stay but i need him
0:29:02 to be
0:29:03 safely transported he's very worried
0:29:05 about being followed
0:29:07 by who
0:29:08 i don't know how the hell have you heard
0:29:10 about the book of nod kabir johnny i
0:29:12 travel places
0:29:13 you know that
0:29:15 it's not hard to get information on
0:29:18 don't worry my friend johnny he doesn't
0:29:20 do books but he knows lots of other
0:29:22 things
0:29:23 so
0:29:24 why don't we get to the car yeah let's
0:29:26 get to the car he gets you to this like
0:29:29 really really shitty station wagon with
0:29:32 wood panel siding
0:29:34 who the hell did you steal this from i
0:29:36 have no idea what happened no no no i'm
0:29:38 driving push like he's very easily
0:29:41 pushed aside by you wind hops in the the
0:29:44 fold down tailgate
0:29:46 sits back there it's actually pretty
0:29:47 comfy yeah miles is going to kill me for
0:29:49 losing that shotgun
0:29:52 he'll kill us for losing that shotgun no
0:29:54 it was never mind
0:29:57 not throwing you under the bus man
0:29:59 i appreciate that johnny if you need a
0:30:01 shotgun i can add that to the list of
0:30:03 payments you receive in exchange for

0:31:09 i'm kind of floating
0:31:10 without any
0:31:13 guidance here
0:31:14 and i could really use
0:31:17 some of your insight
0:31:18 i know that you might not be going in
0:31:20 the same direction i am but i i could
0:31:22 really
0:31:23 really use an old bruja who's actually
0:31:26 got a good head on his shoulders to tell
0:31:28 me
0:31:28 some things i need to hear
0:31:31 he gives that grunt of the grunt of like
0:31:34 i don't want any of this [ __ ]
0:31:37 but i gotta look out for the young lick
0:31:40 yeah johnny tell me where you are and
0:31:41 i'll head there i give him an address
0:31:44 uh me me there and 15.
0:31:47 sounds good
0:31:48 that sounded positive yeah weather
0:31:50 should be headed to uh
0:31:53 he's going to meet us here in 15.
0:31:55 okay the um gives us time to talk about
0:31:58 the uh the address the address that i
0:32:01 gave him um is like a small little like
0:32:04 late night
0:32:06 yeah late night greasy spoon of some
0:32:08 kind um america's diner
0:32:11 the three of us head over and we uh go
0:32:13 grab a booth and and three coffees that
0:32:16 we don't uh that we don't drink we just
0:32:18 beer absolutely drinks his coffee oh
0:32:20 does he yeah that [ __ ] of course
0:32:22 he has been like are you going to drink
0:32:24 yours
0:32:26 win kind of
0:32:27 winds sips hers and swishes it around in
0:32:29 her mouth and keeps spitting back into
0:32:31 the cup
0:32:33 so that she kind of gets the taste but
0:32:34 doesn't have to swallow it you're not
0:32:36 completely sure but you think a beer
0:32:38 might be like
0:32:40 winking at you the whole way after she
0:32:43 spits in it for maybe the sixth time she
0:32:45 slides it over to him yeah here have it
0:32:48 he kind of looks down at the coffee
0:32:50 looks over at wynn
0:32:52 and he picks up the cup of coffee
0:32:55 and right before he takes his sip of it
0:32:58 weathers can be seen walking in
0:33:00 and distracted kabir sets the mug down
0:33:07 johnny looks up at weathers and kind of
0:33:09 smiles grimly and nods wind kind of
0:33:12 gives a grin like hey
0:33:15 weathers this is uh kabir i don't know
0:33:16 if you two have actually ever met
0:33:18 kabir
0:33:20 kind of at like at the second you say
0:33:22 that
0:33:22 kobir gives the sheriff a very
0:33:25 apologetic look
0:33:27 and excuses himself from the table
0:33:30 standing up downs his cup of coffee
0:33:33 and walks away which cup of coffee the
0:33:37 wind cup of coffee
0:33:38 yeah it's made of wind
0:33:40 gross
0:33:43 kabir tiptoes away weathers looks at you
0:33:47 johnny shakes has said look i'm not the
0:33:50 sheriff
0:33:51 i ain't the keeper elysium and i don't
0:33:52 give a [ __ ] that that guy does not have
0:33:54 hospitality
0:33:56 but
0:33:57 you might want to look into that look
0:33:59 into what kabir and his lack of
0:34:01 hospitality
0:34:03 look
0:34:05 i get it good he's arriving basic [ __ ]
0:34:07 so i'm glad you get it
0:34:09 you saved he saved my life
0:34:11 all right good you then you should do
0:34:13 him the solid and get him hospitality
0:34:14 but that shit's illegal right now all
0:34:16 right all right
0:34:18 like you said you're not the sheriff
0:34:19 anymore sit down talk with me what the
0:34:21 [ __ ] happened
0:34:22 he gives you a look like he
0:34:24 is frustrated with unlife enough right
0:34:27 now that he might slap you for telling
0:34:29 him to sit with you
0:34:30 but then he sits with you
0:34:32 nothing new happened more of the same
0:34:36 but this time around i don't know if i'm
0:34:38 gonna just
0:34:39 you know take it for the greater good
0:34:42 i think it's i think it's time that i
0:34:44 went looking for something for me and
0:34:46 stopped you know living at the whims of
0:34:48 these kindred you don't give a [ __ ]
0:34:49 about what happens to everyone else
0:34:52 let's be real johnny you see what i see
0:34:55 all i'm doing now
0:34:57 is acknowledging that it's there
0:35:00 yeah i get it part of the reason that uh
0:35:03 i came out to see you tonight
0:35:05 was miles wanted me to to talk some
0:35:07 sense into you
0:35:09 and i pretty much told him to get [ __ ]
0:35:11 but he's not wrong i do have to talk to
0:35:13 you
0:35:14 what do you need to say
0:35:16 he kind of settles into his heat like
0:35:19 really kind of showing with his body
0:35:21 language that he's open to hear whatever
0:35:23 it is that you got to say
0:35:25 what's worth saving in this domain
0:35:28 a handful of things
0:35:31 a list that takes a while to jot down
0:35:34 not because it's long
0:35:36 but because it's hard as hell to figure
0:35:39 out
0:35:40 what actually makes the cut
0:35:43 but you ain't wrong
0:35:45 there are still things on that list
0:35:50 do you want to stick around and try and
0:35:51 help me save any of them
0:35:54 do i want to
0:35:57 no johnny i don't want to
0:35:59 are you gonna go side with amaya
0:36:02 no
0:36:04 the truth is amaya's got a lot of game
0:36:07 she's very good at convincing people
0:36:09 that they can be free
0:36:11 that
0:36:12 they'll be safe
0:36:14 but the truth is
0:36:17 she's got her own game going on
0:36:19 and if the followers of set don't get
0:36:21 her someone else will
0:36:24 they're not they're not in a better
0:36:26 position
0:36:28 and they're just in a different one and
0:36:30 i don't know if it's the one for me
0:36:32 the anarchs are a war with the followers
0:36:34 upset
0:36:36 the opposite
0:36:37 the followers are set at war with the
0:36:39 anarchs
0:36:40 more like
0:36:42 more than a handful of anarchs have been
0:36:45 subverted by the followers of set
0:36:48 turning to them for magic and
0:36:51 power
0:36:52 so like what happened with the bruja and
0:36:54 shaw yeah
0:36:56 listen
0:36:57 weathers i i think you know me
0:37:00 well enough at this point that you know
0:37:01 i have no love for the camarilla
0:37:03 i'm cameron for four reasons
0:37:06 this loose cannon that she kind of
0:37:08 gestures to johnny kind of gives you a
0:37:10 nod of understanding kind of blew up a
0:37:12 dunkin donuts tonight
0:37:14 what we're gonna fix it later long story
0:37:18 the iceman in chief
0:37:19 the former dead girl walking and the
0:37:22 memory of the bravest lunatic that i
0:37:24 utterly failed
0:37:26 those bastards are my lifeboat
0:37:28 johnny's johnny kind of shakes his head
0:37:30 sits back to pull out a cigarette and
0:37:32 then realizes he's out crumples the pack
0:37:35 and throws on the table the bruja
0:37:37 across the state from johnny kind of
0:37:39 reaches into his pocket
0:37:41 takes out a pack of newports
0:37:44 packs it and offers this like long
0:37:46 menthol 100
0:37:48 to johnny johnny goes a little bit green
0:37:52 smokey [ __ ] cigarette
0:37:55 thanks weathers
0:37:56 pops in his mouth lights up
0:37:59 and if that day ever comes where
0:38:01 that lifeboat that i have isn't around
0:38:04 probably just
0:38:06 sink
0:38:07 into the nights
0:38:09 probably become some kind of
0:38:11 urban legend
0:38:12 sasquatch of east east rock park
0:38:15 but that day isn't today
0:38:17 and i'm gonna fight with every possible
0:38:19 means to keep the ones that i still can
0:38:22 with me and that includes doing
0:38:24 everything i can to keep you here
0:38:25 because i believe you're the only other
0:38:27 person in these nights who gives a [ __ ]
0:38:28 about
0:38:30 us i don't want you guys getting lost in
0:38:33 this war
0:38:35 where there's my coteries
0:38:38 we need you man
0:38:39 my coterie is
0:38:41 the closest thing that i actually have
0:38:43 to a family anymore
0:38:45 my my mortal family
0:38:48 i can't be with them anymore it's just
0:38:50 too dangerous
0:38:52 but you're
0:38:54 the person that i actually owe
0:38:57 a life boom to
0:38:59 and boons aside
0:39:02 i got your back
0:39:04 no matter what
0:39:07 so you ask me to do something it'll be
0:39:09 done
0:39:11 and i don't really have a leg to stand
0:39:13 on to ask anything of you
0:39:16 but
0:39:19 if you want to stay in this city
0:39:22 and actually play the jihad
0:39:27 i got your back on that
0:39:30 because there's still some [ __ ]
0:39:32 who could use some comeuppance here
0:39:34 yeah there is revenge
0:39:38 that's one of the things i have left
0:39:41 look
0:39:42 the quarter he did some fine work
0:39:46 and stood up to
0:39:47 [Music]
0:39:48 a danger that i don't think everyone
0:39:50 even completely understands just yet
0:39:53 what you did was important
0:39:56 i don't i don't think i have any
0:39:59 interest in ending up some ventures
0:40:01 bully boy
0:40:03 but i won't forget what you did either
0:40:07 so if you need me you got me too
0:40:10 i'll stay long enough to see this done
0:40:14 whatever it is
0:40:15 wyn puts her hand out to shake his
0:40:19 this like
0:40:20 gnarly scarred muscular
0:40:23 like meaty hand reaches out and takes
0:40:26 yours and although he's a little cold to
0:40:28 the touch you can kind of like feel
0:40:32 this like this this very very muscular
0:40:35 hand squeeze yours
0:40:36 you know what i mean it's like one of
0:40:37 those hands where you can't quite even
0:40:39 squeeze your hand all the way to shake
0:40:40 his hand back yep it's like a polar bear
0:40:43 giving paw like it's just not
0:40:45 not like it's not an easily like
0:40:48 accomplished handshake yeah and wind
0:40:50 doesn't have tiny hands but it's still
0:40:52 hard to get around yeah
0:40:54 but
0:40:57 she figures it would probably be poor
0:40:58 form to try and head bomb him like she
0:41:00 does other people she respects so this
0:41:02 is the closest she can come to being
0:41:04 civilized
0:41:06 what do you guys need from me
0:41:08 right now i think we just
0:41:10 need to know that we still got a couple
0:41:12 more allies in the city we're trying to
0:41:13 formulate a plan
0:41:16 but not right now i don't know what what
0:41:17 to do
0:41:19 you got to get the tremier on board
0:41:22 they're the only ones with the know how
0:41:24 to kind of
0:41:25 deal with this stuff in ways that the
0:41:27 sabbat won't easily be able to manage
0:41:29 you go to toe to toe with them the
0:41:31 streets you're going to lose yeah that's
0:41:33 just what happened so we have to find
0:41:35 another way
0:41:36 we got to play a game that they they're
0:41:38 not good at getting along no they're
0:41:40 damn fine at getting along i meant the
0:41:42 tremere but yeah yeah
0:41:45 all right
0:41:46 what are the tremeer want
0:41:49 who knows they want information about
0:41:51 what's going on in boston they want vito
0:41:53 zantosa but we don't know why they're
0:41:55 hiding something and whatever going on
0:41:57 in boston it's got to be something else
0:41:59 that they're hiding because i haven't
0:42:00 heard barely anything about it
0:42:03 we can talk about it if you want
0:42:05 i uh
0:42:06 not miss i might have done something
0:42:09 real stupid with santosa weathers
0:42:11 okay to find stupid i may have embraced
0:42:14 him all right i need a quick frenzy
0:42:15 chuckle man
0:42:20 yeah that's reason oh boy i hope you
0:42:23 guys like that
0:42:24 that weathers did not know that
0:42:28 i had not been making that public
0:42:30 information
0:42:32 it's ready for all power and
0:42:34 he will succeed due to a point of power
0:42:39 just because he thought about it
0:42:42 he's like
0:42:43 he looks actually rather calm
0:42:46 you start to realize that while he's
0:42:48 talking there's fangs in his mouth see
0:42:50 seeing him tense up and and and get
0:42:53 serene for a second johnny like leans
0:42:55 back to get out of his personal space
0:42:58 because even on the opposite side of the
0:43:00 booth right now that's in his personal
0:43:02 space
0:43:03 that
0:43:04 that monster does not deserve to be one
0:43:07 of us
0:43:08 when we going to go pick him up
0:43:11 britta ended up shooting him
0:43:13 what it was like some kind of manchurian
0:43:15 candidate thing i i don't know what
0:43:17 exactly is going on [ __ ]
0:43:19 but he was dead
0:43:21 and i know that we needed him this is
0:43:23 romeo all over again wait what i never
0:43:26 heard what happened with that kid
0:43:29 what was his whole deal with us not a
0:43:31 lot of it's known
0:43:32 all i know is that the prince had heard
0:43:35 something and suddenly ended the
0:43:36 investigation into it the malkavian
0:43:39 primogen
0:43:40 intervened
0:43:41 said something to him and he backed off
0:43:44 i heard rumors
0:43:46 yeah
0:43:47 i heard rumors
0:43:49 that this guy had all kinds of talents
0:43:51 that
0:43:53 some you know
0:43:54 graffiti artist street punk would never
0:43:57 be good at
0:43:58 one of them
0:43:59 was being smooth operated with a rifle
0:44:02 he gives a real hard look over it when
0:44:05 like oh god
0:44:07 win looks back
0:44:09 kind of with
0:44:10 some more knowledge and she's kind of
0:44:12 putting some pieces together how long
0:44:14 has this been going on
0:44:16 i think we first started noticing
0:44:19 that there is something a little bit
0:44:20 weird about her amnesia maybe after uh
0:44:24 Reiss got me and and miles out of torpor
0:44:28 she told me about a memory she had that
0:44:30 was set in the shadow lands
0:44:32 yeah this sounds like the romeo
0:44:34 situation do you think this is related
0:44:35 to the sabbat or is this something else
0:44:37 completely i don't know
0:44:39 she could be some sort of sleeper or
0:44:41 like a ghoul family or
0:44:43 who knows
0:44:45 i mean that's
0:44:47 i'm sorry was that to be perfectly
0:44:49 honest
0:44:50 that's kind of way down on our list of
0:44:52 priorities at the moment well they might
0:44:54 all be one in the same and so on some
0:44:56 level
0:44:57 right so if she shot veda zantos there's
0:44:59 a chance that he knew something about
0:45:00 her and you and you said nix knows about
0:45:02 this too huh
0:45:04 yeah she's been laying though for a
0:45:05 while
0:45:06 can't say that i blame her i think it
0:45:08 might be time that we go visit pay her a
0:45:10 visit yeah be careful about that
0:45:13 there's something wrong with nick's
0:45:15 i mean
0:45:17 it's kind of something wrong with all of
0:45:18 us man
0:45:19 yeah and here i am saying be careful
0:45:21 with her
0:45:23 look i i know that the malkavians have
0:45:25 some kind of weird sickness going on
0:45:27 with them
0:45:28 is it really that bad
0:45:30 yeah
0:45:31 yeah she freaks her own clan out
0:45:34 [Music]
0:45:36 but she's like she's a seer
0:45:38 she tends to know things that nobody
0:45:40 else knows
0:45:41 sees things in ways that no one sees
0:45:43 them
0:45:44 well if we need this if we need to get
0:45:46 information that we can trade to the
0:45:48 premier
0:45:49 to try and get them to at least help us
0:45:51 out against the sabbat that might be a
0:45:53 place to start yeah
0:45:55 locating people is kind of a weird
0:45:57 specialty at first i used to hit her up
0:45:59 back in the day
0:46:01 maybe we can even have her have her help
0:46:02 us find santosa we might need it
0:46:05 since i embraced him he's been
0:46:07 he escaped down the water pipes
0:46:09 difficult peter's gone he's
0:46:12 been keeping a weird eye on brita
0:46:16 i don't think he's far leader's got to
0:46:18 go
0:46:20 you think keeping keeping him around at
0:46:21 this point is uh
0:46:23 more trouble than it's worth
0:46:25 the way i see it is like this if there's
0:46:28 anyone that's going to help the killing
0:46:30 spring give them an edge local it's
0:46:32 going to be him so the food sooner we
0:46:34 put a lid on that the better i thought
0:46:35 we was it was already handled but i
0:46:37 guess [ __ ] happened and that's all right
0:46:39 i get it
0:46:40 [ __ ] happens if if we can keep him alive
0:46:42 would that give us any sway over rhys
0:46:45 i don't know he and i aren't exactly in
0:46:47 speaking terms
0:46:49 that makes sense
0:46:51 i think he tried to put a slug in his
0:46:52 chest didn't you
0:46:54 try no
0:46:59 i gotta head to a meeting
0:47:01 where you going i have a meeting with mr
0:47:03 roman pendragon pendragon jesus yeah
0:47:07 he's taken an interest in these domains
0:47:10 are you looking to negotiate joining up
0:47:12 with him or keeping him out of the
0:47:13 domain he sent me a message asking to
0:47:16 talk
0:47:17 saying you heard about my situation and
0:47:19 wanted to look out for you know one
0:47:21 bruja to another he recently took praxis
0:47:24 over hartford so he's in control of that
0:47:27 he's also the prince of springfield mass
0:47:29 and a handful of other locations
0:47:32 jesus
0:47:35 supposedly
0:47:36 him and a handful of other elders came
0:47:38 from england to something called
0:47:40 operation longbow
0:47:41 yeah you were telling me about that yeah
0:47:44 real old world types right right
0:47:47 well the army that he's raised has kind
0:47:49 of given him an opportunity to take and
0:47:52 hold multiple practices
0:47:55 he thinks he's some sort of
0:47:57 answer to the sabbat i'm not convinced
0:48:00 but i figured i'd hear him out
0:48:02 well we don't want to keep you
0:48:05 but we're grateful that you came out to
0:48:06 talk to us man you don't think he's
0:48:08 planning on putting out a cold arms yeah
0:48:11 i think he is
0:48:12 but more importantly i think he's going
0:48:14 to try to get me to do it
0:48:17 cross that bridge when we come to it
0:48:19 yeah
0:48:20 he gets up
0:48:22 weathers
0:48:23 yeah
0:48:24 for what it's worth when you put a slug
0:48:26 in that guy's chest
0:48:28 you saved a little boy from a lifetime
0:48:29 of torture
0:48:31 so
0:48:33 that's worth a lot thank you yeah
0:48:36 he drops a 50 down to cover these
0:48:37 coffees
0:48:39 and
0:48:40 he gives the two of you a nod and heads
0:48:42 out
0:48:43 you guys be safe you're the same old man
0:48:46 he steps out
0:48:47 oh
0:48:48 i think we got to go uh talk to miles
0:48:51 convince him we got to go talk to the
0:48:52 knicks
0:48:54 yeah
0:48:55 and
0:48:57 since you know uh wynn has already
0:48:59 finished her coffee
0:49:01 uh johnny nurses hers for a few moments
0:49:03 and then the two of you head out
0:49:05 outside kibir's car is still waiting for
0:49:08 you uh kibir himself seems to
0:49:11 have disappeared into the night
0:49:13 i mean how good a friend is he
0:49:16 i uh i reach in and i beat the horn a
0:49:18 couple times
0:49:20 you kind of see this like cub year come
0:49:22 from the gas station next door
0:49:25 uh he's got this like his head's on a
0:49:27 swivel he's definitely looking around
0:49:29 for any signs of a scourge
0:49:31 and he makes his way over johnny oh
0:49:34 it's good to see you how was your
0:49:35 meeting so you never got hospitality huh
0:49:38 well
0:49:39 i was going to but
0:49:41 as you know this in the city has been
0:49:42 very tumultuous and
0:49:46 he raises
0:49:48 his hand with a
0:49:50 fresh pack of cigarettes a nice little
0:49:52 green bic lighter and he gives both of
0:49:55 them to you as like a a semi-formal
0:49:58 apology for being a [ __ ]
0:50:00 see this is why we're friends he passes
0:50:02 the big one we're best friends
0:50:04 win takes the lighter and sticks it in
0:50:05 her pocket all right
0:50:07 when is this uh
0:50:09 noticed coming into jfk i'm gonna need a
0:50:11 few nights he is coming all the way from
0:50:13 baghdad
0:50:15 baghdad yes who the [ __ ] do you know in
0:50:17 baghdad i know lots of people in baghdad
0:50:19 it's a very big city all right
0:50:24 i could probably make it down to jfk in
0:50:27 an hour and a half two hours from here
0:50:29 it's a very quick ride
0:50:31 mostly safe and you're coming back up to
0:50:33 new haven yes they want to go to new
0:50:35 haven
0:50:36 are you planning on getting hospitality
0:50:39 once the two of you come back to new
0:50:40 haven uh perfectly honest answer my
0:50:42 friend probably not but i do intend to
0:50:46 stay out of trouble
0:50:48 which is very similar to getting
0:50:49 hospitality all right
0:50:52 you help with my family
0:50:54 i owe you this
0:50:55 when's this guy coming into jfk it's
0:50:58 gonna be about maybe a week or so i
0:51:00 don't have the exact day they're trying
0:51:01 to lay low and avoid their own trouble i
0:51:04 do not think they will bring trouble
0:51:05 with them don't even ask there's no way
0:51:07 to know for sure anyways
0:51:09 but you tell me you get me an actual
0:51:11 date that you need me driving
0:51:14 and i i can do this for you you don't
0:51:16 get me a date i don't know if i can make
0:51:18 that promise okay i will get you a date
0:51:20 right
0:51:20 away johnny if you need a ride and buddy
0:51:23 yes it would be very good to have a
0:51:25 writing buddy more writing buddies the
0:51:27 better uh this about this crawling all
0:51:29 over new york but i think we can mostly
0:51:32 be safe we'll be fine
0:51:35 is anyone actually looking for this guy
0:51:37 uh
0:51:39 yes
0:51:40 who is looking for this guy uh he did
0:51:43 not give me exacts i do know there's an
0:51:45 army of assassins however so his army of
0:51:48 assassins resides almost on the other
0:51:49 side of the entire globe so like
0:51:52 the chance there's no chance they have
0:51:54 access to airplanes no of course not
0:51:56 just because this notice has access to
0:51:58 airplanes these assassins don't even use
0:52:00 guns they use knives they're very old
0:52:02 somehow that doesn't make me feel better
0:52:04 so we're talking about
0:52:06 a noticed kindred from the middle east
0:52:08 who's being chased by assassins with
0:52:10 knives
0:52:11 yes kabir are you dragging me into
0:52:14 asamite [ __ ]
0:52:15 they are also technically asamites
0:52:18 he gives this hard withering engage
0:52:21 i'm very sorry i would not ask this if
0:52:24 it wasn't important and if they were not
0:52:25 paying me a great deal of money i feel
0:52:28 like the importance
0:52:29 is amplified by the great deal of money
0:52:32 i also agree that the importance is
0:52:33 amplified by a great deal of money
0:52:36 johnny nods
0:52:37 his head
0:52:39 just kind of like
0:52:41 up and down but also just ever so
0:52:43 slightly side to side like yeah
0:52:46 i'm gonna help you out with this but god
0:52:49 [ __ ] damn it no i i can i can swim
0:52:52 about i don't want you to feel bad or
