0:00:21 want you to feel the same so listen or
0:00:23 discretion is advised now let's walk the
0:00:27 path of night
0:00:28 and now part two of the path of night
0:00:30 season finale House of wolves
0:00:34 but as you draw close
0:00:36 you can now start seeing every now and
0:00:39 again hooded figures leather jackets
0:00:42 kind of creeping around the side of the
0:00:45 road every now and again kind of keeping
0:00:46 an eye on things but soon enough you
0:00:49 arrive to the Larose Cliff Mansion and
0:00:52 there the gates are open for you
0:00:55 on the limousine pulls him and there
0:00:58 there is a servant waiting and to assist
0:01:01 you out of the limousine and as you and
0:01:04 Roman Pendragon step out you are
0:01:06 confronted
0:01:07 with a gorgeous collection of Kindred or
0:01:12 dressed exquisitely and while in the
0:01:16 presence of the Kindred Elite I need you
0:01:18 to make self-control mm-hmm
0:01:23 debating that willpower
0:01:29 yeah it's the entrance to an important
0:01:31 party I'm spending that willpower it's
0:01:34 good to save it for later but uh it
0:01:36 doesn't matter if you don't get past the
0:01:37 beginning yeah your difficulty is mine
0:01:40 [Laughter]
0:01:43 that's about right
0:01:46 one success because of the willpower
0:01:48 okay
0:01:50 seed
0:01:51 Britta steps out with the assistant of
0:01:54 the servant into the Moonlight and her
0:01:58 as her eyes fall on all the various
0:02:01 kinds of impossible beauty that Kindred
0:02:04 Society is capable of
0:02:06 it sweeps over her but she remains in
0:02:08 control of the appreciation she still
0:02:10 can't help but to admire it but she
0:02:14 keeps her faculties
0:02:16 does it look like there's a particular
0:02:18 Gathering Point like does it look as if
0:02:21 you might go somewhere to request
0:02:25 Hospitality or does this not seem to be
0:02:27 this kind of party you're not terribly
0:02:30 sure however
0:02:32 Roman walks with you
0:02:34 and seems to know how to navigate this
0:02:37 Gathering and as you approach the main
0:02:41 foyer there is a pair of Shaggy looking
0:02:44 men dressed in Redcoats who actually bow
0:02:48 to you in Roman and when you enter you
0:02:51 can hear the soft sounds of violins
0:02:53 playing and at the top of the stairs
0:02:57 there is a Nosferatu who is not
0:03:00 concealing his Visage behind the mask of
0:03:04 obfuscape and he is this tall lanky
0:03:07 figure with thin lips and pointed ears a
0:03:11 bald head
0:03:12 and the Eerie pointed teeth of the
0:03:15 classic Nosferatu and he is dressed like
0:03:18 I wouldn't say fashionable
0:03:21 he is dressed in the way that Puritans
0:03:24 dressed when they arrived to the new
0:03:27 world
0:03:28 he has a very old distinguished British
0:03:31 vibe to him and you very quickly get the
0:03:36 feeling that he is the master of the
0:03:37 house and you can feel the power of His
0:03:40 Beast Weighing on you the moment you
0:03:42 cross into his threshold
0:03:44 he gives a nod to Roman Roman gives a
0:03:48 nod to his ally
0:03:50 and you continue on this time headed to
0:03:54 the ballroom where their Kindred who are
0:03:57 dancing many are gathered and
0:04:00 socializing sometimes laughing
0:04:03 uproariously
0:04:05 among them there is the or what appears
0:04:09 to be the only man who is not dressed
0:04:11 for the occasion he is in tight black
0:04:13 pants a black turtleneck
0:04:16 hair is black and done in this complete
0:04:21 mess he has kind of crusty worn black
0:04:24 eyeliner on
0:04:26 and the ladies in attendance flocked him
0:04:30 to hear about his
0:04:32 position on various forms of poetry and
0:04:36 history and art
0:04:37 on the other side you recognize a
0:04:41 certain malkavian prince who rules over
0:04:44 Boston and he is telling jokes and only
0:04:48 a gathering of six Kindred who are
0:04:50 around him seem to laugh at these jokes
0:04:53 everyone else seems to make an effort to
0:04:55 steer clear of Quentin King are these
0:04:59 Kindred around him dressed in a
0:05:01 particular identifiable way they are
0:05:04 dressed all the same and they look like
0:05:07 they are kind of going for this like
0:05:10 weird 60s Beatles vibe and have pins on
0:05:15 their like lapels they seem to indicate
0:05:17 some nightly order since the exit from
0:05:21 the limousine and the walk through past
0:05:23 the Master of the House Britta hasn't
0:05:26 with what she just experienced in the
0:05:28 limousine she doesn't really in her
0:05:31 heart she doesn't want to be walking
0:05:32 this close to Roman Pendragon but with
0:05:36 the overwhelming glamor and intimidation
0:05:39 of this prestigious and mysterious crowd
0:05:44 she does find her steps closer than she
0:05:47 might otherwise intend and she falls in
0:05:50 line as he leads offering likely if it
0:05:53 would have seemed appropriate at the
0:05:55 time of passing by I think a dip of the
0:05:57 head or a curtsy to what seemed to be
0:06:00 work
0:06:01 and as we get through to the crowd she's
0:06:05 looking at the different faces trying to
0:06:07 take in the different Dynamics
0:06:09 as you pass by the poet
0:06:13 you hear this like kind of gruff sound
0:06:16 that comes from Roman Pendragon
0:06:18 uh flicker of curiosity and I sneak a
0:06:21 look over to see his expression William
0:06:23 Biltmore
0:06:25 and as he says that William
0:06:28 looks to you and gives a very half
0:06:31 suggestive smile sort of quietly and
0:06:34 gesturing for you to join them
0:06:36 and it's then you kind of feel this like
0:06:39 tenseness
0:06:41 come from Roman and the subtle pull
0:06:44 ey makes kind of steering you away from
0:06:47 William Biltmore is it a literal poll
0:06:49 like does he have a literal pull in
0:06:51 what's the body positioning and because
0:06:53 it's important for the reaction like as
0:06:55 as you are having the Silent
0:06:57 Communication really build more you feel
0:06:59 uh your arm become entangled with his as
0:07:03 the two of you kind of walk on together
0:07:05 and he just sort of directs you away
0:07:08 a friendly face is a bit of a comfort uh
0:07:12 in this sort of scenario and I feel that
0:07:15 when it was at first just the beginnings
0:07:18 of a smile that started to form she
0:07:20 might have started to smile a bit back
0:07:23 but what's the suggestiveness came
0:07:26 through that would have been a bit of a
0:07:28 pause Point especially if that probably
0:07:30 coincided with attention I'm guessing it
0:07:32 did and that being the case of
0:07:37 my arm being placed within Roman
0:07:39 pendragons and the steering uh starting
0:07:41 up then I think Bretta curls her arm in
0:07:44 accepting being steered and turning her
0:07:48 attention in the opposite direction
0:07:50 Mr Biltmore rather enjoys the company of
0:07:53 your clan
0:07:54 he lures them keeps them as pets
0:07:58 pets
0:07:59 how so
0:08:01 certainly not like this
0:08:03 this is business what he does is
0:08:06 something else Berta has a flicker of
0:08:08 confusion as Roman Pendragon clarifies
0:08:14 uh she she is lucky to have already have
0:08:18 been directing her attention in the
0:08:20 opposite direction as I imagine
0:08:22 otherwise her expression might have uh
0:08:25 indicated that confusion further as it
0:08:28 is she does sort of glance back to catch
0:08:30 his body language from the way that he's
0:08:33 walking in terms of body language he has
0:08:36 a total poker face he walks with you
0:08:40 clear that you're the subject of his
0:08:42 attention
0:08:43 but the designs he has upon you are not
0:08:47 revealed in any way that those watching
0:08:50 can ascertain and as you sort of look at
0:08:53 him past him you can see this like cold
0:08:58 calculating look coming from William
0:09:00 Biltmore towards the two of you Britta
0:09:04 continues acting as if her line of sight
0:09:08 is meant to be on Roman Pendragon but I
0:09:13 am now using that to try and keep an eye
0:09:17 on exactly if I can like spot like
0:09:20 little flickers of body language from
0:09:21 Biltmore
0:09:22 she isn't quite sure how to respond to
0:09:26 that last comment and it's visually
0:09:28 obvious that she kind of especially
0:09:30 because she's using it to try to get
0:09:32 that that perspective on Biltmore I
0:09:36 think her eyes probably flicker to Roman
0:09:39 pendragon's features uh to sort of get a
0:09:43 reaction and as that doesn't quite work
0:09:45 she pulls together just a nod of
0:09:49 agreement and
0:09:51 sounds like you two have history
0:09:54 he says nothing and as he goes to
0:09:58 continue sort of steering you away
0:10:00 towards uh an empty Hall that is nearby
0:10:03 there's this feminine hand that kind of
0:10:07 presses against his chest and stops him
0:10:10 from like an angle that you couldn't
0:10:12 quite see and as the two of you look to
0:10:16 see who this person is
0:10:17 you immediately recognize Elsa Linden
0:10:21 whose strawberry blonde hair is like all
0:10:24 kinds of teased up with just this
0:10:27 incredible amount of perfectly executed
0:10:29 hairspray usage and she's got heavy but
0:10:33 like very attractive eye makeup on and
0:10:39 much like how William Biltmore chose to
0:10:42 dress in a fashion that really kind of
0:10:44 doesn't quite fit the vibe of this very
0:10:47 kind of Victorian goth party
0:10:51 Elsa stands out like a sore thumb but is
0:10:55 glorious to behold in her absurdly short
0:10:59 black skirt her combat boots the black
0:11:04 sports bra that she is wearing as a top
0:11:06 and the leather jacket like the like
0:11:09 worn well used brouhal leather jacket
0:11:13 that she wears and on her like patch she
0:11:16 has like a patch on her shoulder that
0:11:18 just reads Reggie's side
0:11:20 and
0:11:22 she
0:11:25 gives Roman this like very confident
0:11:29 smile and says to him like oh you look
0:11:32 absolutely dashing
0:11:34 but you hear something different and
0:11:36 through this conversation as she begins
0:11:39 to shower compliments onto Pendragon you
0:11:42 hear say to you
0:11:43 this place is dangerous
0:11:46 but you have to get out of here as
0:11:47 quickly as you can
0:11:49 what is your plan
0:11:51 when Bretta first sees Elsa Linden
0:11:54 looking like this I think there's all
0:11:56 already
0:11:57 Just Like A Rush of uh genuine warmth at
0:12:02 the relief of seeing a friendly face in
0:12:05 the smile that Britta offers her on
0:12:07 purpose of a greeting but it's so
0:12:09 sincere because
0:12:10 thank God but that like warmth is kind
0:12:13 of mixed with the Wonder I've never I
0:12:15 don't think nothing she's worn looks
0:12:17 like this no no no
0:12:19 you are shocked that she knows that what
0:12:22 a leather jacket is she's got a very
0:12:24 like mid-80s Madonna Vibes yes
0:12:29 so I think like there's that like wonder
0:12:31 that kind of takes over for a moment
0:12:32 because what she looks like the hottest
0:12:35 bruja I've ever seen
0:12:38 But as she warns me that this place is
0:12:41 dangerous and asks me about my plan I
0:12:44 haven't used double talk uh before would
0:12:47 one of her compliments be something
0:12:49 along the lines of like like how are
0:12:52 these like about the suit are these
0:12:53 about the eyes like
0:12:55 is it just a shower of compliments
0:12:57 [Laughter]
0:12:59 so she is basically kind of like hey we
0:13:03 never met up after that party this time
0:13:05 and like she's basically giving like
0:13:09 this huge implication that she wants to
0:13:13 hook up with Roman Pendragon and that
0:13:16 maybe tonight could be uh you know a
0:13:21 lucky night for him
0:13:22 uh and but you know she's subtle about
0:13:25 it she's not like throwing herself
0:13:28 yeah to compliment her yeah yeah so it
0:13:32 sounds like Elsa's carry on small talk
0:13:34 that was actually that was actually my
0:13:36 um plan was to
0:13:38 so my intention is to give her a
0:13:42 compliment that leads into me saying
0:13:43 that I could give them a minute but for
0:13:46 the actual message to be
0:13:49 if I don't play along he'll hurt my
0:13:51 codery
0:13:53 she turns
0:13:55 looks he's like by the way and you look
0:13:57 absolutely lovely and she leans in and
0:13:59 kisses you on the cheek and when she is
0:14:01 saying that she says to you
0:14:04 where is your Quarry now can they get
0:14:07 here
0:14:08 you know it means a lot to me that you'd
0:14:10 say I look beautiful so on and so forth
0:14:12 and the actual message is
0:14:16 um I'm not sure where they are I haven't
0:14:18 been able to contact them
0:14:21 I'm going to
0:14:26 I'm going to come on strong and I want
0:14:28 you to just walk away I'll keep him here
0:14:30 but you have to just and before she can
0:14:33 finish conveying her message to you a
0:14:36 very tall Warwick is standing by the
0:14:39 trio and he looks to Pendragon and says
0:14:43 is this the girl
0:14:45 and Roman nods and he says very good
0:14:49 young lady
0:14:51 you will come with me
0:14:53 at once
0:14:55 Bretta dips her head in respect and
0:14:57 moves to untangle her arm from Roman
0:14:59 Pendragon Roman kind of moves like he is
0:15:03 intending on coming with you
0:15:06 and Warwick gives the two Elders a look
0:15:09 that causes the both of them to take a
0:15:11 step back
0:15:12 and Warwick ushers you along and you can
0:15:17 kind of see this uh anger in Roman's
0:15:21 eyes when Warwick pulls you away on
0:15:26 Elsa's features there is panic
0:15:33 foreign
0:15:38 miles is coming down from his frenzy
0:15:40 Johnny will find a quiet ante room
0:15:45 um
0:15:46 is calling from the prince's numbers a
0:15:49 good idea it's quite the flex
0:15:54 that is fair
0:15:56 so Johnny will find a quiet office space
0:15:59 in the prince's Haven his mansion and he
0:16:05 will uh dig out one of his little
0:16:08 contact books that he keeps tucked away
0:16:10 in an inner pocket of his leather jacket
0:16:12 find himaya's number and dial it into a
0:16:15 nice
0:16:16 reasonable rotary phone when there is an
0:16:19 answer
0:16:20 you can hear the distant sounds
0:16:24 of like a local kind of gothy new metal
0:16:29 style band playing in the background and
0:16:32 you hear this like this very low
0:16:36 feminine voice
0:16:39 why are you calling
0:16:41 Amaya it's Johnny Saxon well this became
0:16:45 interesting Johnny why are you calling
0:16:48 and if you don't mind my asking
0:16:51 why do you have the prince's phone
0:16:53 number that's not uh anything to be
0:16:56 concerned about with at the moment
0:16:59 how were things in uh your domain
0:17:03 legally speaking I don't have one but
0:17:06 the territory we run have been facing
0:17:09 some trouble I understand you're on
0:17:12 yours have been tasked with taking me
0:17:13 out
0:17:15 well I think that ordeal is going to be
0:17:19 resolved without any bloodshed
0:17:22 well
0:17:23 any more bloodshed
0:17:25 are you safe at the moment I am
0:17:30 I don't know that I can really say that
0:17:32 I'm ever safe
0:17:34 Johnny Sanders live on the edge you
0:17:37 could Pan and the fire he cracks a smile
0:17:39 you're not currently being hunted
0:17:43 I've certainly got enough time for a
0:17:45 phone call but we're going to want to
0:17:46 confirm about the uh whether or not I'm
0:17:49 being hunted
0:17:50 if not the camera the set it is still
0:17:53 after me but they're not knocking at
0:17:54 your door right now right I don't think
0:17:56 that'd be wise good and you still have
0:17:59 enough Flex to make sure that if they
0:18:01 did it'd be a fight right me
0:18:04 no I can't take the set Heights but you
0:18:08 can almost like
0:18:09 feel her looking over at someone but I
0:18:13 think weathers can take them weather's
0:18:15 with you
0:18:16 yeah
0:18:18 how's the old man doing I think he's
0:18:20 feeling young again that's good to hear
0:18:23 well you still have friends in Clan
0:18:26 bruja in New Haven
0:18:28 I want you to understand that
0:18:31 and there's going to need to be some
0:18:34 discussions had amongst our clan very
0:18:38 soon
0:18:39 I was hoping to call together a rave and
0:18:42 normally I would ask Jane's help with
0:18:44 that
0:18:45 unfortunately she is uh currently M.I.A
0:18:49 I was hoping that if I put out the call
0:18:52 you might be willing to use some of your
0:18:55 influence to get the clan to take it
0:18:58 seriously maybe even assist me with
0:19:01 getting together some of the uh
0:19:02 entertainment for the evening trying to
0:19:05 make it up with that no problem
0:19:06 ah
0:19:08 you know Johnny I don't know if it's
0:19:10 ever been said to you
0:19:12 but I think it needs to be
0:19:15 it is a [ __ ] shame
0:19:18 that the rest of the Baroda and we even
0:19:19 are more like you
0:19:22 thanks Maya
0:19:24 that means a lot
0:19:26 good
0:19:28 take it out because I mean it
0:19:31 the call for the Rave will be out soon
0:19:34 I'll have everything ready by then
0:19:36 take care of yourself
0:19:38 until weather's uh
0:19:40 the weather's I'm glad he's still in the
0:19:42 area
0:19:43 whatever
0:19:44 Johnny hangs up after Johnny's phone
0:19:47 call in the office he returns to the uh
0:19:51 the room
0:19:52 um the chamber where Upton Rowlands
0:19:55 normally sleeps
0:19:57 listening to the door is the frenzy
0:20:00 still continuing
0:20:02 it seems that things have
0:20:05 winded down
0:20:08 to a point where uh miles has become
0:20:11 cognizant Johnny at that point will open
0:20:13 the door enter and Survey the damage
0:20:16 Marcus chaps we sent him out and gave
0:20:19 him food yep he's been well fed so he's
0:20:22 probably in a foyer or some kind of ante
0:20:24 room just kind of like lounging on a
0:20:26 chase with that is now covered in
0:20:29 freaking it's definitely covered in
0:20:31 fisher cat musk that is his chair and
0:20:34 blood from whatever he was eating he's
0:20:36 vacuumed up the scrambled eggs that were
0:20:37 on the floor
0:20:39 laughs
0:20:41 so what kind of damage am I looking at
0:20:43 in the room and what's what state is
0:20:46 miles in as you survey the room it
0:20:49 becomes clear that a great deal of the
0:20:53 pent up frustration and rage that Miles
0:20:56 has felt ever since he decided ever
0:20:59 since he was inspired to seize Praxis
0:21:02 was Unleashed on the room the mirror is
0:21:05 smashed his fists have like rented
0:21:09 furniture
0:21:10 the blankets are all over the place this
0:21:12 what was a very well cared for room with
0:21:16 very expensive possessions has been
0:21:19 ruined utterly and in the middle of it
0:21:23 sort of down on his knees to exhausted
0:21:26 from it to stand at the moment
0:21:28 is Miles
0:21:30 and Scattered ashes all about him
0:21:35 Johnny kind of takes a few strides
0:21:37 through the uh the Carnage all of the
0:21:40 possessions in here are uh pretty much
0:21:42 destroyed yes I mean there are things
0:21:44 that uh he'll be able to you know put
0:21:46 back together uh or at least reorganized
0:21:48 but the room itself is ruined he walks
0:21:52 over and kind of Scoops an arm under
0:21:55 miles shoulder and kind of hauls him up
0:21:58 miles is not wearing his glasses and
0:22:02 kind of finally looks over and takes an
0:22:05 involuntary breath
0:22:08 it's done you okay
0:22:11 it's
0:22:14 vile
0:22:15 and also rolands was old euphoric it's
0:22:20 not it's hard to describe Johnny gives
0:22:23 you a piercing stare
0:22:26 locking eyes
0:22:29 Rowlands was real old
0:22:31 sometimes weird things happen with that
0:22:34 I'll keep an eye on it but I did have
0:22:37 some practice with a demon for the last
0:22:39 30 days or so
0:22:40 I don't know if it makes me feel any
0:22:42 better about that well it is what it is
0:22:45 um at this point do you need do you need
0:22:48 anything
0:22:50 I imagine that you're
0:22:52 Beast probably is
0:22:54 seated it's
0:22:57 quiet
0:22:58 but things need to happen
0:23:01 we need to capitalize on this Johnny
0:23:03 looks down around to see if he can spot
0:23:06 miles's glasses you find his glasses are
0:23:10 they spared the Carnage
0:23:12 they are a bit of Ash but that's it he
0:23:15 bends down picks him up wipes him off on
0:23:18 his uh flannel and passes him over to
0:23:20 miles oh that survived
0:23:22 looks like your Luck's holding out he
0:23:25 places them on takes them off cleans
0:23:27 them puts them back on Johnny steps away
0:23:30 while he's making sure his glasses are
0:23:33 up to his standard and takes a few Paces
0:23:35 over to the wall safe
0:23:37 channeling his potents and a little bit
0:23:40 of his own blood Johnny is going to try
0:23:43 and rip the wall safe off its Mount the
0:23:45 door of the wall safe give me a strength
0:23:49 Athletics your difficulty for this role
0:23:52 is seven can I spend blood to make the
0:23:54 potents just uh Auto successes or no yes
0:23:57 we can yeah
0:24:00 we're looking at 11 successes okay You
0:24:04 Yank the safe out of the slot that it
0:24:07 was built into I would allowed thunk
0:24:10 hits the floor so I was trying to just
0:24:12 rip the door off there's the whole the
0:24:14 whole thing comes out the whole thing
0:24:15 comes out the door itself is like kind
0:24:17 of cracked in a jar Johnny uh will push
0:24:21 open the door and take a look inside the
0:24:23 safe opening the door you find what
0:24:27 looks to be predominantly records
0:24:31 notes various reports from past sheriffs
0:24:34 a lot of the secrets of New Haven
0:24:38 are laid bare where the lupines are
0:24:41 found
0:24:42 all of it after a cursory glance Johnny
0:24:46 Scoops up all of the Intel we'll walk
0:24:49 over offer it to Miles your grace
0:24:56 miles takes the papers
0:24:58 briefly flips through them
0:25:00 this is some stuff
0:25:02 I think it'd be better if we left with
0:25:04 that we don't want any chance of falling
0:25:06 into anybody else's hands that's fair I
0:25:09 don't think anybody would be coming here
0:25:11 yet but you never know the vultures can
0:25:15 often move faster than you think
0:25:17 he looks around for something to like
0:25:19 place them in like a bag or something
0:25:22 like that it's a briefcase or something
0:25:24 I don't know you'll have to search
0:25:26 outside the room yeah yeah I'll I'll
0:25:28 find you something for that Johnny
0:25:30 Johnny heads out and goes to grab
0:25:32 something he had a chance to kind of
0:25:34 like survey the rest of the area so he
0:25:37 probably can find something pretty
0:25:38 quickly yep it's like four briefcases
0:25:41 worth of stuff
0:25:42 well he dusts himself off he picks up
0:25:46 the bag after they've deposited the
0:25:48 papers in the briefcases
0:25:50 we have to get back
0:25:51 we need to make sure his goals don't
0:25:54 flee
0:25:56 or do anything
0:25:59 uh extreme
0:26:01 you never know how ghoul is going to
0:26:02 react in a situation like this right you
0:26:05 let me know who who I can Wrangle up and
0:26:07 pick up and I'll get on it uh they
0:26:09 should all be in my former Haven so we
0:26:11 should go back there and we should get
0:26:13 ready because I'm going to start calling
0:26:15 co-ed together do it soon as you can
0:26:18 I'm sure that nobody yet knows what
0:26:21 happens here but I would be surprised as
0:26:23 hell if the web didn't already know
0:26:25 something was up
0:26:27 we're gonna get moving Johnny nods and
0:26:30 we'll head out with a few of the
0:26:32 briefcases we've collected and make uh
0:26:35 make his moves out to the the Suburban
0:26:38 we took here yeah to the Suburban that
0:26:39 we took all right as you guys are doing
0:26:41 all that can I get an investigation roll
0:26:42 from both of you of course perception
0:26:44 investigation yes please uh difficulty
0:26:47 this roll is seven I will spend a
0:26:48 willpower on it
0:26:50 and I'm curious if the fact that Johnny
0:26:53 is a bully boy if there is any kind of
0:26:55 overlap between that position and this
0:26:58 particular kind of Investigation you're
0:27:00 looking for yep I'm going to give you a
0:27:01 two-day bonus beautiful great um if I
0:27:04 have no investigation I should not roll
0:27:05 correct all right I'll put these dice
0:27:07 back we're looking at three successes
0:27:09 okay with three successes you find a
0:27:14 file named Brittany
0:27:17 hmm
0:27:18 so as he's loading the papers into the
0:27:21 uh the briefcases he stops and kind of
0:27:23 just look blinks a few times looking at
0:27:25 the Britney file and we'll flip open the
0:27:28 cover and take a look at what he's found
0:27:30 inside you find images of Britta out and
0:27:36 about with the cordery hunting
0:27:38 her Haven all these like kind of
0:27:41 old-fashioned photos taken of her
0:27:43 and it kind of talks about the various
0:27:45 reasons that she is suspected of being
0:27:47 in connection with the web you see signs
0:27:50 of her involvement
0:27:53 with operation Longbow some of it seems
0:27:56 like a bit of a stretch and while they
0:27:59 don't seem to be aware of certain truths
0:28:02 that the cautery has discovered about
0:28:03 her
0:28:04 they do know for sure that something is
0:28:07 up and in it Upton Rowlands is advised to
0:28:11 lock her down with a blood bond in order
0:28:13 to protect
0:28:15 the interests of his court
0:28:19 who's the one that's advised him to do
0:28:21 this
0:28:22 the author of the reports that have been
0:28:25 submitted it is advised by Fester who
0:28:28 has the corduroy's electronics on tap
0:28:31 adapt enrollments request
0:28:34 the oldest picture in here of Britta
0:28:38 when is that
0:28:40 the oldest picture that it shows of
0:28:44 Bretta is the group of you piling into a
0:28:49 vehicle getting ready to head for Hell
0:28:52 House
0:28:54 okay
0:28:55 Johnny closes the folder
0:28:58 and hands it to Miles as he packs up the
0:29:01 rest of the uh of the info looks like
0:29:04 the uh looks like I was right about the
0:29:06 web they definitely probably know
0:29:07 something's up already
0:29:09 looks like they've been keeping closer
0:29:10 tabs on us than we think
0:29:12 might as well flip through the folder
0:29:14 well this explains a few things
0:29:17 I guess we'll need to have words with
0:29:18 Fester
0:29:19 getting the courtesy of words huh he
0:29:22 seems to be trying to protect the domain
0:29:24 I have an appreciation for that and
0:29:26 that's why your prince not me
0:29:29 let's go
0:29:31 good find now that everything's packed
0:29:33 up we'll head out to the Suburbans

0:33:56 leads you down to the dungeon and as you
0:34:00 took me a minute
0:34:03 head down to the space where there are
0:34:05 literal cells and people are being held
0:34:08 in them uh he approaches a young woman
0:34:11 all of them have these like collars are
0:34:14 on their necks uh on the wall over there
0:34:16 is the chains can you grab it real quick
0:34:18 for me buddy uh yeah I do sure how many
0:34:21 do just one or what what's yeah I figure
0:34:23 I'll just I'll wrestle one down we'll
0:34:24 bring them out and uh basically we serve
0:34:28 Refreshments uh for the elders to enjoy
0:34:31 and uh someone is they're happy we can
0:34:35 kind of do whatever we want we can enjoy
0:34:36 the music we can hang out underneath the
0:34:38 Stars I know you love that [ __ ] and do
0:34:41 just have a good time
0:34:42 uh yeah Neil
0:34:45 now that he's here like anybody who is
0:34:49 pouring like prying into Neil's head
0:34:52 would just see his mind racing
0:34:54 but externally he just goes over and
0:34:59 picks a chain up off the wall
0:35:01 and brings it back over to Fester uh
0:35:04 grab a walkie too you don't really see
0:35:07 what what are you talking what what I I
0:35:09 got it I get it don't worry oh okay he
0:35:12 kind of wanders off and so you're just
0:35:14 standing there holding a chain
0:35:15 and after a few moments he returns and
0:35:18 he has a walkie-talkie approaches you
0:35:21 and he's like hey you hold on to this
0:35:23 okay it's basically guys running a
0:35:26 perimeter watching the whole place in
0:35:27 the event of danger okay
0:35:29 listen to it let me know if you if
0:35:32 there's any trouble okay if there's
0:35:33 trouble worry about it then in the
0:35:35 meantime you give me the chain and
0:35:37 you'll just immediately pushes it over
0:35:40 all right and we're just gonna walk
0:35:42 around to serve refreshments
0:35:44 yeah okay yep all right
0:35:48 and not really knowing what to do with
0:35:50 the walkie-talkie uh Neil turns the
0:35:53 volume down low-ish
0:35:55 it's got good hearing he'll keep an ear
0:35:57 out for
0:35:59 [ __ ] thank you fester for handing me
0:36:02 an information module uh but he'll try
0:36:05 and like clip it on his belt like kind
0:36:06 of like out of the way just not really
0:36:09 sure what to do with it
0:36:10 and sort of Clips it down because uh
0:36:13 okay actually is this one of the ones
0:36:14 that has like the earpiece okay Neil
0:36:18 will clip it inside of his jacket and
0:36:20 then run the earpiece up and put the
0:36:22 earpiece in his left ear and then turn
0:36:24 and look at faster and give him finger
0:36:27 guns
0:36:28 all right man uh let's go
0:36:31 uh yeah let's go collects the chain onto
0:36:34 this hapless mortal and gives you finger
0:36:37 guns in return and then with like a
0:36:39 harsh tug he starts dragging the girl
0:36:42 out who tries to hold on to the bars so
0:36:44 that she isn't forced out of the the
0:36:46 confinements that she's in but uh he
0:36:49 just overpowers her and the three of you
0:36:51 start heading upstairs Neil is
0:36:54 trying very hard to keep his expression
0:36:57 calm I'm gonna take care of this he like
0:37:00 grabs her and you see kind of the light
0:37:04 go out of her eyes in terms of her
0:37:06 willingness to resist and once she's
0:37:09 complacent he starts walking up the
0:37:11 steps
0:37:12 under his breath in the old just goes
0:37:15 it's not really what I was talking about
0:37:17 even even in his low Humanity even in
0:37:21 his Newfound lack of care
0:37:24 I mean Neil's the kind of guy who gets
0:37:26 too anxious to feed off people who
0:37:29 aren't asleep so like
0:37:31 clasping people in irons and parading
0:37:34 them around is unnerving for him but he
0:37:38 is doing his best to follow along and
0:37:42 just maintain that facade and under his
0:37:44 breath is just still giving that Mantra
0:37:47 of the cuttery's names and how who he
0:37:51 thinks he's supposed to be like right
0:37:52 now back straight he follows Fester up
0:37:55 into the party as you head into the
0:37:56 party you see a group of Nosferatu
0:37:59 creeping around the Gathering and sort
0:38:01 of just
0:38:02 taking in this weird gleeve they seem to
0:38:06 find in them being able to watch all
0:38:09 these conversations while they
0:38:10 themselves remain unseen
0:38:12 Neil has been around the Nosferatu long
0:38:16 enough and has been someone like that
0:38:18 himself to know that like it's it's it's
0:38:22 rude and unexpected to be pointed out
0:38:25 that you're not as obfuscated as you
0:38:27 think you are sure it doesn't want to
0:38:30 you know 100 give that kind of stuff
0:38:31 away
0:38:32 however does anybody like look at him
0:38:36 specifically or is he managing just to
0:38:39 be sort of like not obfuscated in the
0:38:41 discipline sense but like obscuring
0:38:44 himself just like I'm not descript and
0:38:46 just kind of hanging out yeah people
0:38:47 seem to kind of uh Overlook you but not
0:38:51 in a uh condescending dismissive sort of
0:38:54 way just you fit in great so he'll just
0:38:57 not point out the mass presence of
0:39:00 Nosferatu creeping around listening to
0:39:01 people
0:39:02 and while he's following fester and like
0:39:06 kind of keeping up chatter or we'll
0:39:08 we'll try and actually be helpful in
0:39:10 that sommelier sort of way of like uh
0:39:14 the person might this just sort of
0:39:16 pointing around at any moment that
0:39:18 Fester looks like he's not sure where
0:39:20 maybe he should go but while he's doing
0:39:22 so his eyes are just
0:39:24 sweeping the crowd as best he can for
0:39:27 Britta or for Roman pend dragon as you
0:39:30 sweep through the area
0:39:32 uh one you notice that a number of the
0:39:35 torreador from the New Haven domain are
0:39:37 present like no no like two or three but
0:39:40 not not uh not zero which is really kind
0:39:43 of what you came here expecting yeah and
0:39:46 they seem to be playing Lookout in a
0:39:49 very uh subtle fashion for Elsa Linden
0:39:53 who seems to be having a very serious
0:39:55 conversation with Roman Pendragon but
0:39:59 there's no sign of Britta
0:40:01 that gives meal pause both seeing Elsa
0:40:04 and a small Lookout retinue at all here
0:40:07 was something he did not expect he
0:40:10 expected to be completely alone here
0:40:12 other than like professor and hopefully
0:40:15 Britta then seeing her talking to Roman
0:40:17 Pendragon is also sort of like what the
0:40:20 hell's going on here and then not seeing
0:40:23 Britta at all Neil doesn't actually break
0:40:25 out into a sweat but it's just like okay
0:40:28 uh well what do I do here
0:40:30 and looks at Fester
0:40:32 I was like hey um
0:40:35 what about them they
0:40:37 they might be hungry keep tensions down
0:40:39 oh [ __ ] you want me to just walk up to a
0:40:42 Roman pen Dragon I thought you said your
0:40:44 job was too give me a second
0:40:46 do you want me to do it
0:40:48 uh yeah [ __ ] yeah here
0:40:50 uh you hold the chain I'm gonna keep you
0:40:53 company okay and just relax
0:40:57 okay and whatever you do
0:41:01 make sure we look cool this is this is
0:41:03 someone I want to be impressive to if
0:41:05 I've learned anything from miles
0:41:09 and he sort of looks deliberately and
0:41:12 faster when he says miles and honestly
0:41:13 Johnny and when and but basically every
0:41:16 member of the country with me
0:41:18 um half of looking cool is just the
0:41:20 confidence that you're cool that's what
0:41:22 Miles said anyways my Neil his miles is
0:41:26 such a big [ __ ] biceps

0:41:34 he's a big guy yeah he's a yeah sure
0:41:38 um miles has never said that to Neil as
0:41:40 far as I know uh but Neil is just in
0:41:43 this like gotta fake it till you make it
0:41:45 mindset and is just bullshitting he was
0:41:48 like all right yeah um
0:41:51 yeah hang out man
0:41:52 um
0:41:53 Let's uh let's do this and Neil with the
0:41:56 earpiece in and his
0:42:00 tuxedo and makeup and roguelock
0:42:03 straightens his spine even more as much
0:42:06 as he can Neil not a short guy once he
0:42:08 actually has not terrible posture
0:42:11 takes the chain from fester and just
0:42:14 doesn't walk like directly across the
0:42:16 dance floor like an idiot but like makes
0:42:18 his way over towards Roman and Elsa and
0:42:23 the toriador
0:42:25 and
0:42:27 trying to manifest that confidence out
0:42:30 of nowhere
0:42:31 confronts his worst fear which is a high
0:42:34 group of me and toriador who have been
0:42:36 mean to me and walks over and goes
0:42:41 could I interested in anyone in some
0:42:44 refreshments
0:42:46 totally old like just talking over
0:42:49 whatever conversation is happening as he
0:42:51 approaches in that like the waiter who
0:42:53 wants to refill your glass when you did
0:42:55 not ask him to kind of way
0:42:57 as you're approaching
0:42:59 you can hear Elsa saying to Roman that
0:43:05 can you cannot just have an outburst if
0:43:08 he wants to speak with her fine I don't
0:43:11 think she's in any sort of danger
0:43:13 whatever it is your plan is remains
0:43:15 intact
0:43:16 so please don't do it
0:43:20 and Roman
0:43:22 looks at you
0:43:24 and I need a courage test oh yeah
0:43:26 absolutely
0:43:27 there's been willpower on this you may
0:43:30 but he just looks and that's enough
0:43:32 that's all and already in a bad mood you
0:43:36 interrupt 100 Elsa trying to talk him
0:43:39 down yeah no it's oh absolutely uh I
0:43:42 will 100 spend that willpower
0:43:45 foreign
0:43:47 what's the difficulty you want on this
0:43:49 your difficulty is eight then I have two
0:43:52 successes
0:43:54 him just looking at you oh he's still
0:43:56 here he makes your Beast
0:43:59 beg you to flee in a full-blown rat
0:44:02 Shrek
0:44:04 I'm sorry good evening everyone uh
0:44:07 would anyone care for some refreshment
0:44:11 Elsa
0:44:13 turns and looks at you
0:44:17 laughs
0:44:19 and much like the Romans has a raised
0:44:23 eyebrow at your presence
0:44:26 she raises an eyebrow at your presence
0:44:29 what are you doing
0:44:33 offering
0:44:35 a snack
0:44:36 she tries not to
0:44:39 [Laughter]
0:44:47 but there's this Panic to giggle
0:44:49 I think I'm submerged just like like a
0:44:52 like a [ __ ] here we are
0:44:55 laughs
0:44:58 Roman does not laugh yeah I wouldn't
0:45:01 imagine he doesn't
0:45:03 he reaches out
0:45:05 grasps the Mortal that you have held by
0:45:09 a chain
0:45:10 and he bites into her
0:45:13 and her body makes this jolting motion
0:45:17 as veins burst and her arteries kind of
0:45:22 like start to give at the harshness with
0:45:26 which he draws Vitae from her
0:45:28 and
0:45:29 when her eyes start to flutter
0:45:32 he lets her go cleans off his lips but
0:45:35 does not bother to click the wound and
0:45:37 looks at you
0:45:39 good evening princess dragon
0:45:41 Miss Lyndon
0:45:43 it's a pleasure to see both of you
0:45:45 those who are here to serve as servants
0:45:47 do not speak
0:45:49 technically I'm a guest
0:45:51 then why are you holding the chain
0:45:52 because I'm doing a favor for a friend
0:45:55 I see
0:45:57 and that favors to act in the capacity
0:45:59 of a servant well let's see you should
0:46:02 be quiet why not
0:46:04 he turns and walks away from you and
0:46:07 Elsa
0:46:09 Fester kind of like huh that was that
0:46:11 was uh not exactly what I uh so was that
0:46:15 good
0:46:16 I mean you're supposed to
0:46:19 Surf and he is an elder who was served I
0:46:23 see that as a success
0:46:26 why am I so afraid
0:46:28 uh you know can I get the train sure man
0:46:31 yeah okay absolutely all right thank you
0:46:32 uh Elsa looks to the two of you so
0:46:37 a matter of interest for you
0:46:40 as Grace
0:46:42 Prince Warwick was aware
0:46:44 of the arrival of your companion
0:46:47 and what looked previously as though
0:46:51 Roman Pendragon had an interest in Britta
0:46:55 has evolved into Warwick knowing who she
0:46:58 is
0:46:59 there a reason
0:47:02 that Warwick might want to speak with
0:47:03 her in private
0:47:05 Neil
0:47:07 size looks around
0:47:10 I um
0:47:12 I guess that
0:47:15 depends
0:47:17 on what kinds of questions he might want
0:47:20 to ask her
0:47:21 Neil was like too shaken up just by this
0:47:24 whole social scenario to like really
0:47:26 fully hide that he probably can think of
0:47:30 a couple of reasons why Warwick might
0:47:32 want to talk about Britta but he's
0:47:35 absolutely not saying him out loud
0:47:38 Anil
0:47:39 yeah
0:47:41 um how long have you been in the
0:47:42 camarilla
0:47:43 30 years for 30 years you have walked
0:47:47 among the camera
0:47:48 you have come to understand that privacy
0:47:52 does not exist yeah but Elegance does
0:47:58 um
0:47:59 what needs to be said needs to be said
0:48:04 so say it
0:48:05 in a way that will help brother and not
0:48:08 damn her but say it
0:48:11 honestly I just didn't want her to be
0:48:15 alone here and I came to get her out and
0:48:17 I
0:48:20 Neil looks outside there's like huge ass
0:48:23 windows in here right oh yeah he looks
0:48:25 outside and his eyes flick towards the
0:48:28 Moon
0:48:29 and then back to Elsa and he goes
0:48:33 you know I spent a lot of time looking
0:48:34 at the stars
0:48:36 and you're right there are no secrets
0:48:39 everything can be found if you know how
0:48:40 to ask the right questions and
0:48:43 sometimes people wonder where we came
0:48:46 from I had a conversation once where
0:48:50 someone told me
0:48:52 and Bretta more told Brett I was
0:48:54 listening that
0:48:57 sometimes you are
0:48:59 enslaved to where you came from
0:49:02 and it is difficult the more you learn
0:49:07 to cut your own path and be your own
0:49:09 person
0:49:10 and I think
0:49:12 she's done a damn good job
0:49:15 in the last few tumultuous months
0:49:19 of being a member of the camarilla being
0:49:22 her own person
0:49:23 but that doesn't mean
0:49:26 people don't want to ask
0:49:28 about what it is they think she might
0:49:32 know and his eyes drop from the Moon
0:49:34 down to the dark water when we return to
0:49:37 New Haven
0:49:39 I would like to speak with you and see
0:49:43 to it that you are publicly rewarded for
0:49:47 the aid that you gave me some months ago
0:49:49 I have not forgotten I am
0:49:52 you and I haven't really had a chance to
0:49:53 talk recently I I just
0:49:56 I feel like I need you to know that I
0:49:59 didn't do that looking for Boons
0:50:03 or public acknowledgment maybe naively
0:50:07 maybe idiotically I did it because we
0:50:09 said we would
0:50:11 and when I set my mind to keeping my
0:50:14 word I do
0:50:16 I didn't do it for reward I did it
0:50:19 because that's who I am and I am much
0:50:21 more interested in
0:50:23 honest friendship than I am in that sort
0:50:27 of thing
0:50:28 maybe I'm an idiot but that's
0:50:30 me
0:50:31 I need you to make me a promise then
0:50:34 if I can
0:50:36 again right at home
0:50:39 I'm gonna try
0:50:41 not yet
0:50:43 put it at home
0:50:45 when she's finished
0:50:47 with what she needs to do
0:50:50 what does she need to do
0:50:51 I don't know
0:50:53 so what are you and Roman were talking
0:50:54 about what she needs to do for Roman uh
0:50:57 Prince Pendragon he looks around like oh
0:50:59 my god did somebody hear me say
0:51:01 just Roman
0:51:03 I don't know
0:51:05 what it is that brother needs to do
0:51:09 but I'm here
0:51:11 because I saw her here
0:51:14 okay
0:51:18 okay if I could see her I could figure
0:51:21 it out I could
0:51:23 where is she oh so what is that smell
0:51:26 it's um
0:51:28 [Laughter]
0:51:29 it's uh wolf Panther
0:51:32 uh Fester likes it he he wanted us to
0:51:37 have matching sense so I I I I you know
0:51:40 I didn't want to sneak in so I'm his I
0:51:42 need to go excuse me sure yeah okay
0:51:45 it's blocks away that little smell
0:51:48 comment like breaks Neil's nerve it's
0:51:52 like the final little straw that just
0:51:54 it's like okay this is too much I I
0:51:56 don't [ __ ] and fester like went back
0:51:58 downstairs right like took the so Neil's
0:52:01 just alone at this party now he has no
0:52:04 idea what to do
0:52:05 from this point
0:52:07 and just
0:52:09 looks out the window
0:52:11 up to the stars and just he's not
0:52:15 casting a spell or anything he just goes
0:52:18 please please please give me some sort
0:52:21 of sign
0:52:23 I got this far and I don't know what to
0:52:24 do
0:52:26 and he looks back down
0:52:28 Warwick has Britta not knowing where that
0:52:32 is in this Mansion right now or the fact
0:52:34 that if he just bursts in
0:52:36 [ __ ] dead probably and the fact that
0:52:41 Elsa was like let her do what she needs
0:52:42 to do and then get her the hell out of
0:52:43 here Neil does the unthinkable
0:52:47 and for the time being
0:52:50 goes to mingle
0:52:53 when you look out over the water
0:52:55 you see
0:52:57 like a half dozen speed boats I don't
0:53:00 know the water just kind of
0:53:01 filling there at night at night hmm
0:53:05 and that's kind of when you hear like
0:53:08 a little gasp as fast as like oh oh no
0:53:12 and the Mortal that he kept on a chain
0:53:15 has fainted from apparent blood loss
0:53:18 and he's like oh sorry about that guys
0:53:20 uh you know this kind of stuff happens
0:53:22 you know tree specs all that and uh he
0:53:25 just kind of pins down to pick her up uh
0:53:28 and smudges a bit of blood on his like
0:53:30 shirt and gets this look of panic like
0:53:33 friend help I look like an idiot
0:53:36 Neil floats over
0:53:38 trying his best to help his friend right
0:53:40 and just
0:53:41 hey man it's an opportunity to show him
0:53:44 just pick her up okay
0:53:46 let's pick her up and he takes a thumb
0:53:49 because he did uh Roman did not lick the
0:53:52 wounds right like there's still blood
0:53:53 all over was Fester wearing a white
0:53:55 shirt he was Neil takes his thumb
0:53:59 and in a move very similar to how he's
0:54:02 moved in private before as a blood
0:54:05 sorcerer rubs his thumb along the blood
0:54:08 on the woman's neck and then say traces
0:54:12 a bloody thumbprint on the white flower
0:54:14 on the boutonniere that he got for him
0:54:16 and just looks at him and goes
0:54:18 now you match
0:54:20 his eyes
0:54:22 he has a [ __ ] Neal
0:54:24 and he claps him on the back just like
0:54:28 just take her downstairs bring somebody
0:54:30 out you got this just show off how
0:54:33 strong you are yeah the little man gives
0:54:35 a nod and just casually lifts this
0:54:38 Mortal yeah and wanders off of there was
0:54:41 that like I don't know why I'm picturing
0:54:43 that like fully in the middle of the
0:54:45 dance floor like an idiot but like yeah
0:54:46 so that leaves Neil just standing in the
0:54:48 middle of the dance floor yeah who is
0:54:51 around you recognize the infamous
0:54:54 mulcavian William Biltmore who is sort
0:54:57 of just standing in people watching
0:54:59 uh and his love for
0:55:01 um yes for some reason his odd behavior
0:55:05 is taken as absurd Charisma beyond that
0:55:08 you catch Roman heading up the stairs
0:55:12 off to wherever wherever it is that
0:55:16 Warwick has taken Britta
0:55:18 no she's got to do what she's got to do
0:55:21 Neil takes a little cloth out of spot
0:55:23 like his little like red silk like
0:55:26 pocket square leans down wipes the
0:55:28 little bit of blood that probably fell
0:55:29 onto the floor uh up tucks it back into
0:55:32 his pocket and then just walks off the
0:55:35 dance floor with sort of like go ahead
0:55:37 and continue everyone kind of motion and
0:55:41 then just starts following Roman as you
0:55:44 get up to the stairs there are guards
0:55:46 that kind of bar passage but the door is
0:55:50 in sight and you can kind of faintly
0:55:52 hear the sounds of conversation
0:55:55 and Roman opens the door slips in and
0:55:59 closes it behind him
0:56:01 with Neil's senses
0:56:04 can I make out what that conversation is
0:56:06 you may listen I will listen okay and
0:56:09 just kind of linger I guess we're in the
0:56:11 front hall right he will just sort of
0:56:13 linger in the front hall it's only a big
0:56:15 fountain or something in here some sort
0:56:17 of thing to look at yes uh and he will
0:56:20 just stand there fully checked out
0:56:23 and listen
0:56:26 to whatever's going on behind that door
0:56:31 [Music]
0:56:35 but is escorted to her room
0:56:37 it is a
0:56:39 lavish meaning space that has been
0:56:42 carefully arranged and Warwick
0:56:46 who enters along with Bretta
0:56:50 is not alone in the room
0:56:53 and at this table seated is a pair of
0:56:56 individuals
0:56:57 one of them
0:56:59 is a young man
0:57:01 with blonde hair and these kind of like
0:57:04 light hazel eyes
0:57:06 and he
0:57:07 is rather well dressed but is dressed
0:57:11 like
0:57:12 like in a thief chic
0:57:15 sort of fashion not really dressed for a
0:57:18 party
0:57:19 and beside him also not dressed for a
0:57:22 party
0:57:23 as a cowled figure
0:57:25 who seems to have no hair
0:57:28 and when he sees you he smiles wide
0:57:34 revealing a serrated fangs
0:57:38 from ear to ear
0:57:41 that stops pretty pretty well in her
0:57:44 tracks and her
0:57:46 eyes go a bit wide looking from the man
0:57:50 with the wide teeth does he look like
0:57:54 her memories or does he just he looks
0:57:57 exactly like your memories then her
0:57:59 steps halt completely she was intending
0:58:02 to follow Warwick into the room she had
0:58:05 a whole plan of Grace
0:58:07 but then that pause is unmistakable at
0:58:10 the smile and the reveal
0:58:12 she looks over the man with a blonde
0:58:15 hair
0:58:15 to trying to determine if there's
0:58:18 anything familiar about him but her eyes
0:58:21 keep flicking back to the teeth
0:58:23 the man with the teeth
0:58:25 speaks in this tongue that you know to
0:58:29 be the language gamalish
0:58:31 but do not know its exact meaning and
0:58:34 you find yourself walking to a seat
0:58:37 sitting down scooting in and turning to
0:58:42 look at the two strangers Bretta blank
0:58:45 says she realized she's scooted in that
0:58:48 she has moved entirely without realizing
0:58:52 recognition
0:58:53 more comments looking at you Britta
0:58:57 glances back to Warwick but
0:59:00 frankly as scariest work is uh her fear
0:59:04 has gone primarily towards the man with
0:59:07 the with the many teeth and she waits to
0:59:09 be spoken to before commenting herself
0:59:12 work speaks
0:59:14 your companions have joined me here this
0:59:17 evening
0:59:18 to discuss the matter
0:59:20 of Hell House
0:59:22 as I understand it you and your
0:59:25 quarterly are the only individuals who
0:59:28 travels to this place
0:59:31 fought the thing that resides there and
0:59:34 survived to speak of it is this correct
0:59:39 we've been inside your grace and we
0:59:42 fought
0:59:43 a Revenant who was taking care of the
0:59:48 thing inside but we haven't been that
0:59:51 deep in Mr zantosa yes an associate of
0:59:54 my child's source of information
0:59:56 regarding the house
0:59:58 since the intervention of your cautery I
1:00:01 have lost
1:00:02 a bit of track regarding its development
1:00:06 tell me what you found there
1:00:09 Bretta keeps her eyes down Cass At The
1:00:11 Mention Of The Death of Shah inside
1:00:15 there were
1:00:16 many strange creatures that were feeding
1:00:19 it seemed that Mr xantosa had been
1:00:23 bringing them
1:00:25 a constant Supply
1:00:27 and he had said that he was feeding
1:00:31 what was in the house
1:00:33 as well he had documents that probably
1:00:36 were for you
1:00:38 um
1:00:40 we haven't been
1:00:42 back since
1:00:43 not more than just passingly and you
1:00:46 have not maintained any ongoing
1:00:48 investigation into the thing that you
1:00:50 found there the sentience whatever
1:00:54 Consciousness what can you tell me of
1:00:56 the thing that is there
1:00:57 it seems to be a piece of a bigger hole
1:01:00 tell me of its connection to New York
1:01:03 in the research that my codery did we
1:01:06 it seemed that that peace is a part of
1:01:11 something buried beneath New York and
1:01:13 that
1:01:14 that thing affects the other planes I
1:01:17 wish to understand
1:01:19 you visited her house you fought to the
1:01:22 thing that resides there you did all of
1:01:25 these things
1:01:26 including attaining the fragments of the
1:01:29 book of Nod then Mr zentos are
1:01:32 maintained there
1:01:33 and with all of this knowledge there's
1:01:35 access to this mystery
1:01:38 your quarterly did what with it
1:01:40 we've been hoping to find a way to fight
1:01:42 Hell House
1:01:44 whatever's in there we weren't able to
1:01:47 take
1:01:48 what we fought in there was the goal
1:01:51 Sentosa we didn't see really what was
1:01:54 inside as I understand the gold Sentosa
1:01:57 was embraced
1:01:59 made into a bruja intended to be gifted
1:02:02 to Mr pendragon's Army
1:02:04 what then we never received the zantosa
1:02:08 Mr santosa is currently in a in the
1:02:11 possession of
1:02:13 Mr Reiss
1:02:15 Mr Reiss
1:02:17 of the premiere intriguing
1:02:20 take off your gloves
1:02:23 Britta doesn't mean to pause as long as
1:02:25 she does and even as she starts to
1:02:29 follow the command
1:02:30 cheese starts with the right hand and
1:02:33 the door opens
1:02:34 she pauses the upper length glove has
1:02:37 made it down to the wrists of her right
1:02:40 hand but her hand freezes atop her
1:02:43 wrists to look to the door
1:02:45 seeing what you're doing Roman looks at
1:02:47 you and raises an eyebrow the gloves
1:02:49 stay on
1:02:50 he turns his attention to Warwick the
1:02:52 story at work arrived with me as you
1:02:55 will remain within me and it is only out
1:02:57 of respect for your domain
1:02:59 that I did not react harshly
1:03:02 to her attempt to take her
1:03:04 Bretta rolls her sleeve back up slowly
1:03:08 as if the motion itself could add fire
1:03:10 to the situation keeping her eyes sound
1:03:13 cast from both Pendragon and from
1:03:15 Warwick
1:03:16 looking very much like she wants to slip
1:03:19 away Warrick shifts in a seat and
1:03:23 regards Roman Pendragon for a long time
1:03:25 before speaking
1:03:27 Mr Pendragon you are a valued Ally
1:03:31 and fellow companion of operation
1:03:33 Longboat
1:03:35 however are you aware of the importance
1:03:37 of this car and her association with
1:03:41 Mysteries dating back to the very
1:03:43 beginning of Kindred existence
1:03:46 Roman shakes his head no and I do not
1:03:50 care
1:03:50 all that matters for the time being is
1:03:53 that you have impuned on what is mine
1:03:55 bread is saying completely so it doesn't
1:03:58 take a genius to figure out that her
1:04:00 attention is so closely on this
1:04:02 conversation but it's like if she can
1:04:05 just say still enough that she might be
1:04:07 immune from it like she'll just become a
1:04:10 part of the air and not have to be
1:04:11 present but she's doing her best to keep
1:04:16 her expression
1:04:17 blank subservient despite that there is
1:04:21 a look of
1:04:23 Amusement on the blonde man that is
1:04:27 watching the conversation go
1:04:30 well it seems that this meeting has
1:04:32 become complicated and I think they're
1:04:35 fighting over you he says kind of
1:04:37 looking at you when he speaks by the way
1:04:40 you can hear by the others present him
1:04:43 saying oh we do not wish to cause any
1:04:46 trouble this is oh you're simply here to
1:04:49 speak and mean no offense bretta's eyes
1:04:52 widen before she can catch it it breaks
1:04:55 through the mask that she's been putting
1:04:57 up but uh thankfully her eyes are still
1:04:59 mostly directed towards the floor the
1:05:01 blonde man will absolutely be able to
1:05:03 catch that possibly his many tooth
1:05:05 companion but good for you
1:05:09 that's a full with the phrase good for
1:05:13 you that jilt spread his head up and she
1:05:16 makes full eye contact with this man
1:05:18 trying to figure out who he is
1:05:20 she knows the phrase she's heard it
1:05:22 before she's heard it in a nightclub
1:05:24 when she was confused and blank and that
1:05:28 Echo is not welcome
1:05:30 it is clear
1:05:31 that Warwick is watching you
1:05:34 assuming to have noticed what is
1:05:36 registering on your mind
1:05:38 Roman approaches and offers you his hand
1:05:42 Bretta takes it definitively
1:05:45 I'm sure they will apologize
1:05:47 but perhaps you can use some fresh air
1:05:50 thank you your grace
1:05:52 end with just incredibly disrespectful
1:05:56 body language towards these two
1:05:59 strangers
1:06:00 he ignores them completely and gives a
1:06:03 respectful nod to his ally Warwick who
1:06:07 nods in return accepting
1:06:10 Roman's Outburst Britta will duck her
1:06:13 head in respect
1:06:15 at the prompt
1:06:17 although her body language is shutting
1:06:19 away the two that uh
1:06:22 as far as she can as it's it's a
1:06:25 directed towards War
1:06:26 and he leads you out of the room as the
1:06:29 two of you descend down the stairs you
1:06:32 see Neil
1:06:33 as bretta's eyes land on nail there's
1:06:38 that
1:06:39 soft
1:06:40 soundless exhale of
1:06:43 almost frustration uh just everything
1:06:47 that's coming together in this scenario
1:06:49 is beginning to be so much but there's a
1:06:53 flash too of just being touched that
1:06:56 he's there and she pulls it back as
1:06:58 quickly as she can to not look at him in
1:07:02 that way of if she diverts her attention
1:07:04 elsewhere then maybe he won't feel that
1:07:06 her eyes landed on him and maybe he'll
1:07:08 he won't notice that she's there
1:07:11 I'll just
1:07:12 probably uselessly trying to protect him
1:07:15 clinging a bit more onto Rome and
1:07:17 pendragon's hand to accept his
1:07:19 leadership outside or wherever it would
1:07:22 go and the two of you step outside
1:07:27 [Music]
1:07:31 Mouse you have uh some announcements to
1:07:35 make sure the court at large but I
1:07:36 believe before that happens I plan on
1:07:40 straightening myself up a little bit
1:07:42 after the incident inside Rowlands uh
1:07:45 State and then I will give Elsa a call
1:07:49 to let her know that the problem has
1:07:52 been the the slight to the Tory door has
1:07:55 been rectified when you place your call
1:07:58 to Elsa Linden you hear uh what sounds
1:08:02 very uh very much like the the quality
1:08:05 of sound of like a cassette player
1:08:07 and
1:08:09 you hear Elsa's voice
1:08:12 explaining that she's not present at the
1:08:13 moment and asks you to please leave her
1:08:15 a message
1:08:17 Elsa uh this is Miles
1:08:19 the things that we talked about the
1:08:22 other day have uh come to pass the
1:08:26 issue with a Toreador has been rectified
1:08:29 and following up I am calling together
1:08:33 Court I hope to see or hear from you
1:08:36 soon
1:08:37 and then I hang out preparations are
1:08:39 made and Miles win and Johnny head to
1:08:44 the court to meet with the Kindred of
1:08:46 New Haven when you arrive there is
1:08:49 a majority of the Court
1:08:52 one person of interest is missing but
1:08:55 there are other members who almost never
1:08:58 attend elysium's reports who are in fact
1:09:01 present tonight
1:09:03 Elsa is nowhere to be found but as you
1:09:05 arrive the Tory door of Court greet you
1:09:08 pleasantly there are women who kind of
1:09:10 like tuck your their hands under your
1:09:12 arms
1:09:14 and the clan seems to stick pretty close
1:09:17 to you in addition to this
1:09:19 Rhys and seven of his Premier are
1:09:23 present that's a lot of his terminal
1:09:25 present here
1:09:26 coincidence
1:09:28 sounds like some left-hand [ __ ] if
1:09:31 I've ever heard it
1:09:32 great well
1:09:34 nice smiles and laughs with The Toreador
1:09:38 as we proceed to get Court organized uh
1:09:41 keeping an eye out on the premiere who's
1:09:43 present from Clan Nosferatu only Renwick
1:09:46 but he's usually when the Nosferatu are
1:09:50 at court it's only one or two of them
1:09:52 the rest seem to generally prefer to
1:09:56 hang out underground who is present from
1:09:59 Clan malkavian of the mulcavians only
1:10:02 the keeper of Elysium is present
1:10:04 dashwood is present the actual premium
1:10:07 uh she is not my interactions with
1:10:11 dashwood previously have been generally
1:10:12 neutral positive yeah
1:10:15 he seems kind of indifferent about most
1:10:17 uh local politics but does his job
1:10:20 confident got it what kind of spread of
1:10:23 the other bully boys are present
1:10:25 uh the bully boys are exactly uh they
1:10:29 normally are they you know they watch
1:10:31 the doors they kind of hang out with
1:10:33 each other some seem a little bored but
1:10:36 are doing their jobs and
1:10:38 um because I've got kind of a 50 50
1:10:40 relationship with the other bully boys
1:10:42 as far as I understand yeah they seem
1:10:44 like they're unaware that anything's
1:10:46 even going on so just kind of hanging
1:10:48 around gotcha we do some small talk and
1:10:52 glad handing
1:10:53 for a bit and then I will start moving
1:10:56 towards the raised uh stage Plateau
1:11:00 whatever this dice thank you days is it
1:11:04 the balcony where Arabella was it feels
1:11:07 weirdly poetic
1:11:08 it does I guess I'll make the
1:11:13 loud March upstairs Johnny will follow
1:11:17 him and position himself in a defensive
1:11:21 spot in case things start going wild I'm
1:11:25 going to be in a place to help defend
1:11:28 Miles when is actually weirdly
1:11:31 appropriate for the evening
1:11:33 she is wearing a white button down
1:11:35 rolled up to the elbows she has a vest
1:11:38 which clearly is not fitted to her
1:11:40 probably belongs to a guy from the
1:11:42 ostentatious nature of it it's probably
1:11:43 kabir's she has a man's dress pants on
1:11:46 and her her [ __ ] kickers and a pair of
1:11:49 aviator sunglasses [ __ ] yes
1:11:54 and
1:11:56 strutting but she is kind of keeping a
1:11:59 very weary eye especially when she
1:12:00 notices that number of premiere
1:12:03 she sticks her hands in her Pockets at
1:12:05 one point and is quietly giving the
1:12:07 finger to everybody in her pockets but
1:12:10 not unlike Johnny is just like okay if
1:12:12 shit's gonna go down it's probably gonna
1:12:13 be tonight so head on a swivel she does
1:12:17 keep a lookout to see if there are any
1:12:19 spirits in the area that are not
1:12:21 normally there any raids that [ __ ]
1:12:24 may have called in to
1:12:26 attack from other planes and she has a
1:12:29 gold chain around her neck looking
1:12:30 around for any kind of like unusual
1:12:31 behavior
1:12:33 do you see toriador kind of slipping in
1:12:36 and out of conversations
1:12:37 spreading a rumor the rumor of it is oh
1:12:41 my God
1:12:42 did you hear about how their quarterly
1:12:45 murdered members of the Sabbat just
1:12:49 brutally executed them
1:12:51 sending the Sabbat Running Oh My wind
1:12:55 does not flip them off
1:12:58 before they're so aggressive
1:13:00 um so dangerous wind grins a little bit
1:13:03 out of one corner of her mouth thank you
1:13:05 Toreador on our way up to the balcony
1:13:08 Johnny will uh put a hand on Miles
1:13:10 shoulder and uh kind of catch his eye
1:13:15 you've got this your grace
1:13:18 and spend a willpower to give him Iron
1:13:20 Will you feel like a total badass more I
1:13:25 was like I am I also spend blood to up
1:13:28 all of my physicals to six
1:13:30 all right so we continue up the stairs
1:13:33 we
1:13:35 survey for solid 60 seconds before I
1:13:38 wrap my Katana on the ground
1:13:42 to gain attention much like Reiss used
1:13:45 to do with his sword game
1:13:47 or Kane if you want to pretend
1:13:50 the court turns to you and as you go to
1:13:54 speak the doors open and a group starts
1:13:58 filing in and they are dressed in
1:14:03 kind of very mid-90s Street where like
1:14:06 bright blue jeans and like sneakers a
1:14:11 lot of it's kind of like a little worn
1:14:13 they have this tired look about them
1:14:16 like they've been journeying for a long
1:14:18 time and sort of at the head is this man
1:14:24 was a thick beard and keeps his head
1:14:28 covered and with a long coat on the big
1:14:32 thing that really stands out about this
1:14:34 guy is that they have he has completely
1:14:37 obsidian black skin and with this wary
1:14:42 look or weary look like just not like
1:14:45 trying to be menacing but just tired
1:14:47 right they shift to the side and sort of
1:14:51 wait to not be any more of an
1:14:54 interruption to whatever the Court's
1:14:56 proceedings are a lot of the Court
1:14:58 starts looking at them and they're like
1:14:59 ask them it's what why are we under are
1:15:02 we about to be under attack what's going
1:15:03 on and they look up to you
1:15:07 Court of New Haven it has come to my
1:15:10 attention
1:15:12 that Upton Rowlands is no longer able to
1:15:15 perform his duties as Prince
1:15:17 due to attacks from outside the domain
1:15:20 that has stricken him
1:15:21 and made him unstable and weakened him
1:15:25 have put him in a position where he is
1:15:29 unfit
1:15:30 to be Prince
1:15:32 on an unable
1:15:33 to lead this domain going forward
1:15:36 so I am here after our successful attack
1:15:40 on the Sabbat and multiple defenses of
1:15:43 this domain to claim Praxis
1:15:46 to be your prince of New Haven
1:15:49 to give you Safety and Security where I
1:15:51 can in these long nights
1:15:55 and I hope that you will support me
1:15:57 going forward as we deal with any
1:16:00 threats that may come to this city
1:16:04 there is
1:16:06 a long
1:16:08 silence
1:16:09 the kind that like sort of creeps into
1:16:12 you
1:16:13 and that you feel in your bones
1:16:16 and The Toreador move towards where you
1:16:19 are sort of between the court and you
1:16:21 and turn to face the court
1:16:24 indicating their loyalty on this matter
1:16:29 that they're standing with me the tramir
1:16:33 then approach The Toreador
1:16:36 and stand
1:16:38 by them turning to face the court in the
1:16:41 same gesture
1:16:43 it is then
1:16:45 that John Reiss approaches
1:16:48 sort of uh ending up somewhere between
1:16:50 the toridor and the chimer
1:16:53 bends the knee
1:16:55 Your Grace congratulations on your claim
1:16:58 of Praxis
1:17:00 I humbly request Hospitality for myself
1:17:03 and my clan mates who are here and then
1:17:05 behind him the court starts lining up
1:17:08 waiting for their turns to request
1:17:10 Hospitality from the new Prince of New
1:17:13 Haven
1:17:16 [Music]
1:17:19 Neil you see Roman and Beretta head down
1:17:26 the stairs leaving the meeting there's
1:17:28 something different about their body
1:17:30 language as they pass by somehow
1:17:33 whatever interaction that existed
1:17:36 between the two of them before has
1:17:38 shifted and become more perhaps
1:17:41 conspiratorial it's like she was dragged
1:17:44 to the initial meeting
1:17:45 but now they are leaving together
1:17:47 you see him lead her to the door and he
1:17:51 opens it for her she steps out he
1:17:53 follows and closes the door behind him
1:17:56 do they step outside of the house yes
1:17:58 they're headed outside Neil
1:18:01 Browns
1:18:03 and then hurries across the entrance
1:18:05 hall to the door he just closed just to
1:18:08 like blatantly follow after them in one
1:18:10 of those like oh hey wait a minute kind
1:18:12 of kind of motions uh but as he crosses
1:18:15 the front we'll just the earpiece and
1:18:17 the in the walkie that Fester gave him
1:18:19 that's supposedly hooked up to the
1:18:21 security channel right we'll just click
1:18:23 over as he's running across I go uh hey
1:18:26 do we know whose boats are out on the
1:18:27 water ah no not really
1:18:31 um
1:18:31 I can go ahead and take a look uh I'm
1:18:34 dealing with a little bit of a situation
1:18:35 though uh some of the outer patrols they
1:18:38 haven't responded in a few minutes and
1:18:40 we just want to make sure everything's
1:18:41 all right oh okay uh hold on don't don't
1:18:45 go out there
1:18:46 um hold hold hold a second and you know
1:18:49 we'll at that point like get to the
1:18:51 front door and open it up directly after
1:18:53 Pendragon and Beretta uh and hurry out
1:18:55 following them basically out into the
1:18:57 out into the night but uh
1:19:00 it was not my expectation that he would
1:19:02 do that
1:19:04 um
1:19:04 thank you thank you for thank you for
1:19:08 getting me out of there
1:19:09 was something on your mind
1:19:12 who were they
1:19:14 brittle looks down and
1:19:17 fiddles it's
1:19:19 clear that she's weighing the choice of
1:19:21 saying more but she looks back up eyes
1:19:24 flicking
1:19:25 to the ground to him
1:19:28 think I knew them before I lost my
1:19:31 memory I and she looks to his face
1:19:36 searching his expression for where he's
1:19:40 at emotionally
1:19:41 give me a perception plus empathy role
1:19:46 that difficulty oh well does my new spec
1:19:50 apply Lux
1:19:52 yes I should probably say unto the uh
1:19:55 say into the mic what that spec is
1:19:56 empathy villains yes
1:19:59 [Laughter]
1:20:02 I almost said care myself yeah Rebecca
1:20:05 turns and looks directly into camera
1:20:08 Rebecca's like whether the smuggish
1:20:10 version I should say what the spec is
1:20:13 shouldn't I shouldn't I
1:20:16 it's villains uh villains everyone hold
1:20:19 on let me make sure the mic is picking
1:20:21 that up just right uh villain sympathy
1:20:24 villains empathy Village
1:20:25 very thin line apparently between
1:20:27 embarrassed
1:20:29 I'm gonna start off with perception
1:20:32 empathy for the straight social world
1:20:36 five successes because willpower with
1:20:39 five successes
1:20:40 the only thing you're not sure of is
1:20:43 whether or not he sees you as a person
1:20:45 but you are certain that he disapproves
1:20:49 of the way that you are disrespected and
1:20:52 so far as it disrespected him and he is
1:20:57 reacting to the same way that someone
1:21:00 might care for a pet when treated by
1:21:06 like poorly by like a neighbor or if
1:21:09 they were in brief danger he's concerned
1:21:11 for you but it's not clear he certainly
1:21:14 isn't concerned for a peer and the
1:21:16 second row yep
1:21:20 for Aura perception that that will be a
1:21:23 wash okay no successes he can't quite
1:21:26 get a read you start to see the colors
1:21:28 but it's too confusing
1:21:31 do you wish to Stay or Leave
1:21:34 I just
1:21:35 um
1:21:36 I'm here to do what your vests of me
1:21:39 because you have aspects up give me a
1:21:43 perception plus alertness okay
1:21:48 difficulty seven after aspects three
1:21:51 successes or three successes it's subtle
1:21:54 but you smell blood on the wind and this
1:21:57 God awful cologne as you turn to find
1:22:00 out what the source of that stenches
1:22:02 you see Neil approaching
1:22:05 Neil walks up and when you pass him on
1:22:08 the stairs earlier he was very clearly
1:22:10 like listening and intense on where's
1:22:12 Britta how she okay like it's very clear
1:22:14 that he was just listening in and sort
1:22:16 of lingering around as he opens the door
1:22:18 to follow you guys out though very
1:22:20 clearly ignoring the brush off that
1:22:22 Pendragon just gave he comes up next to
1:22:25 you guys but now looks distracted he has
1:22:27 a finger on like one ear like he's
1:22:29 listening to an earpiece hey Bretta uh
1:22:32 it's just uh
1:22:34 watch my back for a second here because
1:22:36 um hello Prince Pendragon uh just
1:22:39 something might be and he puts a hand
1:22:40 over his eye like one of his eyes and
1:22:43 looks straight up at the stars and Lex
1:22:45 now that I'm out under the stars here
1:22:47 and I know that Brit is not like
1:22:49 disappearing on me I want to check out
1:22:51 what's going on with those boats because
1:22:53 now that Fester said people are missing
1:22:55 I am a little concerned go for it I will
1:22:58 spend a willpower on this too
1:23:01 three successes Neil actually goes so
1:23:04 far as to you're you're still are you is
1:23:07 Britta Still Standing like arm linked
1:23:09 with Pendragon I mean frankly um if he
1:23:12 hasn't given her any she's incredibly
1:23:15 shaken up like as she's been trying to
1:23:17 press it down in order to get through
1:23:20 the situations and get through the
1:23:21 situations but they keep happening and
1:23:24 so I don't think unless there's been
1:23:26 like a prompt for her to let go of him I
1:23:30 think she's still holding on to him like
1:23:33 tightly as a form of comfort the Neil
1:23:36 walks up directly next to Britta on the
1:23:39 other side of Pendragon and just snakes
1:23:43 an arm into hers like the [ __ ] Wizard
1:23:45 of Oz and then covers his eye and looks
1:23:48 straight up at the stars hey it's uh
1:23:51 it's really good to see you okay kind of
1:23:53 ignoring Pendragon in that weird focused
1:23:56 way that Neil gets when he's like
1:23:57 Automation and looking for stuff and
1:24:00 casts his gaze towards a particular star
1:24:03 overhead and then with that many
1:24:05 successes half of his vision goes away
1:24:08 and he is simultaneously here aware of
1:24:11 his surroundings next to Britta outside
1:24:13 and the other half of him is gazing like
1:24:17 a satellite from space down onto where
1:24:20 he saw the boats before because I don't
1:24:23 like that people are
1:24:25 going missing and Fester's nervous and
1:24:28 they all had their eyes out on the water
1:24:29 especially since like these
1:24:32 people that made Britain nervous are
1:24:33 here and shit's going on and I would
1:24:35 like to see what I can see around that
1:24:38 area now do you smell like blood or what
1:24:42 no I don't think so it's wolf Panther
1:24:46 while looking through you see the set of
1:24:49 boats kind of drifting in the water
1:24:50 empty and in the case of at least one
1:24:54 there's the floor of it is caked in
1:24:57 Blood and Ash
1:25:00 um Bretta looks incredibly uncomfortable
1:25:03 by the way as Neil puts her between the
1:25:06 two of them she returns the previous
1:25:09 behavior of being still for a dear life
1:25:11 as he does this Pendragon kind of gives
1:25:14 Brit a look of what is this Britta gives
1:25:17 Pendragon back a look of I'm not
1:25:20 entirely sure but please give it a
1:25:22 minute
1:25:23 Pendragon steps away Prince
1:25:26 um there's okay
1:25:28 um well he might actually want to hear I
1:25:30 don't know I think something's going on
1:25:31 right now uh we need to get the hell out
1:25:33 of here what to do what have you found
1:25:35 oh I don't I don't know
1:25:37 um but professor said that some of the
1:25:40 patrols have gone quiet and uh there's a
1:25:43 bunch of boats out on the water they're
1:25:45 empty but one of them is just spattered
1:25:46 with blood and Ash uh and if I was the
1:25:50 Sabbat and I knew all the members of
1:25:52 operation Longbow were in one house at
1:25:54 one time
1:25:56 um okay so we went around then that this
1:26:00 yacht comes out of obfuscate and
1:26:03 you can see
1:26:05 two individuals that are actually kind
1:26:08 of like they're dressed for the occasion
1:26:11 like like as though they're attending
1:26:13 the party but very quickly you realize
1:26:15 these two people are probably not
1:26:16 invited as one of them is this sharp
1:26:21 sharp sharp looking Spanish kind of
1:26:25 villain who has this near perfect look
1:26:28 about him save
1:26:30 for that along his cheek and neck is the
1:26:33 subtle Sunburn and he is dressed in a
1:26:37 white tux and next to him actually not
1:26:40 one of the two that really stands out is
1:26:42 an individual who's dressed in body
1:26:45 armor like there's some sort of like
1:26:47 paramilitary goon and they're holding
1:26:52 this like long sword as though they are
1:26:56 like the person who carries this
1:26:59 Conquistador sword for him and
1:27:01 accompanying them is this Eerie
1:27:05 androgynous form and they have uh these
1:27:12 completely alien
1:27:14 shapes and ripples and spikes that
1:27:17 protrude from their flesh and have these
1:27:20 very kind of full lips and alien eyes
1:27:23 that look out over the water right at
1:27:26 you as you're using your magic and they
1:27:30 are dressed in this long gown that flows
1:27:35 unnaturally as what it has is more like
1:27:38 it looks like it's this this gown made
1:27:41 from like a skin and snakes and tendrils
1:27:45 that like ride underneath and the two of
1:27:47 them are just enjoying the evening and
1:27:50 because of your heightened senses
1:27:52 by the shallow of the water are many
1:27:57 figures kind of moving through just kind
1:27:59 of walking to shore
1:28:01 so we need to tell security about the
1:28:03 boats then there's more there's more
1:28:04 there's more there's more um all right
1:28:07 um can you radio into the security team
1:28:10 and I'll tell you Prince my dragon yeah
1:28:13 because they're probably here for uh
1:28:14 because there's a lot okay umbrella just
1:28:17 starts walking in now uh and I put my
1:28:20 finger off Fester uh Fester you there
1:28:22 dude security buddy uh hey I'm just
1:28:24 headed over to the cars uh one of the
1:28:26 alarms went off I'm just checking it out
1:28:27 no wait wait go back to the house get
1:28:30 back in the house I'm
1:28:31 buy the house okay enemies here a lot a
1:28:34 lot of enemies yeah so keep a low
1:28:36 profile don't piss them off and they'll
1:28:38 just explain this time what miles would
1:28:40 do just okay look hot and be confident
1:28:43 well I'm not con to have you seen the
1:28:46 yacht that just appeared out there
1:28:48 there's no yeah I can see it yeah
1:28:50 there's a yacht out there and it has I
1:28:52 don't know okay all the monsters on one
1:28:54 second he hangs up well he like stops
1:28:56 like responding yeah it's uh um I gotta
1:28:59 I gotta we gotta tell more there's got
1:29:01 to be a way to well brother can you tell
1:29:03 and he just sort of yells across the
1:29:05 thing um and then looks around here's
1:29:08 something I haven't done and has not
1:29:10 actually appeared on screen at all
1:29:11 really there's a [ __ ] ton of mulcavians
1:29:13 in the area right Neil will pull his
1:29:17 phone out of his pocket and just start
1:29:20 whispering into his phone enemies
1:29:23 they're coming by sea enemies they're
1:29:25 coming by like over and over in this
1:29:26 really weird repetitive pressing his
1:29:28 face up against the phone and I'm going
1:29:30 to use Arcadian time to try and send a
1:29:33 message go for it
1:29:35 four successes so it should be
1:29:37 reasonably clear then hopefully locally
1:29:39 than just uh
1:29:41 yeah so Bretta would see Neil just pull
1:29:43 his phone out but instead of using it
1:29:45 like an actual phone just kind of like
1:29:46 presses his face against it and starts
1:29:48 Whispering into it as he's waiting for
1:29:50 fester to respond it gets half a weird
1:29:53 look but British out looking to pull a
1:29:56 pen Dragon back into the conversation
1:29:57 you know you can feel the strange static
1:29:59 that kind of comes from you trying to
1:30:01 reach into this this web that doesn't
1:30:05 quite actually exist and you can feel
1:30:09 this Consciousness that exists between
1:30:12 all of you you and your clan mates and
1:30:17 the message spreads like a bit of
1:30:20 electricity along a nerve and eventually
1:30:22 hits them and you can hear a couple
1:30:27 Panic screams come from inside
1:30:29 yowling and screaming that they're
1:30:31 coming they're coming and some of the
1:30:34 crowd begins to investigate and kind of
1:30:36 you know check on other mulcavian
1:30:38 friends and see why they're behaving so
1:30:40 strangely you can hear the sound of what
1:30:43 is clearly William bolt more laughing
1:30:47 and kind of cackling at the sudden chaos
1:30:51 that has overtaken the party Neil gives
1:30:54 a little shutter that level of
1:30:56 connection is is uncomfortable it's
1:30:59 strange but just in a panic you didn't
1:31:02 really know what else to do at the
1:31:03 moment and looks over now at this point
1:31:05 is afraid to radio back faster in case
1:31:08 he's like sneaking around so instead
1:31:10 just looks over towards Britta who
1:31:14 hopefully has been able to get one of
1:31:16 the Elder other leaders of longbow's
1:31:19 attention I think she already had
1:31:21 started walking away after she told Neil
1:31:23 to just tell fester and she was walking
1:31:26 towards Pendragon to try to pull him
1:31:28 into the conversation tell him about the
1:31:31 boats when you see him he is in the
1:31:34 midst of a conversation with his driver
1:31:35 and he's like got the car now we're
1:31:38 leaving make no scene and the driver
1:31:41 starts heading off he turns to look at
1:31:43 you Neil says this about our hair on
1:31:46 boats it's about here on boats yes and
1:31:49 more in the water I think
1:31:51 this look of frustration crosses his
1:31:55 face very well approaches Grace the
1:31:58 prince of this domain tell him what
1:32:00 you've told me and
1:32:02 tell them that I require a sword Bretta
1:32:05 has clear trepidation at the idea of
1:32:07 going to Warwick but she nods when
1:32:09 you're finished giving your message
1:32:12 come to me run
1:32:14 okay and she turns to go seek out work
1:32:22 I have to find the prince
1:32:24 Neil just turns and hurries after Bretta
1:32:28 gracelessly with just to don't leave me
1:32:31 I can't always run at this point while
1:32:33 you're running with Retta that you can
1:32:36 see figures starting to come out of the
1:32:38 water and two faces you recognize one of
1:32:42 them is your former captor oh no and she
1:32:46 has arrived she carries with her what
1:32:48 her sword and walking along with her
1:32:52 is what has to be Johnny sire he kind of
1:32:56 like is ringing out his long hair and
1:32:58 kind of has this look of intrigue and
1:33:03 excitement as he scans the fields for
1:33:06 any signs of Elders oh my God oh my God
1:33:09 oh my God um the only hesitation Bretta
1:33:11 has is pulling up the skirt on her dress
1:33:14 so that she can run faster and nodding
1:33:17 to kneel to come with her as she seeks
1:33:19 out where work once was Carmen and
1:33:21 Delgado are here
1:33:23 um they're uh two they're oh they're
1:33:26 here too they're over there getting the
1:33:27 house getting house getting house we
1:33:29 gotta get the hell out of here faster we
1:33:31 do this the faster I can go let's go
1:33:35 foreign
1:33:42 like breathe out relaxation side but
1:33:45 absolutely nothing on the surface as I
1:33:47 start
1:33:49 to Grant Hospitality to those in my
1:33:51 domain
1:33:52 as they line up when looks at every
1:33:55 single person who is lining up just
1:33:58 seeing if there's any surprises oh yeah
1:34:01 there's a lot of people who are very
1:34:02 surprised that a bunch of Sabbat got
1:34:04 killed the Prince got killed and here's
1:34:06 miles like yo I'm in charge like they're
1:34:08 they're not just is there anyone who
1:34:10 wouldn't be wouldn't who has been in
1:34:13 opposition to miles that might not come
1:34:16 and seek Hospitality from him uh there
1:34:19 does not that does not appear to be the
1:34:21 case okay even his Rivals his most
1:34:24 staunch public Rivals such as Reiss yep
1:34:27 have bent knee and requested Hospitality
1:34:31 I specifically run wenwick I assume
1:34:34 runwick still yeah I asked him to meet
1:34:38 with me afterwards he gives deep nod
1:34:40 into Grease Johnny will actually hop up
1:34:43 in line and when it's his turn
1:34:47 he'll Step Up
1:34:49 take a knee your grace
1:34:51 Clan bruja is currently without a
1:34:54 primogen
1:34:56 our former primagen Weathers
1:34:58 has
1:34:59 been attending other duties and
1:35:02 responsibilities within the camarilla
1:35:05 in lieu of his leadership I ask for
1:35:08 Hospitality for myself
1:35:09 on the rest of Clan bruja miles were not
1:35:13 hospitality is granted to you and the
1:35:16 bruja also your grace if I may be so
1:35:19 bold
1:35:20 since I have your ear
1:35:22 allies of Clan bruja amongst the anarchs
1:35:25 have been persecuted by
1:35:28 ordeals set by the former Prince Maya
1:35:33 may I ask
1:35:35 that this ordeal against Amaya of the
1:35:38 anarchs
1:35:39 be suspended
1:35:41 my acquiesced to your request Johnny
1:35:43 bows his head I think all of Clan bruja
1:35:46 thanks you for this generosity
1:35:50 and
1:35:52 sanity
1:35:53 it is my pleasure and taking this moment
1:35:56 to speak of generosity the City of New
1:35:58 Haven has been under siege for a number
1:36:02 of weeks now and we will be discouraging
1:36:04 funds from my personal accounts to see
1:36:09 that everyone has Security in their own
1:36:12 domains
1:36:13 you will be providing money to get a New
1:36:15 Haven to find to upgrade yours to do
1:36:18 what you need to do to feel safe
1:36:21 and then that goes for all inhabitants
1:36:22 of New Haven from the torridor there is
1:36:25 uproar supplies and the rest of the
1:36:28 Court seems to kind of
1:36:30 fail to resist their infectious ways
1:36:34 and in moments the entire court is
1:36:37 loudly applauding you
1:36:38 Johnny will step to the side guys this
1:36:41 is a super power trip
1:36:46 guys it's just too awesome
1:36:51 once Johnny is out of line
1:36:54 when we'll step into line
1:36:58 and she will take her glasses off and
1:37:01 bend the knee to him
1:37:03 I am a clan of one your grace
1:37:06 but I ask for Hospitality for my clan
1:37:09 and the whole time she's talking she has
1:37:10 her eyes crossed
1:37:12 just because she can't possibly take
1:37:14 anything seriously
1:37:16 my internal response is hey there Iceman
1:37:20 you're more than a clown of one you just
1:37:24 happen to be the only occupant currently
1:37:25 and I glance you and anyone you find
1:37:29 tolerable Hospitality thank you your
1:37:32 grace
1:37:33 from the Shadows computer is like yes
1:37:36 she thinks I'm tolerable technical
1:37:38 technically in I am adorable
1:37:42 it could be tolerable
1:37:46 and before she turns around she puts her
1:37:48 sunglasses back on
1:37:50 uh the Assamites approach
1:37:53 the man with the beard among them kind
1:37:56 of like thick eyebrows and these like
1:37:58 old eyes that have kind of seen parts of
1:38:02 the world that the camera that just
1:38:04 doesn't tread into
1:38:05 and he bows
1:38:09 your grace
1:38:10 it is my humble request
1:38:14 that you
1:38:16 open your mind
1:38:18 to the idea of accepting
1:38:21 the asamites into your corn
1:38:24 and acknowledging us
1:38:26 camarilla citizens of your domain
1:38:29 and he bows again
1:38:31 your name traveler I am familiar Ali
1:38:35 vizier of the asamites
1:38:38 and we have traveled a long way because
1:38:41 our home is no longer safe to us
1:38:44 those who have come with me we are not
1:38:47 assassins
1:38:48 or Artisans scientists
1:38:52 I now in my head Gravely at him
1:38:55 and I'm taking a quick perusal of the
1:38:58 general crowd's reaction there is an old
1:39:01 fear of Assamites and the court is sort
1:39:05 of reacting the way you would sort of
1:39:08 expect someone to react to you know an
1:39:11 Infamous clan of diablarist killers
1:39:15 when kind of stares at the man who is
1:39:20 asking for hospitality and is like
1:39:22 discreetly like cleaning her nails to
1:39:25 hopefully assuage some of the fear that
1:39:28 the prince is about to be attacked from
1:39:30 the court in general okay I look down to
1:39:33 familiar I offer the safety of my domain
1:39:36 for now so that you and me and a few
1:39:39 others can discuss this going forward
1:39:42 he bows again
1:39:45 you're a kind Prince
1:39:47 congratulations
1:39:50 thank you familiar they sort of back off
1:39:53 and Retreat to like a little corner to
1:39:55 not interact with the local court and
1:39:59 not be seen as much of a threat as they
1:40:01 currently are
1:40:03 I guess we go through the line unless
1:40:04 there's any specifics you go through the
1:40:07 line it is exhausting lots of platitudes
1:40:11 yeah
1:40:12 and your phone receives a message

1:40:18 at it

1:42:41 like the heel of her shoe kind of pushes
1:42:44 the prince's seat like just away from
1:42:48 the desk enough to suggest that you sit
1:42:51 down
1:42:52 and have a talk I uh
1:42:55 I shrug and move over to the chair

1:43:55 lipstick on you and her fingers are
1:43:58 through your hair kind of like pulling

1:45:13 nest of tunnels and warrants under this
1:45:14 place okay next thing and Bretta will
1:45:17 look around with heightened vision for
1:45:20 the sword give me a perception alertness
1:45:24 difficulty
1:45:25 um
1:45:26 yeah willpower
1:45:32 four successes with the willpower
1:45:35 uh you find uh what appears to be a pair
1:45:38 of cross swords over a mantle Bretta
1:45:41 does not
1:45:42 race in this situation and she
1:45:46 help me out uh okay uh and Neil with
1:45:50 like one hand on the phone the phone
1:45:52 pressed it was here like come on uh
1:45:54 we'll sort of hunch down so that Britta
1:45:57 can like step up on his shoulders to
1:45:58 like reach up to these things and grab
1:45:59 the [ __ ] in a surprisingly able movement
1:46:02 the front part of British stiletto lands
1:46:05 in your hand and she launches herself up
1:46:07 to grab both swords you come down with
1:46:10 both sorts she rests them free from the
1:46:12 wall not Sunil
1:46:14 let's go back you get Elsa I I I it's
1:46:17 still it's still raining okay let's go I
1:46:20 will be scanning the crowd for both the
1:46:22 people that I ostensibly care about
1:46:24 other than Brenda in this crap like at
1:46:26 this party I'm also looking for Elsa
1:46:28 okay let's do some initiative rules
1:46:32 I am spending one point of Celerity
1:46:36 10 17. so at the top of the round
1:46:38 brother uh you're searching for a path
1:46:40 back to Roman however at this point the
1:46:43 main doors to the estate are closed and
1:46:47 locked and while there's a group of like
1:46:51 Warwick's goons trying to hold the door
1:46:53 you hear this boom
1:46:56 Boom coming from the other side that
1:46:58 shakes the doors and like the walls that
1:47:01 the door set into like something really
1:47:04 big is on the other side I guess that
1:47:07 prompts the question as to where the
1:47:08 windows are ah there are windows all
1:47:10 over it's it's a very kind of exposed
1:47:13 location uh some of them are already
1:47:15 getting smashed in the shovelheads start
1:47:17 to crawl their way in so in order to
1:47:20 clear a path out for herself and for
1:47:22 Neil
1:47:23 um Bretta is going to direct dread gaze
1:47:26 towards a window that seems to have the
1:47:27 least people in it okay give me a dread
1:47:29 gaze roll
1:47:33 foreign
1:47:35 two successes with two successes it
1:47:38 stays in place but does not run as this
1:47:41 drenched
1:47:43 heavy set bald man Bears his fangs and
1:47:47 like kind of stammers back but he's so
1:47:51 hungry and lost the bloodlust that it's
1:47:54 difficult for him to focus on anything
1:47:56 even an immediate threat Britta shares a
1:47:59 look with a Neil before she directs that
1:48:02 vampiric Terror towards the man but he
1:48:04 is not completely shaken outside you
1:48:07 hear this Eerie reverberating feminine
1:48:10 voice speak
1:48:12 praise Kane
1:48:14 and as the priest of this sacred writer
1:48:17 I declare this the beginning of the war
1:48:20 party
1:48:22 you Darkness
1:48:24 do you come to this hunt willingly and
1:48:25 of your own accord and one at a time
1:48:28 entire packs that are outside on the
1:48:31 beach start letting out howling screams
1:48:33 as they Proclaim their intent to hunt
1:48:36 and devour any Elders they find inside
1:48:39 of the building with that Britta makes
1:48:41 absolute sure to dull her aspects she
1:48:45 doesn't know what's going on with the
1:48:46 bloodlust outside but she knows that
1:48:48 there's something getting swept up in it
1:48:49 and she doesn't want to be on that list
1:48:51 Neil phone's still ringing for Elsa and
1:48:55 looking around Neil is looks totally
1:48:57 panicked like just completely like this
1:48:59 is not
1:49:00 I came for like a weird politics fight
1:49:03 and what the the facade of like I will
1:49:05 be party guy is completely gone
1:49:08 and he just looks terrified sticking as
1:49:11 close to Britta as he can and just
1:49:13 looking around okay there's gotta be
1:49:15 there's gonna be a way out this is a
1:49:16 this is a nice Haven
1:49:18 um Lex I'm a friend of the Underground
1:49:22 there's probably tunnels actually I know
1:49:24 there's tunnels under here I came in
1:49:25 through one in like the dungeon right
1:49:28 yep
1:49:29 so I Neil goes to like reach out to grab
1:49:32 like British arms but come on this way
1:49:34 and then was like oh wait never mind
1:49:35 like you're way better with your [ __ ]
1:49:37 hands-free uh he goes come on there's a
1:49:40 um
1:49:40 there's this way through the ballroom
1:49:42 there's there's a way out uh and to the
1:49:44 parking lot there's trucks out that way
1:49:45 and when we can head that way uh there's
1:49:48 an escape
1:49:48 um and it'll take us to the ballroom we
1:49:50 can look for Elsa and we gotta find
1:49:51 Fester on the way
1:49:53 and we'll start heading in that
1:49:55 direction and we'll still keeping an eye
1:49:57 out and trying to call Elsa and like
1:50:00 trying to like calm Fester I see you
1:50:02 guys running further in or outside
1:50:05 Britta will use her next Celerity action
1:50:07 to catch up and run with Neil and in the
1:50:10 direction that he's that he's shown her
1:50:12 and she'll call out for Elsa as she's
1:50:15 running deeper down towards the path
1:50:17 that Neil has indicated as you start
1:50:19 heading downstairs someone picks up the
1:50:21 phone
1:50:23 Neil where are you I'm upstairs okay
1:50:28 um I I think I know a way out can can
1:50:30 you meet us we're we're headed across
1:50:33 the ballroom they're gonna kill the
1:50:34 elders tell her to come out yeah all
1:50:36 right so yes we're real quiet dimension
1:50:38 of they're going to kill the elders
1:50:39 because she's on a different side of the
1:50:43 conversation uh with that regard
1:50:46 um I don't know if I can get to you
1:50:50 um I'm going to try
1:50:52 we
1:50:53 um
1:50:55 I mean she hangs up we can come meet she
1:50:58 said Elsa's upstairs she needs she's
1:50:59 gotta do what's safe for her and we're
1:51:01 gonna have to go we've warned her we
1:51:02 have she might she might need help
1:51:05 she doesn't know if she can get to us
1:51:07 and Britta is ready to follow you
1:51:11 [Music]
1:51:13 I'm not waiting again
1:51:14 you're by the stairwell and there's a
1:51:16 path up as well
1:51:18 up deal let's go and we'll try and head
1:51:23 towards where I assume Elsa is changing
1:51:27 your mind and instead turning to start
1:51:29 head upstairs you remain on the ground
1:51:31 floor just in time to see the entrance
1:51:34 burst open as this massive
1:51:38 its limbs are like elongated and it has
1:51:41 tons of like extra muscle and bone the
1:51:44 only thing that really kind of stands
1:51:46 out is it's still got Tufts of this like
1:51:50 long dark hair that's like feathered
1:51:53 back and these huge claws that are like
1:51:56 radiating heat and very quickly it
1:52:00 starts rending all of the Kindred that
1:52:02 it starts coming down on and people are
1:52:04 scattering
1:52:12 if I were to drag Neil could I get him
1:52:17 faster up the stairs with my Celerity if
1:52:19 you have the strength
1:52:21 uh Brett is just ready to run she's
1:52:24 prepped to drag him if she feels the
1:52:26 need to she keeps she reaches back
1:52:28 outwards towards him to catch his hand
1:52:30 but she is just charging up the stairs
1:52:32 and under the
1:52:34 morbid hope that it's going to take
1:52:36 Johnny sire a while to get upstairs all
1:52:39 right so you are taking Neil upstairs
1:52:41 and you will accomplish this upstairs
1:52:44 there is a group of toriador that are
1:52:49 clamoring at a door banging on it being
1:52:50 like Elsa Elsa you have to come out we
1:52:52 have to go does the store look locked
1:52:54 yeah it looks like they're it looks like

1:53:22 Immaculate hair and is she able to pull
1:53:24 out a such item yes she looks anneal you
1:53:28 any better at this than I might be
1:53:30 uh I I I've done it before but I'm
1:53:32 usually not on a time crunch like this
1:53:34 just go go ahead and throat him without
1:53:36 heightened since you can hear this like
1:53:37 scratching and tapping at the door from
1:53:39 the other side kick it open Predator
1:53:42 knots and she sets to trying to get the
1:53:43 door open
1:53:46 your difficulty
1:53:49 one success
1:53:51 you find that the locks here for some
1:53:53 reason are just insanely intricate but
1:53:56 you managed you hear the the slight
1:53:58 clicking sound Britta mix
1:54:01 a bit of a confused gesture as her
1:54:04 attempt at larceny actually works out
1:54:06 she wasn't entirely sure there was an
1:54:07 instinct there but oh [ __ ] okay it
1:54:10 unlocks and she pulls the door open
1:54:12 swing the door open and before you is a
1:54:15 field of darkness and you can't see a
1:54:18 damn thing pass the doorway
1:54:20 now can you see in there all right um no
1:54:23 you were looking at a field of
1:54:25 Supernatural Darkness
1:54:27 the Neil's all hyped up on like [ __ ]
1:54:29 senses and [ __ ] so uh we heard weak
1:54:32 fingers at the door like literally less
1:54:35 than a couple seconds ago when we're
1:54:37 gonna pop the door so Neil is just going
1:54:39 to like okay use this and plunge his
1:54:42 hands into the darkness to try and grab
1:54:44 Elsa and pull her out I'm gonna blood
1:54:45 buff for strength and sort of blind try
1:54:49 and grab and hope for the best you feel
1:54:52 her hands in yours grab you back like in
1:54:55 this desperate employee for help go
1:54:58 ahead and roll the other toroid or that
1:55:00 are there the four of them grab onto you
1:55:03 and start pulling a little of their
1:55:04 might so you can enjoy a plus four die
1:55:06 bonus to this nice okay
1:55:11 yeah I do not have strikes back unless
1:55:14 one of the [ __ ] toriadors giving me
1:55:16 one they do not I didn't think so but
1:55:18 either you're a plus two diff well I'm
1:55:19 at plus two diff yeah you're in a shred
1:55:21 ah you're you're right uh and minus two
1:55:24 dice as well you feel this cold chill
1:55:26 start to sap at you as you try to pull
1:55:29 her away from whatever it is that has
1:55:31 her
1:55:33 come on
1:55:35 ah I did get three successes okay uh
1:55:39 they have 14 successes yeah as you feel
1:55:42 a great much like Johnny's hold her
1:55:47 Britta Britta looks to the Toyota helping
1:55:50 Neil and knows that there's nothing that
1:55:52 she can do that can rival that kind of
1:55:53 strength when it comes to attempting to
1:55:56 pull and to add to that Force so instead
1:56:00 she goes with something she has more
1:56:03 strength in which is her majesty
1:56:06 she focuses in on herself extends her
1:56:10 power across the room and into that
1:56:11 Circle and says let Elsa go
1:56:16 and activate a Majesty I am what
1:56:18 generation are you I have two dots in
1:56:20 generation so that's 11th right yes you
1:56:23 call out into the this void and don't
1:56:26 hear anything yet Neil it's your turn
1:56:30 [ __ ] it at this point like Neil's
1:56:33 pulling against a brick wall and just is
1:56:36 really starting to panic at this point
1:56:38 well uh holding on to her
1:56:41 you feel
1:56:43 her crumbled Ash in your hand
1:56:46 Neil just absolutely loses it it is
1:56:50 completely fully panicking as Elsa
1:56:53 crumbles in his hands it's just I'm
1:56:56 sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry
1:56:59 we gotta go just go go go go go go go go
1:57:01 go
1:57:03 is that Neil I hear is that Carmen's
1:57:06 voice it was definitely garminster okay
1:57:07 yeah no Neil was like two steps from a
1:57:09 full panic
1:57:10 everybody has to go the Terminator start
1:57:13 running with the the panicked like
1:57:16 cracking everybody has to go
1:57:18 deal was gonna use voice of Madness like
1:57:20 as he's starting to like scramble
1:57:22 backwards because like I assume I
1:57:24 Stumble backwards on my ass pulling that
1:57:26 hard as she turns to Ash so just as he's
1:57:29 literally like horror movie scrambling
1:57:31 like scoot scrambling backwards into the
1:57:33 hallway away from the darkness just
1:57:36 basically shrieks everybody has to go uh
1:57:39 reflexively I think the dementation that
1:57:41 he's only had a short time will Bubble
1:57:43 Up and I am in a voice of Madness
1:57:47 two successes since I know Carmen's
1:57:50 there Carmen is the choice
1:57:53 okay and then otherwise Neil is just
1:57:55 sort of scrambling away
1:57:58 good meal
1:58:00 and you see her step out of that
1:58:04 darkness that the room was filled with
1:58:06 and she is in those kind of like very
1:58:10 tight wet jeans and shirt her hair is
1:58:13 kind of like stringy sloppy wet her
1:58:16 mouth is covered in blood and parts of
1:58:20 her seem to fade away at times being
1:58:24 consumed by like darkness and sometimes
1:58:27 her head is just just simply a shadow
1:58:30 and it's just these Rippling Shadows
1:58:32 that exist over her that also generate
1:58:35 these four tentacles that Whip and lash
1:58:39 about from her torso
1:58:41 and I need a courage test to not rush it
1:58:44 yeah absolutely can you spend you can
1:58:47 spend willpower on a retro test sure

1:59:17 that shadow the shadow advances forward
1:59:20 enveloping you and the space you're in
1:59:23 Britta it's your turn
1:59:27 same question if I can grab hold of him
1:59:30 if I am able to find him in Celerity you
1:59:33 may drag him yes you'll need strength
1:59:35 three to uh carry him off without
1:59:38 penalty pumping my strength with blood
1:59:40 up to strength three determined Britta

1:59:47 with Celerity into the castle away with
1:59:49 him give me a DEX plus Athletics and
1:59:52 difficulty eight with minus two dice I
1:59:55 am spending another willpower running

2:00:02 kind of rise up in the ground around him
2:00:04 there will be no mercy this time Leo
2:00:06 Mafia did to my back mate
2:00:11 foreign

2:00:54 and let's go what
2:00:55 so what I said I do we're going
2:00:59 I guess I don't have a choice you do not
2:01:02 in fact Britta is holding on tightly as
2:01:04 if you were about to be murdered in
2:01:06 front of her eyes she may not have
2:01:07 turned off Majesty no the Majesty is in
2:01:10 full effect as she's tearing through
2:01:12 looking for the path that you've
2:01:13 described while you're running the
2:01:15 Shadows kind of
2:01:16 been and kind of Advance towards you as
2:01:20 the whole world is disappearing as you
2:01:23 guys flee you look down over at the
2:01:25 foyer uh back at the stairs and there's
2:01:28 just ash and blood and Scorch marks all
2:01:32 over the place a whole section of the
2:01:34 house is now on fire I need a courage
2:01:37 test difficulty seven from the both of
2:01:39 you all right well I'm spending another
2:01:40 in willpower I only have one left and
2:01:43 there's so much [ __ ] oh I'm running
2:01:45 out quick but my courage is so bad and
2:01:48 the last thing we need is Meetup Frenzy
2:01:50 ah saving it is a poor decision but here
2:01:54 we are actually no [ __ ] I'm holding on
2:01:56 to you I I'm spending it I'm spending a
2:01:57 less willpower I forgot I have grip on
2:02:00 you
2:02:03 two successes with the willpower
2:02:07 willpower okay towards the fire you can
2:02:10 hear like cackling and laughing as a
2:02:13 pack of Sabbat and just Thrills
2:02:16 themselves by running through burning
2:02:18 holes and kind of like and in this an
2:02:20 almost childish manner playing among the
2:02:23 Carnage
2:02:24 outside you can see that that same
2:02:27 androgynous creature gesturing and
2:02:30 invoking hermetic thomaturgy as it
2:02:33 incinerates Kindred that attempt to flee
2:02:36 it to definitely the tunnels tunnels and
2:02:39 Neil will attempt to direct Britta
2:02:42 towards the basically The Wine Cellar
2:02:45 dungeon there is an escape to this place
2:02:47 this is a you know as horrible as this
2:02:49 is this is a Nosferatu Warren and Neil
2:02:52 knows what's up
2:02:54 brighter will drop everything she's
2:02:55 doing and head outside
2:02:56 okay do I retain a hold over kneel while
2:03:00 doing that you sure do where are we
2:03:02 going no this isn't the right way you do
2:03:03 not head towards where the Vykos is on
2:03:06 its Rampage
2:03:08 uh you are LED out back towards the
2:03:10 kitchens and as you make it outside it
2:03:14 seems that there is a group of camera La
2:03:15 Kendrick that are still fighting out
2:03:17 there and what looks to be Roman
2:03:21 Pendragon but appearing as seven
2:03:25 different images moving in sync with
2:03:27 each other
2:03:28 his fighting with like bare Knuckles and
2:03:33 like a pistol that he's and like he just
2:03:36 blows the clip out and tosses aside
2:03:39 um
2:03:40 [Laughter]
2:03:42 and you find that you're summoned to him
2:03:45 I'm tired of waiting the bruh extends
2:03:48 his hand give me the sword Bretta hands
2:03:51 over the sword she offers hand over both
2:03:53 but one is extended towards the hand he
2:03:56 just takes the one she shifts the
2:03:57 remaining sword to a proper well as far
2:04:00 as she can tell a proper grip he tosses
2:04:02 you the pistol he's holding do what your
2:04:04 quarter he is meant for and find a way
2:04:06 out the cars are burned Neil the way out
2:04:09 all right we'd have to go down there
2:04:12 um she catches and adjusts the pistol
2:04:13 expertly Lex which part of the parking
2:04:16 lot are we in because professor and I
2:04:18 did not arrive with the guests we
2:04:20 arrived right you are part you guys were
2:04:22 parked like way in bag underground where
2:04:25 the help rips out of sight getting there

2:04:29 the tunnels so we're gonna have to get
2:04:31 back in the house you're gonna have to
2:04:32 go back in the house
2:04:34 Neil looks over Roberta through the
2:04:38 kitchens there are tunnels underneath
2:04:39 the house one goes to a parking lot
2:04:42 there is a UPS truck with an AK-47 and
2:04:45 all of my sorcery stuff in there
2:04:47 um at least I don't know if they found
2:04:49 it yet but that means we have to go back
2:04:52 inside Bretta takes the brief moment of
2:04:55 conversation and Neil's explanation to
2:04:58 kick off the stilettos and if this dress
2:05:01 doesn't already have some form of slit
2:05:04 or allowance for a movement she is
2:05:05 taking that sword and creating one she
2:05:07 does so now that he has a sword and can
2:05:10 actually properly fight Roman Pendragon
2:05:12 kind of takes off the suit coat and
2:05:14 rolls up his sleeves what does Neil do
2:05:16 it's time to go back inside I don't Neil
2:05:20 I guess starts moving back towards the
2:05:22 house towards the way down to The Wine
2:05:24 Cellar where the dungeons were
2:05:26 this is the way that this is the way we
2:05:28 gotta go um back inside downstairs and
2:05:31 then once we're down there oh you know
2:05:34 NOS build their tunnels a certain way we
2:05:36 we can do this
2:05:38 I've been in the tunnels a lot of times
2:05:39 not here but
2:05:41 we this way
2:05:43 and starts moving towards where he
2:05:46 thinks they have to go okay red are you
2:05:48 going with yes Bretta shifts the gun and
2:05:51 the sword getting the gun to her better
2:05:53 hand nods over to the Roman Pendragon
2:05:56 that she Associates as the main voice
2:05:58 there being seven of them
2:06:01 and trying to send an air of
2:06:04 encouragement over to the crowd the
2:06:06 remainder of the camarilla share nods
2:06:09 and makes her way over to follow Neil to
2:06:12 lead the rest uh you notice that
2:06:14 whenever he stops moving there's just
2:06:16 one of him but as soon as he starts to
2:06:19 move it's so quick that it's playing
2:06:21 tricks on the eyes and he and the pair
2:06:25 of bruja goons that are with him uh
2:06:27 accompany the two of you as the five
2:06:30 head back into the burning house I need
2:06:34 another courage test in order to advance
2:06:37 into the burning home I will spend
2:06:41 another willpower I won't switch your
2:06:43 nature all for courage test actually
2:06:45 yeah you know what what is my major uh
2:06:47 Visionary Visionary is the one where I
2:06:50 believe you get refreshes based on
2:06:52 getting people to do as you would see
2:06:54 fit uh we didn't apply here this is more
2:06:57 Survivor nature
2:06:59 what's the difficulty seven wash three
2:07:02 successes okay Britta flies into a raw
2:07:05 Trek and turns to flee out and a hand
2:07:09 just kind of picks her up and continues
2:07:12 walking inside
2:07:14 uh Britta you are in a raw Trek uh you
2:07:18 must win a strength plus brawl check
2:07:21 against Roman Pendragon in order to take
2:07:23 any actions otherwise he will simply
2:07:25 hold you and continue walking along with
2:07:29 Neo into the burning mansion
2:07:32 laughs
2:07:35 doesn't my Majesty come down was that I
2:07:38 have Majesty episode does that go out
2:07:40 his generation is such that he does not
2:07:42 seem aware of your it's not that it's
2:07:44 for anything else oh no you're just a
2:07:45 majestic little freaked out you're like
2:07:48 a figurehead So within this Rush wreck
2:07:51 and the they're still like the Beauty
2:07:54 and the presence of Bretta as she just
2:07:59 rides and tries her best to get away
2:08:01 from the terrible fire it's like the
2:08:04 skirt keeps on getting kicked up like a
2:08:06 glamorously she Rush ecstatically
2:08:09 apparently
2:08:10 you get to The Wine Cellar and up above
2:08:14 you can hear the sounds of Carnage and
2:08:16 unfortunately in this very sad sort of
2:08:19 way
2:08:20 it's already starting to quiet down and
2:08:22 that's when things
2:08:24 start to feel really dangerous because
2:08:26 now they're looking for stragglers
2:08:29 and you make it to the dungeon entrance
2:08:33 that's over in The Wine Cellar but it's
2:08:35 closed and locked what do you do the
2:08:39 Neil looks around he has spent a lot of
2:08:42 time around the Nosferatu he's one of
2:08:45 the few people at least in New Haven
2:08:46 who's like
2:08:47 been able to skulk around their warrants
2:08:50 with them so he looks around pretty
2:08:52 quickly for whether there are like
2:08:55 Secret Escapes or secondary entrances or
2:08:58 weird little tunnels behind a wine cask
2:09:00 somewhere that they often have for like
2:09:04 Panic routes out towards the the
2:09:06 secondary parking give me a perception
2:09:08 Bliss investigation role at difficulty
2:09:10 10. two success is required does friend
2:09:13 of the underground apply it does so
2:09:15 between that and heightened senses I
2:09:17 will reduce uh this by six so it sounds
2:09:20 good so then
2:09:22 it would be 11 and then
2:09:27 two successes
2:09:30 with two successes
2:09:32 you do find the concealed switch
2:09:34 underneath the old barrels and with the
2:09:37 help of two of the brujah they can kind
2:09:40 of move them out of the way for you
2:09:41 because a certain amount of strength is
2:09:42 needed in order to access them in the
2:09:44 first place
2:09:45 and you flip the switch You Hear The
2:09:49 Click link as the door becomes unlocked
2:09:52 and you begin to make your way
2:09:56 um Neil sort of looks at the other
2:09:57 brouha is anybody particularly good at
2:10:00 driving they'll kind of like Shake That
2:10:02 Roman pen drag was like no you'll be
2:10:04 driving I ridiculous okay yeah okay
2:10:09 sure
2:10:11 right as you pass through where the food
2:10:15 is kept for the party Roman stops and
2:10:19 while like still holding brother in his
2:10:22 in his arm
2:10:23 grasp one of The Mortals and drains them
2:10:25 dry to refresh himself
2:10:29 you start making your way back to the
2:10:31 UPS truck is
2:10:32 and as you get into that space you can
2:10:34 see the headlights
2:10:36 of the UPS truck and the vehicles
2:10:40 quickly backing out to make an escape
2:10:42 faster faster wait oh [ __ ] I thought you
2:10:47 died he pokes his head out and your body
2:10:50 is like covered in Scorch marks he's
2:10:53 gotten teeth knocked out of his mouth he
2:10:56 looks like he has been through one hell
2:10:59 of a night Neil after all of the Just
2:11:02 Terror and everything and losing Elsa
2:11:05 and uh and having been afraid to reach
2:11:08 out that he might like ruin Fester's
2:11:11 Escape she all starts crying when he
2:11:13 sees that his friend is alive no it's
2:11:15 okay but we gotta go we gotta go
2:11:17 everybody we're gonna get in the truck
2:11:18 okay and we're gonna get the hell out of
2:11:20 here okay uh they're they're coming with
2:11:22 us
2:11:24 okay uh and Neil just runs up to the
2:11:28 truck and jumps in the front seat with
2:11:31 with Fester as this is going on Britta
2:11:34 you start to come out of your raw Trek
2:11:37 and kind of feel yourself being hoisted
2:11:39 off to the UPS truck britta's eyes
2:11:42 flutter as she I don't believe she's
2:11:43 frustrated before so this isn't entirely
2:11:46 new what does it feel like does it just
2:11:48 feel like Terror taking over you it is
2:11:49 not Terror it's actually not even your
2:11:52 own fear the Beast loses control of
2:11:56 itself
2:11:57 seizes the moment and flees it's as
2:12:01 though it was like this horrible nature
2:12:03 series of like like spasms or driving
2:12:06 you to a physical act that's beyond your
2:12:08 own control it is a terrifying sensation
2:12:10 so then as her eyelashes flutter she
2:12:13 starts to get a grip on herself again
2:12:16 and looks around understanding very
2:12:19 little of her circumstance does she
2:12:21 remember what happened during her
2:12:22 rushwick
2:12:24 uh bits and pieces then in that case she
2:12:28 has enough information to understand
2:12:29 who's holding her the inside of the
2:12:31 truck is confusing but she turns her
2:12:34 large eyes towards Roman pendrick and
2:12:36 trying to even test whether she has her
2:12:39 own consciousness
2:12:40 as well as realizing that he's still got
2:12:44 her and that they've made it to some
2:12:46 form of Escape we're going to be leaving
2:12:48 cover the Escape got it you back with us
2:12:52 yeah there's a there's a rifle in the
2:12:55 back of the car okay trade and she hands
2:12:57 over her guns in favor for the rifle the
2:13:00 gun and the sword Neil holds the gun in
2:13:03 the sword from the front seat like holds
2:13:05 him in his hands not like he's using him
2:13:06 but just like he's holding him in front
2:13:08 of himself Britta kind of like nods her
2:13:10 head over to one of the bruja thugs for
2:13:12 the sword and reaches out and accepts
2:13:14 the AK again that unsettlingly expert
2:13:18 motion as she checks over the gun and
2:13:20 readies it towards covering the exit
2:13:22 they pretty readily accept any weapons
2:13:24 offered to him yeah Neil hands them over
2:13:26 pretty quickly and for his own
2:13:28 preparations for the Escape uh snaps
2:13:31 like retrieves his fanny pack from under
2:13:33 the front seat and snaps his sorcerer
2:13:35 stuff like right around his waist hey
2:13:37 Neil oh honey I'm glad you made it glad
2:13:41 you made it too man let's go let's get
2:13:43 on get the hell out of here
2:13:44 it starts it again and starts dragging
2:13:48 out the group of you uh start taking off
2:13:52 and he hits the gas I starts to make the
2:13:57 exit as shovelheads are kind of like
2:13:59 hearing the ups and chasing after it for
2:14:02 a few long strides before you lose them
2:14:05 you find yourselves traveling along that
2:14:07 long road
2:14:08 along the coast making your way out
2:14:12 [Music]
2:14:18 while you're going after all of this
2:14:20 chaos
2:14:21 Britta
2:14:23 you feel your connection to Upton Rule
2:14:26 and snap what does this feel like it
2:14:29 feels like hearing the news of the loss
2:14:35 of a family member in the wrong way
2:14:37 it's that exact moment when you realize
2:14:40 that someone you love is going to be out
2:14:42 of your life for the rest of your
2:14:43 existence and you are powerless to do
2:14:47 anything about it suddenly Bretta lets
2:14:49 out a wrecked sop
2:14:51 she doesn't seem to be expecting it and
2:14:54 there's no visual clue as to what's
2:14:56 causing it because she had really just
2:14:58 been staying on target looking for those
2:15:01 shovel heads for anyone that was coming
2:15:02 after her grip on the Gun Titan she's
2:15:04 not willing to sand down but even
2:15:07 through that dedication to the danger of
2:15:10 the circumstance to the orders that she
2:15:12 has to follow the tears break through
2:15:15 she starts trembling her expression is
2:15:19 so confused
2:15:20 like there's the clear grief but there's
2:15:24 also confusion and almost Fury
2:15:27 she
2:15:28 doesn't seem to know even where to
2:15:30 direct that feeling the trembling just
2:15:33 tightening her grip on the AK Roman
2:15:36 Pendragon looks at you and seems to
2:15:38 recognize something
2:15:41 about what you're going through and he
2:15:44 gives just this the ghost of a nod
2:15:48 a tries to nod back her eyes just
2:15:51 welling up with tears made even larger
2:15:53 by what she's going through let this be
2:15:55 the last time you suffer for a false
2:15:58 princess vanity
2:16:00 I can't believe I
2:16:03 can actually hate him now
2:16:07 we wanted to why
2:16:11 he's gone Rowlands is gone
2:16:14 it will come easier and easier
2:16:17 just don't let it be the only thing you
2:16:18 feel
2:16:20 better pulls together a deep series of
2:16:23 nods attaching to the words
2:16:26 holding on to them like a Lifeline he
2:16:29 reaches out and takes brother's rival
2:16:31 just
2:16:32 not really acid permission just with
2:16:34 impossible strength just rested from her
2:16:36 casually and he moves to watch the door
2:16:39 Britta dips her head to him and
2:16:42 there's some strange hesitation but the
2:16:44 moment passes and she keeps her head
2:16:47 dipped and she gets out of his way
2:16:49 in the front passenger seat Neil's eyes
2:16:51 flick up to the mirror watching the back
2:16:54 watching these interactions and as
2:16:57 British sort of left alone for a second
2:16:58 as Roman looks out the back with the
2:17:00 rifle what you can see is Britta curling
2:17:03 uh as soon as she's behind Roman
2:17:05 Pendragon and she has there's no privacy
2:17:08 here I mean this is a there's how many
2:17:11 people are here they're Subaru huh
2:17:13 there's anyone else left who survived ah
2:17:16 so far
2:17:17 the six of you then Britta is just kind
2:17:20 of placing herself up in the corner
2:17:23 closest to the driver's seat and curling
2:17:26 into a tight Circle to just allow the
2:17:29 tears to go she's needed to cry this for
2:17:32 a very long time she's been holding this
2:17:33 back and uh now that there's no hiding
2:17:36 it it's just breaking through
2:17:38 Neil looks over faster I was like hey um
2:17:41 eyes on the Rock give me a second and
2:17:43 sort of one buckles nuts and stands up
2:17:46 and moves into the back and just sort of
2:17:49 sits down against the wall next to Britta
2:17:51 he can't quite help but invade her
2:17:53 personal space this is the back of a
2:17:54 truck and just gives her the courtesy
2:17:57 not to look directly at her while she's
2:17:59 crying but just goes
2:18:02 I'm mom I'm glad you're alive
2:18:10 I
2:18:11 two
2:18:15 I am
2:18:16 I've never been in anything like that
2:18:18 before but I have been
2:18:21 missing
2:18:22 and I just needed you to know that you
2:18:25 weren't
2:18:26 alone
2:18:28 I wasn't
2:18:30 I wasn't coming back without you so I'm
2:18:33 glad
2:18:34 he stops and he's just quiet for a
2:18:36 little bit
2:18:38 I know you're not okay that's an insane
2:18:40 thing to ask right now but
2:18:42 you wanna hug
2:18:44 win always
2:18:46 hugs me when I'm not around I've been
2:18:48 trying to
2:18:49 be the whole cotery tonight as much as I
2:18:52 can and Fred is not capable of words she
2:18:54 just turns towards Neil and
2:18:58 gives him room to slip a hug him Neil
2:19:01 puts an arm around her shoulders and
2:19:03 pulls her into sort of like a one of
2:19:06 those both people sitting down like half
2:19:08 hugs
2:19:10 it's okay I mean it's not okay nothing's
2:19:13 okay but
2:19:14 your life and I'm alive and
2:19:17 I mean we're gonna have a lot to talk
2:19:19 about in the future but right now just
2:19:21 little wins in one more night right
2:19:26 she again is not able to answer him uh
2:19:29 it's almost like the further they get
2:19:32 from everything that's happened this
2:19:33 night whether it be the Tama Hera
2:19:35 showing up
2:19:36 seeing Oh I'm Vanessa Nails seeing the
2:19:40 man who ate her parents things that she
2:19:42 didn't doesn't even remember things that
2:19:44 are just visions that passingly were
2:19:47 revealed to her as part of a haphazard
2:19:50 attempt to say afloat in months of
2:19:54 memory the death of Elsa her mentor
2:19:57 the pure stress of having been kidnapped
2:20:00 and trying to Vie for the codery to stay
2:20:02 alive it's just all catching up and she
2:20:05 just sinks into him and
2:20:07 sobs
2:20:09 Neil just sits and lets her weep against
2:20:13 his shoulder as long as she needs to
2:20:16 If eventually she starts to slow not
2:20:19 even stop but just starts to slow he'll
2:20:22 very gently
2:20:23 hey um
2:20:25 I had a couple things I got to do and
2:20:28 you know Fester could use some eyes up
2:20:30 front do you wanna Neil knows if he was
2:20:36 to look at at Britta and be like hey uh
2:20:38 you want the front seat do you want to
2:20:39 become well she would just shut down but
2:20:41 by the same way that he does sometimes
2:20:43 honestly the same way that like Johnny
2:20:45 or or miles had done for him in the past
2:20:48 I've been like ah here's a task so you
2:20:49 don't spiral
2:20:50 sort of frames sitting up in front in
2:20:53 the comfortable kind of more private
2:20:55 seat as like ah here's a task if you
2:20:58 want to take it it takes brother a very
2:21:01 long time to slow once Neil does find
2:21:05 that opportunity and it does eventually
2:21:07 happen
2:21:08 and he gives that offer
2:21:11 it's almost like the weight of keeping
2:21:14 her [ __ ] together Falls right back into
2:21:16 place
2:21:18 she looks up at Neil
2:21:20 with those big doe eyes and looks subtly
2:21:23 to the remainder of the Cambria from
2:21:26 that party and
2:21:28 she shakes her head and she says
2:21:31 you should you should go help him
2:21:35 um
2:21:36 thank you thank you I
2:21:39 I'll be okay you don't um
2:21:43 you don't have to thank me I don't think
2:21:45 I really did very much here
2:21:48 I am
2:21:49 you don't have to be okay okay
2:21:52 there's really not
2:21:55 a lot of options say you lose your [ __ ]
2:21:58 once I get home I'm gonna lose my [ __ ]
2:22:00 through everything that's happened it's
2:22:04 really seemed like every night has been
2:22:07 emergency after emergency and impossible
2:22:11 problems that
2:22:13 I don't even have the world of context
2:22:15 to remember
2:22:16 and they just seem to get worse and more
2:22:19 dangerous and more people seem to die
2:22:21 and
2:22:23 I think this is as close as I
2:22:26 get to get to losing my [ __ ] and maybe
2:22:29 in another
2:22:30 what two and a half months or however
2:22:33 long it's battle I'll be able to be sad
2:22:36 or scared in a way that gets me some
2:22:39 peace about it but right now there's
2:22:40 just
2:22:42 there's more things to do there's more
2:22:45 is always another problem so so that's
2:22:48 what I'm gonna handle
2:22:50 first night that we ever met you
2:22:54 there were just as many problems
2:22:57 and we got into a habit of saying well
2:23:01 we'll deal with that that's a tomorrow
2:23:02 night problem
2:23:04 and right now
2:23:05 right now we've got a lot of tonight
2:23:07 problems
2:23:08 I think
2:23:09 I think it's okay to put a couple
2:23:11 tomorrow night problems back on the list
2:23:14 uh
2:23:16 I'm glad you're safe and he puts like a
2:23:19 what he feels like is a comforting hand
2:23:21 on her shoulder and then stands up and
2:23:24 goes back into the front seat with
2:23:25 Fester
2:23:26 trying his best to be that empathetic
2:23:31 comforting and Humane meal that he used
2:23:33 to be
2:23:34 having gotten the pep talk from Neil and
2:23:37 having gotten to let go of some of the
2:23:39 horror and Terror of the night Bretta
2:23:42 looks down at her dress and actually
2:23:44 Foley takes in the fact that this
2:23:46 extraordinarily beautiful piece of
2:23:48 clothing has been destroyed by herself
2:23:49 but
2:23:50 she rips off a strip of it anyway and
2:23:53 attempts to clean up to get the blood
2:23:55 out of the way and to ready for the next
2:23:58 problem
2:24:02 [Music]
2:24:05 when Johnny did you receive contact from
2:24:08 the prince to meet him in his office
2:24:11 which is not to be confused with the
2:24:13 previous Prince's office and when you
2:24:16 arrive miles what do they see they
2:24:20 probably see that uh there is there my
2:24:24 own piano up here now that is replaced
2:24:26 like a large portion of some of the
2:24:28 whatever knick-knackery that the
2:24:30 previous Prince kept I don't know it's
2:24:32 probably extra chairs and like a few uh
2:24:36 guitars are hung on the wall very
2:24:38 similar in some ways to
2:24:40 um Jane in that way but they're not
2:24:42 really signed or anything like that but
2:24:43 they are expensive looking guitars a few
2:24:46 tasteful pieces of art you know it looks
2:24:49 much more modern and updated and
2:24:52 um better
2:24:54 and much more better much more better
2:24:56 and so yeah I'm essentially just kind of
2:24:59 like tooling around on the piano until
2:25:01 they they come in Johnny probably
2:25:04 answers the uh summons fairly quickly I
2:25:07 imagine he's actually probably been
2:25:08 spending some time nearby in the
2:25:10 sheriff's office just kind of making
2:25:12 sure that things are ready to be poured
2:25:14 over to whoever's going to be failing
2:25:16 that position
2:25:17 he uh arrives at the the prince's office
2:25:19 kind of knocks on the door frame and
2:25:22 pokes his head in oh man I see you I did
2:25:24 some redecorating in here it's necessary
2:25:27 if I'm going to be doing business let me
2:25:31 see the previous Decor was very
2:25:32 distracting I guess so some of it got
2:25:35 wrecked so wrecked
2:25:38 Johnny leans against the uh door frame
2:25:41 kind of [ __ ] an eyebrow hearing that
2:25:44 some of the furniture was smashed you uh
2:25:48 still having problems with everything
2:25:49 that went down or are you just enjoying
2:25:52 uh wrecking this place there was
2:25:54 definitely some enjoyment to be had in
2:25:55 it
2:25:57 Johnny kind of gives you a look of like
2:25:59 he sees that you're not telling him
2:26:01 something but he shrugs pop some morally
2:26:04 in his mouth and heads inside and sits
2:26:06 on one of your more new modern Chic
2:26:09 little Chase lounges that you've set up
2:26:12 for guests well got any ashtrays in here
2:26:15 yeah there should be a few he looks
2:26:17 around and spots kind of a uh
2:26:19 little Modern Art looking dish unclear
2:26:23 as to whether it's an ashtray or not he
2:26:24 picks it up and starts using it as one
2:26:27 we're just waiting on when she should be
2:26:29 on her way
2:26:33 [Music]
2:26:37 so when is takes a little stop there's
2:26:41 not a whole lot of greenery in New Haven
2:26:43 proper but she finds a just like one of
2:26:45 those sidewalk trees and just kind of
2:26:47 leans against it and thinks for a minute
2:26:50 starts thinking of how much the last few
2:26:53 days have been just there's been a ton
2:26:56 that's going on and she wants to take
2:26:58 care of something before it slips her
2:27:00 mind or things get too busy and she
2:27:02 makes a call to Amber Gino Giovanni
2:27:04 there's someone that answers on the
2:27:06 other line and the speaker to the phone
2:27:09 are like mask who's calling wind cabin
2:27:11 out of New Haven ah wind is very good to
2:27:14 hear from you uh you were calling from
2:27:16 Giovanni yes I am very well if you can
2:27:19 bear with me just one moment I'll put
2:27:20 you right into contact thank you after a
2:27:23 brief hold someone picks up on the other
2:27:26 end is Giovanni wincape yes yes good
2:27:31 evening Mr Giovanni how have you been I
2:27:33 am well and how are you Madonna
2:27:36 concerned and hoping you can help
2:27:39 tell me of your woes this sixth
2:27:42 Maelstrom that's coming no wraith is
2:27:45 expected to survive it I do not know
2:27:48 precisely with the future holds but
2:27:51 there is an understanding of Oblivion
2:27:55 that each Necromancer must accept
2:27:58 all stories Madonna come to an end and
2:28:03 there is a cycle a wheel that turns each
2:28:07 after age
2:28:09 but in time even the wheel shall break
2:28:12 and you you are afforded the opportunity
2:28:17 to see the final nights the very end
2:28:21 this sixth great maelstrom
2:28:23 it is the end of the rest is dead
2:28:27 but more precisely it is the end of
2:28:30 their world as they know it when kind of
2:28:33 she doesn't need to swallow but she does
2:28:37 like this is just not what she wanted to
2:28:38 hear but she's not quite dissuaded yet
2:28:41 so she kind of gives it a pause to it
2:28:43 makes make it look like she's thinking
2:28:45 about what he's saying
2:28:46 I will tell you this
2:28:49 Oblivion is feared by most and with a
2:28:53 good reason
2:28:54 but
2:28:55 Beyond The Labyrinth
2:28:57 the well that leads to nothing
2:28:59 what exists on the other side or the
2:29:02 resides Beyond Oblivion is unknown
2:29:06 and that are those among the Restless
2:29:08 Dead
2:29:09 who believe
2:29:11 not Beyond it lies salvation but there's
2:29:14 a chance it just leads to obliteration
2:29:16 for some these are one and the same how
2:29:19 did The Wraith survive the previous
2:29:20 maelstroms none were so great and
2:29:23 terrible
2:29:24 storms that can be weathered but this is
2:29:27 meant to swallow the world it is the end
2:29:29 of all things for them but again
2:29:35 what is peace
2:29:37 it is not Joy
2:29:39 it is not the frenetic existence that is
2:29:42 life
2:29:43 it is the quiet
2:29:45 the end of struggles
2:29:47 I can appreciate that but I'm a Gangrel
2:29:51 and we fight until the end
2:29:53 this is about the boy
2:29:55 yes
2:29:56 is he Gangrel
2:29:58 he was just a boy perhaps you must
2:30:01 accept that he is not you
2:30:05 I made him a promise to do everything I
2:30:07 could so I'm gonna fight till his end
2:30:09 and if you can do nothing
2:30:12 then I failed again
2:30:14 then you will have wasted what precious
2:30:17 moments you have
2:30:19 it is not the length of one's existence
2:30:22 that gives life or even unlife meaning
2:30:25 it is how it is spent
2:30:27 and if you will ignore the boy in favor
2:30:29 of thrashing against an event that is
2:30:33 destined against Faith itself
2:30:36 you are not merely failing you are
2:30:39 wasting what you have
2:30:41 is there a way to to get him out of
2:30:44 there to make him something else
2:30:47 to give him a a second chance at a life
2:30:50 that was cut too short
2:30:51 not without great suffering
2:30:54 on Whose part him
2:30:57 then you
2:30:59 so what you're saying is I should just
2:31:00 prepare him for the end
2:31:02 or keep it a secret from him what I am
2:31:05 saying
2:31:06 use of that death
2:31:09 Annihilation it is inevitable there will
2:31:13 come a night
2:31:14 or the sun no longer Rises or the Stars
2:31:18 wink out of the sky When Gravity itself
2:31:21 devolves dissolves into nothing and even
2:31:25 time itself ceases to flow
2:31:28 there is always an end
2:31:30 struggle as you wish to avoid
2:31:33 but should one Doom fail to claim you
2:31:36 another lies in weight
2:31:40 there is
2:31:42 there is a project
2:31:44 I do not mean to judge you
2:31:46 for you see
2:31:48 the sixth great Maelstrom it will be the
2:31:52 end of wraiths perhaps even spectori as
2:31:56 far as I know
2:31:57 but we too have our Doom
2:32:01 end to all of the canine race if you
2:32:04 have heard something about that but it
2:32:06 is the end of the canine race and those
2:32:09 who are no longer canines shall not be
2:32:12 subject to this fate and that is the
2:32:15 nature
2:32:16 of the ritual of the red sign
2:32:18 we will evade the end of canine kind for
2:32:22 we shall not be canines
2:32:24 when that end comes perhaps
2:32:27 perhaps such an Avenue exists for the
2:32:31 boy when is kind of struggling to
2:32:33 understand the magnitude of what he's
2:32:36 talking about I will make you a deal
2:32:38 okay and be warned
2:32:41 it is dangerous
2:32:43 but there are tones required in order to
2:32:45 enact the ritual of the red sign our
2:32:47 research is not complete you have an
2:32:50 able-bodied cautery one that is a
2:32:52 capable of travel and accomplishing
2:32:54 Feats unnoticed by the elders who would
2:32:57 seek this power for themselves
2:33:00 I am going to send you a list
2:33:03 acquire them and in the meantime
2:33:06 I will use what methods I know
2:33:09 to preserve the boy
2:33:11 without Soul forging self-forging does
2:33:14 not preserve the soul it is the
2:33:17 transubstantiation into property okay
2:33:20 I'm glad we're on the same page as that
2:33:23 and if I get you these tomes
2:33:25 we can take care of him
2:33:28 yes
2:33:29 and the codery or just the boy I'm sorry
2:33:33 I'm not a smart woman I offer the
2:33:35 Salvation to you and the boy
2:33:39 okay contact me when you are ready to
2:33:43 bring the boy to Boston okay
2:33:46 he disconnects wind just kind of flips
2:33:48 the phone shut or actually she's got a
2:33:50 Nokia she just hits the hang up button
2:33:52 she just kind of leans against the tree
2:33:54 and kind of like Taps the phone against
2:33:56 her face as she's thinking and remembers
2:33:58 that she's supposed to be somewhere and
2:34:00 she starts walking
2:34:01 [Music]
2:34:07 back at miles's office the door swings
2:34:10 open revealing a win I've never been in
2:34:13 here before really yeah and you can't be
2:34:16 amazed at how much different and better
2:34:18 it is now it looks nice okay I just take
2:34:20 it a photo then
2:34:22 no I am
2:34:24 he didn't really want to ever talk to me
2:34:26 for anything that wasn't public
2:34:27 humiliation so I think he was afraid of
2:34:29 the game girl he should be
2:34:31 should have been anyways I haven't heard
2:34:33 from the other two yet so Neil has a
2:34:36 phone he'll get in contact if he has to
2:34:37 very good Chinese phone rings give me my
2:34:40 beeper goes off uh oh yeah
2:34:44 still haven't really leveled up there I
2:34:46 don't think he plans on it I do not
2:34:49 Johnny sits up on the Shays digs around
2:34:51 his pocket for a second pulls out his
2:34:53 beeper and takes a look to see who
2:34:55 called him you recognize the number of
2:34:57 Amaya he uh looks over at Miles he's
2:35:01 already pointing over at the phone he
2:35:03 knows gets up walks over to the uh the
2:35:05 desk where the phone is and Pops a seat
2:35:08 down on the desk grabs the phone and
2:35:10 dials the number there's an answer on
2:35:12 the other end Johnny
2:35:13 I did what you needed
2:35:16 the Rave is ready to go I've arranged
2:35:20 something of a battle of the bands on a
2:35:21 local level and all of the brujah are
2:35:24 aware that there is a rave coming
2:35:27 what else do you need don't think I need
2:35:30 anything else that's incredible thank
2:35:32 you for your help with that Amaya what
2:35:34 do you need wind kind of looks over when
2:35:37 he says Amaya's name and kind of gives
2:35:40 an approving nod like okay this is going
2:35:41 in a good direction I would like
2:35:46 I would like you to convince our Prince
2:35:50 to remove the satype presence from New
2:35:53 Haven I don't think that would be that
2:35:56 big of a stretch glad to hear it
2:35:59 but uh I will say sometimes those snakes
2:36:03 can be awfully pesky be hard to chase
2:36:05 out of a place so give us some time I
2:36:08 trust you when uh
2:36:11 when's The Wraith planned for the Rave
2:36:14 is going to be set for the end of April
2:36:16 lets us put out invitations across the
2:36:19 region sounds good well thanks again to
2:36:22 my
2:36:23 do you mean anything else you know where
2:36:25 to call me but I do good night oh and uh
2:36:29 you see uh if you see the old man
2:36:32 make sure to tell them that uh Johnny
2:36:34 says all right I'm sure I'll be glad to
2:36:37 hear it
2:36:38 Johnny hangs up the phone
2:36:39 so it looks like we got a rave scheduled
2:36:41 for the end of April how exciting
2:36:44 yeah I don't have a thing to wear we can
2:36:47 change that oh God I said that in front
2:36:49 of you yes you did oh
2:36:51 to be fair you guys are gonna have to
2:36:52 find a brew how to take you it's kind of
2:36:54 uh we all get a plus one I don't think
2:36:57 anyone's going to turn away an owl even
2:37:00 spend the whole time as an owl not the
2:37:02 whole time but I'll definitely get
2:37:03 through the doors and I'll get a crash
2:37:04 bruja party just make sure you don't uh
2:37:07 ruffle the wrong feathers just my own
2:37:10 I approve of your Pawn thank you thank
2:37:12 you for that oh his not yours I said
2:37:14 what I said it's a team effort yeah well
2:37:17 slowly and surely putting this domain
2:37:19 together things seem to be moving along
2:37:21 well one thing the uh the baron did
2:37:25 request that we encouraged the settides
2:37:29 to leave New Haven I'll let it be known
2:37:31 that until they seek my particular
2:37:33 Hospitality they are not uh not um
2:37:36 not tolerated in New Haven right now you
2:37:39 realize it is going to start some [ __ ] I
2:37:41 look forward to it you seem very
2:37:43 confident
2:37:44 I owe the sedites they've wrecked a few
2:37:48 of my cars at this point and um
2:37:51 you know what it's my turn to take the
2:37:54 initiative on this
2:37:56 speaking of other things have you uh
2:37:58 have we figured out exactly who's going
2:38:00 to be taking all the positions in the
2:38:01 city yet uh as soon as Elsa gets back
2:38:03 I'll have a discussion to make sure
2:38:05 everything's kosher but I have some
2:38:07 thoughts I still need to talk with
2:38:09 Renwick right you were thinking of
2:38:11 having him be a sheriff and Scourge
2:38:13 sheriff or Scourge I want to see what he
2:38:15 would like to do hmm
2:38:17 oh idea for some opinions there Johnny
2:38:19 no I just think that the the sooner we
2:38:21 get these things hammered out the more
2:38:23 stable the domain is going to be for
2:38:25 sure you let those positions just kind
2:38:26 of hang in the breeze it's gonna I think
2:38:28 it's going to be seen as weakness yeah I
2:38:31 just want
2:38:33 I don't want Elsa to be mad at any
2:38:35 particular position right now and her
2:38:37 support is kind of necessary with Reiss
2:38:39 being Rhys I also have some thoughts on
2:38:42 what to do about the asamines yeah well
2:38:45 Clan Gangrels numbers are pretty thin
2:38:46 right now they're another independent
2:38:49 Clan they're probably not
2:38:51 it's not going to be looked on kindly if
2:38:53 you give them a primogen seat but if an
2:38:56 established primogen speaks for them at
2:38:58 least as a trial basis
2:39:00 that might look like you're willing to
2:39:02 work with the new and upcoming and
2:39:06 you're still willing to honor the old
2:39:07 traditions that's an interesting thought
2:39:09 a uh different differing opinion though
2:39:12 I appreciate the fact that you're
2:39:15 looking to let the Assamites stay here
2:39:18 but how much do we actually know about
2:39:20 this clan I mean let's not just fall to
2:39:24 the rumors but usually things like that
2:39:26 get started for a reason I know that
2:39:29 Neil's pretty tight with uh with the
2:39:31 Assamites
2:39:32 I don't know if that means we should let
2:39:34 the whole clan in I don't think it is
2:39:36 the whole clan I think it's just whoever
2:39:38 managed to escape I think we're gonna
2:39:40 need both Neil and Nara to certainly
2:39:42 sort this out Nara owes us to a certain
2:39:44 degree Neil knows them it is should be
2:39:48 able to help us sort out one way from
2:39:50 another I'd rather have a discussion
2:39:51 with them first but if they find
2:39:54 themselves to be a more permanent
2:39:56 resident we can definitely see about
2:39:58 putting them under your I guess don't
2:40:01 say accounting accounting also I don't
2:40:04 know how that would look I mean I think
2:40:07 the primogen council is going to have a
2:40:08 say in asomlight matters regardless so
2:40:11 if you want to speak up for them and
2:40:13 speak on their behalf and vouch for them
2:40:16 that's up to you and Clan Gangrel
2:40:18 which at the moment is you
2:40:21 uh I can't imagine that the Assamites
2:40:24 would take kindly to being put under
2:40:27 your Authority they seem like a proud
2:40:30 bunch and I don't imagine that they
2:40:32 might not look at that as a kindness
2:40:35 It's not a on a permanent basis it would
2:40:38 be for a few months until we establish
2:40:40 whether they're an asset to the city or
2:40:42 not and in that time that would ensure
2:40:43 they have a voice that's a that's a
2:40:45 Great Notion but I know the camarilla
2:40:48 has a long history of saying things
2:40:50 aren't going to be permanent if I were
2:40:52 them I wouldn't trust it well I feel
2:40:55 like they don't have a lot of options
2:40:56 right now so it's definitely a thought
2:40:58 to visit upon if they're open to it the
2:41:00 offer extends I need to know what
2:41:02 information they have and what other
2:41:04 kind of benefits we can get from them
2:41:05 too all right so it sounds like we need
2:41:07 to set up a meeting between you and
2:41:08 these Assamites yep I'm just waiting on
2:41:11 Neil specifically and then we can
2:41:13 reunite him with Nara and then we can go
2:41:16 from there should we should we keep
2:41:18 waiting I don't think he's dead I don't
2:41:20 think he's dead either but
2:41:23 this domain is not going to stop moving
2:41:25 and we can't necessarily put all of our
2:41:29 plans on hold just because Neil went a
2:41:32 wall and Britta is off with
2:41:35 whoever well it wasn't much of her
2:41:38 choice but I'm not saying it was I'm
2:41:40 just saying that if we keep waiting for
2:41:44 them or waiting to hear from them more
2:41:46 than a night or two we're gonna start
2:41:48 getting ourselves in hot water we'll
2:41:49 give it a couple more nights a lot of
2:41:51 them are very busy spending that money
2:41:53 we just gave them good point Chinese
2:41:56 creeper goes off busy freaking popular
2:41:59 tonight huh yeah and as he checks wins
2:42:01 phone rings
2:42:02 uh when checks her phone Johnny's
2:42:06 message is SOS emergency
2:42:09 from what number Kabir is that who's
2:42:13 calling win and that's who's calling
2:42:14 when she picks up hey what's up lean
2:42:18 what's wrong Michael the one who hears
2:42:20 what is happening

2:42:45 not to trust him but I'm gonna get there
2:42:47 and if you can get there that's probably
2:42:48 for the best too and she opens a window
2:42:50 and blows three blood and turns into a
2:42:52 bird and flies away when Birds the [ __ ]
2:42:55 out of there meanwhile there's a knock
2:42:56 at the door I go to the door I'm

2:43:02 Katana and I open it when you open the

2:43:16 emergency you attend a business here
2:43:18 he reaches into his pocket and he throws

2:46:40 Johnny is uh walking down to the parking
2:46:43 lot there's a parking lot where the hoi
2:46:46 polloi put their vehicles I imagine that
2:46:48 the lambo and a few other select members
2:46:50 of the Court actually have a parking
2:46:52 structure connected to the uh to the
2:46:54 court where that's actually uh parked so
2:46:58 he will head down to the Lamborghini
2:46:59 check over his armaments I think he made
2:47:02 a quick stop off in the Sheriff's Office
2:47:04 to grab some body armor and some weapons
2:47:06 to make sure that he is prepared for
2:47:09 whatever might be spooking Kabir and
2:47:12 once he's satisfied with with what he's
2:47:14 got he'll hop in the Lamborghini and
2:47:16 start heading over towards when did say
2:47:19 the Motel 6 correct I think she
2:47:21 clarified it with him
2:47:23 whether it was spoken or not I think
2:47:26 Johnny knows the the uh the hotels that
2:47:29 Kabir tends to haunt being that they're
2:47:31 such good friends and I've got a
2:47:33 Lamborghini so it's probably quick you
2:47:35 know I can drive by the few Motel sixes
2:47:37 that he's he tends to haunt and just try
2:47:39 and spot the uh obvious ravnos vehicle
2:47:42 driving through New Haven is there
2:47:44 anything that Johnny notices about
2:47:46 tonight you start seeing a great deal of
2:47:51 kind of unrest among the Mortal populace
2:47:54 and like there is a car accident you see
2:47:57 people screaming at each other on the
2:47:59 streets there is a literal doomsayer
2:48:02 holding a sign up and screaming about
2:48:05 the end is coming the end is coming
2:48:08 Johnny kind of gives all of these things
2:48:11 a uh wary glance and just keeps on
2:48:14 driving steps on the uh the accelerator
2:48:16 a little bit harder it's a little spooky
2:48:18 and at one point I do need you to give
2:48:20 me a drive check as an SUV just Wings
2:48:23 into your lane trying to avoid something
2:48:25 that's not even there any uh dice bonus
2:48:27 from the lambo we'll give you a plus
2:48:29 three die bonus if it is hit at all that
2:48:31 is totaled
2:48:34 difficulty five for the sports car six
2:48:37 successes with six successes you weave
2:48:40 out of the way and shortly thereafter
2:48:42 you pull up into the Motel 6 where there
2:48:46 is an ambulance present and it looks
2:48:48 like someone has been carved into an
2:48:50 ambulance after some sort of knife fight
2:48:52 broke out in the parking lot what the
2:48:55 hell is going on
2:48:56 Johnny uh steps out locks the lambo and
2:48:59 drops the keys into his pocket looks
2:49:01 around to see if you can see an owl
2:49:03 anywhere when it's right around now then
2:49:05 the owl swoops and and sees the same
2:49:08 ambulance situation not not actually
2:49:10 right by the room that uh Kabir keeps
2:49:13 but she will find the nearest dark
2:49:15 corner closest to his room and change
2:49:18 into herself and just run up to it and
2:49:20 she doesn't care about what's happening
2:49:22 she runs up to his door and she just
2:49:25 knocks once and then opens the door when
2:49:27 the door swings open Johnny you see this
2:49:29 too Kabir who had been staring at a wall
2:49:32 hop into this point turns and bears his
2:49:36 fangs on you win and rushes you I need
2:49:38 an initiative rule
2:49:40 nine uh Johnny's going on a 16. Johnny
2:49:43 at first
2:49:44 um and that's including spending a blood
2:49:46 for an extra action with Celerity okay
2:49:48 it's seeing him with fangs bear rushing
2:49:52 it when he's going to rush forward to
2:49:54 interpose himself between the two of
2:49:56 them and try to basically spear tackle
2:49:58 Kabir to the ground back in the room
2:50:01 give me an attack roll tackle stiff
2:50:03 seven
2:50:03 [Music]
2:50:06 four successes with four successes you
2:50:09 tackle him to the ground grabbing all of
2:50:11 them you can actually feel that the
2:50:13 wounds that were left on him previously
2:50:15 some of it's still there so he's
2:50:17 actually he's been nursing this for a
2:50:18 bit and with him pinned underneath you
2:50:20 he will attempt to break free
2:50:23 thrashing about in the throes of a
2:50:25 frenzy
2:50:27 uh seven successes to hold him down okay
2:50:29 your seven successes beats is one and uh
2:50:33 he is held in place Kabir what the hell
2:50:35 he thrashes and like hisses but not at
2:50:39 you at this like shitty old TV that's
2:50:42 playing the news like desperately
2:50:45 hissing and gnashing at it one thing
2:50:47 with Spirit tracking when can kind of
2:50:49 see through chemistry and Illusions are
2:50:52 there any right now is this actually
2:50:53 Kabir this is actually Kabir okay so she
2:50:56 will slap the TV off since he's hissing
2:50:59 at it so when you go to slap the TV off
2:51:00 you notice something the news is about
2:51:04 this typhoon that has struck from
2:51:08 Calcutta across a vast region and people
2:51:13 are on the news that is talking about
2:51:14 like an expected death toll of in the
2:51:16 Millions
2:51:18 like there is just something going on
2:51:21 and from satellite view there it's just
2:51:25 this Mega storm settled on there and the
2:51:28 Boop TV's off yep Johnny you go Celerity
2:51:30 action yep does he look like he is in
2:51:32 the midst of a hunger frenzy he looks
2:51:35 like he is in the midst of a berserk
2:51:37 frenzy Johnny's going to try and uh
2:51:40 remove a stake from his harness that he
2:51:43 wears under his jacket whereas where he
2:51:45 keeps his weapons while keeping him
2:51:47 pinned down okay uh as you do there are
2:51:51 weird color and light distortions that
2:51:53 are happening from him throughout the
2:51:55 room and when you recognize like
2:51:58 chemistry is just kind of doing stuff
2:52:00 this isn't he's not in control of his
2:52:02 discipline at the moment and this like
2:52:04 weird refracted light that is coming
2:52:06 Johnny is going to be at a minus two die
2:52:09 penalty to a staking wool so stakes in
2:52:11 hand top of the round Johnny Johnny is
2:52:13 going to try and stake Kabir okay give
2:52:15 me a tackle uh your difficulty for a
2:52:17 stake is 9.
2:52:20 two successes give me damage Johnny will
2:52:24 spend a uh point of uh Vitae to activate
2:52:28 potence
2:52:31 10 levels of damage okay he will soak
2:52:35 three and be rendered unconscious and
2:52:37 staked you plant the steak into his
2:52:39 chest and for a moment
2:52:41 the lights and distortions not Eerie
2:52:44 sounds start to settle and then the TV
2:52:47 flips back on
2:52:48 what the [ __ ] is going on we are here
2:52:51 reviewing the storm everything's out of
2:52:54 control people are in danger uh they
2:52:56 start some newscasters talking and in
2:52:59 the storm you can see clear as day there
2:53:03 is something in the storm
2:53:06 and the light Pulses from the screen
