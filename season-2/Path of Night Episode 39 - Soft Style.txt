0:00:00 path of night is an actual play vampire
0:00:02 the Masquerade podcast set in the
0:00:04 classic world of Darkness we're all
0:00:06 friends we're here to have fun but our
0:00:08 story can include graphic violence drug
0:00:10 use sexual content and other mature
0:00:12 themes we talked on our table about
0:00:14 safety comfort and consent both as
0:00:16 players and storytellers we know what to
0:00:19 expect we're all excited to be here we
0:00:21 want you to feel the same so listen or
0:00:23 discretion is advised now let's walk the
0:00:27 path of night last time on path of night
0:00:29 Johnny Nguyen rushed to Neil's Haven to
0:00:32 try and rescue Nara and to take the
0:00:33 evidence of Nils Durham key however ruha
0:00:36 bully boys ledbet runwick had already
0:00:38 arrived When Calls in Kabir the group is
0:00:41 able to steal back both Nara and the
0:00:43 ritual components before
0:00:44 miles and brother bring Neil into court
0:00:47 but the malkavian must be handed over to
0:00:48 the miles tries to talk to the prince
0:00:50 while Breda works on a deal with Elsa
0:00:52 miles finds that his Prince was deeply
0:00:55 unhinged by the dementation of Clinton
0:00:57 King but miles manages to bargain for
0:00:59 the trial to be held last night giving
0:01:01 the cautery a precious extra 24 hours to
0:01:03 try and save me meanwhile Reese
0:01:06 questions meal and just as things had a
0:01:08 Breaking Point Elsa follows through on
0:01:10 our bargain with Brita leading the
0:01:11 torreidor into the interrogation and see
0:01:14 the Seal of the investigation
0:01:16 meanwhile Johnny and Wynn placed their
0:01:18 phone call so I think Johnny and Wynn
0:01:22 head to some
0:01:24 out of the way spot that he knows in the
0:01:26 city to find a pay phone just so that
0:01:29 they can sit with their newly found
0:01:32 asomite friend and not get hassled by
0:01:35 Sabbat or Premier goons I think Kabir is
0:01:40 still with us too oh that's right we
0:01:42 have Kabir with us as well yeah we have
0:01:44 a bunch of unacknowledged people with us
0:01:46 and so if we can if we could if we could
0:01:48 avoid City contacts that'd probably be
0:01:50 great
0:01:51 um do you just want to use my cell phone
0:01:52 and we go hide in the woods for a little
0:01:54 while
0:01:55 that that thing can make a call out in
0:01:56 the woods yeah I can make a call as long
0:01:58 as I'm not standing inside my house
0:01:59 that's impressive yeah yeah why don't we
0:02:01 do that instead all right sorry I can't
0:02:04 trace these things right I that you're
0:02:06 getting into the dark lexicon at this
0:02:08 point I don't know these sort of things
0:02:09 all right it could be right into the
0:02:12 park who's placing the phone call I
0:02:14 think Johnny will because if we're
0:02:16 calling weathers probably the one person
0:02:19 that he might not just hang up on
0:02:21 to be fair he might not hang up on you I
0:02:23 think he might actually talk to you all
0:02:25 right do you want to call others no I
0:02:27 think you should talk to him he might
0:02:29 he's he's getting more and more sick of
0:02:31 my [ __ ] every time I talk to him all
0:02:33 right well if you get the sense that his
0:02:35 [ __ ] a meter is off the tracks you
0:02:37 know hand the phone to me all right I'm
0:02:40 winning oh uh hands her Nokia to Johnny
0:02:43 Johnny stabs the Nokia with big fat
0:02:47 ugly fingers and puts in weather's
0:02:49 number
0:02:49 yeah weathers it's uh it's Johnny
0:02:53 all right Johnny what's going on
0:02:55 um
0:02:56 there's a lot of bad news going around
0:02:58 the city tonight
0:03:00 I heard a little something about them
0:03:02 that you attacked the scourge uh I did I
0:03:05 I I was gonna attack the scourge but a
0:03:08 freaking Shamir got in my way nothing
0:03:10 happened
0:03:10 [Music]
0:03:11 I'm gonna trust you to not [ __ ] me
0:03:13 so what's the issue so whether is you
0:03:15 still in the city
0:03:16 yeah
0:03:18 I've been up in the tray kind of keeping
0:03:20 an eye on things
0:03:21 I don't know if I'm gonna stay
0:03:23 I got an offer to help with some work in
0:03:25 New York
0:03:26 really yeah
0:03:28 what's going on in New York City
0:03:30 potentially it's the front lines
0:03:32 Brothers
0:03:33 yeah
0:03:35 so um
0:03:36 I got a couple of uninvited guests
0:03:39 and I really need to make sure that
0:03:41 they're safe
0:03:43 and I'm hoping you might be able to help
0:03:45 me uh keep an eye out for him or maybe
0:03:48 give me some some Clues to where it
0:03:50 might be safe
0:03:53 um
0:03:54 who are they once my ravnosed friend
0:03:57 that you uh you've met before the other
0:04:00 is
0:04:02 um I think she calls herself a child of
0:04:04 Hakeem
0:04:06 all right
0:04:07 why is an assemite in town
0:04:10 I don't know
0:04:12 but I know that they're that she's being
0:04:14 chased by other asomites who is she
0:04:18 would you like to talk to her
0:04:20 Johnny do you not know who she is she's
0:04:23 a friend of Niels and that's good enough
0:04:24 for me her name's Nara who is that
0:04:27 that's win here tell you what I'm gonna
0:04:29 pass the phone phone to her because you
0:04:31 tend to be nicer to her when takes the
0:04:33 phone hey weather sorry just do you just
0:04:35 passed the [ __ ] phone without asking
0:04:37 me yeah does that surprise you
0:04:41 laughs
0:04:42 her name is Nora her name is Nara
0:04:45 thenara from New Haven years ago I don't
0:04:48 know was there a Nara in New Haven years
0:04:49 ago ask her if she's been here before
0:04:51 wind kind of holds the phone down away
0:04:53 from her mouth hey Nara have you been
0:04:55 here before there's like a slightly
0:04:57 awkward nod
0:04:58 confirmed
0:05:00 I know we're sorry
0:05:01 where does she need to hold up
0:05:03 is there anyone particular or are you
0:05:05 guys just looking for a hole somewhere
0:05:07 we're just trying to keep her away from
0:05:08 the scourge at this point Neil's kind of
0:05:10 fallen into an avalanche of [ __ ] and
0:05:13 um does the scourge know that you have
0:05:14 her
0:05:15 no I don't think so
0:05:19 I need a definite yes or no
0:05:21 Johnny yeah Kabir do we think that the
0:05:24 scourge knows we have her
0:05:26 no way no one would think that we are
0:05:28 responsible for that car crash Johnny
0:05:30 reaches over and takes the phone from
0:05:32 when oh [ __ ] he's taking it back so
0:05:36 the scourge
0:05:38 thinks that he secured Nara and there
0:05:42 was definitely the beginnings of an
0:05:44 altercation with me so if there was
0:05:46 going to be suspicion cast anywhere it
0:05:49 would probably be towards me
0:05:50 and you want me to hide Kabir too why am
0:05:52 I hiding Kabir actually he could
0:05:54 probably fend for himself but I was just
0:05:56 putting putting all my cards in the
0:05:58 table Johnny gives a shrug over to Kabir
0:06:00 like I'm sorry dude
0:06:03 don't worry my friend
0:06:04 we are in control
0:06:07 but aside from the scourge there's also
0:06:10 the uh the web of knives that's running
0:06:13 around looking for Neil and Nara and
0:06:16 there's uh the Sabbat in the city so we
0:06:19 are no not short of any kind of [ __ ]
0:06:23 drop her off at the Metro Station
0:06:26 I'll take care of it from there
0:06:28 whatever all this [ __ ] is you've got
0:06:31 to get it under control or one of those
0:06:34 things that's going to end up killing
0:06:35 you or someone you care about I know
0:06:38 win motions for the phone Johnny hands
0:06:40 it back over hey thank you I got you
0:06:43 yeah you always do
0:06:45 thank you
0:06:46 and she hands it back to Johnny
0:06:48 I'll see you in a little bit old man
0:06:49 yeah I'll see you soon all right what's
0:06:52 the plan well we're gonna load up in my
0:06:56 vehicle we're gonna head over towards
0:06:59 the metro station probably making a stop
0:07:01 off so I can buy him a pack of Newports
0:07:04 and then we're gonna hope that uh
0:07:07 he can provide some protection for Nara
0:07:09 while we try and get things sorted at
0:07:11 the Elysium
0:07:13 I already [ __ ] up by letting them raid
0:07:15 uh Neil's Haven I told him I wouldn't we
0:07:18 [ __ ] up on that man but uh I want to
0:07:20 make sure I can tell him that Nara is in
0:07:22 safe hands yeah
0:07:24 I think we've lost a few too many
0:07:25 friends yeah Nara speaks up so I aim to
0:07:29 stay with this friend of yours
0:07:31 he was the former Sheriff system of this
0:07:33 domain weathers apparently he knows your
0:07:36 sire yeah that's what he said I know of
0:07:38 this man I would trust him with my life
0:07:41 and we're trusting him with yours
0:07:43 because Bobby very honest you're
0:07:45 probably better off with him than with
0:07:46 us at this point he is understood to be
0:07:49 a man of honor I'm glad that's carried
0:07:51 over we need to go into the uh heart of
0:07:54 the domain to try and make sure that
0:07:56 Miles
0:07:57 Brita and Neil are safe and I don't want
0:08:01 to risk you bringing along bring risk
0:08:04 bringing you along is that acceptable
0:08:07 it is is there anything you need
0:08:10 at this time
0:08:12 nothing I cannot find with Mr Weathers
0:08:16 all right
0:08:17 and what is to become of Neil
0:08:19 I'm determined
0:08:21 undetermined he's being accused of being
0:08:24 his own sire and masquerading to defraud
0:08:27 the uh camarilla so it's not looking
0:08:30 good for him
0:08:31 we're gonna do everything we can thank
0:08:33 you
0:08:34 is there anything you can do to help us
0:08:36 with that
0:08:38 still have contact with Alamo if it is
0:08:41 Warriors you need
0:08:43 Warriors can be secured
0:08:46 as much as I love the idea of some uh
0:08:49 asking my backup I don't think that
0:08:52 would do anything but exacerbate the
0:08:54 situation holy [ __ ] did that just come
0:08:56 out of your mouth Johnny yeah that's
0:08:57 that's about my my word budget for the
0:09:00 night
0:09:02 then I will refrain from doing such yep
0:09:04 so long as Neil lives
0:09:07 if Neo goes down I don't think the rest
0:09:09 of us are going to take it quietly the
0:09:11 web of knives want something from Neil
0:09:13 if he is to meet final death there will
0:09:16 be Vengeance what do they want from him
0:09:18 we have seen omen
0:09:21 of dark times that lie before the
0:09:23 children of Hakeem the first among us
0:09:26 great and wise Hakeem taught us long ago
0:09:30 to avoid the Mad Jihad that is the get
0:09:34 of Cain
0:09:35 and in our isolation we would remain
0:09:39 separate and capable judges
0:09:42 some have foretold that an ancient
0:09:46 weapon is to rise
0:09:48 and when it does
0:09:50 our clan will be torn asunder
0:09:53 new has seen
0:09:56 the form that this takes I think he's
0:09:59 mentioned it a couple times the herald
0:10:01 of Hakeem comes Johnny flashes eyes over
0:10:04 at Kabir to get kabir's read on what
0:10:07 Nara is saying he like kind of rolls his
0:10:10 eyes don't worry Johnny Jesus might tend
0:10:14 to be a rather sanctimonious if you
0:10:15 understand my feeling yeah it was you
0:10:18 right right
0:10:19 they always have some great prophecy
0:10:22 some great purpose some great whatever
0:10:24 some knife
0:10:26 Johnny kind of Chuckles
0:10:28 look like she's [ __ ] joking well
0:10:31 Johnny Johnny Chuckles along Kabir but
0:10:33 his eyes are not laughing he's he's kind
0:10:36 of keeping eyes on Nara like he is
0:10:39 rather uncomfortable that like so many
0:10:42 things that he would have normally just
0:10:43 laughed off his [ __ ] is happening
0:10:46 with more and more frequency over the
0:10:48 past
0:10:49 few months of the of uh of 1999. it's
0:10:52 this is just it's getting a little to be
0:10:54 a little bit too coincidental my hair
0:10:57 will sharpen the knife that is the
0:10:59 children of Hakeem and press it to the
0:11:01 throats of the others of your camarilla
0:11:03 the Elders of your Saban none of the get
0:11:06 of Cain shall be safe throughout the
0:11:08 rest of the final nights and this is all
0:11:11 before great Hakeem comes with his
0:11:13 vengeance
0:11:15 well before they can come with their
0:11:16 Vengeance we have to work on not needing
0:11:19 to use ours so let's get you safe for
0:11:21 the night and we'll get to Elysium to
0:11:23 see if we can do anything about Neil of
0:11:24 course
0:11:26 Johnny loads everybody up into his
0:11:28 vehicle and they head off to the metro
0:11:31 station
0:11:32 he will definitely stop somewhere along
0:11:34 the way to buy a pack of Newports
0:11:37 so you can slick some palms and and
0:11:39 hopefully buy a little bit of Grace with
0:11:41 his favorite bruja
0:11:43 and before get we get out I look around
0:11:46 for a vehicle that matches what I
0:11:48 respect weathers to be driving
0:11:50 it is not long
0:11:53 before you arrive to it looks to be like
0:11:56 a big black like SUV the kinds that are
0:12:00 like really popular right around this
0:12:01 time and this one's got like fully
0:12:04 tinted windows on the side it's
0:12:07 definitely like the kind of thing that
0:12:10 he might take to a Chase
0:12:12 the window rolls down and you see
0:12:15 weather's in the driver's seat is there
0:12:17 anybody else in the SUV with them the
0:12:18 windows are tinted
0:12:20 um
0:12:20 Johnny will hop out of the the vehicle
0:12:23 I'll leave the keys in the ignition and
0:12:26 walk over to uh the driver's the
0:12:28 driver's window and hand him the pack of
0:12:30 Newports he will also peek into the SUV
0:12:33 in the back to see if there's just
0:12:35 anything else weird going on uh there
0:12:38 are three of his goals in the back seat
0:12:39 and they're all like packing heat
0:12:42 thank you again for this weather
0:12:44 don't mention him
0:12:46 so this is Nara who kind of like looks
0:12:48 leans over and kind of like
0:12:50 gives her a nod and she like lowers her
0:12:53 head differentially towards him
0:12:55 yeah this is her Johnny kind of motions
0:12:58 for her to get get out of the out of the
0:12:59 truck and jump into the SV with a lot of
0:13:01 weathers she does pretty quick win gave
0:13:04 her the front seat and she sat in the
0:13:05 back with Kabir so you know anything
0:13:07 about this Scourge weathers he shows
0:13:09 child so what's his play here I haven't
0:13:12 had much interacting with him but most
0:13:14 of it seems to be him asking questions
0:13:16 about your quotery the Dynamics of the
0:13:19 domain it's usually a lot of it looks to
0:13:22 be the stuff that's kind of typical
0:13:23 however he is both Persian and Scourge
0:13:27 the prince doesn't usually reward that
0:13:30 as far as I knew I was the only one
0:13:31 doing double back in the day
0:13:34 ah
0:13:36 but he's definitely tied to Warwick so
0:13:39 where did his where did his loyalties
0:13:40 lie because he seems like he's pretty
0:13:42 buddy buddy with tremire he is loyal to
0:13:45 what he thinks the Cameron is supposed
0:13:47 to be just like you are and he wants
0:13:50 Vengeance for his sire wouldn't you
0:13:53 yeah nope if I knew my sire
0:13:57 while we're talking about it
0:13:59 I should warn you
0:14:01 your side is in town
0:14:03 I figured as much and there are a few
0:14:06 things
0:14:07 that would pose an overt problem for the
0:14:09 domain like him in a bad mood
0:14:12 so watch your back
0:14:13 how much do you know about my salary was
0:14:15 because I know Jack all and I feel like
0:14:18 you know more about him than I do
0:14:21 Delgado is a West Coast Outlaw back in
0:14:24 the day when that was the sort of thing
0:14:26 that people were Johnny hisses Delgado
0:14:30 horseback Colt old school I always just
0:14:34 knew him as the black hands he's not the
0:14:37 only of his kind in that regard I just
0:14:39 found out about that too would you hear
0:14:41 them
0:14:44 foreign
0:14:51 when I went down to New York to pick up
0:14:54 Nara and Neil
0:14:57 there was a phrase I was supposed to use
0:14:59 to pick him up in the airport a black
0:15:01 hand Rises
0:15:03 hmm
0:15:06 also the whole thing yeah
0:15:10 keeps on scratching the black hand a
0:15:13 black moon into her hands just like my
0:15:15 sire had
0:15:17 that's pretty bad I figured as much
0:15:21 what are you gonna do about it I'm gonna
0:15:24 keep an eye on it for as long as I can
0:15:28 some warning right there huh watch as
0:15:31 long as you can hoping that it's all
0:15:32 that needs to be done
0:15:34 what I'm asking is what are you gonna do
0:15:36 and that's
0:15:37 no longer the case
0:15:40 I don't want to think too much about
0:15:41 Futures that I don't want to see come to
0:15:43 pass yeah well
0:15:46 I hate to break it to you but that's
0:15:48 being a kindred
0:15:50 and the reason the bra lose is because
0:15:52 they prefer to not do that
0:15:56 I'm gonna get going you guys played safe
0:15:59 yeah yeah I think it's day late a dollar
0:16:03 short for that but we'll do our best no
0:16:05 it's not it can always get worse
0:16:07 right now you're at risk of losing
0:16:09 everything

0:16:13 see how we describe it then

0:16:33 driver's seat hops up and in pulls out a
0:16:36 Morley Pops in his mouth
0:16:38 let's head to Elysium
0:16:39 where you want us to drop you off Kabir

0:16:43 car whatever
0:16:45 their knees brush a couple times I like
0:16:48 that wind doesn't say anything she just
0:16:50 kind of smirks Johnny proceeds to drive
0:16:52 to the Elysium
0:16:55 Chinese real quiet in the back seat
0:16:59 but
0:17:00 It's Gonna Be The Chaperone the state

0:18:15 lingers her gaze lingers a little bit
0:18:17 which confuses even her and she heads
0:18:20 into the Elysium Johnny tucks the keys
0:18:23 away in like a secret spot on the uh on
0:18:26 the vehicle because I feel like he
0:18:28 that's kind of more his style is like
0:18:30 leaving a keys with a vehicle rather
0:18:32 than taking it on his person and he kind
0:18:34 of flashes an eye back in Kabir and kind
0:18:36 of nods to him just you know having
0:18:37 stashed the keys of course my friend I
0:18:40 will take things from you yeah I bet you
0:18:42 will I will yeah you carry any weapons
0:18:45 on you one no good yeah I know
0:18:48 and the two of them walk up in him
0:18:53 [Music]
0:18:57 miles you're out of your meeting and you
0:19:01 already see Reese and a group of Premier
0:19:03 kind of rallying off in a corner and
0:19:05 leaving Elysium as that is happening
0:19:07 when and Johnny arrive I raise my
0:19:11 eyebrows with that but at the Tamir
0:19:13 leaving not the Johnny showing up and
0:19:16 head towards Johnny and Wynn what's the
0:19:19 word
0:19:21 nothing's too good
0:19:23 they uh they managed to raid Neil's
0:19:27 Haven and found mostly everything but on
0:19:31 the upside Friends of the codery are in
0:19:34 safe hands well that's good I assume you
0:19:38 weren't able to stop them from taking
0:19:40 any of this stuff they were already
0:19:41 moving it out when by the time we got
0:19:43 there let's hold off on mentioning that
0:19:45 to him until everything is done it's my
0:19:47 thought yeah where is he by the way
0:19:50 he was Shackled and taken off by the
0:19:53 Chimera but I saw them just leave so I
0:19:57 was going to go check in on Brita
0:19:59 because she was talking to Elsa okay
0:20:03 and I feel like something has happened
0:20:06 oh the prince is um
0:20:08 not feeling well
0:20:10 Jenny kind of gives you a furrowed brow
0:20:12 wind kind of gives a look like what the
0:20:14 [ __ ] does that mean
0:20:16 um it may explain why everything has
0:20:18 happened in this short span but I'm
0:20:21 afraid to go into details and both
0:20:23 company right open court right it's
0:20:26 things I feel like Neil might know about
0:20:29 but we'll get him back eventually let's
0:20:31 just put it that he is unreliable
0:20:34 more so than usual
0:20:36 so what's the plan for tonight besides
0:20:38 get Neil back well I've delayed Judgment
0:20:41 at least on anything uh when at least
0:20:45 till tomorrow
0:20:46 okay which hopefully gives us an ability
0:20:48 to calm some of this down and the only
0:20:51 payment I so far have to do is somehow
0:20:53 make the prince
0:20:56 um appear
0:20:59 cool
0:21:01 so this the nosferati primogen The
0:21:04 Scourge he was the one heading up
0:21:06 operations over at the Haven he's a
0:21:09 primagen anascarge yeah and acting like
0:21:12 a sheriff and that explains you saying
0:21:15 ah the scourge is able to do all this I
0:21:17 think that's uh stepping a little bit
0:21:19 beyond his position but I'm not
0:21:22 necessarily the top of uh domain
0:21:25 politics we'd have to go into the detail
0:21:27 but I'm imagining that but the bully
0:21:29 boys were acting like he was calling the
0:21:31 shots oh we can look into that later I'm
0:21:34 just letting you know since you're
0:21:36 acting Sheriff yes I mean I feel like I
0:21:39 am Sheriff but uh doesn't mean that
0:21:43 there isn't practices inside the bully
0:21:46 organization from everything that
0:21:48 happened oh I get it I just I want to
0:21:50 make sure you have the information so
0:21:51 you don't look bad if someone brings it
0:21:53 up good thought
0:21:55 let's go find bread and see what our
0:21:56 next step is here
0:21:58 so we'll start looking for her and
0:22:00 moving towards imagine the middle area
0:22:03 of the corner we're just kind of in life
0:22:05 by herself on a nice big lavish sofa
0:22:09 which kind of makes her somehow look
0:22:11 smaller while sitting on it she looks up
0:22:13 as everyone approaches hi
0:22:16 okay thank you none
0:22:19 um
0:22:20 so she kind of pitches her voice lower
0:22:23 uh conscious of the Elysium
0:22:26 the investigation is going to be handled
0:22:28 by The Toreador now
0:22:30 to oversee verification of Neil's
0:22:34 identity and of his magic
0:22:38 that won't Ensure
0:22:40 uh the verdict that we are hoping for
0:22:43 but it will assure that there won't be a
0:22:46 sabotage you must have paid a pretty
0:22:48 penny for that well there's two possible
0:22:51 prices and there's a bit more hang on
0:22:54 um
0:22:55 Elise we'll meet with the prince also
0:22:58 we'll meet with the prince I think that
0:23:00 might have already happened and the code
0:23:02 Ray will have the chance to help prove
0:23:05 Neil's innocence
0:23:06 before the final verdict when it comes
0:23:09 to the price
0:23:10 yeah
0:23:12 I did bargain like you suggested there's
0:23:16 two possible prices depending on how
0:23:18 this goes right now my name and yours
0:23:22 win we're on the book owing a lifeboon
0:23:25 each
0:23:26 to Elsa if we prove Neil's innocence
0:23:30 that life been shifts from you to him
0:23:32 wind kind of gives a nod like she
0:23:35 expected this but there's a way to get
0:23:37 rid of them both
0:23:39 um
0:23:40 she turns to miles miles raises an
0:23:43 eyebrow
0:23:44 when I was learning about Boons and
0:23:46 everything
0:23:47 um a blood Boon is less than a life
0:23:50 spoon
0:23:51 and one of the possible prices for one
0:23:56 basically the the agreement that we came
0:23:59 to was that I would
0:24:02 Be Blood bound to her
0:24:05 and if you would apologize to her
0:24:08 if you would apologize publicly in
0:24:12 Elysium so that everyone would hear to
0:24:15 show your support for her and that you
0:24:19 regretted the disrespect she feels she
0:24:21 showed her that she would erase the life
0:24:23 spoons and that would be all
0:24:26 what exactly does she want me to
0:24:27 apologize for she wants a public
0:24:29 declaration that you had not seen that
0:24:32 you would not seek to negatively impact
0:24:35 her that you feel that you've
0:24:37 disrespected her that you
0:24:41 should have shown your support and
0:24:43 admiration more
0:24:45 that's what I was doing but I'll confirm
0:24:48 with her to get whatever specific
0:24:49 apologies she wants
0:24:51 so that she can't say that I didn't hit
0:24:52 the marks that she wanted what she'll
0:24:55 want from you is
0:24:58 I think why she was willing to accept me
0:25:01 being blood bound to her instead of
0:25:03 having a life burn over me
0:25:06 sincerity
0:25:07 and she did she blood bond that Romeo
0:25:11 kid
0:25:12 I don't know because he was awfully
0:25:15 buddy buddy with her and spent a lot of
0:25:17 time around here and realized they were
0:25:19 clan mates and all but I mean I believe
0:25:21 he was under her accounting so listen
0:25:24 if she's willing to save Neil I'm okay
0:25:28 with giving her that admiration and I
0:25:31 know it won't be my choice so long as
0:25:33 that blood Bond
0:25:34 works but I mean we've given each other
0:25:39 that and for lesser costs
0:25:43 rather for for higher costs for nothing
0:25:45 just try to help each other sure but for
0:25:48 me to feel that way towards her I I I'll
0:25:52 I'll pay I'll pay that price that's
0:25:55 that's fine look all I'm curious about
0:25:57 is the fact that she she seems to take a
0:26:00 a particular shine to you young lost
0:26:02 licks
0:26:04 that could just be coincidence but I
0:26:06 feel like coincidences in short supply
0:26:08 these days is it a blood Bond or a blood
0:26:12 Boon blood Bond
0:26:14 she wants assurance that she can depend
0:26:18 on us that we won't undermine her and
0:26:20 that we will support her publicly in
0:26:23 this domain that her reputation will be
0:26:26 bolstered by ours and by our actions
0:26:28 that's why I think she wants the apology
0:26:30 from you in part to demonstrate that
0:26:33 we're linked to her and in part because
0:26:35 she does feel genuinely disrespected by
0:26:37 you and I know that might not have been
0:26:38 your intention but that's how she
0:26:40 perceives it
0:26:42 I guess that I'm willing to do so but I
0:26:45 want to hit the points with her because
0:26:46 I'm not going to do something
0:26:49 half-assed so I want to know what she's
0:26:51 looking for and it may have been a
0:26:53 misunderstanding I'll point out this
0:26:56 she is one of the Elders of this domain
0:26:59 the elders are very particular
0:27:01 about they the way they feel catered to
0:27:04 you going and asking her how to
0:27:07 apologize might offend her further if
0:27:11 this is what I think it is she's just
0:27:13 trying to flex on you and she might just
0:27:16 want to see you prostrate yourself in
0:27:17 open court and try to cover all of your
0:27:21 bases without asking
0:27:23 just a thought I'm going to have a
0:27:27 conversation with her before I go and do
0:27:30 all sorts of apologies on the thing
0:27:32 don't say I didn't mourn you miles if
0:27:34 you are to have a conversation with her
0:27:37 would you consider opening with a
0:27:40 private apology and the assurance that
0:27:42 you will give her the public apology so
0:27:44 that she might be more open to talk to
0:27:46 you if she feels that I have wrong
0:27:48 alhamdul then I want to get to the root
0:27:50 of the matter and I will do so it was
0:27:52 not my intention through our last
0:27:54 contact to do such a thing lead with
0:27:56 that when you do talk to her you might
0:28:00 want to frame it as the truth that you
0:28:02 have offended her not that she feels
0:28:04 that you offended her but if you take
0:28:07 her perspective and take her side she'll
0:28:08 be more open to you is that what I said
0:28:11 by her feeling that I offended her
0:28:15 offended her you offended her that's her
0:28:17 reality
0:28:18 so don't in this case lead with what her
0:28:22 feelings are What I've Done Works
0:28:24 because of deference it works because of
0:28:28 being willing to put my life in her
0:28:31 hands and being willing to put my
0:28:32 respect towards her and if we carry that
0:28:35 energy through I mean she's already done
0:28:38 this much for us
0:28:40 so I mean she did this much for us
0:28:42 because she's got her side of the
0:28:44 bargain so she's upholding her side of
0:28:46 the bargain but keep in mind she views
0:28:49 her time and her efforts at very highly
0:28:51 as Elder it's not an even bargain miles
0:28:55 Clan ventru is the best clan at making
0:28:57 deals and forcing things Clan toridor he
0:29:03 points over to Brita
0:29:04 are the ones who make sure all all this
0:29:07 social [ __ ] is lubricated and
0:29:09 happens listen to what the young one's
0:29:12 saying I get it I know but I will I'm
0:29:15 just saying this is
0:29:19 I'm perfectly fine with the whole
0:29:23 apology and everything like that but I
0:29:25 also want to be
0:29:27 it also has to be from me and with the
0:29:30 correct
0:29:33 the word I'm looking for correct
0:29:35 truth to it my truth the correct way the
0:29:38 way I would say these things if I just
0:29:41 say things people are going to know it's
0:29:44 not a real apology so I need to go and
0:29:46 get that because I am perfectly willing
0:29:48 to give her what she wants
0:29:50 so just know going in that she feels
0:29:53 that what you said the way that you
0:29:55 conducted to hurt yourself with her
0:29:58 undermined her that's the source of the
0:30:01 sense of disrespect that you were not
0:30:03 the considerate that he somehow made her
0:30:06 less powerful when you're trying to get
0:30:10 people to like you
0:30:12 it's cumulative
0:30:15 people need to continue liking you so if
0:30:18 people are seen not to like you it hurts
0:30:21 that effort
0:30:23 um miles our names are in the book when
0:30:27 and I so as Harpy it is always her
0:30:31 choice
0:30:33 as to whether or not she would ever take
0:30:35 those moons out so any wait a minute you
0:30:38 paid her in a boon and now you're also
0:30:40 planning to give her a blood Bond and
0:30:42 have him apologize no it's just that the
0:30:45 boons are there they're in the book and
0:30:48 she's the only one who can take them out
0:30:49 as Harpy in order to replace it with the
0:30:52 other costs the boots are there in order
0:30:55 for her to keep doing what she's doing
0:30:57 right now like collateral yes you
0:31:01 realize that you are taking her at face
0:31:04 value that she would replace those right
0:31:07 I realize that I'm willing to pay that
0:31:10 price if it need be and that the only
0:31:12 way that she's going to trust us again
0:31:15 is if we show that we can trust her
0:31:18 we can't trust her you know that we need
0:31:22 somebody in here to trust and the other
0:31:24 options aren't particularly great when
0:31:26 it comes to trusts what we're asking of
0:31:29 her is a high price if she's willing to
0:31:32 help us with that I think that's worth
0:31:34 some trust I do and I know that I can't
0:31:37 trust I just I want you to remove any
0:31:40 expectation that trust has anything to
0:31:43 do with this transaction she will help
0:31:46 us
0:31:47 she will make us pay a price I don't
0:31:49 think you should conflate that any of
0:31:52 this has anything to do with trust
0:31:55 I know to be careful but I know you're
0:31:58 looking out for me to remind me
0:32:01 I'm just pointing out the reality to the
0:32:03 camarilla
0:32:05 that's all kid but the reality is is
0:32:07 that now we have a way to save Neil to
0:32:10 possibly save Neil possibly we have the
0:32:13 opportunity to save Neil she's right an
0:32:16 opportunity with the tornado is held
0:32:18 better than the opportunity with with
0:32:20 the tremeer we know that the tramir from
0:32:23 what Elsa said we're going to sabotage
0:32:26 it for sure we need to take steps to try
0:32:29 to heal this domain if we're going to
0:32:31 stand any chance of any outside with any
0:32:33 outside attacks she is the most
0:32:35 competent person in charge I agree so
0:32:39 let's just not forget we're riding
0:32:41 across the river on her and taking a
0:32:44 scorpion with us just let's not borrow
0:32:46 trouble until that time you're right to
0:32:49 be cautious what else can we do did you
0:32:51 learn anything while you were out short
0:32:54 answer yes long answer
0:32:56 we should go to your place after this
0:32:58 and talk all right
0:33:00 can you start trying to make the prints
0:33:02 seem cool
0:33:03 it's
0:33:06 um Brita kind of goes like quiet and
0:33:08 like looks down and like kind of like
0:33:10 toys with uh I imagine this is probably
0:33:12 a velvet couch yeah it just starts like
0:33:15 kind of nervously running her finger
0:33:17 over the Velvet and looks back at Miles
0:33:20 and says
0:33:22 is he it says Chris mad at me no he just
0:33:27 looked he looked kind of upset I mean he
0:33:30 he was upset but
0:33:31 right now the best thing we can do for
0:33:34 the craze is to make him feel better and
0:33:38 he needs to feel like the court respects
0:33:40 him
0:33:41 so I'm going to
0:33:44 have this small conversation with Elsa
0:33:46 and hopefully while that's happening you
0:33:48 can maybe bolster his Grace's reputation
0:33:51 with some of the members of the court
0:33:52 and I will try to keep my mouth shut
0:33:55 Johnny's already looking around the room
0:33:57 to see if you can spot The Scourge The
0:33:59 Scourge has not arrived yet is anybody
0:34:01 wearing the scourge's clothes arrived uh
0:34:03 no all right uh while people are looking
0:34:05 around for people I suppose Britta is
0:34:07 looking around the room for Rollins
0:34:09 Upton rolands has barricaded himself in
0:34:13 his uh office all right you need to make
0:34:16 the general populous make him feel cool
0:34:18 to that objective Brita is going to sort
0:34:22 of while the others are seeking their
0:34:24 objectives walk around listen into
0:34:27 conversations listen in if she needs to
0:34:31 enhance just to try to catch like the
0:34:34 current feeling on uh Roland's and how
0:34:36 she might use that people are quietly
0:34:39 saying that romance has gone completely
0:34:41 insane and uh May oppose a permanent
0:34:45 problem for the domain unless it's
0:34:46 addressed and apparently he made an
0:34:49 announcement that the prince of Boston
0:34:52 humiliated him and has warned everyone
0:34:54 that if they speak of it they will be
0:34:56 killed everyone is talking about it but
0:34:57 like everyone's agreeing like don't tell
0:34:59 anyone but this don't tell anyone but
0:35:02 this don't tell anyone but this and it's
0:35:05 like insanely scandalous so I
0:35:09 take a deep breath as people as I move
0:35:12 away from the group and like Center
0:35:13 myself and like put on more of my normal
0:35:17 card face and go seek the center of
0:35:20 attention
0:35:22 or whatever that's usually wherever else
0:35:24 it would be two people enter Elsa and uh
0:35:28 the Nosferatu Premiership Elsa kind of
0:35:31 like finds a seat relaxes
0:35:33 as a drink poor fur she seems kind of
0:35:36 bored with the knife apparently the
0:35:38 excitement of Upton Roland's being
0:35:39 cray-cray has come and gone for her
0:35:41 she's no longer interested I will move
0:35:44 towards her and wait to be acknowledged
0:35:46 okay on your way there the nosferatsu
0:35:50 premagen kind of moves and intercepts
0:35:52 Sheriff primogen we need a conversation
0:35:56 all right do you need it here or do you
0:35:59 want to go somewhere else that's up to
0:36:00 you an awesome I was detained at your
0:36:02 quarter inmates Haven since then the
0:36:06 kids are responsible for transporting
0:36:08 the asthma it was attacked and now the
0:36:11 assemite is at Large
0:36:14 another quarter he made of yours was
0:36:16 present at the scene when it happened
0:36:18 all right
0:36:20 what do you know about it what do I know
0:36:22 about it that is what I just asked that
0:36:25 I know that you were there with some
0:36:28 Shamir and you took away a person I just
0:36:31 told you that part right other than that
0:36:34 I hadn't heard much you hadn't heard
0:36:37 much no they just came back our bully
0:36:40 boys acting outside of your command
0:36:41 doing this [ __ ] accordingly they seem to
0:36:43 be acting outside of my command when you
0:36:45 were commanding them the prince gave
0:36:47 instructions to the domain as a whole I
0:36:49 think you should be rather proud now
0:36:51 your bully boys were adhering to the
0:36:53 prince's wishes very good I'd only got
0:36:56 one side of the story of course well I
0:36:58 have that where is the asomite
0:37:01 I have no idea where did you put the
0:37:04 estimate on
0:37:05 it sounds like you've misplaced the
0:37:08 individual you've obtained subtly
0:37:10 telling you that a member of your
0:37:11 quarter just in feared it interfered
0:37:12 with an investigation and set loose
0:37:15 someone that's probably going to be
0:37:16 blood hunted and I'm going to go
0:37:18 recommend that he be Blood Hunter along
0:37:19 with her but I'm willing to talk to you
0:37:21 first so are you going to seize the
0:37:23 opportunity to talk to me about this
0:37:24 before I do that or am I just going to
0:37:26 go in my [ __ ] way we're talking I
0:37:28 don't feel like we're having a
0:37:29 conversation right now but maybe you can
0:37:31 convince me that it's worth my time to
0:37:33 stand here and continue talking to you
0:37:35 more than likely the astonite is out of
0:37:37 this city at this point
0:37:39 what makes you feel that way
0:37:41 because that would be the safest thing

0:37:46 code right mates here where's the asthma

0:37:57 all this I'm here to do my job and if
0:37:59 there's someone that's smuggling
0:38:01 unwanted Kindred out of the domain
0:38:03 particularly asomites I'm going to make
0:38:05 sure it's dealt with all right shouldn't
0:38:08 we find out about what's going on first
0:38:10 yes that is exactly why I just [ __ ]
0:38:12 approached you right no you came to me
0:38:14 with accusations not I came to you with
0:38:17 what I know about the situation and you
0:38:19 apparently don't know much so I'm gonna
0:38:20 let you take some time to figure it out
0:38:22 what is your problem with the watch you
0:38:24 have blatantly Sabbat called remates
0:38:27 about sympathizers from this don't make
0:38:30 me prove it in the middle of a crowd so
0:38:32 bot sympathizers he casts Brita a look
0:38:35 and then looks back at you
0:38:37 find out where the asimide is thank you
0:38:39 for your time Sheriff he walks away did
0:38:42 he say Sabbat sympathizer is loud enough
0:38:44 for other people on the court to hear
0:38:46 yes loud enough for Johnny to hear yes
0:38:48 Johnny will cut him off as he goes to
0:38:51 leave the court what the [ __ ] did you
0:38:53 just say about me what makes you think
0:38:55 I'm talking about you Johnny I don't
0:38:57 think you're a sympathizer I think
0:38:58 you're full on in you think I'm Sabbat
0:39:00 yeah he's killed remembers is rising
0:39:03 you've been involved in Diablo you've
0:39:05 embraced Sabbat ghouls you've had access
0:39:08 to Sabbat paraphernalia you spend all of
0:39:11 your time warning everybody about how
0:39:13 dangerous the pack you came from is why
0:39:15 wouldn't I think that you're awfully
0:39:18 [ __ ] stupid for anosferatu yeah yeah
0:39:21 cause you don't know [ __ ] about what's
0:39:22 going on do you I don't know what's on
0:39:25 Bridges hands Johnny looks over are your
0:39:27 hands open or are they gloved Britta is
0:39:30 always wearing gloves and has often in
0:39:32 the past put makeup on even before the
0:39:34 gloves it is a strange thing that he
0:39:36 might know that there would be something
0:39:37 on my hands what the [ __ ] is up with her
0:39:39 with her hands oh oh so you don't know
0:39:44 yeah you're real quiet all of a sudden
0:39:46 now Johnny
0:39:47 I thought you're gonna get in my face
0:39:48 and tell me that I don't know anything
0:39:49 about what's going on but you don't
0:39:51 understand is that we've already plucked
0:39:54 a [ __ ] ton of information out of your
0:39:55 quotery mate we know the dirt that's
0:39:58 going on with your Quarry stop
0:40:00 pretending that you're innocent first
0:40:02 off I embraced the xantosa for the
0:40:04 archon The archon Wanted the zantosa
0:40:08 Embrace is that what you're telling me
0:40:10 the archon needed zentosa alive I mean
0:40:14 if this conversation is going over I'm
0:40:15 going to start moving to back him up
0:40:16 because before that was a normal thing
0:40:18 but this is starting to become a little
0:40:19 bit different
0:40:20 Everyone's Watching yeah for that matter
0:40:23 what Diablo are you talking about you
0:40:25 talking about your [ __ ] sire because
0:40:28 that happened because of Premier blood
0:40:30 magic get your facts straight and he
0:40:32 stabs a finger into his chest like
0:40:35 pointing out his point you feel like a
0:40:37 rough hide yeah underneath uh like like
0:40:40 some sort of like carapace almost
0:40:41 underneath his clothes and he steps
0:40:44 forward like kind of escalating things
0:40:46 even for further and now you can kind of
0:40:49 smell the stench of the sores coming off
0:40:51 of him Brett has been listening as she's
0:40:53 been listening to the court and the
0:40:55 whisper as I imagine the whispers are
0:40:57 transitioning to this topic pretty
0:40:59 quickly so you mean to tell me that the
0:41:01 premiere the tremeer the ones that are
0:41:04 responsible for your Secrets getting
0:41:07 exposed or now suddenly the guy that I
0:41:09 should be worried about I'm telling you
0:41:11 you didn't have any problems with Shaw
0:41:13 we had plenty of problems man and you
0:41:15 didn't get into a fight we saw you
0:41:17 didn't attack him whose fangs were in my
0:41:19 sire's neck your Cyrus fangs were bared
0:41:21 trying to pull blood out of my neck
0:41:23 because there was four and he holds up
0:41:25 his hand four vampires in the middle of
0:41:28 this Elysium that the tramir drained of
0:41:31 blood with blood magic so they would
0:41:33 [ __ ] eat each other alright fine tell
0:41:35 me who they are tell me what reliable
0:41:37 Kindred sources you've got Johnny uh
0:41:40 looks over to uh Elsa uh and gives her a
0:41:44 hard look
0:41:45 anything you want to speak up primogen
0:41:47 are you saying that to uh Elsa yeah Elsa
0:41:51 sets her glass down
0:41:53 and she stands up and approaches the
0:41:57 group of you
0:41:59 do you have any idea how embarrassing
0:42:01 this is
0:42:02 no okay
0:42:05 the entire concept
0:42:07 of the camera
0:42:09 is to create an environment
0:42:13 or kindred
0:42:15 can engage in the conflicts that they
0:42:17 have and not
0:42:19 be loud obtuse
0:42:23 idiots
0:42:24 risking The Domain in their feuds
0:42:27 and what you are doing is casting aside
0:42:30 every opportunity for civility and that
0:42:34 the camera offers
0:42:35 and deciding
0:42:37 that you will be thugs out on a street
0:42:40 chest thumping and now you're asking me
0:42:44 to participate
0:42:46 and not your flagrant unwillingness to
0:42:50 behave as Kindred she says looking
0:42:51 between both Johnny and Renwick so
0:42:57 I do have something I would like to say
0:43:00 and what I would like to say is that
0:43:04 both of you
0:43:06 need to stop
0:43:08 Johnny kind of relaxes his posture to a
0:43:12 much more kind of peaceful stance
0:43:16 bows his head and then looks up at
0:43:18 Renwick kind of with a begrudging offer
0:43:22 of you want to try and restart this
0:43:25 conversation with the with the torridor
0:43:28 looking over us he seeths with hatred
0:43:32 for the man who killed The Sire and also
0:43:34 anything to do with The Toreador and
0:43:37 just kind of nuts
0:43:40 my sire was loyal
0:43:43 to the camera
0:43:45 and served the Elders of the camera
0:43:48 Faithfully
0:43:50 he was never a member of the Saban and
0:43:53 every interaction he had was the Sabbat
0:43:56 was for the purposes of gathering
0:43:57 information
0:43:59 politics whatever they were he did not
0:44:02 deserve
0:44:03 to die like then
0:44:06 I hated your sire's guts but I
0:44:10 completely agree that he did not deserve
0:44:13 to die like he did
0:44:15 not really sure of what to do with his
0:44:20 anger
0:44:21 Renwick gives a slow nod
0:44:25 and quietly excuses himself
0:44:28 as he goes to turn
0:44:31 Johnny Goes to reach out to like grab a
0:44:35 shoulder but then thinks better of it um
0:44:37 find out what the premiere did that
0:44:39 night
0:44:41 I will
0:44:43 Johnny then turns to Elsa drops down to
0:44:47 a knee
0:44:48 Miss Lyndon
0:44:49 thank you for your instruction
0:44:53 I was completely out of line
0:44:56 and it is by your grace that this
0:44:59 situation has been resolved the way it
0:45:01 should be
0:45:02 and he kind of just bows his head and
0:45:04 waits for her to do something
0:45:06 she
0:45:08 walks away from me for a moment picks
0:45:10 upper glass
0:45:12 and holds it out for you
0:45:14 stay a while
0:45:16 does she look like she wants me to drink
0:45:18 from the glass she's just offering you a
0:45:19 drink yeah puts a hand out of polite
0:45:23 refusal yeah of a plight decline I don't
0:45:27 think this would stay civil if I drank
0:45:30 that
0:45:31 my Constitution is not able to uh imbibe
0:45:36 he's kind of being obtuse as to whether
0:45:38 it's blood or wine yeah I think he'll do
0:45:40 just fine if the offer still stands I
0:45:42 will stay a while though
0:45:44 the office stands thank you for your
0:45:46 hospitality she has as though like like
0:45:50 parting the Red Sea a crowd of gawking
0:45:55 Kindred kind of shift out of the way and
0:45:58 begin
0:45:59 having their own conversations none of
0:46:01 them about what just happened
0:46:03 uh as Elsa goes off to find her seat at
0:46:09 the piano and she flips the cover up to
0:46:13 reveal the keys and just kind of like
0:46:16 busies herself with the piano for a
0:46:19 while Johnny will move to the sides of
0:46:21 the room and will kind of keep his mouth
0:46:24 shut for the rest of the night
0:46:32 foreign
0:46:36 so I did follow them back to the piano
0:46:39 and that I'm just yet again waiting for
0:46:42 her to acknowledge me
0:46:44 yes miles
0:46:45 also Linden Miss Linden poppy London if
0:46:49 you must fair enough
0:46:51 I owe you a conversation
0:46:54 an interesting interpretation at least
0:46:56 at this point
0:46:58 also interesting what would you like to
0:47:00 discuss I want to know how I can
0:47:05 apologize for my offensiveness
0:47:07 miles and how I can prevent it in the
0:47:10 future
0:47:12 they're asking about how to
0:47:13 contractually word it to be fair yes but
0:47:16 also truthfully I want to know
0:47:20 miles you approached me with an offer an
0:47:23 offer that was built entirely on the
0:47:25 assumption that you know what is best
0:47:27 about my future
0:47:29 and when you thought you wouldn't get
0:47:31 what you wanted about my future
0:47:35 you pushed
0:47:37 and then you demanded
0:47:40 that the relationship I have with your
0:47:43 quality be built on prestation
0:47:46 you wanted a life boom
0:47:49 when you had already had my Aid
0:47:51 genuinely
0:47:52 and now we are here in a scenario where
0:47:54 you are getting exactly what you want I
0:47:56 am Harpy and our relationship is built
0:47:59 on press station
0:48:00 I wanted
0:48:02 to put you in a position where you were
0:48:04 more in charge of everything else in
0:48:05 this court than anything yes but I'm a
0:48:08 woman who does not belong to you you
0:48:10 don't get to put me into positions I
0:48:13 thought that was what you wanted and it
0:48:14 was my misunderstanding it is a
0:48:16 misunderstanding of a conversation we
0:48:18 didn't have I never told you I wanted to
0:48:20 be a heartbeat no that was my
0:48:22 misunderstanding is that I used my own
0:48:24 prejudices
0:48:26 I didn't ask you you are correct
0:48:29 and I have not endured
0:48:32 the unlife that I have endured
0:48:35 to have a young man come to my door and
0:48:38 tell me what I will do with my Knights
0:48:41 I understand you do know that I was also
0:48:43 trying to secure the domain that's what
0:48:46 I was doing it for Miles the domain will
0:48:48 always
0:48:50 be in some new tumultuous circumstance
0:48:54 it is not my responsibility and you
0:48:56 don't get to press gang me
0:48:58 into protecting your Clan's assets he
0:49:02 sees she can see basically regret that
0:49:04 the fact that this should not be
0:49:06 essentially that we shouldn't be
0:49:08 handling the prince in the way that we
0:49:10 are
0:49:12 that kind of regret just comes across
0:49:14 especially when like comparative like
0:49:15 how competent Arabella was and
0:49:17 everything else like that the truth is
0:49:20 you were put into a position that you
0:49:22 are not ready for and you needed help
0:49:26 but your pride forbade you from asking
0:49:31 so instead you went from door to door
0:49:34 with Solutions expecting that everyone
0:49:36 would get in line
0:49:38 I cannot work with you
0:49:40 if that is now you intend to function
0:49:43 it was not it was just a series of being
0:49:46 pushed around myself that had an
0:49:48 unfortunate circumstances
0:49:51 I want
0:49:53 the best for this domain but
0:49:55 I also understand that sometimes
0:49:59 not everybody wants to be what I think
0:50:02 they could be and
0:50:04 they have their own things they want to
0:50:06 be doing
0:50:07 yes smiles it's hard it's a lot of it is
0:50:10 my
0:50:11 responsibility
0:50:14 I don't always get that option
0:50:17 a burden of the venture
0:50:19 quite possibly one of our own making I
0:50:22 suspect you might actually be right for
0:50:24 once thanks kind of like gauges how you
0:50:27 handle
0:50:28 her chastising you
0:50:30 that is what I want an apology for
0:50:34 well I'm apologizing here and I will do
0:50:36 it in the court I look forward to
0:50:38 hearing it hopefully I will be able to
0:50:40 do it in a satisfactory way
0:50:42 I hope so
0:50:47 [Music]
0:50:50 as the group of you are aware the
0:50:53 following night is when the trial is to
0:50:55 take place and the camera has something
0:50:57 of a reputation for not being overly
0:51:00 Fair a great deal of whether or not he
0:51:02 survives is going to be based on his
0:51:04 ability to become a very popular man in
0:51:06 a very short period of time sure if you
0:51:09 end up heading to your Havens for the
0:51:10 evening
0:51:11 Kabir is was indeed waiting right in the
0:51:14 car just as he was instructed to
0:51:16 and you find yourselves able to get some
0:51:19 rest for the evening
0:51:20 you experience your rest which is death
0:51:23 like sleep
0:51:25 Neil
0:51:26 you do not rest so comfortably but when
0:51:29 you were taken the tour we were largely
0:51:32 actually keep you in the same room that
0:51:33 you were interviewed in
0:51:35 and one by one over the course of the
0:51:37 night they file out going about their
0:51:40 business
0:51:41 eventually
0:51:43 you find yourself alone
0:51:46 and while you're alone
0:51:49 and you can feel the weight of day
0:51:53 beginning to force you into a
0:51:57 that Restless sleep that takes all
0:52:00 vampires when the Sun rises
0:52:02 the door to your room opens
0:52:06 and figure enters
0:52:09 and
0:52:10 you recognize
0:52:13 the figure
0:52:14 as the person I have been hunting you
0:52:16 from New York
0:52:18 to Boston
0:52:20 to hear
0:52:22 and when they like shut that door behind
0:52:24 them

0:52:30 and then day takes you

0:53:36 see you next time Kendrick
0:53:37 [Music]
0:53:45 by the way after the last podcast
0:53:46 episode I did go back and watch the Pete
0:53:48 Holmes thing with the angel oh my God
0:53:51 [ __ ] bird
0:53:55 shouldn't you send a bird oh my God
0:53:58 miles channeling Pete Holmes Xavier is
0:54:01 [ __ ] amazing so the reason that this
0:54:03 all happened with the [ __ ] bird joke
0:54:05 is me and Rebecca watch the videos
0:54:08 and we were watching like oh my God he's
0:54:11 [ __ ] miles yes he's like he's just
0:54:14 miles it's literally the next day we
0:54:16 were recording and then miles I think
0:54:19 said some [ __ ] about birds that are like
0:54:20 oh no he told win shouldn't you
0:54:30 [ __ ] bird
0:54:34 he said together no I remember we were
0:54:37 sitting there and I turned to Lex and I
0:54:39 was like I mean I love that Garrett is
0:54:40 hit by this again because he also in the
0:54:42 recording that we posted he's like
0:54:44 that's so good well yeah but like I like
0:54:47 I thought we were just riffing on that
0:54:49 bit I didn't even I didn't even make the
0:54:51 connection that like that like Xavier or
0:54:54 Pete Holmes Xavier is [ __ ] mild it's
0:54:57 like I just turned to Lex and I said is
0:54:59 that not just miles and there was no
0:55:01 reception of new information in his
0:55:03 expression like it just was like an
0:55:06 understood truth that had yeah it's just
0:55:09 like
0:55:10 yeah yeah he has that weird Mid-Atlantic
0:55:13 accent that I'm kind of affecting for
0:55:15 this particular character oh it's great
0:55:17 yep
0:55:18 [ __ ] bird good
0:55:23 do you want me to spit this back out for
0:55:25 you
0:55:29 miles talk [ __ ]
