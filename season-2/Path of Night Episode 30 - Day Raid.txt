0:00:24 [Music]
0:00:30 last time on path of nine
0:00:33 the quotery arrives in Boston
0:00:36 they meet up with Scourge Sullivan learn
0:00:38 the lay of the land and make
0:00:40 arrangements for a safe haven
0:00:43 the group plan's strategy to navigate
0:00:45 the eccentricities of The Prince and his
0:00:47 Redcoats
0:00:50 during the day Neil awakens to the scent
0:00:53 of smoke
0:01:06 [Music]
0:01:08 Neil as the group of you rest you find
0:01:12 yourself very suddenly jerked awake by
0:01:16 the power of your blood magic
0:01:18 and already
0:01:21 you can smell smoke
0:01:23 in their nostrils and this like this
0:01:26 Soft Orange flickering light from
0:01:29 somewhere else in the apartment Neo
0:01:32 pulls himself out of the bathtub and
0:01:34 goes to go out into the main room sort
0:01:38 of panic and starts starts yelling
0:01:40 everybody up everybody up there's a fire
0:01:42 you yell to alarm everyone and as you
0:01:45 kind of like look into that main area
0:01:47 the door to the apartment has been
0:01:50 opened and is still somewhat ajar and
0:01:54 the Flames seem to be kind of coming
0:01:56 from there and they are very rapidly
0:01:58 clinging up along the walls and smoke
0:02:00 starting to blow up and block the
0:02:03 ceiling whatever accelerant they're
0:02:04 using is a very very fast accelerant as
0:02:08 you yell for uh everyone to wake up I
0:02:11 need everyone else at the table to make
0:02:14 a Humanity roll again at difficulty
0:02:17 eight uh Neil this is your first round
0:02:22 of resisting the day am I aware of any
0:02:26 like extinguishers or anything that
0:02:29 could help
0:02:31 fight a fire or do we need to get the
0:02:33 [ __ ] out of here what's the day we can't
0:02:35 go anywhere
0:02:37 basement don't know can I ask you two
0:02:39 questions of the humanity role um we can
0:02:41 spell what power you said yes um one's
0:02:43 detract once we'll subtract from six
0:02:45 tens do not explode correct correct
0:02:49 all right I will spend a willpower I am
0:02:51 also spending on Willpower yeah yeah
0:02:53 agreed
0:02:58 Johnny has four successes win has two
0:03:01 one success killing the willpower
0:03:03 counting the willpower wow says two so
0:03:06 this concludes the first round of day
0:03:10 raid so we're gonna go ahead and start
0:03:12 with the second round you guys are gonna
0:03:14 have a little bit of time to dialogue
0:03:16 but as far as physically acting each of
0:03:20 you can do one thing unless you're
0:03:22 expending blood for Celerity please
0:03:24 remember that all of your dice bowls are
0:03:25 capped by your Humanity score uh so
0:03:28 we're going to cut to RP and then
0:03:31 someone's just going to raise your hand
0:03:32 and I'm going to pause if anyone raises
0:03:34 their hand I'm going to pause RP to
0:03:36 accept their action understood Lex the
0:03:39 question you said the fire seems to be
0:03:41 coming from the front door area like
0:03:42 outside that seems to be where the uh
0:03:46 fire had initially started so the close
0:03:48 charge of the front door the closer you
0:03:50 are to the actual fire itself okay for
0:03:52 the apartment there is a fire escape and
0:03:54 there's a door you guys are up on the
0:03:56 second floor the top of this round this
0:03:58 is when I am going to need a courage
0:04:00 check from everyone the difficulty of a
0:04:03 courage check while trapped inside of a
0:04:05 burning location is nine boy
0:04:08 I will spend a willpower on this too
0:04:11 Neil is not a brave man I'm not
0:04:15 spend there buddy that's how he Frenzy
0:04:22 zero successes two successes three
0:04:25 successes two successes with a willpower
0:04:27 span I have one success unless iron will
0:04:30 give me any bonuses to my difficulty it
0:04:32 does not okay is everyone starts to like
0:04:34 eyes open Johnny is very close to the
0:04:37 fire Johnny is very close to the fire
0:04:40 and at this point his clothes already
0:04:42 starting to smoke and as he wakes up his
0:04:45 fangs are bared and the Beast takes over
0:04:48 attempting to get him out of the area
0:04:50 the group of you immediately recognize
0:04:52 that he has entered the red fear raw
0:04:54 Trek
0:04:57 somebody stopped Johnny from trying to
0:04:59 go outside I'll try and take care of the
0:05:00 fire
0:05:01 um Can someone break a sink open or
0:05:03 break open some pipes or something yes
0:05:05 I'll get Johnny how many floors are in
0:05:07 this place we're on the second how many
0:05:08 total four and the fire seems to be
0:05:11 coming from the hallway but is it below
0:05:14 do we know anything else about it other
0:05:16 than it's from in the hallway so you may
0:05:18 roll investigation for this round if
0:05:20 that's what you want to do okay after
0:05:22 saying Hey [ __ ] up the pipes and stuff
0:05:23 and sort of assuming that we can't go
0:05:26 anywhere Neil
0:05:28 freaks out and you said the fire seemed
0:05:31 to be coming from like the door frame
0:05:33 and maybe towards like the outside and
0:05:35 Neil immediately uh sort of backs away
0:05:39 from the flyer freaked out and then
0:05:40 closes his eyes and I'm going to attempt
0:05:42 to make it rain heavily on the building
0:05:45 I'm trying to make it rain outside yeah
0:05:47 okay try and soak the area Neil why
0:05:49 don't you go ahead and give me a rule
0:05:51 for your weather control spending
0:05:53 another willpower because I need this to
0:05:54 go off now rather than like an hour from
0:05:56 now
0:05:57 six successes for Heavy Rain okay
0:06:01 overhead that is followed by a very
0:06:04 sudden downpour when heads to the
0:06:07 kitchen sink and turns both Taps on in
0:06:11 an effort to get some water going you
0:06:13 the the sink immediately starts to spray
0:06:15 with a pretty steady Uh current water
0:06:17 and then she starts to try and yank the
0:06:20 faucet to get a good gush going mature
0:06:23 strength score four postpones okay with
0:06:26 uh strength four you are sufficiently
0:06:29 strong to tear it open and start kind of
0:06:31 getting water like sprinkling over the
0:06:32 kitchen wind also soaks herself in the
0:06:35 water understood you hear you hear this
0:06:38 this rasping bass howl almost hiss uh a
0:06:44 rise out of Johnny it's a noise unlike
0:06:46 you've ever heard him make before and
0:06:49 you catch a glimpse of him outside in
0:06:52 the main room his muscles and veins are
0:06:57 constricted and pumping Vitae he is
0:07:00 definitely in the midst of a fox frenzy
0:07:02 acting on Instinct hearing the awful
0:07:05 noises that Johnny is making
0:07:07 Brita tries out something that she's not
0:07:10 certain how to use she starts trying to
0:07:12 summon him she calls his name are you
0:07:15 trying to do two things at once summon
0:07:17 them to you and talk him down that is my
0:07:19 ideal to summon him and talk him down
0:07:20 okay should I Gonna Roll three dice to
0:07:22 summon and three dice to talk him down
0:07:25 you're looking at to five
0:07:29 and I have three successes Johnny in the
0:07:33 midst of your monstrous reaction to the
0:07:37 fire the frenzied Johnny is drawn first
0:07:40 to the room he does not open doors he
0:07:43 simply goes right through it so first
0:07:46 the summon happens yeah he goes to you
0:07:48 uh you're gonna make your rule and then
0:07:50 Johnny's gonna take all of his hilarity
0:07:52 actions all right so bretta's voice
0:07:54 calls you back into the room and towards
0:07:57 where she was staying Johnny you put me
0:07:59 out before when we are fighting I know
0:08:01 that you can face fire you're brave
0:08:04 enough for this you can come back now
0:08:06 you make the Charisma leadership role
0:08:11 there are two successes Johnny give me a
0:08:14 self-control rule uh unfortunately you
0:08:16 are a bruja so this is going to be a
0:08:18 difficulty seven
0:08:19 three successes Johnny's eyes which his
0:08:23 pupils seem to be in a kind of a
0:08:24 constant state of vibration when he
0:08:26 first comes into the room suddenly stop
0:08:29 shaking and he focuses very clearly on
0:08:32 you Bretta has her hand on where the
0:08:35 wounds were the ones that have healed so
0:08:37 far as if really trying to show him that
0:08:39 he's the one that saved her he reaches
0:08:41 out a hand and kind of just grips her on
0:08:43 the shoulder really quick and nods she
0:08:45 know it's back Johnny you've got an
0:08:46 action the fire's in the main room right
0:08:49 yes to be clear I only had that one
0:08:51 success on one action for being awake
0:08:54 yeah this is it
0:08:57 power down
0:08:59 Johnny will uh will rush back into the
0:09:04 uh the main area and head to the kitchen
0:09:06 where win is and he's going to use his
0:09:08 Celerity to smash in through the drywall
0:09:10 grab some pipes and rip them out because
0:09:13 my dice pool may be capped to do that
0:09:15 but I can still spend blood for potence
0:09:17 and just get Auto successes correct uh
0:09:20 there's actually no rule of Defeat of
0:09:21 strength so what that means is your
0:09:23 strength was potency is compared to the
0:09:25 chart and if you are strong enough you
0:09:27 simply do it if you are not strong
0:09:30 enough you have to make a willpower roll
0:09:32 at difficulty nine so what is your
0:09:33 strength plus potence being sleepy still
0:09:36 means you can lift a truck uh strength
0:09:38 plus potence is eight okay yeah so uh
0:09:42 I'm sorry Johnny rushes right up to win
0:09:45 right next to her uh seemingly in
0:09:47 control of himself plunges his fist into
0:09:51 the drywall and comes back with a torn
0:09:54 pipe and in water that's sprang all over
0:09:56 the place the two of you have the
0:09:58 kitchen area very quickly getting doused
0:10:01 with a great deal of water gonna show me
0:10:04 that trick at some point Johnny you got
0:10:05 it maybe not tonight though maybe not
0:10:08 I'm going to get up and move towards the
0:10:10 main room to investigate and not
0:10:12 investigate but look at the the fire as
0:10:14 best I can and then I have spent a
0:10:17 Celerity so if I determine that I can do
0:10:19 anything I will if not I'll probably
0:10:21 going to retreat towards the water okay
0:10:23 uh why don't you go ahead and give me a
0:10:25 processional difficulty seven uh it'd be
0:10:27 difficulty eight because I'm probably
0:10:28 not wearing my glasses ah yep
0:10:32 that's a NADA not a botch but uh not a
0:10:35 success all right so the doorway is on
0:10:37 fire it's definitely on fire so with my
0:10:40 Keen investigation abilities I have
0:10:42 determined that the front area is on
0:10:44 fire and I've decided to retreat to the
0:10:46 kitchen where the water is uh when miles
0:10:48 runs in to the room Neil is standing
0:10:51 there like miles if if I can get the
0:10:54 fire away from the door I need you to
0:10:55 close it I need somebody to close it all
0:10:58 right I will stop my Progressive back to
0:11:00 the kitchen and be prepared to close
0:11:01 that door that ends round two any PCs
0:11:06 who only had one success hi will now
0:11:08 fall asleep collapsing right where they
0:11:10 were so once Brita manages to get Johnny
0:11:14 functional once more the overbearing
0:11:17 urge towards sleep catches up with her
0:11:20 and she starts stepping forward to try
0:11:22 to follow him out and finds herself
0:11:26 stepping down onto one knee and then
0:11:28 finding the floor to be a very
0:11:30 comfortable place to be curling up and
0:11:32 falling asleep Johnny for a moment you
0:11:35 hear about it right behind you and then
0:11:36 you don't
0:11:43 begin round three
0:11:47 oh
0:11:48 I don't know I don't think I'm gonna
0:11:50 stick out just a whole lot longer here
0:11:52 but somebody needs to call the fire
0:11:54 department or something and tell them
0:11:55 this is a false alarm don't come
0:11:58 otherwise once we're all unconscious
0:12:00 we're gonna have a bunch of people
0:12:01 trying to very helpfully carry us out of
0:12:03 here I uh
0:12:05 I think I can get rid of the fire I just
0:12:07 you know I can't too much past that um
0:12:11 question this building the the
0:12:14 particular part of it we're in because
0:12:16 it's a it's a it's an apartment building
0:12:17 right yes are there anybody living this
0:12:20 building or is this whole building
0:12:22 property of the domain yeah abandoned
0:12:24 don't know for sure you definitely know
0:12:27 that downstairs there's a restaurant so
0:12:30 it is at least uh the at least the first
0:12:33 floor sees use so Johnny is go now that
0:12:36 he has the pipe trip out of the wall
0:12:37 he's really gonna start trying to angle
0:12:39 them to actually put out some of the
0:12:42 Flames that are crawling up the walls
0:12:43 why don't you give me a strength plus
0:12:48 Athletics rule your difficulty is seven
0:12:50 your dice pool maximum is equal to your
0:12:53 Humanity
0:12:55 foreign
0:13:00 and come up with a chunk of the pipe
0:13:03 that you needed to be able to redirect
0:13:05 Neil
0:13:06 uh standing in the front now that
0:13:09 there's water spraying from busted pipes
0:13:11 and broken faucets and down pouring
0:13:14 outside
0:13:15 um okay is everybody with me here is
0:13:18 uh doing our best man because if this
0:13:20 doesn't work uh somebody just dragged me
0:13:22 back into the bathroom it's the safest
0:13:24 place in a fire
0:13:25 now that Wynn and Johnny have just
0:13:28 flooded the kitchen with their actions
0:13:30 anneal concentrates it's like oh please
0:13:32 please let this work I I haven't well
0:13:34 please let this work and pushes his
0:13:37 hands forward and will spend a blood and
0:13:40 channel his darong key to control the
0:13:44 water and just send like streams of it
0:13:47 from the kitchen floor and all the
0:13:49 flooding to the water that's licking up
0:13:51 the wall or to the fire that's licking
0:13:52 up the walls uh go ahead and give me a
0:13:54 roll for your path remember that your
0:13:56 dice fool again is kept and because we
0:13:59 really need to get this water out I'm
0:14:00 about to go unconscious I will spend a
0:14:02 willpower for this okay
0:14:04 with the willpower that's five successes
0:14:07 with five successes and most of the
0:14:09 Flames are actually put out and uh it
0:14:12 looks like how quickly the fire itself
0:14:15 is going to expand through the apartment
0:14:16 has been greatly reduced to buying the
0:14:19 glory sometime celebrity so I go close
0:14:22 the door and try to come back like if
0:14:24 you're going to the area that's uh that
0:14:26 there are still some Flames I need a
0:14:27 courage check sure uh difficulty seven
0:14:29 to approach let's go with the willpower
0:14:31 on that seems important
0:14:33 hmm nope not happening okay uh miles uh
0:14:39 tries to work on the conviction but it
0:14:41 the the fire goes against every sense of
0:14:44 self-preservation that he has and he
0:14:45 finds himself unable to advance seeing
0:14:48 that miles is stricken and unable to get
0:14:52 the door shut when charges over to try
0:14:55 and finish the job cordial div 7
0:14:57 willpower
0:15:00 two successes okay you find yourself
0:15:02 able to head over and you close the door
0:15:05 and she Retreats uh back into the safety
0:15:08 of the water does anyone still have
0:15:09 Solarity actions remaining Johnny does
0:15:11 there are still some Flames kicking
0:15:13 around yes he will um rip open the
0:15:16 cabinet under the sink and reach to
0:15:19 hopefully find one of either two things
0:15:22 either a bucket or maybe a small little
0:15:24 fire extinguisher there is no fire
0:15:27 extinguisher there is a bucket perfect
0:15:29 so Johnny will grab that bucket and
0:15:32 basically start trying to scoop up some
0:15:34 of the water maybe you know he'll grab
0:15:37 some of the uh of the streams that are
0:15:40 coming out of the uh air that aren't
0:15:43 necessarily going towards the fire but
0:15:45 he'll use the fact that the water has
0:15:48 made itself very easily scooped out of
0:15:51 the air to grab a bucket full of it and
0:15:54 start splashing it towards the the
0:15:56 Flames that are still raging
0:15:58 uncontrolled you're gonna begin an
0:16:00 extended with you absolutely I need a
0:16:01 dexterity plus athletic scroll uh the
0:16:03 difficulty on this rule is six again
0:16:05 your dicable is Catholic Humanity
0:16:09 hey Swift would that count uh towards
0:16:12 getting this done in a timely fashion uh
0:16:15 for dexterity splashing the walls yes
0:16:18 but it will not apply to the actual
0:16:19 filling gotcha all right so the uh so on
0:16:23 this particular roll it's not gonna help
0:16:25 out right okay gotcha so then four
0:16:29 successes okay uh with four successes
0:16:32 you kind of get the pipe been around and
0:16:35 you take a ton of steps uh little quick
0:16:38 motions rather to very quickly start
0:16:41 getting water into the bucket does
0:16:42 anyone have any remaining solar
0:16:44 reactions other than retreating did Neil
0:16:46 make it back to the he made to the
0:16:48 bathroom right at the end of this round
0:16:50 this is round three for Neil because I
0:16:52 got up around before everybody else and
0:16:54 I will be collapsing yeah he does not
0:16:55 make it to the bathroom so miles do you
0:16:58 have anything you wanted to do right I
0:16:59 have my I guess Celerity action because
0:17:01 I failed to make it to the right the
0:17:03 door so I'll come back and I will try to
0:17:05 get myself and Neil into the kitchen of
0:17:08 water and that's gonna be the end of it
0:17:10 for me too because that is my round two
0:17:11 so at the end of around three of The
0:17:15 Haven raid those of you who uh collapse
0:17:19 please describe doing so we'll start
0:17:21 with Neil Neil uh with his arms
0:17:23 outstretched just directing these
0:17:26 thermaturgical streams of water as miles
0:17:29 gets to him just suddenly like his arms
0:17:31 drop by his sides and he just collapses
0:17:34 in a very sleepy pile going as
0:17:37 corpse-like as any vampire when they
0:17:39 sleep and is no longer aware of the
0:17:40 world around him doing a scoop drag as
0:17:43 he comes back towards the kitchen he
0:17:45 kind of drags them both in there and
0:17:47 then kind of just collapses and falls to
0:17:50 his own undeath Slumber probably face
0:17:52 down Glam yep as uh miles and Neil come
0:17:58 back to the kitchen when is still
0:18:00 dragging herself back there and manages
0:18:02 to make it to a puddle before slumping
0:18:05 her feet just gets so heavy and she
0:18:09 can't really lift her legs to step
0:18:11 anymore and she just goes to one knee
0:18:13 then the other then to her side then
0:18:16 flops onto her side unconscious and
0:18:19 unaware oh boy and then there was Johnny
0:18:21 thank God Brita got you back around
0:18:23 there was Johnny
0:18:31 Johnny yeah started round four
0:18:34 your quotery is down there's still some
0:18:38 Flames looking a very slow expanse of
0:18:41 the fire kind of begins to encroach and
0:18:44 seep into uh your
0:18:47 um the little Haven that's been provided
0:18:49 to you here in Boston
0:18:51 and uh it's just you versus the fire
0:18:54 what is your action all right now that I
0:18:57 have a bucket filled with some water I'm
0:18:59 gonna use that to try and put out the
0:19:02 main bits of of Blaze so that this can
0:19:05 finally be put out so we're looking at
0:19:07 dexterity Athletics yes and Swift
0:19:09 supplies here right correct
0:19:12 for successes with four successes you
0:19:16 splash the water up against the wall and
0:19:18 put out the last of it do you have any
0:19:21 celebrity actions I do what do you plan
0:19:23 to do Johnny will use the first Slayer
0:19:25 reaction to go over the door and
0:19:29 basically head out into the hallway
0:19:31 um and kind of just get a quick sense of
0:19:33 what's outside you open the door to the
0:19:37 hallway inside and there you see a trio
0:19:42 of guys who are in trench coats they
0:19:46 have bandanas covering their mouths and
0:19:49 they are armed with knives and uh
0:19:54 relatively minor uh weapons but it's
0:19:57 definitely three guys and they look very
0:19:59 surprised to see you Johnny has a second
0:20:01 Celerity action he will obliterate the
0:20:04 first one with a big meaty punch to the
0:20:08 face give me a roll
0:20:11 two successes all right uh two one die
0:20:15 carries over and uh go ahead and give me
0:20:16 damage is this limited by my Humanity no
0:20:19 pretty sure he could still spend
0:20:20 opponents for auto damage oh I can't
0:20:24 just wanted to remind you because I know
0:20:25 uh leaving things up to the dice isn't
0:20:27 always the best for you
0:20:30 do my powerful arms assist me in in
0:20:32 doing uh damage so we're looking at four
0:20:34 on the dice plus four from the potents
0:20:37 that is eight levels of damage
0:20:38 [Laughter]
0:20:42 punch this man's head clean off well
0:20:45 that's only bashing right still that's
0:20:48 that's one of the one things I like yeah
0:20:49 these are I'm gonna get I'm gonna get
0:20:51 everybody breakfast uh okay uh he will
0:20:54 take eight levels of Bastion damage one
0:20:56 level will roll around into lethal
0:20:58 damage as you smash his drawing the
0:21:01 person ragdolls and after being sent a
0:21:05 few feet away just hits the ground
0:21:07 twitching and uh seemingly in the midst
0:21:10 of a seizure do you have any other
0:21:12 Solarity actions not the last thing you
0:21:16 see is the two remaining men looking
0:21:19 between each other unsure of what to do
0:21:21 oh no I still have another round I had
0:21:24 four successes to stay away never mind
0:21:26 yeah I already had four successes and
0:21:28 was a round after I got up the last
0:21:30 thing he sees before he goes right right
0:21:32 the last thing Johnny sees before he
0:21:34 sees another man's head explode yeah
0:21:37 listen I think oh I had to get back in
0:21:39 this fight I mean yes okay uh this means
0:21:42 that we will uh begin what is going to
0:21:44 be the final round of this Haven raid
0:21:46 but I actually need you to roll
0:21:48 initiative on this one sure and uh
0:21:51 They're Gonna Roll an initiative as well
0:21:54 uh Johnny what is your initiative 10. so
0:21:57 initiative is going to go uh assailant a
0:21:59 Johnny assailant B uh assailant a is
0:22:02 going to uh in a bit of a panic attempt
0:22:05 to stab Johnny
0:22:07 uh he has two successes to hit oh okay
0:22:10 uh he is dealing four levels of lethal
0:22:12 damage
0:22:13 so Johnny skin tightens like Wynn has
0:22:16 been teaching him and uh I imagine he
0:22:19 still has his oh no he took his leather
0:22:21 jacket off that's right to uses a pillow
0:22:23 so
0:22:25 zero successes okay uh Johnny will take
0:22:28 four levels of lethal damage I need you
0:22:31 to roll a self-control check at
0:22:32 difficulty eight
0:22:34 self-control
0:22:36 yes
0:22:37 one success
0:22:44 I'm so scary yep
0:22:46 I mean for Johnny these two guys would
0:22:48 be dead yeah
0:22:50 like we'll be fine I just don't know
0:22:52 what's gonna happen to Johnny afterwards
0:22:53 uh with my first action I will split to
0:22:57 grab the guy that that stabbed me and
0:22:59 bite him
0:23:01 roll it uh I'm gonna spend a willpower
0:23:04 to grab him yep
0:23:06 so four successes to grab him yeah he is
0:23:08 grabbed and his feet dangle off dangle
0:23:11 above the floor bite attacks right
0:23:13 difficulty five
0:23:14 fantastic
0:23:16 and they deal strength plus one egg uh
0:23:18 I'll spend another uh another willpower
0:23:20 to make sure this happens
0:23:23 three successes two dice carry over your
0:23:26 rolling strength plus three dice of
0:23:27 aggravated damage can I gain fight day
0:23:29 from this uh you may choose to feed
0:23:31 instead which means you may take up to
0:23:33 three blood and he will take three
0:23:35 levels of damage I will do that because
0:23:37 I need the blood understood he will
0:23:39 submit to the kiss that's how bruja feed
0:23:41 can I then spend the blood to heal a
0:23:43 point of damage it takes an action to do
0:23:46 so uh so you can use one of your
0:23:47 Solarity actions to pause and fair
0:23:49 enough heal uh the other guy is going to
0:23:52 attempt to uh stab you sure he has three
0:23:56 successes in the attack rule actually
0:23:58 Four successes on the attack roll three
0:23:59 carryover strength
0:24:04 he is three levels of lethal damage
0:24:06 coming at you
0:24:07 all right I will
0:24:10 try to soak
0:24:11 I soak two of those I will take a single
0:24:13 point of damage okay I use stabs
0:24:16 furiously at your back in hopes of
0:24:17 accomplishing something but it does not
0:24:20 seem to Slayer reactions from here on
0:24:22 out it's all you my first Celerity
0:24:24 action I will continue to drink uh three
0:24:27 more levels of damage to him okay his
0:24:29 eyes flutter do I taste anything
0:24:31 interesting about this Blood no right
0:24:33 now he tastes like a guy who's gonna
0:24:35 [ __ ] die in the next couple seconds
0:24:38 um there doesn't seem to be anything
0:24:40 unusual going on it's certainly not like
0:24:42 the Lupine all right so that's that's
0:24:43 action one action two is going to be to
0:24:48 grab his friend so I drop him and then
0:24:50 grab his buddy okay
0:24:53 well two successes three of Swift counts
0:24:56 Swift counts so three successes
0:24:59 um and then my final celebrity action
0:25:00 will be will be to uh to bite and tear
0:25:03 his throat out okay give me a uh Dexter
0:25:06 sprawl difficulty five
0:25:10 four successes three will roll over into
0:25:13 damage you are rolling strength plus
0:25:15 four dice of aggravated damage
0:25:18 potent's to just Auto go through
0:25:21 so not okay well my powerful arms
0:25:23 doesn't count for those tens
0:25:25 unfortunately no that's 10 aggravated
0:25:28 damage
0:25:29 I believe you Kool-Aid Man him you
0:25:32 bite at his throat with a full trunk of
0:25:35 his flesh in your mouth you the last
0:25:38 thing you see for real this time
0:25:41 um is his head kind of dangling only
0:25:45 attached by skin to the rest of his body
0:25:48 as he slumps completely dead blood is
0:25:52 all over the walls and you drop to your
0:25:55 knees satiated from the violence that
0:25:58 you just uh Unleashed on your enemies
0:26:00 well the good news is that we're safe
0:26:03 now the bad news is that if somebody
0:26:08 happens to be walking down this hallway
0:26:11 they'll find a bloodbath
0:26:13 but positive side of that is all the
0:26:15 people in the hallway are dead so maybe
0:26:17 they'll just take me to the morgue
0:26:20 I mean you might still have and it's
0:26:22 like you do have lots of my phones I
0:26:24 wasn't sure if you had any movement left
0:26:25 over because you might be able to just
0:26:26 like get stuck back inside unfortunately
0:26:28 celebrity actions you only can take one
0:26:30 you can't really split them right so I
0:26:32 don't think I can actually make it back
0:26:34 inside uh you can hit people and move
0:26:36 yes yeah oh so you could probably kill
0:26:39 the last guy inside the apartment I was
0:26:41 gonna say in in that case if I could
0:26:43 while I'm I'm making these moves if I
0:26:47 could toss people towards or through the
0:26:49 door and bring this violence inside and
0:26:52 try and slump against the door uh with
0:26:54 my last final breath that would be ideal
0:26:57 okay yeah I'm good with that I do need a
0:26:59 Humanity check
0:27:01 that's fair oh boy the conscience role
0:27:05 at difficulty eight
0:27:06 zero successes to Humanities for now
0:27:08 five all right that's my first point of
0:27:10 humanity lost throughout this campaign
0:27:13 same here yes me too for the first time
0:27:15 in your own life you actually feel like
0:27:16 these [ __ ] had it coming when
0:27:18 everybody finally does manage to wait oh
0:27:21 actually these guys one of them is just
0:27:23 knocked unconscious I mean he's gonna
0:27:25 take a while to heal all of that bashing
0:27:27 he's probably not gonna be getting out
0:27:28 of here very easily yeah because I I
0:27:30 punched him so hard I did lethal the
0:27:32 other guy is is drained almost
0:27:35 completely of blood so he's not going
0:27:37 guy who got knocked out is going to take
0:27:38 a few weeks to wake up yeah
0:27:41 and he's in the best shape yeah the
0:27:44 blood guy he's done like that but guys
0:27:46 done headless guy also kind of [ __ ]
0:27:51 foreign
0:27:55 beyond the bloody Inferno of a Haven
0:27:59 raid the cordery rests peacefully but uh
0:28:03 you are among the first to awaken and
0:28:06 immediately uh thoughts of uh your last
0:28:11 moments with Johnny come to your mind at
0:28:13 least so far it seems that you've
0:28:15 survived the night but you're alone in
0:28:18 the room
0:28:19 Brita gets up from the floor looking
0:28:22 around trying to see if there's any hint
0:28:24 of damage but the room looks pretty
0:28:27 normal so she bursts out into the main
0:28:29 room what you find in the main area is
0:28:31 anything but normal around the doorway
0:28:34 that leads out of the apartment there
0:28:37 are Scorch marks everywhere but though
0:28:39 the fire seems to have been contained
0:28:41 what you don't expect or didn't expect
0:28:43 was the blood and gore that fills that
0:28:49 little pathway leading to the door out
0:28:51 of the apartment
0:28:52 and slumped with his back to the door
0:28:56 head against the the heavy like metal
0:29:00 front door is a Johnny
0:29:04 that is caked and dried blood his shirt
0:29:10 is completely drenched and red and it's
0:29:14 not just blood but pieces of people
0:29:18 clinging to him and beside him is a trio
0:29:23 of people you've never seen before all
0:29:25 of them in varying degrees of bad
0:29:28 condition
0:29:28 ranging from a smashed jaw to and just
0:29:34 about completely decapitated and resting
0:29:38 against the what was once a white wall
0:29:41 uh Johnny seems to rest peacefully
0:29:44 unmoving eyes closed as if he was a
0:29:48 corpse among them can I tell that he's
0:29:50 not in torpor or does the blood coding
0:29:53 him make it difficult to see he is
0:29:55 clearly not in torper okay bretta's eyes
0:29:58 will fall onto all of that Gore and
0:30:01 there's a moment where she instinctually
0:30:03 steps back
0:30:05 but she collects herself and forces
0:30:10 herself to walk forwards
0:30:12 and she approaches kneels down very
0:30:15 carefully by Johnny
0:30:18 trying to see what's the damage to him
0:30:20 if he's all right she can tell that he's
0:30:22 not in torpar that was her first thought
0:30:24 but as she's looking to these bodies
0:30:27 beside him she can't help but feel
0:30:30 there's that very human instinct to
0:30:32 check whether or not all of the blood
0:30:34 covering him is his or not
0:30:37 there's that sickening realization that
0:30:39 they've passed that point of humanity
0:30:42 and that that even if he were very hurt
0:30:45 that's not how vampire blood works
0:30:48 and so she sees these stab wounds in him
0:30:52 I think Johnny actually still might even
0:30:54 have the knives sticking in him
0:30:58 are they at least one her hand sort of
0:31:01 ghosts right by the knife handle there's
0:31:05 that instinctive should it be left in or
0:31:07 should it be taken out
0:31:09 but she pulls her hand back and sits
0:31:13 back a little bit to give him some room
0:31:15 looking away and kind of just waiting
0:31:18 for him to get up in the just completely
0:31:22 flooded kitchen Neil sort of stirs
0:31:26 sloshing the water around himself gets
0:31:29 up slowly and looks around a little
0:31:33 surprised that he's still alive looks
0:31:36 down at wind
0:31:38 and Miles nearby to him both of whom are
0:31:42 are asleep although miles is starting to
0:31:46 stir too I think it's that point you
0:31:48 realize that the water you've sloshed
0:31:50 awaken is actually actually has the
0:31:53 taste of blood in it there was enough
0:31:55 blood seeping out that it's probably
0:31:58 mixed together the guy that lost his
0:32:01 head has probably leaked
0:32:03 you know kind of looks confused and and
0:32:06 stumbles out into the main room
0:32:08 taking in all the details and just
0:32:10 looking at Brita by Johnny
0:32:13 oh my God what happened it looks like
0:32:19 and she Trails off her eyes go back to
0:32:21 Johnny and she tries to think of a way
0:32:23 to vocalize it but all that really comes
0:32:25 out is
0:32:26 it looks like these were the guys that
0:32:28 started it
0:32:30 oh my God I hope so he says looking at
0:32:34 the like decapitated corpse miles
0:32:36 finally starts getting up off the ground
0:32:39 and sighs loudly to find himself in a
0:32:42 puddle of water
0:32:43 gets up goes back to his room grabs his
0:32:46 glasses so he can actually see with some
0:32:48 sort of clarity and then comes back into
0:32:51 the main room whereas it counts for
0:32:53 everybody and it's like
0:32:54 oh that looks like it was unsuccessful
0:32:58 the decapitated person and does not look
0:33:01 like it was like a knife or a sword it
0:33:04 looks like his head was chewed off did
0:33:09 you check them for idea or anything like
0:33:10 that yet and are they any of them still
0:33:12 alive I I just got up I I don't know
0:33:15 like I can do it and breaded her hands
0:33:20 are probably shaking a little bit as she
0:33:22 starts unfortunately with the headless
0:33:25 man
0:33:25 because that's where her eyes fell when
0:33:28 miles started talking about the
0:33:30 unconscious people so Johnny's got a
0:33:32 bunch of blooded blood covering his face
0:33:34 and all down like the front of him and
0:33:35 everything like that
0:33:36 he'll probably be fine and I will check
0:33:39 over for ID uh they do not seem to have
0:33:42 carried any personal identification or
0:33:44 anything of the sort brother checks
0:33:46 thoroughly but she has no success and as
0:33:48 she pulls her hands away
0:33:50 she does that useless motion of trying
0:33:54 to wipe them against each other and just
0:33:57 finds that they're becoming more and
0:33:59 more red so she stands and she tries to
0:34:01 there's plenty of water in the kitchen
0:34:04 at this point
0:34:05 let's check on win but I think we all
0:34:08 came out of this okay
0:34:09 what's the
0:34:11 or should we call the scourge or
0:34:12 something what's the protocol here I
0:34:14 don't I don't really know yeah we
0:34:15 probably should this is compromised and
0:34:17 he brought us here I mean
0:34:19 that's a little suspicious of itself but
0:34:21 well I mean it's not hard to find people
0:34:23 if nothing else we need to let them know
0:34:25 that we're need to go somewhere else or
0:34:27 if we can secure our own place because I
0:34:29 will I will let you guys deal with that
0:34:31 I'm not well we also need to check and
0:34:34 make sure that the flooding hasn't
0:34:37 alerted the people below us or what the
0:34:39 deal is with that
0:34:41 I don't suppose anybody managed to look
0:34:43 at a watch or something when we woke up
0:34:45 I mean I don't think I have no idea how
0:34:47 long it's been I mean I can check my
0:34:49 watch no I mean like from when we woke
0:34:51 up to now miles successfully determines
0:34:54 what time it is yes
0:34:55 I meant like to do okay never mind I
0:34:59 don't particularly care about the people
0:35:00 downstairs at this point we're not
0:35:02 staying and I don't know if there's
0:35:03 anybody comes to ask me questions we can
0:35:05 get out of here pretty easily I guess I
0:35:08 just don't wanna you don't want to make
0:35:09 a mess in somebody else's City bread and
0:35:11 nons she's trying to wash her hands off
0:35:13 in one of the bloody puddles that's not
0:35:15 working particularly well but she can
0:35:17 get eventually skirt The Scourge can
0:35:19 either take care of it or leave it
0:35:20 either way at this point all right it's
0:35:23 fine
0:35:24 do we know who did we don't know who
0:35:26 sent these people it looks like
0:35:29 one of them
0:35:31 actually they both might be a wife
0:35:34 huh
0:35:35 yeah we definitely need to call the city
0:35:37 then right
0:35:39 let's get our stuff together because
0:35:41 well we gotta wait for Johnny and Wynn
0:35:43 to get up anyways
0:35:47 when kind of stirs finding herself in
0:35:50 a puddle and it's not it's not the worst
0:35:52 way she's ever woken up you know sticky
0:35:55 and damp and reeking slightly of blood
0:35:59 um but this this is not the best she
0:36:02 finds that because she fell asleep in a
0:36:05 giant puddle that has become diluted
0:36:08 with blood there's a pink tinge to her
0:36:10 hair and the side of her face that was
0:36:13 in the puddle and she kind of pushes
0:36:15 herself upright and looks around
0:36:18 what the [ __ ] did I miss we're um trying
0:36:22 to piece that together oh Jesus Christ
0:36:26 what oh my God is there water still
0:36:29 spraying or did somebody call and get
0:36:32 that shut off
0:36:33 there is no water spraying at this point
0:36:36 okay the apartment does not have water
0:36:39 um
0:36:40 I I don't know you okay is everybody
0:36:42 okay by the way does anybody hurt
0:36:46 I mean I'm still in Boston so Johnny's
0:36:48 clearly got some damage on him
0:36:51 as you look back towards Johnny you
0:36:52 notice his eyes are now open and he's
0:36:54 kind of staring at you brother looks
0:36:56 back
0:36:57 the bags under his eyes are a little bit
0:37:01 more sunken
0:37:03 or something just a little bit more
0:37:04 feral about him than you remember last
0:37:07 from last night and it's not just the
0:37:09 fact that he's covered in blood his
0:37:11 features have definitely taken on just a
0:37:13 darker aspect
0:37:15 hey are you
0:37:18 thanks for keeping me in the fight kid
0:37:19 you're welcome I've got a Grunts and
0:37:22 pain as he pulls the knife out and drops
0:37:24 it on the ground it looks like it got to
0:37:27 you too the fight
0:37:28 I just finished it everyone okay are you
0:37:32 okay ah I've had worse nights man with
0:37:36 your track record that means [ __ ]
0:37:39 are you okay I fed off these goons a bit
0:37:43 I didn't get a chance to ask them who
0:37:45 they were and what they wanted I'm not
0:37:47 sure they would have been terribly
0:37:48 forthcoming if you had Johnny's gonna
0:37:50 reach down and continue to feed off uh
0:37:55 the bodies of the three preferably he'll
0:37:58 drink the blood from those who are dead
0:38:00 I don't know how many of them are dead
0:38:02 at this point two of them are dead one
0:38:04 of them is just not conscious the two
0:38:08 dead ones don't have much blood left no
0:38:10 how much can he get from those two one
0:38:13 of them only had one point uh of Vitae
0:38:16 left available from your feeding the
0:38:19 other one has uh two so three in all
0:38:22 Johnny will take that Bretta seeing this
0:38:25 start to happen would I would like to
0:38:27 roll medicine to see if any of these
0:38:30 guys obviously one is not a life but
0:38:33 there's a question mark above two of
0:38:36 them I think uh I mean as you see Johnny
0:38:38 feed there's no reaction yeah the two
0:38:41 that he's exactly the two that he's been
0:38:44 from
0:38:45 they're already gone but I'd still like
0:38:47 to check that last one yeah yeah yeah
0:38:48 that's medicine plus intelligence can
0:38:52 you see if you can wake him yeah I'll
0:38:54 see what I can do
0:38:58 one success well the one success you can
0:39:00 determine that this person is still
0:39:03 alive uh but has been beaten so badly
0:39:06 that it might be a long time before they
0:39:08 wake up
0:39:09 there are some
0:39:11 I don't think there's any way that we
0:39:13 can really get him to wake up much
0:39:15 faster unless I guess Supernatural
0:39:17 healing I see so Johnny punched him into
0:39:20 the Millennium yeah he um and Bretta
0:39:24 just kind of trails off
0:39:25 Lex uh wind kind of when she sees Johnny
0:39:29 feeding on these two dead men she
0:39:31 instinctively looks around to see if any
0:39:33 wreaths have formed no it's a formed you
0:39:36 actually are aware that sometimes uh
0:39:38 even oftentimes there is no wraith yeah
0:39:40 and sometimes even if there is a wraith
0:39:43 that can take a very long time before
0:39:44 they can reach the point where they're
0:39:46 able to manifest in the shadowlands
0:39:48 we're um
0:39:50 we're gonna have to clean up before we
0:39:52 can move I'll call the scourge I think
0:39:55 that's probably our best course of
0:39:57 action yeah he's the one who burned us
0:40:00 now we have to inform him either way
0:40:03 as everyone's talking Neil is kind of
0:40:06 looking around at the bodies and the
0:40:11 blood spray and the the spread of the
0:40:14 fire and The Scorch marks and I'm gonna
0:40:16 try and just get a general idea of Maybe
0:40:19 Who
0:40:21 orchestrated this design with Isaac
0:40:24 chaos
0:40:27 you examine it and you become very
0:40:29 certain that this was uh personal this
0:40:33 is not like uh just an event that's part
0:40:36 of some ongoing conflict that the group
0:40:38 of you aren't connected to you were
0:40:40 specifically targeted Neil with his eyes
0:40:43 wide is just walking around looking
0:40:45 again like just the patterns of the
0:40:48 blood spray and The Scorch marks and the
0:40:51 Damage Done too and by these individuals
0:40:53 and then stops and looks at the rest of
0:40:55 the color and it's like this is um
0:40:58 I'm uh yeah this was targeted at us this
0:41:02 is no we're not like
0:41:03 getting caught up this is a personal
0:41:05 attack on on us as as people
0:41:09 Arabella maybe that was my thought
0:41:11 that's the guess but let's go with the
0:41:13 whole burning people alive thing kind of
0:41:15 does
0:41:16 not sure
0:41:18 if we tell the scourge that he might
0:41:20 think that we're bringing trouble to his
0:41:21 City
0:41:22 oh you know his troubles here I say we
0:41:25 uh play hardball with the Scourge the
0:41:28 fact that he put us up and then we were
0:41:29 attacked doesn't look good on the domain
0:41:31 but
0:41:33 he is Jane's friend so let's give them
0:41:36 the benefit of the doubt I guess we also
0:41:38 don't have acceptance here one way or
0:41:40 another so we don't really have any
0:41:41 protection oh to us do you guys notice
0:41:44 the water's been shut off and this place
0:41:46 had water to start with well it makes
0:41:48 sense they probably just pulled the pipe
0:41:50 I mean we we kind of [ __ ] up the pipes
0:41:52 up here and and
0:41:54 if it's leaking down in the lower why
0:41:56 would they have water here to start with
0:41:59 does a restaurant operational still
0:42:01 downstairs yeah but there's no reason to
0:42:02 pay for that in the apartment upstairs
0:42:04 well they're so functional without
0:42:06 paying for it
0:42:07 um
0:42:08 sometimes you want to wash your hands or
0:42:10 let your guests take a shower before
0:42:13 I suppose that's fair
0:42:15 when while miles calls The Scourge
0:42:18 um Brita kind of saris at the pink tinge
0:42:22 how about I help you clean that up
0:42:25 yeah that's probably a smart move
0:42:28 Brita has makeup wipes as she brought a
0:42:31 makeup kit
0:42:32 Johnny kind of nods over at the uh the
0:42:36 guy that you were looking at so he's
0:42:37 still sucking air yeah he's um he's
0:42:40 alive
0:42:41 and are you hungry
0:42:43 not that hungry
0:42:45 um think that might be too much damage
0:42:47 to him I mean I I don't care
0:42:50 why not
0:42:52 this guy and his friends came here to
0:42:55 kill us in our sleep poked me full of
0:42:58 holes and we're gonna burn a lot of you
0:43:00 well they did that yeah but I mean if
0:43:04 what Neil said was true and this was
0:43:05 personal we don't know these guys they
0:43:07 did this for someone else if I hit him
0:43:09 half as hard as I think I did he's not
0:43:11 going to be in any condition of any kind
0:43:14 of reasonable life when he does wake up
0:43:16 his brain is probably mush
0:43:19 yeah but I don't know if that means it's
0:43:21 my right to take that from him it's not
0:43:26 a fair fight to take it from him now
0:43:29 um speaking of brain mush
0:43:32 Lex here's a question because I just
0:43:34 looked and it's unspecified the targets
0:43:37 need to be conscious to use telepathy
0:43:39 and pull thoughts out of their minds
0:43:40 they can be asleep but not catatonic
0:43:43 right the catatonic and torpor that his
0:43:47 mind right now is just this like
0:43:49 fluttering wavelength so yeah just
0:43:52 incoherentness
0:43:54 so Neil looks at him well
0:43:56 speaking of brain mush
0:43:59 actually no never mind
0:44:01 um
0:44:02 never mind I thought but he doesn't have
0:44:04 any thoughts so I mean if we can get him
0:44:07 awake we can get him to talk what you
0:44:09 can feed him you can feed him a bit of
0:44:10 blood and maybe he can heal himself a
0:44:13 little bit otherwise I say we just drain
0:44:15 the what's left in them how about we
0:44:17 just I mean we could just leave him I'm
0:44:20 not really look a little hungry but I'm
0:44:22 not
0:44:23 I'm not like kill a guy hungry
0:44:25 agreed
0:44:27 well what about the Masquerade with him
0:44:31 will he remember this or I mean the way
0:44:34 Johnny punched his temple in I you know
0:44:36 I don't know if he's gonna remember
0:44:38 anything for a little while but I mean
0:44:40 that's sort of the
0:44:41 that's sort of the local I mean that's
0:44:42 why we need to call the scourge that's
0:44:44 this this is sort of a local all right
0:44:45 I'm on it so I go change into my casual
0:44:47 clothes so that I can talk on the phone
0:44:51 Miles when he's finished uh swapping to
0:44:54 his uh more casual clothing uh he
0:44:56 returns for a phone call
0:44:59 yeah
0:45:00 um we seem to have an issue at the place
0:45:02 that you have left us
0:45:04 uh somebody came and tried to expandable
0:45:06 on that yeah somebody tried to uh light
0:45:08 us on fire and kill us in our sleep have
0:45:10 you got raided unsuccessfully
0:45:13 so you don't like [ __ ] still have a
0:45:15 problem no no no wait at this point it's
0:45:17 been taken care of but I figured you
0:45:19 should be informed
0:45:21 miles there are bodies here all right
0:45:23 who did it we're not sure
0:45:26 right
0:45:28 we have one that's not conscious but
0:45:31 won't wake up for a while it seems like
0:45:34 all right I'm gonna get a couple guys
0:45:36 head out there clean it up
0:45:38 um I assume all of you are all right
0:45:41 so far so good
0:45:43 I knew it hurt a little bit
0:45:45 hi
0:45:47 I don't know why we'll be out there all
0:45:49 right
0:45:50 the dress cleaned up
0:45:51 uh I should probably take you to see the
0:45:53 prince I don't know what's going on
0:45:55 all right is he gonna be able to see us
0:45:57 or yeah his meeting's done that was last
0:45:59 night oh it seemed like it could last
0:46:01 for a while
0:46:03 a great uh so yeah we'll be there okay
0:46:06 all right we'll be here all right sit
0:46:08 tight and try not to start more [ __ ]
0:46:12 miles was it about a meeting
0:46:16 yes I guess we get to go meet the prince
0:46:19 Neil like looks down at his soaked
0:46:21 shitty clothes and everyone else is
0:46:23 soaked bloody clothes
0:46:25 and then me and my fresh clothes and
0:46:27 miles in his slacks and Blazer
0:46:32 that's all um yeah change and just
0:46:35 they might want the guy Bretta says
0:46:39 looking at Johnny kind of trying to get
0:46:41 a read on his attitude towards not
0:46:45 killing this guy
0:46:46 he seems a little bit short in terms of
0:46:49 patience
0:46:51 it's not like he's ready to just jump at
0:46:53 the guy's throat it's just a little bit
0:46:55 disconcerting she lets her eyes kind of
0:46:57 linger for a second from Johnny then on
0:47:00 to the guy who it would be nice to feed
0:47:02 right now but no she she goes to change
0:47:05 yeah gather all your gear looks like we
0:47:07 won't be staying here as we suspected
0:47:09 so get ready to move out Johnny will go
0:47:12 through some of the cabinets and some of
0:47:13 the the closets are there are there any
0:47:15 like towels or any any kind of like old
0:47:18 Linens in anywhere aside from like the
0:47:21 curtains and uh blankets and sheets on
0:47:24 the the bed into two bedrooms uh that's
0:47:27 about it yeah so he'll just kind of dry
0:47:29 off with one of the blankets then at
0:47:31 least try and get like some of the wet
0:47:33 out of his jeans and some of the blood
0:47:35 off his jeans he'll uh ditch his the
0:47:37 bloody shirt that he was wearing try to
0:47:39 wipe down his his skin as much as he can
0:47:41 and put on one of the fresh new white
0:47:42 shirts and put on his mercifully clean
0:47:45 jacket once he uh once he's cleaned up
0:47:48 Pops another morally into his mouth
0:47:51 lights up wind goes into the bedroom to
0:47:54 change
0:47:55 um she doesn't have extra shoes so
0:47:56 unfortunately her boots are making that
0:47:58 squelching noise again
0:48:00 though it's for Less gross reasons this
0:48:02 time she puts on a new flannel and takes
0:48:06 a pillowcase from the bed and uses it to
0:48:08 dry her hair hopefully get some of the
0:48:10 blood out of it but uh it's probably a
0:48:13 little disconcerting as she
0:48:15 the first couple things are all right
0:48:17 where she takes the makeup wipes makes
0:48:19 sure to get the remainder of the blood
0:48:22 out of wins very noticeably bright hair
0:48:26 but afterwards when Bretta is fixing her
0:48:29 makeup there's something
0:48:30 just not right about watching someone
0:48:32 put lipstick on in this circumstance
0:48:35 Neil uh takes his soaked sweater off
0:48:39 Keeps The Damp uh like tie-dye T-shirt
0:48:43 that he was wearing underneath it on and
0:48:46 then puts a new sweater on top did not
0:48:49 bring a change of pants or shoes
0:48:51 and so just leaves his like black slacks
0:48:55 on
0:48:55 within a few moments the dampness from
0:48:59 the T-shirt leaks through the sweater
0:49:00 but it's better than nothing you may
0:49:03 have taken the T-shirt off no I want to
0:49:05 leave it on it makes me feel more
0:49:06 comfortable
0:49:08 all right then all right
0:49:13 um miles well we're talking about this
0:49:16 we have a couple of minutes do you know
0:49:18 when Arabella was embraced
0:49:20 like you guys were
0:49:22 like do you know the date officially no
0:49:24 but I might be able to reach out okay if
0:49:26 you could find that out like ASAP that
0:49:28 would be super helpful can I like
0:49:31 text Venture Central because you we've
0:49:34 talked about that the Venture have a
0:49:36 record of all these Embraces they
0:49:37 celebrate uh their death days right uh
0:49:40 like a birthday so yes because I knew
0:49:42 that the other Venture in the area knew
0:49:44 who was I was braced by and when so
0:49:46 I was wondering if I could get that same
0:49:48 kind of information so maybe just text I
0:49:51 don't know ventru administrative it's
0:49:52 not a thing you can text come on this is
0:49:55 something you're going to write a letter
0:49:56 you're going to Penny write a letter God
0:49:58 get with the times Venture are you
0:50:00 serious I mean you might be able to call
0:50:03 and talk to Prince Rollins yeah no I'm
0:50:07 not I mean yes I can but sooner rather
0:50:10 than later why why do you need this
0:50:13 because I could find out maybe what
0:50:15 Arabelle is up to I just need to know
0:50:17 when she died so I can look at my star
0:50:19 chart book he needs her horoscope yeah
0:50:22 by the way are we healing this goon or
0:50:24 not I'll leave him for the Scourge in my
0:50:26 opinion I think we I think I'd rather
0:50:28 have our code Arena the information he
0:50:31 has rather than the domain I mean I was
0:50:32 giving him blood really going to get him
0:50:34 back up yes
0:50:35 are you sure on that yes right yeah I
0:50:40 didn't think it automatically worked
0:50:41 does anyone have the blood to spare I do
0:50:44 I'm a little I'm a little tapped
0:50:48 um but here's the question we already
0:50:50 told the scourge about this and told the
0:50:52 scourge that there was one guy who was
0:50:53 not dead
0:50:55 are we gonna get in trouble for just
0:50:57 Googling some Rando in a domain we do
0:51:00 not have we're not welcoming yet
0:51:02 I'm willing to take that chance
0:51:05 um I know you're willing to take that
0:51:07 chance that did not answer my question I
0:51:09 don't know what's the protocol here can
0:51:11 I roll etiquette politics I got that
0:51:15 holy crap I have a DOT of that
0:51:26 what is it politics intelligence yes all
0:51:29 right not my strongest suit
0:51:32 um okay being domain defeat oh because
0:51:34 it's not nonsensical
0:51:36 I mean yeah something something nice
0:51:41 nah watch
0:51:44 you are pretty sure that you are able to
0:51:49 uh go somewhere just fine you just have
0:51:52 to keep the gold and you need to notify
0:51:55 the domain of the action just in case
0:51:57 you engage in poaching I mean my
0:52:00 general knowledge of normal domain says
0:52:03 that yeah we should be would be able to
0:52:05 if we you know registered with with the
0:52:09 print slash domain afterwards okay so
0:52:12 he's not I mean either way he's gonna go
0:52:15 to The Domain right so can we just do it
0:52:17 afterwards after we talk to the prince
0:52:18 because if we I feel like
0:52:21 asking the prince
0:52:23 right so we're just notifying the prince
0:52:25 so I feel like that I'm not going to get
0:52:27 myself involved with it since the prince
0:52:29 already hates me I'll just buy the okay
0:52:31 that's for my birth that's fair Johnny
0:52:33 uh stamps the cigarette out and goes I'm
0:52:36 making an executive Brew audition pulls
0:52:38 out his boot knife uh stabs his hand and
0:52:41 feeds the guy a point find a point of
0:52:43 blood Johnny what the [ __ ] are you doing
0:52:45 I'm waking him up so we can ask him who
0:52:47 the [ __ ] he is and who sent us here I
0:52:48 mean Miles said it was okay and when I'm
0:52:50 done I'm gonna reclaim my blood and this
0:52:52 guy died and before the before the
0:52:54 scourge got here well Johnny you're not
0:52:57 acting right I'm not okay with this
0:52:59 slurps on murder my God some of his uh
0:53:03 head wounds starting to heal his jaw is
0:53:05 shattered and it mends just enough for
0:53:09 him to to drink Johnny pulls his hand
0:53:13 back the second he's the he knows the
0:53:15 guy's moving around okay uh the guys
0:53:18 eyes open slowly Johnny puts the knife
0:53:22 inside his mouth and kind of hooks up
0:53:24 his lip a little bit Johnny you're gonna
0:53:26 answer some questions for my friends
0:53:27 just ruined chin kind of tilts up just
0:53:30 enough that acknowledgment of the weapon
0:53:31 and his eyes like kind of quickly scan
0:53:34 around the room uh with a look of abject
0:53:37 Terror in his in his expression if you
0:53:39 give them answers quickly and honestly
0:53:42 things are gonna go well for you all
0:53:44 right if not
0:53:46 he kind of just tilts his head a little
0:53:48 bit pulls the knife out of his mouth and
0:53:49 kind of backs away yeah I'm just gonna
0:53:52 I'm I'm just gonna look into his eyes
0:53:54 and start doing mesmerized like you will
0:53:56 answer all of our questions as soon as
0:53:58 miles approaches he closes us yeah wake
0:54:00 up uh what's your manipulation plus
0:54:02 intimidation eight okay
0:54:05 so he's active seven
0:54:07 you do not dominate him but what do you
0:54:09 say I start doing the whole measurement
0:54:11 and you will listen to the sound of my
0:54:12 voice it will answer the questions that
0:54:14 we posed to you with the most truthful
0:54:16 answer as fast as possible this tongue
0:54:19 doesn't quite work right
0:54:20 and it's just
0:54:23 in current like slight shaking of his
0:54:26 head with the eyes closed resisting uh
0:54:28 the the call of your discipline miles
0:54:30 it's okay just you can just ask the
0:54:32 question just ask your questions who
0:54:34 sent you
0:54:35 as miles is asking us questions Neil is
0:54:38 just going to kind of stare at the guy
0:54:39 and try and get into his head roll it
0:54:42 F5
0:54:44 uh three so I will basically get like
0:54:48 three decent thoughts pulled out of his
0:54:50 head
0:54:51 who sent you it's basically the way that
0:54:53 like thematically I'm looking at this is
0:54:55 basically every time miles is asking a
0:54:58 question I'm sort of picturing like him
0:55:00 not answering but obviously the thought
0:55:02 gets called to mind and Neil is just
0:55:05 plucking that thought out of his brain
0:55:07 specifically does not remember he uh
0:55:10 like he tries to like he tries to not
0:55:13 think about it which causes him to think
0:55:15 about it but when he tries to think
0:55:16 about it he finds that the thoughts are
0:55:17 not there he um he doesn't know it's
0:55:20 almost like somebody took that memory
0:55:22 out of his mind
0:55:23 which answers some things you will note
0:55:26 that he this this person it does not
0:55:29 seem terribly capable of creative
0:55:31 thought like there's something wrong
0:55:33 with him mentally
0:55:34 uh a Johnny I don't I don't know how
0:55:37 hard you punch this guy but like I mean
0:55:39 he's basically like a worker bee he's
0:55:42 he's got no initiative of his own he's
0:55:46 been hit with dominate in multiple ways
0:55:48 if that's true I mean to be fair Johnny
0:55:50 may have scrambled him really badly but
0:55:52 Johnny's brow furrows and and for a
0:55:55 second you see a a flash of regret and
0:55:58 then he kind of his gay steals again
0:56:00 yeah I don't I don't think this guy has
0:56:02 any like will of his own he's acting on
0:56:06 the impulse of somebody who can just
0:56:08 take memories out of his brain and and
0:56:10 yeah lock his thoughts away he's been
0:56:12 conditioned
0:56:13 what else do you want to know maybe even
0:56:16 if he's been conditioned he could
0:56:17 remember something that would be useful
0:56:19 to us
0:56:20 something like I don't know
0:56:23 can you remember the three of them
0:56:25 talking about this job he does seem to
0:56:28 actually remember communicating about
0:56:30 the job he also knows that he and the
0:56:33 other people in the job and other likely
0:56:36 others that he's like kind of quickly
0:56:37 interact with again these are not clear
0:56:39 images yeah they were shown pictures of
0:56:44 uh specifically miles and Johnny
0:56:48 and they were told to make phone calls
0:56:51 to like on phones that they were given
0:56:53 and whenever they saw the group of you
0:56:57 and you kind of get the impression that
0:57:01 Boston has probably a dozen two dozen
0:57:05 people just wandering Boston at night
0:57:08 looking for signs of the group of you
0:57:10 and calling them in
0:57:13 um okay that's disturbing
0:57:16 what is they um
0:57:18 so these are just just people who have
0:57:22 been sort of snatched off the street uh
0:57:25 and I don't know a couple dozen maybe of
0:57:28 them more there's like a network of them
0:57:30 around Boston they've been sort of
0:57:32 walking around uh every night for it's
0:57:36 it's weird I don't know how long I don't
0:57:38 think he knows how long but
0:57:40 looking for us specifically uh miles and
0:57:43 Johnny
0:57:44 you know network phone calls are made if
0:57:47 you know apparently somebody spotted us
0:57:49 when we came into the city spotted them
0:57:51 at least and like they were I mean what
0:57:54 was the word you used miles conditioning
0:57:55 conditioned they were conditioned to
0:57:57 just make a phone call as soon as they
0:57:59 saw either one of you
0:58:01 and here we are
0:58:02 or maybe I didn't plant that suggestion
0:58:04 but conditioning still might have
0:58:05 happened correct I don't right I'm just
0:58:07 okay clarifying yep I never got that far
0:58:10 right so there's a whole network of
0:58:13 people around this city who were
0:58:15 anticipating us and looking for
0:58:17 specifically photos of miles and and
0:58:20 Johnny it's just generally your clan
0:58:23 that conditions people like that right
0:58:25 Premiere too ever since mine couldn't do
0:58:28 it anymore then yeah the premier and the
0:58:30 ventral
0:58:32 I mean there are a lot of tomato around
0:58:34 here too but along with this being maybe
0:58:36 a more personal attack it does seem to
0:58:39 indicate that arabellas might be behind
0:58:41 this you know we don't have
0:58:43 personal enemies in the city that we
0:58:45 know of outside of Arabella well yeah
0:58:46 not that I'm aware of somebody might be
0:58:48 in hiding here well irritability I mean
0:58:51 I might have pissed off other people I
0:58:53 don't doubt it but specifically Arabella
0:58:55 like you know don't borrow trouble right
0:58:56 right I mean especially for if they're
0:58:58 looking for both me and Johnny is there
0:59:00 anything else we want to know while I'm
0:59:01 in here yeah he's been conditioned to
0:59:05 forget the person who gave him the work
0:59:06 yes
0:59:09 um
0:59:09 that just so we're all aware why is he
0:59:12 closing his eyes like that well
0:59:14 presumably to avoid miles he is
0:59:17 terrified
0:59:18 to meet his eyes like this these
0:59:20 terrible subconscious fears he's met Our
0:59:23 Kind before
0:59:24 well yeah and apparently as an
0:59:28 instinctual fear of being looking in the
0:59:31 eyes of someone like miles he was
0:59:33 conditioned to not remember who gave him
0:59:35 the job
0:59:36 was he conditioned to not remember the
0:59:38 person he fears the most
0:59:40 while the two of them are talking Brita
0:59:43 will look once more and see if the guy
0:59:45 has a cell phone on him he does not and
0:59:47 she'll go on to check the other two they
0:59:50 specifically do not there you said that
0:59:53 they were making calls but none of them
0:59:55 have their phones on them
0:59:57 if if I if I had conditioned somebody to
1:00:00 to make calls to a network and then I
1:00:02 mean they remember meeting up for the
1:00:04 job and talking about this job
1:00:06 and if they had cell phones that could
1:00:08 maybe be traced back I I'd tell them to
1:00:10 throw them in a ditch I only started
1:00:11 carrying a beeper in the past couple of
1:00:13 years use the way the bully boys worked
1:00:15 we'd get the call at whatever Safe House
1:00:17 be working at and then we'd go out and
1:00:19 get the thing done we wouldn't be
1:00:21 bringing we wouldn't be walking around
1:00:22 with with things that could make noise
1:00:24 while we're on a job so I I know that
1:00:27 I'm maybe unreliable in connecting dots
1:00:31 to two different puzzles but uh
1:00:35 I mean it seems pretty clear that
1:00:37 Arabella knew that we were going to be
1:00:39 coming for her at some point up here in
1:00:42 Boston and so set up a network to find
1:00:44 us and and you know take care of the
1:00:47 problem at least you two I don't know if
1:00:49 it wouldn't surprise me if she had maybe
1:00:51 ask him where his safe house is Roland's
1:00:53 was if there is this has Rollins office
1:00:57 bugged let's just let's assume if he's
1:00:59 not carrying phones that they're
1:01:01 operating out of some kind of safe house
1:01:03 if we have if we can find a location
1:01:05 where we know arabella's been in the
1:01:08 last day or so I can track her to
1:01:11 wherever she is but I need a starting
1:01:12 location I can't just do it out of
1:01:14 nowhere I mean there's part of the
1:01:15 reason why I was kind of hoping you
1:01:16 could find her birthday no I can't I can
1:01:19 get that information it just depends
1:01:21 okay and well and also we're gonna have
1:01:22 to go to court very soon so right
1:01:25 you want to see if they're if they
1:01:27 remember some sort of meeting place or
1:01:29 safe house I think you have to ask him
1:01:31 right and it's like do you do you have a
1:01:33 meeting place or safe house that you
1:01:35 meet with these other individuals he
1:01:37 does not upon making the phone call he
1:01:39 received further instructions you can
1:01:42 definitely tell that those instructions
1:01:44 were like implanted into his mind over
1:01:47 the phone okay from there they went to
1:01:51 the restaurant downstairs he met with
1:01:54 other individuals who had approached him
1:01:57 and he had variably seen them before I
1:02:00 had him really like ever had extended
1:02:02 conversations they all literally just
1:02:05 sat quietly waiting for Dawn sometime
1:02:09 around noon there was a drop off for the
1:02:11 gear they accepted the gear they went
1:02:14 inside the apartment complex got dressed
1:02:18 up and then they went to go launch their
1:02:21 attack
1:02:22 miles here's a question and I know it's
1:02:25 been a couple of years since I could
1:02:27 dominate anybody so you probably know
1:02:29 better than I do
1:02:31 um can you do that [ __ ] over the phone
1:02:33 not typically could you Manchurian
1:02:36 Candidate someone to like hear a code
1:02:39 phrase or something over a phone and
1:02:41 then that would trigger something
1:02:42 yes okay okay that knowing that you
1:02:45 could do that is less worrying than than
1:02:47 just being able to give instructions on
1:02:49 the phone because that is 100 what
1:02:50 happened uh they I mean they were just
1:02:53 waiting there was a there was a package
1:02:54 drop off there was everything but they
1:02:56 they called it in they don't know where
1:02:58 there wasn't a meeting place it was all
1:03:00 over the phone a fully blood-bonded
1:03:03 individual will also be very susceptible
1:03:05 to that fair enough
1:03:06 so that's I mean they they these these
1:03:09 guys were Manchurian Candidate it did
1:03:11 to
1:03:12 come kill uh find us and kill us
1:03:15 well
1:03:17 presumably us
1:03:19 I mean it makes sense throwing away tons
1:03:22 and tons of individuals to accomplish a
1:03:24 task yeah that seems very much her
1:03:28 yeah I guess that's where we're at all
1:03:31 right while we wait for this garage I'll
1:03:33 see if I can reach out maybe I don't
1:03:35 have to talk to him I mean
1:03:38 if she knows that we're here and has a
1:03:41 city-wide Information Network and is
1:03:43 going to just maybe keep day rating us
1:03:45 yeah all right sooner rather than later
1:03:48 might be it might be good unless anybody
1:03:50 else has any other ideas
1:03:53 you can just see miles being like it
1:03:55 just never goes well every time he has
1:03:57 to call the prince it just never goes
1:04:00 well
1:04:01 that's if he picks up the only thing I
1:04:04 can think of would be making yourselves
1:04:06 harder to spot maybe something like
1:04:09 I don't know like like motorcycle
1:04:10 helmets I can I can keep us hidden at
1:04:13 night
1:04:15 um so long as you can walk like I do but
1:04:19 that would hide us from everybody and we
1:04:20 can't do that if we're going to court
1:04:22 there's bound to be someone keeping a
1:04:24 look out by there but um after court if
1:04:27 we can find a quiet place and and we can
1:04:31 go a quick refresher on how to walk
1:04:34 without getting noticed I can keep us at
1:04:36 least
1:04:36 at least shielded from Mortal eyes
1:04:38 that'll do more than nothing if we
1:04:41 wanted you know
1:04:42 for a little bit
1:04:46 [Music]
1:04:48 so I'll move away and I will call
1:04:51 Roland's office because I don't call her
1:04:53 own directly is it clear that you're
1:04:56 going to call the prince it's clear that
1:04:58 I'm moving away to make a call which
1:04:59 means it's generally something I don't
1:05:01 want to be interrupted while doing but
1:05:02 did you clarify that you are
1:05:04 specifically talking to rolands uh Neil
1:05:06 did specifically say hey do you want to
1:05:08 just call Roland's right and then I made
1:05:10 a lot of faces about it and him and hod
1:05:12 and then those faces are still happening
1:05:16 it's a flicker of blood-bonded interest
1:05:18 from Bretta
1:05:20 hello hello
1:05:22 speaking how can I help you yes I would
1:05:24 like to talk to uh Prince Rollins if
1:05:26 possible of course one moment please
1:05:28 thank you I have to just the wrong hello
1:05:30 about miles is this is this you are you
1:05:33 in Boston yes I'm in Boston Prince how
1:05:35 is it going there have you completed the
1:05:37 task well well in a way but it would be
1:05:39 helpful if you could tell me the date
1:05:41 that Arabella was embraced
1:05:44 it would help my mulcavian uh April 2nd
1:05:48 1932. very good uh we will hope to get
1:05:51 this all wrapped up quite soon how soon
1:05:53 are we talking here miles this needs to
1:05:55 be done right away yes you can't call me
1:05:57 for wasting both of our times of this I
1:06:00 understand this is the fastest way to do
1:06:02 it otherwise I wouldn't bother you Grace
1:06:04 uh good Tata thank you hangs up
1:06:10 oh my God
1:06:14 I come back in
1:06:16 breathe out April 2nd 1932. oh
1:06:21 oh okay that's super helpful uh and
1:06:26 Neil just kind of sits down on the floor
1:06:27 and pulls like his little book I wonder
1:06:30 if he's out of his day out of his fanny
1:06:31 pack
1:06:32 and just starts looking through like
1:06:34 star charts and stuff
1:06:36 so she wouldn't be an April Fool's child
1:06:39 knowing that while we're waiting he'll
1:06:41 take 10 minutes to not use horoscope but
1:06:45 to conduct the ritual astral portent
1:06:48 to figure out what the most influent
1:06:51 like what the some of the big influences
1:06:55 in her life are right now or rather I
1:06:58 guess the most powerful forces at work
1:07:00 in her life
1:07:02 I only got one success with one success
1:07:06 you become aware that the most important
1:07:10 thing in her own life right now is a
1:07:13 cloven hoof
1:07:14 so Neil sits down and it's just looking
1:07:16 at like star charts and comparing them
1:07:18 and occasionally like over to the window
1:07:20 and look out at the night sky to try and
1:07:22 look at the current the current stars
1:07:24 and then is like cross-referencing them
1:07:27 with the book I'm like oh the stars that
1:07:30 are like 1932 and just going back and
1:07:32 forth it takes about uh 10 or 15 minutes
1:07:35 and eventually he sort of folds the
1:07:37 charts back up into the little book and
1:07:38 Tucks it back into his fanny pack like a
1:07:41 tourist folding a map back up he's very
1:07:44 awkward about folding Maps well that
1:07:46 wasn't as helpful as I thought it would
1:07:47 be sorry you better give me something I
1:07:50 just made that call well look I so the
1:07:54 importance and the and the signs that
1:07:56 she's under right now it's tough to read
1:07:58 I mean my maps are you know ice
1:08:03 I don't know all I got was a cloven hoof
1:08:05 that doesn't mean anything to me Jesus
1:08:07 and Aries can I make a uh a cult roll
1:08:10 yes you can thank you I mean that's a
1:08:12 goat sign isn't it occult intelligence
1:08:14 yes indeed
1:08:17 uh botch
1:08:21 and you are rather certain that this is
1:08:24 some sort of animal reference and it can
1:08:27 mean maybe something with livestock
1:08:30 or maybe she too sacrifices Bulls
1:08:33 I mean cloven hooves are animals have
1:08:37 cloven Hooves maybe she's only certain
1:08:39 types of animals though I didn't say all
1:08:41 animals as well because I do have a coal
1:08:43 on my sheet like a goat yeah you might
1:08:46 actually be onto something one success
1:08:47 with uh one success uh you actually
1:08:50 remember Kabir telling you that there
1:08:53 was a group that was after him and he
1:08:55 needed to lay low for a while and you
1:08:57 put him up they were called the order of
1:08:58 the cloven hoof and they were one of the
1:09:02 three witch covens in search of
1:09:05 something drama and
1:09:07 they're all have a beat with each other
1:09:09 they're all connected in some way
1:09:10 instead of cloven hoof yeah I think
1:09:13 Miles actually might be onto something
1:09:15 with that Aries thing you know Kabir
1:09:17 mentioned a clove and foot one time it
1:09:19 was uh some some witch coven uh they
1:09:22 were they were on his tail for some
1:09:24 stupid thing I think he uh he used he
1:09:27 used his chemistry to piss off the wrong
1:09:29 anyhow sounds about right yeah he uh I
1:09:32 needed to put him up while he was well
1:09:34 he was running from them I think he said
1:09:36 that they were one of three different
1:09:37 witch covens order of the cloven hoof
1:09:40 yeah okay well if she's after the error
1:09:42 codex that kind of makes sense right
1:09:44 because Raven is also after it she said
1:09:46 she was in a witch coven yeah was Raven
1:09:48 in that one can I make like just an
1:09:51 intelligence role to see if I can
1:09:53 remember Raven saying things about this
1:09:55 yes
1:09:58 two successes well I'm pretty sure it's
1:10:00 an Aries sign
1:10:02 she's stubborn fiery I mean it's all all
1:10:06 the signs are there
1:10:07 so what you would know about Raven she
1:10:11 actually doesn't discuss it very much
1:10:12 but you do know that she was once one of
1:10:14 five apostles who were loyal to a circle
1:10:20 of wizards and witches
1:10:22 and when glorious leaders died they
1:10:25 ended up being a split one group kept
1:10:27 the Earth codex and were doing a lot of
1:10:30 dark deeds and she was one of the five
1:10:35 who tried to keep true to the beliefs of
1:10:38 the coven and the two groups ended up in
1:10:41 conflict with one another
1:10:43 ultimately her coven was forced out of
1:10:46 Salem
1:10:47 and after you know some Unfortunate
1:10:50 Events took place among the locals it is
1:10:53 actually around then that she was
1:10:55 embraced Raven is a member of was was is
1:11:00 not completely clear uh a member of a
1:11:04 group called the order of the Twisted
1:11:05 horn
1:11:07 she was not in cloven hoof she was a
1:11:10 member of Twisted horn
1:11:13 but there was a split amongst
1:11:15 both groups are actually descended from
1:11:19 another the cloven hoof did not exist
1:11:21 yet uh this group the original group the
1:11:25 one from which the error code X comes
1:11:28 from is the Golden Dawn so
1:11:32 there were
1:11:34 there was one group The Golden Dawn
1:11:37 and then Twisted horn split from that
1:11:40 and then eventually cloven hoof broke
1:11:43 from that okay
1:11:45 um and Raven was twisted horn cloven
1:11:48 huff and twisted horn and I mean yeah
1:11:52 I'm with miles on the goat thing at this
1:11:53 point
1:11:54 unless they're running around having
1:11:56 congress with the devil isn't that what
1:11:58 the people say witches do you know sex
1:12:00 with the devil or something that's one
1:12:02 of the things they say witches do I'm
1:12:04 aware of this bafflement character
1:12:05 that's pretty popular
1:12:07 I think I saw that on a metal t-shirt
1:12:08 that's pretty much where I know it from
1:12:10 too you know being that you're someone
1:12:12 that paints blood sigils under Windows
1:12:14 off to the Middle East I think you
1:12:17 should I think you should give this a
1:12:18 little bit more gravitas than you want
1:12:20 I'm not I'm not not giving it grommets
1:12:22 why do you think I'm not giving a
1:12:23 gravitas I think it's because you're
1:12:24 giving me too much credit well you're
1:12:26 I'm talking about you're talking about I
1:12:27 agree with Miles about the goat thing
1:12:29 it's a heavy metal t-shirts well no I
1:12:31 have seen I haven't seen Buffett any of
1:12:33 that kind of stuff but yes a lot of the
1:12:35 things that I do in theory are related
1:12:38 to you know I wouldn't say that gods and
1:12:42 Baphomet is immediately counted into
1:12:44 this and names I mean
1:12:47 names mean so little it feels like in
1:12:50 this Society I mean even the names of
1:12:53 our Clans right it could be symbolic for
1:12:55 something completely different it could
1:12:56 be symbolic for
1:12:58 it seems like a pitfall well I don't
1:13:00 want to get that Twisted names with a
1:13:01 capital N AB absolutely do have power
1:13:04 anyways I was just thinking myths and
1:13:06 legends come from somewhere so no I
1:13:08 don't know so the back of my character
1:13:10 might not be the actual one but it might
1:13:12 be the basis for whatever this is or
1:13:14 maybe maybe not right sacrificial I mean
1:13:17 mithras had a bowl you know and that was
1:13:22 all related to
1:13:23 anyways what I'm what I'm saying is I'm
1:13:26 not not giving it credit and Credence
1:13:28 here it's just I I don't know enough
1:13:30 about witches I guess yeah this sounds
1:13:33 like Mortal magic too their mortal magic
1:13:36 is a thing
1:13:37 well that's news to me blood magic had
1:13:39 to come from somewhere but we're talking
1:13:41 about a group of witches
1:13:44 specifically that that are Kindred this
1:13:48 these covenants were chasing Kabir the
1:13:51 they apparently have had Raven amongst
1:13:54 their members and now it seems that
1:13:56 Arabella Rollins has been ensnared
1:13:58 within this cult so for all we know they
1:14:01 could be worshiping a demon or something
1:14:02 so that's well that's a big leap to make
1:14:06 well I don't even know if that's a big
1:14:08 leap to make I think it's just sometimes
1:14:10 people think you worship demons and they
1:14:12 are just a different thing look I'm
1:14:13 trying to keep an open mind about blood
1:14:15 sorcery but anytime I hear it that's
1:14:17 where my mind goes and I appreciate it
1:14:19 and I appreciate how you could have that
1:14:22 perspective
1:14:23 I think I need to get in touch with
1:14:25 Raven I was about to suggest that I
1:14:27 think this is about the time that since
1:14:28 we're waiting anyways maybe you can call
1:14:30 a bird send a bird messenger that's the
1:14:33 plan that's what about our friend
1:14:40 I was watching uh a YouTube old old
1:14:44 YouTube videos remember the old X-Men
1:14:46 you're fired yeah yes the Peter Holmes
1:14:49 yeah so uh me and Rebecca are watching
1:14:53 it and we commented that Pete Holmes as
1:14:55 Xavier is actually really similar to
1:14:58 Miles
1:15:02 and there's this moment where he was
1:15:05 talking to Angel was like you [ __ ]
1:15:07 bird
1:15:19 there was no hesitation from Lexus it
1:15:22 was really good it like I

1:16:52 with him are you and your friends ready
1:16:55 to go
1:16:56 you've got some [ __ ] in your hair
1:16:58 yeah
1:17:00 it didn't bring a change of pants either
1:17:02 oh yeah I forgot that too sorry uh we
1:17:05 made a mess in your city here uh not my
1:17:08 city uh but uh
1:17:11 what the f he like it starts to really
1:17:14 kind of get him how much blood is
1:17:17 everywhere the floor is completely
1:17:18 flooded there's Scorch marks all over
1:17:21 the place
1:17:22 welcoming committee don't [ __ ] put
1:17:25 that on us no didn't mean we don't these
1:17:28 these three emotions towards the floor
1:17:30 tried to burn the place down and then
1:17:33 we're ready to jump us once the uh once
1:17:35 we started fleeing out of the building
1:17:37 unfortunately
1:17:40 we managed to put out the flames and I
1:17:42 got the jump on them all right then
1:17:45 who's this [ __ ] guy
1:17:47 this one here most points at the one
1:17:50 alive we killed two of them and said
1:17:53 said we left one alive but I was scared
1:17:56 this one was gonna die before you got
1:17:58 here so I gave him a bit of my vitae
1:18:01 we asked him a couple of questions and
1:18:04 we think that he is working for Arabella
1:18:07 Rollins do you get what you need out of
1:18:10 him we got what we could out of him
1:18:11 ready to hand him over to you and if you
1:18:13 if if the domain wants to try and get
1:18:15 what they can out of him his mind has
1:18:16 been messed with compromised I don't
1:18:21 need him uh he turns to one of the guys
1:18:24 kind of like gives this quick motion
1:18:26 that guy pulls out a garage and starts
1:18:29 approaching uh the uh captive just so
1:18:33 you um no like Neil is not looking at
1:18:36 Cold murder it just even it still
1:18:39 bothers him just so you know
1:18:41 um you got a couple of dozen of those
1:18:44 around the city
1:18:45 it seems like
1:18:48 uh [ __ ] humans
1:18:51 no people compromised by Arabella good
1:18:54 to know
1:18:55 you know just from one friendly domain
1:18:59 to another yeah
1:19:01 um if
1:19:02 we get out of this meeting with any time
1:19:04 to spare if you could bring us to the
1:19:06 place where you found that burned body
1:19:08 left by Arabella that would help us get
1:19:11 on her Trail we can definitely do that
1:19:13 very good uh yeah the uh
1:19:16 Rotana kind of grabs uh this this like
1:19:20 Soul by the hair and just drags him into
1:19:23 the next room and then shuts the door
1:19:26 yeah let's uh let's go let's I don't all
1:19:29 right my guys I gotta clean this place
1:19:30 up uh are you uh driving yourself out or
1:19:34 uh you're gonna need a ride we should
1:19:37 probably check the car to make sure it's
1:19:38 not compromised let's get a ride for now
1:19:41 it might be the fastest way if we could
1:19:43 stop at like some place that'll be kind
1:19:46 of want to enter into court with this I
1:19:48 don't think the prince would appreciate
1:19:50 it I don't know that he's gonna give a
1:19:52 [ __ ] he's either really gonna be really
1:19:53 pissed off or he's not gonna he's gonna
1:19:55 not notice at all all right I'll just
1:19:57 pretty much a coin toss sure I wouldn't
1:19:58 I wouldn't you're gonna want to go with
1:20:00 your idea because the other end of the
1:20:02 coin toss is that he flips out and as he
1:20:04 killed right so yeah I think it's in
1:20:06 some place appropriate please yeah
1:20:07 sounds good all right so uh why don't
1:20:09 you all uh head outside and uh get
1:20:12 yourselves comfortable and uh I'll uh
1:20:14 I'll make sure everything's done here
1:20:16 and um we can go ahead and get you over
1:20:18 to court much appreciated Sullivan thank
1:20:20 you for the ride and all Neil is already
1:20:22 leaving the apartment because a murder
1:20:23 is happening in there Brett is making
1:20:26 sure everyone's got their stuff and
1:20:28 flinching a bit but moving forward
1:20:31 Sullivan does not seem phased by about
1:20:34 ordering the execution of that person my
1:20:36 hard case bag and everything else Johnny
1:20:38 Go grabs his duffel bag and uh walks
1:20:41 past heading out it gives kind of like
1:20:44 one of those hard knowing stares at
1:20:47 Sullivan as he walks by it's kind of
1:20:49 like this uh look of acknowledgment like
1:20:51 a nod the wind grabs her bag and makes
1:20:53 sure that you know all of her stuff is
1:20:55 packed up and follow him
1:20:59 [Music]
1:21:04 side and there's a couple cabs
1:21:05 there are mortal throngs everywhere
1:21:07 people are kind of having a good time
1:21:09 they're allowed it's cold but uh you
1:21:12 know people having fun the group of you
1:21:14 are able to hop into cabs uh where are
1:21:16 you having them going miles if you're
1:21:17 taking us to like some place to buy a
1:21:19 [ __ ] ton of nice clothes like new things
1:21:22 if if we want to call a hotel and grab a
1:21:25 room that might make sense to just throw
1:21:28 our gear in like a room in a hotel like
1:21:30 maybe use their shower and like some
1:21:33 towels to clean off and change it into
1:21:35 some new clothes so you guys can do that
1:21:37 I can pick up clothes for you so because
1:21:39 I don't want to wait make the prince
1:21:40 wait long it doesn't mean anything fancy
1:21:41 you get a nice Downtown hotel yeah I can
1:21:45 get that all set up so because I don't
1:21:46 want to spend forever doing this so I
1:21:48 can quite easily so you're gonna shop
1:21:50 for clothes right everyone's gonna take
1:21:52 showers and get cleaned up at the hotel
1:21:54 is that correct
1:21:55 okay you are able to do all of these
1:21:57 things without incident it's always nice
1:21:59 to hear yeah we all hold our breath
1:22:01 eventually uh you're able to meet back
1:22:04 at the new hotel room Sullivan kinda
1:22:06 drops a phone call let you guys know
1:22:08 that uh it's time to go now you guys all
1:22:11 look like professionals Neil does not
1:22:14 not wear his tie-dye T-shirt under the
1:22:16 nice clothes you buy him that's because
1:22:18 that's why you have a very dark shirt
1:22:19 open on top of it
1:22:22 maybe an all-black Affair for you
1:22:25 Johnny's dressed in all Red Sox gears
1:22:30 uh is it possible while miles is
1:22:33 shopping and someone else is showering
1:22:34 that wind could find pigeon find a
1:22:37 pigeon yeah she tries to not be obvious
1:22:40 about it but she you know beckons a
1:22:43 pigeon and starts speaking to the pigeon
1:22:45 as a you know in Pigeon says do you know
1:22:48 who Raven is Pigeon does not there is a
1:22:51 woman called raven
1:22:52 and I need you to find her and she gives
1:22:55 a description of Raven tells her which
1:22:57 direction to fly in order to find her
1:23:00 um and tells her to look for Raven the
1:23:02 bird what message do you give what you
1:23:05 seek is in Boston
1:23:06 pigeon takes off and when heads back
1:23:09 into the hotel room and kind of sits and
1:23:13 waits for it's unlikely the pigeon's
1:23:16 going to be back anytime soon she
1:23:18 kind of sits and contemplates Johnny's
1:23:20 Behavior
1:23:22 since they woke up and decide she needs
1:23:25 to have a chat with him it's not
1:23:26 terribly urgent but it is important
1:23:28 um
1:23:29 absolutely does anyone else taking care
1:23:32 of anything before you guys had to meet
1:23:33 with the prince probably just rinses his
1:23:35 hair out in the sink and dries off all
1:23:37 of the uh all of the grime off him with
1:23:40 like a towel like a wet towel and he
1:23:42 just calls that a close enough for jazz
1:23:44 before putting on the new clothes so
1:23:46 he's actually probably one of the people
1:23:47 he's ready first I'm actually pretty
1:23:48 clean apart from washing my hands more
1:23:50 even though he probably doesn't need it
1:23:52 uh if we're given the time Neil 100
1:23:54 takes a shower uh so for this scene I
1:23:58 want you guys to picture Neil badly
1:24:00 singing Blue Oyster Cult songs
1:24:01 throughout your entire
1:24:04 conversation yeah Johnny let's go have a
1:24:07 smoke all right Johnny pops up and
1:24:09 follows win win kind of goes outside the
1:24:13 hotel room door kind of make sure the
1:24:16 hallway is clear they head outside
1:24:18 actually because there's they're going
1:24:19 to be smoking
1:24:20 and she just kind of gives him a long
1:24:22 look Johnny lights two cigarettes and
1:24:25 passes her one thanks man
1:24:27 I don't think that guy's the only one
1:24:29 who got his brain scrambled in that
1:24:30 fight Johnny
1:24:31 his eyebrows both kind of pop-up [ __ ]
1:24:34 like damn they're just cut into the
1:24:35 chase
1:24:36 I'm I'm not gonna beat around the bush
1:24:38 with you I respect you too much for that
1:24:42 it was a rough night yeah I can tell
1:24:46 Johnny I
1:24:48 we can't both we're the ones who give
1:24:50 the hitting we can't both be
1:24:53 me
1:24:55 we can't both be the monsters
1:24:59 win
1:25:02 first of all you're not a monster
1:25:05 and
1:25:07 look
1:25:11 this is this is what happens to people
1:25:13 that do work like us
1:25:16 I know
1:25:17 but you weren't fighting it
1:25:19 you were given into it I've been
1:25:21 fighting it for a long time I know and
1:25:23 it's exhausting
1:25:25 is
1:25:27 this year
1:25:29 if it keeps going the way it's been
1:25:31 going I I don't know what I'm gonna look
1:25:33 like on the other side of it
1:25:35 we started things off with
1:25:38 finding this doe-eyed girl in an alley
1:25:42 we've just been embraced
1:25:45 having feasted upon another girl
1:25:48 because she couldn't control her [ __ ]
1:25:51 I don't get cases like that a lot but
1:25:54 that [ __ ] should have just told me what
1:25:56 a [ __ ] year this is gonna be
1:26:00 and then we had the everything happen
1:26:02 between the the bear and the the house
1:26:04 with the zantosa I embraced that
1:26:08 [ __ ]
1:26:10 there was the werewolf we thought we
1:26:12 lost Neil
1:26:14 there's weird things creeping around the
1:26:16 city these days
1:26:18 zombies
1:26:20 now we're fighting amongst the camarilla
1:26:24 itself trying to pick sides between the
1:26:27 Gemini league and the operation longbow
1:26:31 and then three punks decided they could
1:26:34 just burn us alive in our sleep
1:26:38 and Brita looked at me and asked me to
1:26:40 save her
1:26:41 and yeah something just snapped inside
1:26:45 yeah
1:26:46 I
1:26:48 I remember when I lost it too but you
1:26:50 know what I feel a lot better now that I
1:26:53 just kind of let go of that part yeah I
1:26:55 don't like that though and I think you
1:26:58 need deserve to know that I'm not gonna
1:27:00 let you
1:27:01 go down that path
1:27:04 all right
1:27:06 I need you to be better than me
1:27:10 because I'll tell you right now it
1:27:12 doesn't bother me that they're
1:27:12 strangling that kid
1:27:15 doesn't bother me either I know
1:27:17 but I need you to pretend it bothers you
1:27:19 I need you to be I need you to be you I
1:27:22 Can't Let You Lose Yourself to this
1:27:25 Johnny uh takes a long drag on his
1:27:27 cigarette almost down to the filter
1:27:29 drops it puts it out with his boot
1:27:32 I'm not going to get better for your
1:27:34 sake so you can go down the rabbit hole
1:27:35 but I'll make you a promise and he kind
1:27:38 of looks at you squaring the eyes
