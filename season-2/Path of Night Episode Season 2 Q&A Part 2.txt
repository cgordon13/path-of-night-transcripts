0:00:03 [Music]
0:00:06 welcome back dude uh this was a q a part
0:00:09 two and uh we've still got some more
0:00:11 questions from everybody
0:00:13 uh so do we want to start with
0:00:16 um
0:00:16 I know last time we talked a lot about
0:00:18 you know how we got started and and the
0:00:20 the general gist of everything and our
0:00:23 character Concepts and our favorite
0:00:24 vampire stuff if you haven't listened to
0:00:26 part one go you know go do that
0:00:29 um or don't we can't tell you what to do
0:00:31 no I'm telling you what to do go do it
0:00:33 Rob can't do that either damn it
0:00:36 this I'm not even running a game yet you
0:00:38 can't bring it you do you do you
0:00:39 audience members
0:00:41 all right uh but some of the some of the
0:00:44 questions one of the one of the
0:00:45 questions we got a few times is um so
0:00:48 let this is for Lex specifically
0:00:51 um we talked a little bit about like
0:00:52 your prep work and uh the World building
0:00:55 and stuff but uh how much of the wider
0:00:57 World outside of New Haven is fleshed
0:00:59 out like we've seen some of New York
0:01:00 some of Boston some of Baghdad uh some
0:01:03 of Rhode Island at this point
0:01:05 um how much like World prep do you do
0:01:09 game to game versus how much is already
0:01:11 pre-prepped
0:01:12 so when I first started uh kind of
0:01:17 putting together what the setting was
0:01:18 going to be
0:01:20 um the big thing that I focused on was
0:01:23 because it's you know set to in 1999
0:01:26 that's uh or a series of really major
0:01:30 events happen in the world of Darkness
0:01:32 so what I
0:01:35 did was I went to the events I decided
0:01:37 how they would uh impact the local
0:01:40 setting
0:01:42 um and from there I kind of thought you
0:01:44 know which Canada PCS in the area what
0:01:47 concepts needed filling and I actually
0:01:51 started I obviously I focused mostly on
0:01:54 New Haven but there are
0:01:57 uh I have an idea of a good chunk of the
0:02:01 domains that are that kind of make up
0:02:03 the Northeast right so there are things
0:02:06 going on as far up as Vermont
0:02:10 um some of it has actually been
0:02:12 alluded to uh back in the first season
0:02:17 um obviously New York is you know very
0:02:20 defined
0:02:21 um New Haven Bridgeport Hartford
0:02:24 um Boston
0:02:27 um and then you know other important
0:02:30 places like alamut has uh stuff going on
0:02:35 Vienna
0:02:37 um
0:02:37 so
0:02:38 I think part of the way I do it is we're
0:02:42 basically telling a story that is set in
0:02:44 a very large very well-defined universe
0:02:47 so there are things happening in those
0:02:50 Universe in in that universe but I try
0:02:53 to kind of keep focus on the characters
0:02:56 themselves and how they interact with
0:02:58 those big events like the vision you had
0:03:00 uh and and season one right so Neil has
0:03:04 this vision and a whole lot of that
0:03:06 Vision can kind of pertain to the story
0:03:09 that was going on at the time
0:03:11 but
0:03:12 for like more
0:03:15 I don't know what white wolf lore heavy
0:03:17 players they very clearly saw the rise
0:03:21 of our shogi and it meant something
0:03:24 totally different to them
0:03:26 um but even like aside from like other
0:03:28 cities you know there's a there's a sept
0:03:30 of werewolves that's in the area
0:03:33 and I know there's some people that are
0:03:35 kind of waiting for like you know they
0:03:36 get offenders to visit Johnny uh which
0:03:39 which you know
0:03:41 spoiler alert I have not I have not
0:03:44 forgotten and neither have they
0:03:46 um and uh so yeah a lot of it has a lot
0:03:51 of it has not made it to the screen so
0:03:54 to speak yet but it's all it's there
0:03:56 cool
0:03:58 this is sort of a question
0:04:00 um that's for all of the players and we
0:04:04 we've done it a few times in game uh and
0:04:07 obviously uh Garrett made official art
0:04:09 uh in two different styles that we've
0:04:12 we've put out there for everybody to
0:04:13 look at but um
0:04:16 because it we've uh
0:04:19 sort of our characters have changed over
0:04:21 time uh between this between the two
0:04:23 seasons
0:04:24 can we go around the table and sort of
0:04:26 everybody give like an updated
0:04:27 description of what your PC looks like
0:04:30 right now
0:04:33 if you want I can start it's uh Neil is
0:04:36 tall and like way too thin and gangly
0:04:39 and he's got this like greasy hair
0:04:42 curtain although at the end of the
0:04:43 season he's got a white stripe in it and
0:04:44 it's actually pushed back and it looks
0:04:46 nice upgrade upgrade
0:04:49 um he started the season wearing like
0:04:51 you know slacks and a bolt like
0:04:53 polyester bowling shirt uh but has
0:04:55 switched out into his more like
0:04:59 I don't know mod 60s mod goth look like
0:05:03 you know a turtleneck sweater and thin
0:05:06 pants and then when he's doing sorcery
0:05:08 [ __ ] he's got like a weird Gauzy black
0:05:10 like hooded it's not like a cape it's
0:05:14 not a cloak like a mantle I don't know
0:05:16 how you
0:05:17 I can picture it in my [ __ ] head and
0:05:19 I don't know the clothing word for it
0:05:22 um but yeah he's just like a tall weird
0:05:24 looking like
0:05:26 nervous white guy who's just
0:05:29 his hair swept back what color are his
0:05:31 eyes
0:05:32 now that they can be so now that they
0:05:34 can actually be seen uh they are brown
0:05:35 okay black pits uh yeah well they are
0:05:40 brown eyes but if I remember right like
0:05:42 when he does weird Vision like
0:05:45 Khalif magic [ __ ] they like dilate until
0:05:48 you can almost not see the sclera right
0:05:50 I just thought they got bloodshot
0:05:51 they're just I mean that's not Khalif
0:05:54 that's yeah oh that's the other that's
0:05:55 the [ __ ] he does with wind yeah some of
0:05:58 the [ __ ] he does with one yeah
0:06:00 all right I can go next
0:06:03 um
0:06:04 Bretta is she looks to be about 18 to
0:06:08 19. she has notably a large bright blue
0:06:12 eyes
0:06:14 um light to medium brown hair her
0:06:18 her build is slight but balanced she
0:06:21 tends to wear a lot of very feminine
0:06:23 clothing she likes skirts she kind of
0:06:26 gravitates towards like a neutral
0:06:28 palette but also likes like purple and
0:06:31 some lighter colors
0:06:33 um
0:06:34 and she's always wearing gloves that was
0:06:36 actually something I was joking about
0:06:37 the other day somehow our art she's not
0:06:40 wearing gloves I guess uh in the
0:06:42 beginning she didn't have the the
0:06:43 Crescent showing through and then all
0:06:46 the art for Berta got done before yeah
0:06:47 before a crescent moon showed up on her
0:06:49 hand but yeah Boston I think it was
0:06:51 Boston when that happened yeah we went
0:06:53 to see the Giovanni and Regina actually
0:06:55 it was before that it was it was she was
0:06:57 scribbling it was New York it was New
0:06:59 York when
0:07:01 um the uh what was it was this the sign
0:07:05 I was supposed to look for was um the
0:07:08 was it black as the sun or yep like is
0:07:10 the sun red is the moon yeah and um when
0:07:13 that got mentioned you you like
0:07:16 scratched into your hand yeah so that's
0:07:18 that's when that first started so I
0:07:19 think all the illustration stuff was
0:07:21 from season one was before that no
0:07:23 talking about that I don't know Lex I
0:07:26 don't know if you can tell spoilers or
0:07:27 not have we hit all the Manchurian
0:07:28 Candidate triggers yet for Brita or
0:07:31 more all right nah let's see also one's
0:07:36 coming actually oh so this is going to
0:07:38 be cool how would you I'm trapped in a
0:07:40 van with her right now yeah yeah it's
0:07:42 pretty good what would make you think
0:07:43 that was over
0:07:45 I don't know man optimism
0:07:50 she also she has um
0:07:55 blush of health and part of the reason
0:07:57 she was wearing gloves at first was that
0:07:59 touch of frost
0:08:01 um on her hands as well I think that's
0:08:04 she tends to move like very
0:08:07 I feel like Toyota innately I enjoy
0:08:10 portraying them with like a sense of
0:08:11 like Grace and that's definitely true
0:08:14 for for her
0:08:15 uh miles at the end of the season has uh
0:08:19 uh at this point in time not being not
0:08:22 wearing his combat wear
0:08:23 which is the trench coat and the belts
0:08:26 and the guns and the most important part
0:08:29 yeah well to be fair even in my normal
0:08:31 attire the katana's generally around so
0:08:34 let's let's not pretend Chinese ninja
0:08:36 saber you're banned from everything
0:08:42 So currently I didn't mention it before
0:08:44 but I actually imagined him having like
0:08:46 a rust colored suit at this point
0:08:48 um
0:08:49 uh about the time that the princess
0:08:51 showed up and still utilizing the katana
0:08:54 uh the hair is still mostly back but I
0:08:57 think a little bit of slipped
0:08:59 um
0:09:00 just my the appearance is just never as
0:09:03 tight as it was previously and some
0:09:06 loose strands of villains
0:09:11 still commanding well-built six foot
0:09:14 blonde hair blue eyes individual you're
0:09:17 what kind of are you wearing like the
0:09:19 the thin wire like 90s glasses probably
0:09:23 whatever is most fashionable at that
0:09:25 time but that's probably what I'm
0:09:26 thinking
0:09:27 um it's definitely not what I wear like
0:09:29 currently here now because these are
0:09:30 much more modern stuff modern and yeah
0:09:32 look nice I always forget the Heights in
0:09:35 the codery because bread is the smallest
0:09:37 but then I think Johnny because Johnny's
0:09:39 so and I know he's not tall no just
0:09:41 because he's so big like muscle wise I
0:09:45 always forget that miles is easily the
0:09:47 tallest I think miles is the tallest
0:09:49 miles
0:09:51 doing the uh Mr Burns my impression was
0:09:54 always that Miles and Neil were about
0:09:56 the same height but Neil has such
0:09:57 horrific posture like that's why when we
0:09:59 went to the gala and I was trying to be
0:10:01 confident I was like I'm gonna have
0:10:02 posture like miles like very
0:10:03 deliberately but it's back cracked
0:10:05 because he's never moved in that
0:10:07 direction so it's funny because when I
0:10:09 imagine like scenes right so I actually
0:10:12 see all of your PCS like differently
0:10:14 and and uh it's kind of amusing to me
0:10:18 because
0:10:19 Johnny gets like an inch taller a couple
0:10:22 episodes right and it's funny because
0:10:25 like in my descriptions of Johnny right
0:10:28 like like Johnny's you know he's he's a
0:10:30 healthy looking dude yeah but like when
0:10:33 I'm describing stuff there's always
0:10:35 something she's like oh those biceps I'm
0:10:39 so jacked
0:10:41 there's ABS
0:10:43 that white T-shirt is doomed right
0:10:47 like like I think we also forgot to
0:10:49 mention about miles is that he has
0:10:51 really big hands and it's big hands big
0:10:53 hands scientist of hands that makes no
0:10:55 sense unless you listen to the previous
0:10:57 episode which was our like table banter
0:10:59 episode that that that's where that made
0:11:01 it I think it makes perfect sense
0:11:03 everyone knows that his hands are big
0:11:04 hands yeah see it's well known fact
0:11:07 nobody needs to check that out
0:11:12 you're up Erica oh boy
0:11:15 um all right so when
0:11:17 did not get any Beast features this
0:11:19 season which no one is more surprised
0:11:21 than me opportunities existed
0:11:24 um
0:11:25 she continues to have
0:11:28 um long stark white hair
0:11:31 um
0:11:32 looks shaved on the sides but
0:11:35 during backstory Revelations reveals she
0:11:38 tore it out during her embrace
0:11:42 um
0:11:42 and those sides are now flecked with
0:11:45 snake scales
0:11:47 um from the first season's Frenzy
0:11:49 her eyes are the color of
0:11:53 I said seagull initially but I've been
0:11:55 looking at a lot of pictures of birds
0:11:57 for lots of reasons
0:11:59 um
0:12:00 uh and actually Eagles have the same
0:12:02 color eyes
0:12:04 um so just drop the c
0:12:07 there's
0:12:10 [Laughter]
0:12:23 foreign
0:12:28 don't give me an in man
0:12:30 um she's about five seven uh she is
0:12:33 her biceps are not legendary but she is
0:12:36 muscular and she is very sturdily built
0:12:41 um
0:12:42 she
0:12:44 um also has when her fangs are extended
0:12:47 they are uh snake fangs
0:12:51 um
0:12:52 she pretty much is always in leather
0:12:55 flannel and jeans and Doc Martens and
0:12:58 she still has the last scrap of her
0:13:00 dad's last flannel wrapped around her
0:13:02 wrist it's a blue and red check pattern
0:13:06 did we didn't some happen to your boots
0:13:09 haven't we replaced your boots yet or no
0:13:10 I keep listening and I keep thinking
0:13:12 that we've replaced them and I don't
0:13:14 think we have you gave them to Brita at
0:13:17 one point I very distinctly remembered
0:13:19 someone else wearing them and being like
0:13:21 Oh I think I'm like giving them back to
0:13:23 win and be like no yeah no I mean
0:13:25 between season maybe like her upgraded
0:13:28 outfit at the end when she was wearing
0:13:29 the aviators and the and kabir's clothes
0:13:32 her accurate upgrade is just looking
0:13:34 more like Kabir it is but but hotter
0:13:38 um yeah uh but yeah she um she did do
0:13:42 the upgrade so that might still be what
0:13:43 she's wearing at this point as the
0:13:45 season ended was a gaudy red and gold
0:13:49 vest
0:13:50 um a button-down white shirt rolled up
0:13:52 to the elbows not all the buttons
0:13:54 buttoned and then a pair of men's
0:13:55 trousers
0:13:56 and aviators
0:13:58 I vacillate so wildly on what my opinion
0:14:01 like what my belief of what kabir's
0:14:04 appearance rating is that it like and I
0:14:06 don't want to know don't tell me but
0:14:07 like it's
0:14:09 I there are days when I'm like that
0:14:10 [ __ ] like a two maybe a one and
0:14:12 there's like he's gotta be like a four
0:14:14 or five right like just like a scummy
0:14:16 four kabir's appearance rating is the
0:14:20 weirdly hot guy at the carnival
0:14:22 that really tries
0:14:24 yeah I I hear that you can't put that in
0:14:26 numerix
0:14:28 he he is the hot guy who he's the hot
0:14:31 car most of most of his possessions he
0:14:34 bought at like a gas station
0:14:36 you know like he's he's got that going
0:14:39 on well I mean he was there for Wolf
0:14:40 Panther anyway he's got that they're for
0:14:42 Wolf he's got that look where you look
0:14:43 at me like man that guy's attractive but
0:14:45 five years he's gonna be awful looking
0:14:47 at this those five years never come yes
0:14:50 they never come they'll never come but
0:14:51 you see them and you're like uh time's
0:14:53 not gonna do well to you but is it
0:14:56 apparently it is
0:15:01 um I guess so Johnny's look
0:15:03 um so the funny thing about Johnny
0:15:05 is I I the perception that he's a lot
0:15:09 bigger than he is
0:15:12 um he's actually only about 5 10.
0:15:15 um maybe five eleven
0:15:17 um but he is he of the of the of of the
0:15:21 guys in the codery he's the shortest I
0:15:23 think
0:15:24 um he just happens to also probably be
0:15:26 the widest
0:15:28 um
0:15:28 because he's just one of those just like
0:15:30 built kind of dudes I thought the the
0:15:33 wit that was the width you were giving
0:15:34 us five five ten five eleven yeah that's
0:15:36 right exactly the square um but um you
0:15:40 know he's uh
0:15:42 he's
0:15:43 you know the idea around him is
0:15:46 and I didn't say this before but the
0:15:48 obviously the other inspiration for
0:15:50 Johnny is Jack Burton yeah that's that's
0:15:53 every brujah is not at least a little
0:15:56 bit Jack Burton you're not doing it
0:15:57 right
0:15:59 and um
0:16:01 I feel like that really kind of infers
0:16:03 his look you know he's got
0:16:05 um
0:16:05 very dark brown maybe black hair in that
0:16:10 kind of Kurt Russell in the 80s look
0:16:12 um he's got a five that permanent five
0:16:15 o'clock shadow
0:16:16 um you know he was embraced when he was
0:16:18 on the road
0:16:20 um with his truck so he didn't actually
0:16:22 get a chance to like prep and shave and
0:16:24 all that kind of thing that a lot of
0:16:25 people get I would assume a lot of
0:16:29 you know people like in the clan Venture
0:16:31 like miles get a chance to like prepare
0:16:33 themselves before they're embraced
0:16:35 um
0:16:36 Johnny didn't
0:16:38 um
0:16:39 the audience can't see your smug look
0:16:41 right now yeah I mean totally prepared
0:16:43 but
0:16:45 um
0:16:47 yeah he's uh he he's very solidly built
0:16:50 um and always wears like a pair of of
0:16:55 worn but you know mostly clean like
0:16:58 Levi's 501s with a pair of like brown
0:17:01 heavy work boots
0:17:05 um
0:17:06 and uh I always imagine him having kind
0:17:08 of one of those
0:17:10 um leather Concho belts
0:17:12 you know what I'm talking about no uh
0:17:15 the those kind of like western style
0:17:17 belts with with the little like silver
0:17:19 conchos in them oh yeah okay
0:17:22 um I do think I know what you're talking
0:17:23 about and uh it always has a white a
0:17:28 white T-shirt on
0:17:29 um
0:17:30 form-fitting white tee that's either
0:17:32 tucked in or
0:17:34 um no it's usually always tucked in and
0:17:36 then maybe some kind of flannel over top
0:17:38 of that
0:17:40 um and depending on what state of of
0:17:43 combat he's going into his uh his
0:17:45 leather biker jacket that he wears on
0:17:47 top of that
0:17:48 um I don't think his his uh look has
0:17:51 changed drastically from that I think
0:17:53 did Miles get you in a suit once for
0:17:55 Boston well we were we were all in fancy
0:17:57 clothes once for Boston yeah
0:17:59 um
0:18:00 the um and he even when Johnny dresses
0:18:03 up I imagine he's he's one of those guys
0:18:05 that still is going to be wearing his
0:18:08 jeans it's just he might put a a
0:18:11 button-up shirt on it's like you know
0:18:13 the dad who's trying to dress up for a
0:18:15 PTA meeting but doesn't do it very well
0:18:18 um
0:18:20 oh yeah and then um and then eyes wise I
0:18:22 think he's got kind of uh like blue gray
0:18:26 eyes but I think it was mentioned at one
0:18:29 point that when he uses presents they
0:18:30 kind of crystallized into like this
0:18:32 perfectly like you know ice blue like
0:18:36 look oh oh you know suddenly his eyes
0:18:38 get way more attractive than they
0:18:40 actually are
0:18:41 um because usually I think he's got more
0:18:43 of kind of that squinty eyed look of you
0:18:46 know somebody who's on the road a lot
0:18:48 all right it's up for uh the people who
0:18:50 are asking you know I hope that helps
0:18:52 um Lex jumping back to uh sort of the
0:18:55 the overall plot and you again anytime I
0:18:58 ask a plot question or like a character
0:18:59 backstory question it is you know just
0:19:03 so we don't discipline the audience like
0:19:04 there's entirely possible we're just
0:19:06 gonna be like yeah I'm not answering
0:19:07 that then you know wait for the last
0:19:09 reasons that's boring no not boring
0:19:12 let's go he's answering everything today
0:19:14 just ask him
0:19:16 um oh he's Elsa alive
0:19:27 I believe the audience questions have
0:19:29 already been submitted
0:19:31 uh we all listen to the podcast dude we
0:19:34 count as audience
0:19:36 um
0:19:37 uh so you very you talk about wanting to
0:19:39 set at 99 and like doing uh something
0:19:41 and one of the questions that came in is
0:19:43 like hey where are the thin Bloods and
0:19:45 the cadiffs
0:19:47 um they don't fit into every Chronicle
0:19:49 but seeing how gahanna's coming uh uh
0:19:52 people curious how that's gonna fit in
0:19:54 or if you're planning on fitting that in
0:19:56 so right now
0:19:59 uh anarchs thin Bloods
0:20:02 um those communities are actually kind
0:20:04 of crushed uh between the conflict that
0:20:07 the camera on this about's happening
0:20:09 so
0:20:11 basically the way that kind of goes is
0:20:15 they're there I actually have some named
0:20:17 uh I I can't pull up Windows right now
0:20:19 what are we doing but uh but there are
0:20:22 thin Bloods
0:20:24 um however because those thin Bloods
0:20:26 exist outside of uh
0:20:29 Kindred Society for the most part you
0:20:32 don't really hear a ton about them but
0:20:34 uh I mean without like
0:20:37 spoiling too much there are things that
0:20:40 the arcs in the area are fighting for
0:20:43 there are reasons that younger Kindred
0:20:47 are kind of afraid of tramir and avoid
0:20:50 them uh the all of the elders that have
0:20:54 been portrayed thus far absolutely see
0:20:56 thin Bloods as a sign of Ghana some of
0:21:00 them are so old that they think the 13th
0:21:03 generation is a sign of Ghana oh
0:21:08 um but uh yeah no that's that's that's
0:21:10 definitely a thing and uh the thin
0:21:14 Bloods are supposed to kind of rise and
0:21:16 become more relevant as we get closer to
0:21:17 gehenna so I would expect that to kind
0:21:19 of come in more and more especially like
0:21:22 once Amara starts seeing more
0:21:23 screenshots Amaya rather Maya said
0:21:27 screaming I remember why I don't know
0:21:28 why I keep calling her Amara there's
0:21:31 someone named there's some character
0:21:32 named Amara from like
0:21:34 a vampire love years ago that just keeps
0:21:37 like popping into my head yeah
0:21:39 um
0:21:40 but uh we'll figure that out tomorrow
0:21:45 but uh yeah as as she kind of reveals
0:21:48 more as weathers yeah and what's going
0:21:50 on with him starts getting revealed more
0:21:52 you're gonna see a little more about
0:21:54 like the oppressed Kindred on the
0:21:57 outskirts of uh Society oh no miles
0:22:01 becomes Prince and suddenly we're like
0:22:03 [ __ ] the camera bro
0:22:06 I have to deal with the pores
0:22:12 um
0:22:12 so one of the things uh Erica you and I
0:22:14 I mean I think we all get to talk about
0:22:16 this but this one is a little bit more
0:22:18 just through circumstance tailored for
0:22:20 you and I um
0:22:22 how do we portray the different levels
0:22:24 of high Humanity versus low Humanity
0:22:26 like how
0:22:28 there's obviously there's like
0:22:30 some book standards and things and like
0:22:33 suggestions but like how do each of the
0:22:34 characters deal with Humanity
0:22:36 um obviously humanity is a major theme
0:22:38 of playing a vampire the Masquerade game
0:22:40 uh so how do we how do we deal with it
0:22:44 and you are you started low and dropped
0:22:47 lower I still started at six okay
0:22:50 um she was not a regular yeah she was
0:22:52 about average
0:22:54 um
0:22:56 and honestly the kind of the way I look
0:22:58 at
0:22:58 when is that
0:23:01 she's not
0:23:03 her her ultimate goal in
0:23:06 in who she is as a person is to protect
0:23:10 um
0:23:11 and
0:23:13 sometimes Humanity gets in the way of
0:23:15 truly protecting what needs protecting
0:23:19 um
0:23:20 so she
0:23:22 for her humanity is
0:23:25 something she aspires to but the greater
0:23:28 preservation to her is the things that
0:23:30 make you human
0:23:32 this was sort of I think implicit uh
0:23:35 when you were talking on screen when
0:23:37 when Neil and Wynn had their like
0:23:39 post-humanity Drop yeah post Sabbat
0:23:41 murder yeah talk
0:23:43 uh you had implied and that wind had
0:23:47 dropped yeah too hard before in my mind
0:23:49 way back up in my mind
0:23:52 um long before win ever saw screen time
0:23:55 she was probably in a very very bad
0:23:57 place
0:23:58 um
0:24:00 and I I imagine her dropping to about
0:24:02 Humanity three
0:24:03 and then
0:24:05 gradually finding things to
0:24:09 love feels like the wrong word but to
0:24:12 cherish and to want to not lose herself
0:24:16 completely to the desire to protect too
0:24:19 like if they don't want me around what
0:24:21 am I protecting them for you know how
0:24:23 will I be able to keep protecting them
0:24:24 if they won't let me near them
0:24:27 um and so that does come back to
0:24:31 um the things that she's lost and the
0:24:33 Dark Places she's been and
0:24:36 wanting to
0:24:39 not stop
0:24:42 not stop being human but not forget that
0:24:45 she's a monster
0:24:46 and just being comfortable that there's
0:24:48 going to be highs and lows with that
0:24:50 because the world is an ever-changing
0:24:52 place and her blood especially is one of
0:24:54 change
0:24:56 Rebecca why Britta did not have the same
0:24:59 like draw like you've maintained since
0:25:01 the beginning right oh I lost one I
0:25:04 started at seven and are Skirmish with
0:25:07 the setites dropped me to six that's
0:25:09 right but Bretta has held on to that
0:25:12 Sixth Sense uh it in particularly in the
0:25:16 face of somebody like Lex you
0:25:18 legitimately had Pendragon walk in and
0:25:20 be like Humanity's stupid losing kill
0:25:23 this person like
0:25:25 sort of uh no pretty much yeah we were
0:25:29 there
0:25:30 so like where do you want to talk about
0:25:33 Brit is like
0:25:35 you know walking that tightrope so in
0:25:38 that scene I started doing some Mental
0:25:40 Math uh pretty immediately as soon as
0:25:43 I remember uh within the mind of Brita
0:25:46 getting very anxious as soon as Lex
0:25:48 described that there was a mortal in the
0:25:50 car
0:25:52 um and I started doing that mental math
0:25:55 on how I could possibly keep her alive
0:25:57 because I just assumed that she was
0:25:59 there to die
0:26:01 um
0:26:01 which is part of why
0:26:03 I tried to take as little blood as
0:26:05 possible I figured that however much
0:26:07 blood I took Pendragon would take
0:26:09 as much or more so the only safe amount
0:26:12 that I could take would be one if I take
0:26:14 one he takes one she's alive if I take
0:26:17 two he takes two
0:26:19 she's not getting a hospital anytime
0:26:21 soon
0:26:22 and that kind of mental math
0:26:24 um
0:26:25 is common for Brita I think that
0:26:29 when she's trying to keep on a hold of
0:26:32 her Humanity
0:26:33 she doesn't have a memory of Being Human
0:26:36 and so it's all very
0:26:41 it's a strange combination of like
0:26:43 analytical and emotional how she tries
0:26:45 to keep hold of her Humanity she tries
0:26:47 to both feel through it and reason
0:26:50 through it and
0:26:53 it matters to her she's very protective
0:26:55 over the things that she
0:26:59 she's lost so much and like anything
0:27:01 that reminds her of herself she
0:27:03 desperately wants to keep hold of but
0:27:05 it's complicated
0:27:07 and I think that
0:27:10 she knows as well Pendragon other NPCs
0:27:16 keeping hold of that Humanity in this
0:27:19 Society is
0:27:20 kind of proving to be
0:27:25 painting a Target on yourself
0:27:27 and she's not willing to lose that
0:27:30 Target so she has to navigate that
0:27:33 Garrett Johnny like Johnny's the one who
0:27:37 is actually most closely tied to other
0:27:41 human beings like in his former life and
0:27:43 things like that have what where is his
0:27:46 like relationship with Humanity right
0:27:47 now
0:27:48 um I don't want my sheet in front of me
0:27:50 but I I think he's pretty much stayed
0:27:51 constant throughout the game I think
0:27:53 I've he dropped once when the thing when
0:27:55 the place caught fire
0:27:56 um
0:27:58 I think he's at five right that's right
0:28:00 okay yeah yeah cause he started a Lego
0:28:02 six he started at six he Dr yeah so he
0:28:04 must be at a five
0:28:06 um
0:28:07 and I I think that
0:28:09 um
0:28:11 Johnny is kind of
0:28:13 um he's kind of resigned himself to the
0:28:16 slow descent into low Humanity
0:28:19 um
0:28:19 we've talked about like the possible
0:28:21 paths for Johnny's Humanity of like
0:28:24 going down like a Delgado Road versus a
0:28:26 weathers Road versus a Pendragon Road
0:28:28 the different bruja examples I'd prefer
0:28:30 him to go down the weather's Road
0:28:32 um I don't think I see him going down
0:28:34 the Pendragon road because I I
0:28:37 personally would like to role play more
0:28:39 of like a hopeful kind of story
0:28:42 um so you know chances I get for the
0:28:44 character to really like see the fact
0:28:46 that his family is still around and that
0:28:48 he can you know he can kind of like be
0:28:53 he he can still be the father that
0:28:55 he re you know ran away from being
0:28:59 so I think there's a lot of chances for
0:29:00 him to go on a better road than you know
0:29:04 the you know either Delgado or weathers
0:29:08 right
0:29:09 um no Tim miles diabolarized someone
0:29:13 what how how's
0:29:18 it uh it's less than it was before I
0:29:20 diabetize somebody
0:29:22 um
0:29:23 but uh with Miles and Humanity it's
0:29:27 always been a gamble it's a resource
0:29:31 that has been gambled for him and for
0:29:33 the codery
0:29:34 for the things that we need to get done
0:29:37 to Keep Us Alive and safe and it's
0:29:39 always
0:29:40 knowing which act is going to push us
0:29:43 over that limit and
0:29:46 like miles has a lot of lines that he
0:29:49 draws for himself to keep his Humanity
0:29:52 higher because it's a very easy slope to
0:29:55 lose in the in the process of
0:29:59 not necessarily even pursuing power but
0:30:02 at this point pursuing power for a
0:30:04 reason a lot of times but miles is also
0:30:07 the character that just took a set at
0:30:08 its hand in a fit of peak I mean they
0:30:13 crossed the line
0:30:16 for himself yeah
0:30:21 part of it was messaging I mean you
0:30:24 gotta establish a brand I was gonna say
0:30:26 this is a branding issue yeah yeah so
0:30:28 like look he felt a little bad about it
0:30:30 but he got his arm back so like I don't
0:30:32 know what everybody's all concerned
0:30:33 about here
0:30:35 um good boy I see miles as this
0:30:38 character who uh
0:30:42 has Humanity because he has a quotery
0:30:45 right and then pass that Circle it's
0:30:48 just business yeah and were he to lose
0:30:52 that quotery everything would be just
0:30:55 business
0:30:57 and so like when it comes to the setting
0:30:59 no no he
0:31:00 he was out of line he got handled but if
0:31:05 like okay
0:31:07 but if but if like win yells at him he's
0:31:09 like come on just stop I'm just trying
0:31:11 to keep the group together God why are
0:31:13 you yelling at me it's a totally
0:31:15 different response but it's very much uh
0:31:19 um in line with how the character thinks
0:31:24 um he's kind of that he's kind of
0:31:25 callous in a way that he really only
0:31:27 sees his quotery as people
0:31:29 it's also kind of what makes them like
0:31:31 you know really interesting
0:31:33 um and it's fun because
0:31:36 uh I tend to see like npcc interacts
0:31:40 with
0:31:42 you can kind of see like which
0:31:44 characters he's like willing to
0:31:46 acknowledge as people and others for its
0:31:49 business like Elsa Linden that whole
0:31:52 Fiasco with Elsa Linden literally
0:31:55 happened because at first she's like
0:31:56 okay this is business what do you mean
0:31:58 it's a perfectly reasonable thing what
0:32:00 she's out of line this is stupid why are
0:32:01 her feelings involved and then when he
0:32:04 actually sat with her and was like oh my
0:32:05 God she's a person
0:32:07 um [ __ ] it just kind of changed their
0:32:09 entire relationship and that's just how
0:32:12 miles rolls it's pretty good I love it
0:32:14 and the other one major line that is
0:32:16 there is is I don't do harm to Mortals
0:32:20 if I can help it
0:32:21 it doesn't mean that I don't have a
0:32:24 short fuse for them though like when
0:32:26 they're pissing on your car yeah that
0:32:28 guy was very close to losing some stuff
0:32:31 I'm relatively sure that he suffered
0:32:34 after that I'm sure he did
0:32:36 that's why I never wanted him up one of
0:32:39 the weirdly scarier uses of presents was
0:32:41 like I'm gonna go lies of the crowd that
0:32:43 guy's about to get his ass beat by a
0:32:45 gang of anime folks listen I've wasted a
0:32:48 lot not wasted I I have spent a lot of
0:32:51 XP being very very pretty so
0:32:54 it's got to have its uses absolutely
0:32:57 as someone with a parents do yeah
0:33:03 um I so I have I think I had the most
0:33:07 fraught relationship with Humanity since
0:33:09 the game started wow you've been on a
0:33:10 roller coaster it started at an eight
0:33:12 yep meal was like an eight and
0:33:15 sustaining and sort of Erica like the
0:33:18 complete opposite of how you see wind I
0:33:19 see Neil as being eight like the whole
0:33:22 time I just never like I don't I never
0:33:25 really saw him dipping
0:33:27 um he was just based on who he was and
0:33:31 his lifestyle and the things that he did
0:33:33 in his choices uh and he has a pretty
0:33:36 high conscience like one of his highest
0:33:37 virtues is conscience yeah so like he's
0:33:40 just
0:33:41 like he feels bad a lot but he doesn't
0:33:44 like you know that that's so funny that
0:33:47 you have the highest you I think you're
0:33:48 probably the highest conscience in the
0:33:49 groove right yeah I have a four I don't
0:33:51 know
0:33:53 um
0:33:55 you know all the you know all the jokes
0:33:58 about how my courage sucks and I'm like
0:34:00 constantly scared it's because my
0:34:02 conscience and my self-control are
0:34:03 really high we're both forced all right
0:34:05 I have a three that makes sense I also
0:34:08 have a three two yeah miles
0:34:11 that [ __ ] tracks
0:34:13 five and self-control so like yeah
0:34:17 so I played Neil very high Humanity very
0:34:20 like in touch with other people's
0:34:21 emotions but very like which is not like
0:34:23 100 uh thing but the way that I see him
0:34:26 losing Humanity because I think it's a
0:34:27 little bit different for everybody right
0:34:28 yeah is that he starts to withdraw a
0:34:31 little bit more and starts to see so
0:34:34 Neil's what we've talked about is
0:34:35 derangement right like he he Hoards he
0:34:37 collects things and like to me the lower
0:34:40 his Humanity gets the more entitled to
0:34:42 those things he starts to feel yeah
0:34:44 where like you know oh like in my head I
0:34:47 don't ever came up on Mike but in my
0:34:49 head like
0:34:51 he owned the pawn shop
0:34:52 poor like people who are in a desperate
0:34:55 way would come into town like come in to
0:34:57 sell it him [ __ ] if he really likes
0:34:59 something he would keep it because like
0:35:01 you know that's him uh but then like if
0:35:04 they if they were just selling [ __ ]
0:35:06 all right fine and he would keep in the
0:35:08 store and sell it uh if it was like an
0:35:11 old lady selling her wedding ring
0:35:12 because she needed to pay for like her
0:35:14 husband's health insurance or whatever I
0:35:16 saw him in my head sneaking back into
0:35:18 their house and like putting it back
0:35:19 yeah
0:35:21 um and doing that kind of weird little
0:35:23 [ __ ] and then as his Humanity dropped
0:35:25 like there's a reason at the end of at
0:35:28 the end of season two
0:35:30 he was like Hey those people [ __ ]
0:35:32 took things from me and I'm going to go
0:35:34 terrorize this neighborhood take
0:35:36 everything back hurt them for taking
0:35:39 things from me like make sure they never
0:35:42 take from make sure they know like look
0:35:43 at all and he could in his head like uh
0:35:46 look at it like look at all the good
0:35:47 I've done for this neighborhood and this
0:35:49 is how they treat me yeah like which is
0:35:51 [ __ ] right like send them a message
0:35:54 but that's the thing is I was I started
0:35:57 as an eight I've only lost twice but
0:36:00 both those times were botches yep so
0:36:03 when we went after the setites I dropped
0:36:05 from an eight to a six but that somehow
0:36:07 also feels
0:36:09 like someone who has been an eight for
0:36:12 so long to then be encountered with
0:36:14 these situations it feels like it should
0:36:16 be a more dramatic loss yeah like like
0:36:18 he's gonna feel it deeper than there are
0:36:20 the yeah there are those like you know
0:36:22 there are the hints and stuff of like
0:36:24 hey he went on like adventures with
0:36:25 asomites Once yeah but like other than
0:36:28 hanging out with the children of Hakeem
0:36:29 this is the first like recent nights
0:36:31 this is the first time he's actually
0:36:33 gone in like done stuff does Neil do
0:36:36 like a little weird guy does Neil do the
0:36:38 thing where he like feels bad for
0:36:41 objects like if someone's trading in
0:36:43 like something that's clearly been
0:36:44 cherished he feels bad for it or like
0:36:47 person
0:36:49 so not the person he doesn't feel bad
0:36:51 for the person feels bad for the like
0:36:52 like it's a dog being dropped off at the
0:36:54 shelter sort of he sees he sees value in
0:36:57 objects he sees the inherent value in
0:37:00 objects
0:37:01 um and they're all emotional connections
0:37:03 so like in some ways yes but in some
0:37:06 ways no because like yes a cherished
0:37:08 ring
0:37:09 for whatever reason might be the same as
0:37:12 like hey I have this book of receipts
0:37:14 from 1976 that I just kept for no reason
0:37:16 right and like they have the same
0:37:18 emotional value right so like yes and
0:37:22 also no which like so two things really
0:37:25 quick
0:37:26 um one I love the idea of a book of
0:37:28 receipts from 1976 because you can't see
0:37:30 any of the ink on any of those receipts
0:37:32 anymore it's literally just like a fully
0:37:35 of just Korea crinkly nasty receipt
0:37:38 paper with nothing on it
0:37:40 um and then two I I I think kneel's
0:37:45 Humanity
0:37:46 is probably one of the best indications
0:37:48 of the setting
0:37:51 in that the camarilla is this
0:37:55 non-changing entity right like it is the
0:37:59 it is this representation of the old
0:38:00 world of the power of Elders
0:38:04 and I feel like your Humanity has almost
0:38:07 kind of sold the idea that the that
0:38:11 1999 is a a weird era of flux and things
0:38:15 are changing and rapidly and it's
0:38:18 scaring a lot of people in the camaria
0:38:21 and in the world of darkness in general
0:38:23 and someone like Neil who for the past
0:38:27 however many decades has
0:38:30 not really changed
0:38:32 all of a sudden this man of a few months
0:38:34 things are getting really out of hand
0:38:36 you're like you're like the weirdly the
0:38:38 canary and like the [ __ ] you know
0:38:40 yeah in the coal mine for the camarilla
0:38:44 okay for the cotery yeah
0:38:46 uh
0:38:48 uh so sort of transitioning from that a
0:38:50 little bit uh you know personally the
0:38:52 the the massive loss of humanity was a
0:38:55 uh was a curveball and I had to sort of
0:38:56 think about right how to play that Lex
0:38:59 uh one of the questions we got was
0:39:01 um you know we've talked about your prep
0:39:03 and the world and and all that kind of
0:39:05 stuff what uh were there any like big
0:39:08 curves that the story took that you did
0:39:10 not like any things that we threw at you
0:39:12 or like ways that the story ended up
0:39:14 turning were that took you off guard or
0:39:18 you were like oh this is not what I
0:39:19 thought was gonna happen
0:39:21 I
0:39:22 Vito Zantos are being embraced yeah yeah
0:39:26 that was a big surprise that was
0:39:28 probably the the big one
0:39:31 um so I expected there to be some
0:39:35 conflict between you know the PCS when
0:39:39 Beretta's programming kind of came into
0:39:42 play uh
0:39:45 and you know of course she
0:39:48 uh has this this program in her to take
0:39:51 out vicissitude oriented like
0:39:54 threats so she gets activated and she
0:39:57 goes and she makes her move now I
0:39:59 expected a bit more back and forth but
0:40:02 she just pastes him you got arrested
0:40:05 longing you know so he's just he's just
0:40:08 done I like that that you expected back
0:40:10 and forth and in the part one of this q
0:40:12 a you specifically called out win and
0:40:14 Brita as being weirdly surprised that
0:40:17 they one shot pay someone every time so
0:40:19 the fact that you were like but she one
0:40:20 shot pasted the guy I didn't expect that
0:40:22 well here's so Vita Vito's a powerful
0:40:25 character right like
0:40:27 apparently not like that dude is some
0:40:30 serious business and she's just like nah
0:40:32 and so he gets rocked and
0:40:37 you know the Quarry that's there is
0:40:39 reacting to Brita
0:40:41 so I was like okay so Vito is well he's
0:40:45 done
0:40:46 and I was just kind of thinking in my
0:40:49 head while that scene was going
0:40:52 how it would kind of like
0:40:54 shift the plot around and let other
0:40:57 characters basically like fill in for
0:40:59 certain rules that Vito has in the
0:41:02 overall story to kinda
0:41:04 obviously the you know the course has
0:41:06 been changed now but like you know
0:41:08 deciding kind of like how to convey that
0:41:11 and uh then Johnny Embraces Vito
0:41:16 and I was like to me it was kind of like
0:41:20 well
0:41:21 this is interesting because some a few
0:41:23 things have changed one obviously and
0:41:27 veto is a vampire and that has you know
0:41:29 its own consequences but also
0:41:32 Johnny just helped this like minion of
0:41:36 the Sabbat and
0:41:39 that could blow up pretty bad in his
0:41:41 face and I feel like it has been it's
0:41:43 been coming up yeah for sure yeah and
0:41:47 like it got to a point where like
0:41:49 Johnny's like [ __ ] you I don't work with
0:41:50 a spot and and like and like I think it
0:41:53 was like Renwick yeah is like yeah what
0:41:55 about these things and John's like well
0:41:56 [ __ ] you I have no answer for any of
0:41:59 that it all happened circumstantial uh
0:42:02 yes like just get out of my face with
0:42:05 those exact details yeah Amanda like
0:42:08 Renwick I I haven't really haven't
0:42:10 gotten as much of him but I know more is
0:42:12 coming
0:42:14 yeah run Works renwick's fun I actually
0:42:17 out of out of the NPCs of the game I
0:42:20 would actually say while
0:42:23 I mean obviously misguided uh Renwick is
0:42:27 one of the like more good-hearted
0:42:29 characters yeah
0:42:31 um obviously to me I have like a Bend
0:42:34 towards Justice yeah exactly uh and uh
0:42:38 he's actually a lot like Weathers in
0:42:40 that way which kind of causes their
0:42:43 potential relationship to be really
0:42:45 complicated he feels like he's just like
0:42:48 working like us but with the opposite
0:42:50 set of information yeah because like so
0:42:53 the point of weathers right is that
0:42:56 the idea is before the quarter it came
0:42:58 around
0:42:59 uh weathers was the protagonist he was
0:43:02 the good guy he was the guy that was
0:43:04 trying to make things right and look out
0:43:05 for people when things would go bad and
0:43:08 his story is that he was the one good
0:43:11 guy in a crooked City and at the end of
0:43:14 it he lost and he ended up in this this
0:43:18 position where he was just being used as
0:43:20 like either a weapon of the prince or
0:43:22 like you know a an unpopular member of
0:43:25 his own Clan despite like clearly being
0:43:28 the most talented and capable member of
0:43:30 them
0:43:31 um and so he's like so a lot of season
0:43:34 one was this kind of quiet like passing
0:43:39 of the torch so like weathers obviously
0:43:41 it was kind of handing things off to you
0:43:42 guys and for Renwick
0:43:45 kind of like
0:43:47 he is receiving his sires torch and is
0:43:52 dealing with the fact that now that it's
0:43:54 in his hands and he can see the truth
0:43:56 it's not what he thought it was
0:43:59 and it's going to be a tough time for
0:44:02 him I think yeah can I just say that
0:44:04 another moment that seemed to catch you
0:44:06 like that seemed to be like oh [ __ ] I
0:44:08 don't know what I need to do now when
0:44:10 none of us really did well on the roll
0:44:12 to wake up in the hotel in New York
0:44:16 you're like wait all of you failed like
0:44:18 all of you failed this oh [ __ ] to be
0:44:21 honest all right so uh that was less bad
0:44:25 uh for the metaplot if you will right uh
0:44:29 but it was funny because it was kind of
0:44:31 like all right so this is the plan that
0:44:32 the bad guy's gonna use and they're
0:44:33 gonna do this thing and you know there's
0:44:37 five of you so they're gonna have to
0:44:38 figure [ __ ] out when that doesn't go
0:44:40 exactly according to playing all right
0:44:41 here we go
0:44:43 divide You by ear
0:44:46 oh man I felt so bad about you my ears
0:44:50 so the like two days after jubayer died
0:44:54 like at the table and obviously you know
0:44:56 the the recording of it wasn't out yet
0:44:58 uh a few friends who were like hey can I
0:45:02 just say I think we mentioned this
0:45:04 importantly yeah yeah she did so good
0:45:06 she's so great and I love him and he's
0:45:08 precious and don't you hurt him yeah I
0:45:11 was like oh no well we didn't mention do
0:45:12 you want to do uh your brother's
0:45:15 favorite character Tim
0:45:16 oh days after or something yeah had been
0:45:20 recorded yeah so my brother thought uh I
0:45:23 had named a character after him which
0:45:25 may have happened because I named him
0:45:26 just blindly
0:45:28 um subconsciously yeah yeah Mark's a
0:45:30 good name this happens to me a lot so
0:45:33 good character uh he said my brother's
0:45:34 like he's sassy I love him
0:45:37 um Marcus was good that sounds great
0:45:39 yeah and he came down from where he is
0:45:42 in out in Ohio and he's talking to me
0:45:44 and Lex and like just looks at me and
0:45:46 he's like what do we do what do I say
0:45:50 yeah because because he's looking at me
0:45:53 and he's like man I just love that NPC
0:45:55 so much he's my favorite and I just
0:45:57 don't know what I would do if he died
0:45:58 and I'm like and I look at Tim and like
0:46:00 damn what are we doing you gotta tell
0:46:02 him I'm not telling him you gotta tell
0:46:04 him uh so we opted to neither of us tell
0:46:07 him
0:46:08 oh well handled boys
0:46:11 like something about your [ __ ]
0:46:13 catches up with you when you like meet
0:46:14 like you know people who are been
0:46:16 listening and like they're like oh this
0:46:17 is great and you're like oh [ __ ] I did
0:46:21 some dirty [ __ ]
0:46:23 I feel okay with the people at the table
0:46:25 because you know they deserve this
0:46:27 yeah our audience doesn't they've
0:46:30 consented to this the most divisive so
0:46:32 far has definitely been pen dragon by a
0:46:34 lot Yeah by a whole lot
0:46:37 um it seems pretty unified to me that oh
0:46:40 this is a bad guy but he [ __ ] no no
0:46:42 that is not no no no that is largely
0:46:46 what women have responded with a lot of
0:46:50 the guys who have talked to me are like
0:46:52 yo this guy is just I don't know he's
0:46:54 [ __ ] smarmy and he makes me
0:46:55 uncomfortable and I just hope he dies I
0:46:58 hope someone kills him I I do not like
0:47:00 this dude he's up to something and he's
0:47:04 just stay away from Brita I want to see
0:47:06 a raven Pendragon fight was that I want
0:47:08 to see a raven pen dragon fight I have
0:47:10 actually envisioned how that goes yeah
0:47:12 yeah interesting yeah I don't want to
0:47:14 know what you've envisioned what happens
0:47:16 yeah
0:47:17 there's there's a few there's a few like
0:47:20 Titanic characters who if they thought
0:47:24 it would be very very interesting
0:47:26 um
0:47:27 I've envisioned how it would go if when
0:47:30 catches what pendragon's doing to Brita
0:47:33 and it just looks like wind getting
0:47:34 wiped across the floor but
0:47:38 yeah Raven has so all right straight up
0:47:41 yeah well Raven's got flesh of marble
0:47:43 Roman Pendragon is vastly more dangerous
0:47:45 in a fight than Raven however
0:47:49 Raven is a like professional punching
0:47:53 bag like come at her with whatever she
0:47:56 will make it out and that's kind of how
0:47:58 at least I envisioned obviously like you
0:48:01 know this who knows what will actually
0:48:03 happen yeah but uh yeah the Gangrel
0:48:05 way is to wait until the bruja Burns
0:48:07 himself out of blood and then so that's
0:48:10 like the problem right
0:48:12 um by the time he's out of blood the
0:48:14 neighborhood is gone and and so you
0:48:17 can't do that uh but what you can do
0:48:20 is shattered fog and freaking leave and
0:48:26 just throw away yeah be out
0:48:28 that also because like her style I mean
0:48:31 that's that's and that's not a guarantee
0:48:33 that's the best move though right in
0:48:35 most vampire fights the best move is
0:48:37 just get the [ __ ] out yeah absolutely if
0:48:39 you don't have surprise especially if
0:48:40 it's a Duncan and there's everything we
0:48:43 have not set the terms it's been bad and
0:48:45 every time when we like jump somebody
0:48:46 it's been real good like it's so in
0:48:48 exactly and in my mind uh Raven has to
0:48:51 do a couple of things to make it out
0:48:53 yeah one she has to drawing of the Beast
0:48:55 because if he's in control of his
0:48:57 actions he will crush her with presents
0:48:59 and it will be not good
0:49:02 um to like he'll paralyze her presence
0:49:03 and that's it she's stuck there until
0:49:05 she dies which is not a long wait yeah
0:49:07 um but if she draws out the Beast and he
0:49:10 just goes on a blind Rampage
0:49:12 gorilla mad yeah she can just get out
0:49:15 just go and Raven is
0:49:20 a very clever Survivor and
0:49:23 now unfortunately if it's PCS and Raven
0:49:28 and then she's drawing uses drawing out
0:49:30 the beast on the dragon and she gets
0:49:32 away she still leaves
0:49:35 and just kind of like hey if you guys
0:49:37 are good as good as you guys think you
0:49:39 are you'll you'll leave too
0:49:41 oh man we are not that smart
0:49:45 oh God I would try to get him out of
0:49:47 frenzy I know stop it
0:49:52 um like a moth to Flame
0:49:54 but anyways moving on see there there it
0:50:00 is it's very divisive uh so
0:50:05 uh Garrett one of the questions that
0:50:07 came in uh specifically for you
0:50:09 um you've sort of already answered which
0:50:11 was hey is there anything that would
0:50:12 make you cut ties with the camarilla do
0:50:14 you regret being here you answered that
0:50:16 yeah so 100 yeah I mean honestly
0:50:18 Johnny's a Harris breath away from
0:50:20 leaving the camarilla the oh I think the
0:50:22 only literally the only thing keeping
0:50:25 him in the camarilla is named Miles yeah
0:50:27 that's it
0:50:29 um but so that actually directly leads
0:50:31 into the other question that came in for
0:50:33 you which um I I don't know because we
0:50:36 haven't fully done these on screen so I
0:50:37 don't know if we want to save these for
0:50:38 actually on screen sure the flex you can
0:50:40 make a call on that too but like how did
0:50:42 Johnny originally get involved with
0:50:43 Miles and Company like how did you
0:50:45 become a part of the cutlery how did
0:50:48 well
0:50:50 um the the character of Johnny
0:50:54 um his his story starts on the road
0:50:58 um when he got into a fight at a at a
0:51:01 truck stop
0:51:02 um trying to trying to stick up for some
0:51:05 Mortals who were getting bullied by the
0:51:07 spot
0:51:08 um and that's not a fight that you win
0:51:10 um and he got shovelheaded which for
0:51:12 people I guess who don't know um the the
0:51:14 when the Sabbat recruit people
0:51:17 they basically Mass Embrace Mortals uh
0:51:21 throw them in a mass grave uh cover them
0:51:23 over with dirt and uh let them frenzy
0:51:27 Underground
0:51:28 and whoever
0:51:30 survives basically digging their way out
0:51:33 and feeding off their Brethren
0:51:36 um get become honorary Sabbat members
0:51:39 now there's a little bit more to it than
0:51:41 that but that's the basic gist
0:51:43 um and so he he got um embraced in in
0:51:46 kind of a traumatic way like that
0:51:49 survived but man also after getting out
0:51:53 of the ground managed to slip the Sabbat
0:51:57 um I figured he was in such a state that
0:51:59 you know not every Shovelhead gets gets
0:52:02 corralled like they should some of them
0:52:03 actually do manage to get away
0:52:06 um at which point he made his way back
0:52:09 to Connecticut and
0:52:11 um
0:52:12 was eventually uh found and picked up by
0:52:17 weathers
0:52:19 um weathers managed to
0:52:21 um Corral the uh the young lick
0:52:25 explain what had happened to him and
0:52:27 help him kind of actually fit into a
0:52:29 society
0:52:30 and
0:52:32 um Johnny desperately needed purpose
0:52:34 um because he all he wanted to do was go
0:52:36 out and and look after his family
0:52:39 um but that's not a good idea because a
0:52:41 vampire can't necessarily do good things
0:52:43 for uh for a mortal family
0:52:45 so um
0:52:48 weathers helped him with the actual
0:52:50 influence he would need to make his
0:52:51 family be okay and in response and and
0:52:54 in payment
0:52:56 um basically put Johnny to work as a
0:52:58 bully boy
0:52:59 um miles who is an up-and-coming uh
0:53:03 Venture in the city was Bay I imagine it
0:53:06 was basically head hunting for talent
0:53:10 um that sounds about right and seeing
0:53:12 that weathers had this talented young
0:53:14 bruja who was
0:53:16 not under the thumb of Shaw
0:53:19 um who is you know uh pretty headstrong
0:53:22 but
0:53:23 it was mostly a good guy
0:53:26 um the two of them just kind of got
0:53:28 along because they were they were
0:53:30 basically up and coming at the same time
0:53:32 and
0:53:34 I I think for Johnny it wasn't really it
0:53:36 was just kind of a foregone conclusion
0:53:38 of oh I'm working for the camarilla now
0:53:40 I guess this is the guy I'm working for
0:53:43 um that is correct and yeah and and then
0:53:47 basically became work friends right I
0:53:52 know him from work yeah yeah exactly
0:53:55 um nice
0:53:56 yeah
0:53:57 uh
0:53:58 so Tim uh sort of piggybacking off of
0:54:02 that one of the questions that came in
0:54:03 for you uh was
0:54:04 um which code to remember does miles
0:54:07 feel the like the closest to uh or does
0:54:10 he kind of keep them all sort of
0:54:12 mutually at some form of arm's length
0:54:22 um
0:54:22 oh man I mean especially over these last
0:54:25 two seasons
0:54:26 um it's kind of been over the place most
0:54:29 of the time it is Johnny
0:54:31 um I think a lot of the time not too
0:54:33 long after especially during her
0:54:34 accounting was Brita
0:54:36 um because she was closer to how he
0:54:38 wasn't a vampire in a lot of ways
0:54:42 um
0:54:43 yeah I'm glad that we get to talk now
0:54:45 that Daddy said oh my God [ __ ] him
0:54:54 no because we couldn't really like talk
0:54:57 about anything that you were doing
0:55:00 very much on purpose that's correct oh
0:55:04 uh the one he doesn't is is Neil because
0:55:08 he's just they're just really very
0:55:10 different people very different people
0:55:12 uh Neil is very good at the things that
0:55:15 he has been able to do he's very good at
0:55:17 information gathering and he's uh
0:55:19 influential with the number of forces in
0:55:21 the domain that miles does not get along
0:55:23 with
0:55:24 um so that was the pickup uh win as
0:55:27 discussed towards the end of the season
0:55:29 is another hitter that he found
0:55:32 um
0:55:33 and just found that she generally liked
0:55:38 her on life
0:55:39 pretty fine as much as miles did like
0:55:41 the biggest difference between Johnny
0:55:43 and miles a lot of ways is Johnny's not
0:55:45 happy with on life
0:55:47 straight up yeah
0:55:49 um and and miles is uh found a lot more
0:55:53 purpose here than he ever did being
0:55:55 immortal
0:55:57 um all right uh so that actually answers
0:56:00 uh that there was another uh sort of
0:56:03 version of that question you kind of
0:56:05 just mentioned a little bit
0:56:07 um which was you know what were your
0:56:08 first impressions of each member of the
0:56:09 codery when you first saw them right
0:56:11 um
0:56:12 which you had talked about like ah okay
0:56:15 like that one like that one oh this
0:56:17 one's like me that guy's weird but he
0:56:18 like talks to people I don't want to
0:56:20 talk to what yes
0:56:22 um but the other last question uh which
0:56:25 I very much deliberately word for word
0:56:27 put down uh how much of a [ __ ] boy was
0:56:30 Miles pre-embrace
0:56:33 yes
0:56:36 I had thought about contemplating this
0:56:39 question previously and I decided not to
0:56:42 um
0:56:44 uh I would imagine super [ __ ] boy he was
0:56:48 kind of a [ __ ] boy man come on did he
0:56:50 [ __ ] I mean yeah
0:56:57 like if fuckboy was one of the skills
0:56:59 he'd probably be like a four well he
0:57:02 wasn't a producer in the 90s producer in
0:57:04 the 80s oh God that makes it worse yeah
0:57:06 80s cocaine fueled [ __ ] boy like
0:57:09 straight up
0:57:10 um I think that at that time I was
0:57:13 trying to find gems and make like during
0:57:16 the 80s when he was an actual mortal
0:57:17 producer and like trying to uplift
0:57:19 people that were good at their things
0:57:21 but that probably also means that if he
0:57:24 didn't really see them with Talent he
0:57:27 probably took advantage of them
0:57:30 yeah I mean that has changed and beat
0:57:33 similar when you became a music producer
0:57:35 vampire too that's how you I mean you
0:57:38 literally feed by luring people back to
0:57:40 your house on Promises of like a record
0:57:42 deal right fighting
0:57:44 it's not a lure what I listen to their
0:57:48 mixtapes I do the garbage but that's
0:57:51 fine but I fulfilled my end of the
0:57:54 bargain uh
0:57:57 Erica
0:57:58 um to to jump off the the the the
0:58:02 fuckboy questions uh one of the ones
0:58:04 that came in for you was like hey man do
0:58:06 you actually know how to take a bath or
0:58:08 like is that it was it just a shower
0:58:10 it's canonical that she knows how to
0:58:12 take a bet she did it in season one she
0:58:15 showered in season one after the Weeping
0:58:18 there I look how offended you are yeah
0:58:20 she's like I know how I've just gotten
0:58:23 into so many twitters
0:58:31 [Laughter]
0:58:35 she doesn't see a whole lot of need for
0:58:38 it she
0:58:40 if if she's got something like obviously
0:58:42 dirty she'll clean it but she doesn't
0:58:44 sweat if she bleeds she'll wash it uh
0:58:47 but
0:58:48 you know or if she gets weeping bear
0:58:50 viscera on her obviously that's gonna
0:58:52 come off so that's actually something
0:58:54 related speaking of weeping Bearer uh
0:58:56 what is the discipline that I think I
0:58:59 know the answer but like what is the
0:59:00 discipline that freaks win out the most
0:59:03 I can see I can see you going a couple
0:59:06 different ways with this
0:59:08 but I think it's changed over the years
0:59:13 um
0:59:13 it definitely started with protein
0:59:15 because that makes sense she manifested
0:59:18 claws like immediately after the embrace
0:59:20 and that was such a traumatic moment for
0:59:22 her that she
0:59:24 didn't get over that for a long time and
0:59:26 I think it was learning how to meld with
0:59:30 the Earth that gave her some peace with
0:59:32 it
0:59:34 um
0:59:35 she has seen what vicissitude can do
0:59:39 um
0:59:39 I don't know that she has the context to
0:59:43 know that it's a discipline versus a
0:59:45 disease no so I don't know if that
0:59:48 counts
0:59:49 um but she has seen
0:59:51 her emotional support milk with his rib
0:59:53 cage turned inside out and so yeah that
0:59:55 did a
0:59:56 yeah
0:59:57 forcefully turned into a grotesque yeah
0:59:59 she was also fortunately turned into a
1:00:01 grotesque monster
1:00:03 um but she just kind of felt like the
1:00:04 outside matched the inside oh boy um oh
1:00:08 no
1:00:09 um
1:00:10 but yeah um honestly presence scares her
1:00:16 um yeah presence and dominate frighten
1:00:19 her because her whole thing as a gang
1:00:21 girl is having her and the thing that
1:00:23 has kept her going is her own free will
1:00:25 and agency
1:00:26 and that being taken away like even
1:00:29 demonation that's that's scary [ __ ] but
1:00:32 ultimately it's just changing the way I
1:00:35 react to things my perception of things
1:00:37 but I still get to react the way I want
1:00:39 to to the stimulus
1:00:42 um
1:00:43 but yeah I think anything that strips
1:00:45 her ability to
1:00:48 to guide her own sales is terrifying for
1:00:52 her
1:00:54 um and then sort of the last uh part of
1:00:57 the question for you there Erica
1:00:58 um real quick like
1:01:01 if she had not been embraced like if she
1:01:03 had not walked into the woods that day
1:01:04 like where do you think she would like
1:01:06 where would her life have fallen out as
1:01:08 a human being
1:01:09 uh I think she would have been a single
1:01:11 mom for most of her life probably a
1:01:12 series of kids with series of dads
1:01:15 um
1:01:16 probably would have stayed very tight
1:01:17 with her parents probably would have
1:01:20 inherited her dad's boxing gym and the
1:01:23 bar
1:01:24 uh
1:01:26 she may have like found work as a
1:01:28 bouncer she may have
1:01:30 uh gone to continued going to college
1:01:33 and become a social worker she would
1:01:35 have done something that would have
1:01:37 allowed her to still like protect those
1:01:39 that needed protecting yeah
1:01:41 cool
1:01:44 um the question came in for me that was
1:01:45 uh if Neil could change one thing he has
1:01:47 or hasn't done what would it be
1:01:50 um and I thought about that a lot like a
1:01:51 lot of things but like on screen
1:01:53 specifically uh is one of the biggest
1:01:55 ones and it was not saving those kids
1:01:57 yep not acting and not going in or like
1:02:01 interfering even though it would have
1:02:03 [ __ ] the mission up
1:02:05 um which and like the audience kind of
1:02:07 saw a lot of his thought process like
1:02:08 play out on screen after that where he
1:02:10 was like wrestling with that
1:02:12 um but that is probably like the biggest
1:02:14 thing he would like at this point so
1:02:15 like we talked about Humanity it dropped
1:02:17 down to a four yeah uh between Seasons I
1:02:19 have bought it back up to a five after
1:02:21 going and rescuing Brita and fester
1:02:24 rescuing that's what happened that's
1:02:26 what happens being rescued maybe that's
1:02:29 what happened
1:02:31 no no no offense to anyone but it was
1:02:34 faster than two of you guys yeah that's
1:02:36 why that's why we drank what for
1:02:39 Professor saves the day I'm a hero and
1:02:40 everything's great uh but like so I
1:02:44 bought it back up to five
1:02:46 um after like the talk with win and
1:02:47 Enrique so it's a fight it's still not
1:02:49 nearly what like original Neil was but
1:02:51 that is giving him enough sort of like
1:02:55 in touch with this to like really that's
1:02:58 the moment he would change is and
1:03:00 honestly to be totally honest as a
1:03:02 player that is a moment I might think
1:03:03 about changing um I stick to the plan
1:03:05 like meal is Neil is a very indecisive
1:03:07 individual he like freaks out and has
1:03:09 anxiety
1:03:10 um but when was uh when and Erica also
1:03:14 are not convinced that the right choice
1:03:16 was made there yeah exactly which is I
1:03:18 mean is really good story but like that
1:03:21 is a that is a mistake he makes that is
1:03:23 a mistake he would change I had been
1:03:24 planning in my head like this whole
1:03:27 scene was formed in my head of how I was
1:03:30 gonna go back and very emotionally
1:03:33 apologize to you guys I know that I wish
1:03:35 that I hadn't like made the suggestion
1:03:37 that I'd made uh and then because Brett
1:03:40 kept her Humanity she's guilty about it
1:03:42 and then I disappeared so I didn't get
1:03:44 to do that
1:03:45 we didn't go right back so
1:03:49 um that would have been a hell of a
1:03:50 [ __ ] fight so yeah so the last time
1:03:53 that Britta saw Neil was right after win
1:03:56 face ripped
1:03:57 um and then she was snatched and he
1:04:00 disappeared yeah
1:04:02 um Rebecca uh speaking of uh your
1:04:06 choices and stuff what was and your lack
1:04:08 of choices uh what is uh what was your
1:04:12 favorite lose control moment uh and it's
1:04:16 a twofold question because they wanted
1:04:17 to know both like what is your what is
1:04:19 the moment that stands out to you where
1:04:21 you just Toreador tranced out like
1:04:23 what's your favorite one of those uh and
1:04:26 then what is a moment that stands out to
1:04:28 you when you went full tell mahera
1:04:30 Manchurian Candidate
1:04:32 ah allegedly allegedly
1:04:37 oh this is this is hard I love these
1:04:39 moments um I I adore them I find them to
1:04:42 be like really building for character
1:04:44 both categories
1:04:46 um
1:04:47 I'm gonna have to give it to the end of
1:04:51 season two
1:04:53 um
1:04:54 the concept of walking into a room and
1:04:57 seeing the guy that ate your parents uh
1:05:00 as well as someone that you can't quite
1:05:04 place but says something extraordinarily
1:05:06 familiar
1:05:08 um good for you yeah I get cagey every
1:05:11 time I hear any one of you guys say that
1:05:13 I use it in regular conversation the
1:05:15 other day yeah listen it's it's
1:05:18 programmed in all right
1:05:20 we know
1:05:22 that that moment of um Lex narrating
1:05:26 not just sitting but saying nicely
1:05:28 pulling the chair in
1:05:30 um that that's that's my favorite Tomah
1:05:33 tomahira moment uh for sure
1:05:36 and then Bretta the question is for
1:05:39 brita's um Toyota flaw kicking it yeah
1:05:41 when you're talking about what's what's
1:05:43 one of your favorite like Toreador flaw
1:05:45 like failure moments
1:05:48 I enjoy them so much it's actually like
1:05:51 a temptation as a player not to spend
1:05:53 willpower for them because I like I like
1:05:55 I like losing it yeah
1:05:57 um
1:05:59 you know my favorite was when you were
1:06:01 staring through the van window at lucida
1:06:04 I mean Lucy she's so pretty I just would
1:06:08 say her corset was also on that list I
1:06:11 mean maybe not actually a failure but
1:06:12 are there any moments to stick out in
1:06:13 your mind where you really appreciate
1:06:15 the fact that Lex went out of his way to
1:06:17 make you test against something yeah
1:06:19 that's a good one I didn't literally
1:06:21 there's no I I can't name a time where
1:06:23 Lex is like hey self enroll this that I
1:06:25 was like oh no I don't want to I think
1:06:28 half the time you prompted him you're
1:06:30 like how pretty is it well okay yeah
1:06:33 that's that's actual super legit Point
1:06:35 literally just the rolling series of
1:06:38 checks walking through pendragon's
1:06:39 [ __ ] like toriador trap house I think
1:06:42 it's a tie between um the cage yeah I
1:06:46 think it's a tie between lucida because
1:06:47 that what like I I remember distinctly
1:06:51 that I had been thinking about the
1:06:53 character
1:06:54 um and
1:06:56 I had realized I had never said on
1:06:58 screen that Bretta was bisexual I got
1:07:00 kind of sad about it because I was like
1:07:02 oh that should be that should be
1:07:04 represented I um I I don't really like
1:07:06 when something like that isn't said and
1:07:08 just kind of said out of character and
1:07:10 then I remembered that I like drooled
1:07:11 over lucida for like 30 minutes
1:07:14 um so I don't know that's like I I took
1:07:17 that forwards but then ah Garrett
1:07:19 Garrett you had this commentary during
1:07:21 um
1:07:21 the Pendragon series of his house
1:07:24 Roofing me
1:07:26 you put it much more elegantly where you
1:07:29 were talking about just yeah like how
1:07:32 much of a trap that is and how that
1:07:34 literally
1:07:35 yeah so so it's tied between those two I
1:07:40 have to give out I have to give it
1:07:41 really [ __ ] good yeah
1:07:44 um I think my favorite I don't think you
1:07:47 actually rolled but you like just chose
1:07:50 to RP it was at the Dunkin Donuts
1:07:55 bisexual diffusion intensifying yeah
1:07:57 Okay and britto's like
1:08:01 the other black hand I like it
1:08:04 I like it a lot then what's the word the
1:08:07 word for that scarehouse how do you
1:08:10 pronounce that
1:08:11 I'm scraus
1:08:16 yeah straight up it was like oh my God
1:08:18 is he about to come across the street
1:08:20 what should we do I need you to know
1:08:23 that when really wanted to say something
1:08:24 there and I'm not letting her guys
1:08:26 you're gonna have to leave me behind him
1:08:27 yeah
1:08:32 um Doug
1:08:34 [Laughter]
1:08:37 Otto is definitely I mean he's he's so
1:08:40 cool I I would have named him as one of
1:08:42 my favorite NPCs last q a except that we
1:08:44 haven't gotten as much interaction with
1:08:45 him but just goth Cowboy vampire all of
1:08:49 these Aesthetics are perfect Aesthetics
1:08:51 he's so goddamn cool I got a quick
1:08:55 question before we move on here all
1:08:56 right everyone needs to know since we
1:08:58 talked about lucido um how is the
1:09:00 midnight blue Ferrari doing does
1:09:03 everyone need to know everyone needs to
1:09:05 know
1:09:06 I have some bad news right so
1:09:12 lucida is a world-class assassin however
1:09:17 she is also really cocky
1:09:20 and we'll just leave a mess if the
1:09:24 situation calls for it and I'm gonna
1:09:26 pull back the current a little bit right
1:09:27 so ever since Miami uh
1:09:32 right along this massive Crusade that
1:09:34 the Sabbat is doing
1:09:36 um there has been a crew of La Sombra
1:09:38 who are gathered together uh one of
1:09:40 which was a character who was once
1:09:43 called Archbishop Polonia but is now
1:09:45 called Cardinal Polonia and they've been
1:09:47 kind of you know gathered and protected
1:09:49 by a black spiral dancer Kinfolk La
1:09:53 Sombra by the name of tally the Hound I
1:09:56 hate all of them Charlie's been running
1:09:57 security
1:09:59 up and down well John Peterson
1:10:03 hired lucida to eliminate these La
1:10:07 Sombra
1:10:08 and she has been traveling uh the East
1:10:10 Coast
1:10:11 assassinating Osama leadership
1:10:16 um however
1:10:19 lucida is not a spy movie star she's an
1:10:24 action movie star oh no and cars do not
1:10:27 make it to the end of action movies
1:10:31 uh so it's a trade for our for the
1:10:34 knives we took you know okay audience I
1:10:36 need you all to pour one out for the
1:10:37 midnight blue
1:10:38 so yeah
1:10:41 no no so like I I fully played I don't
1:10:44 know if I'm gonna remember to do it or
1:10:45 not but at some point obviously lucida
1:10:47 comes back because that story actually
1:10:48 concludes in Hartford
1:10:50 um
1:10:51 I do plan to have Lucy to come by and be
1:10:54 like what what car just like just not
1:10:57 remember she just goes through so many
1:11:00 then she throws a ceramic shotgun of her
1:11:03 shoulders
1:11:04 Johnny's like I like her style well she
1:11:08 seems really cool yeah like Johnny
1:11:10 tossing the shotgun was like a Prelude
1:11:13 I got the storm purple Lambo right now
1:11:16 we're doing we're doing it it's okay
1:11:17 we're having a car buffer it's just like
1:11:19 Tim it's okay to grieve a little bit
1:11:22 uh Rebecca the other question that came
1:11:25 in uh speaking of like the torreidor and
1:11:27 your torador flaws uh does Brita so
1:11:30 beyond British loyalty to the cotery
1:11:32 does she any does she feel any sense of
1:11:34 belonging to or with the toriador like
1:11:37 does she feel like a Toreador internally
1:11:43 in a lot of ways being like essentially
1:11:47 a race by the codery she weirdly ended
1:11:51 up more torador than I think she might
1:11:53 have if she were raised by a Toreador
1:11:55 she she filled so much of
1:11:57 that Toyota Gap in the codery that she
1:12:01 grew towards being that I think also
1:12:05 with the local Toreador
1:12:07 there's a sense of Separation but also
1:12:10 connection
1:12:11 um
1:12:12 we spoke very briefly about uh behind
1:12:15 the scenes that she was receiving some
1:12:17 instruction from Elsa Elsa Linden how to
1:12:21 learn how to double speak uh that kind
1:12:23 of thing and she certainly had a feeling
1:12:26 of connection in that way to Elsa
1:12:29 um
1:12:30 seeing her as a mentor as an example
1:12:35 not and always naturally but um
1:12:38 like
1:12:39 having that sense of admiration towards
1:12:41 her
1:12:42 but
1:12:43 having that sense of admiration and like
1:12:45 that very sort of sincere
1:12:48 warmth towards her I think also
1:12:51 separated her in some weird ways from
1:12:52 the rest of the Toreador she wanted to
1:12:55 get close to Romeo when he was alive she
1:12:57 still wants to get to know him but that
1:12:58 uh whoops got complicated and like you
1:13:02 can werewolves you can even see like in
1:13:05 certain scenes that like she didn't get
1:13:08 to go to the sorry it's what do you call
1:13:11 it is it that
1:13:14 thank you
1:13:16 um
1:13:17 she was she's been cut out of a lot of
1:13:20 like
1:13:22 she ends up in odd positions with the
1:13:24 torador where she doesn't get to
1:13:26 always be with them but she's always one
1:13:30 of them if that makes sense
1:13:38 I have this okay I have this head can
1:13:40 and I haven't had quite the opportunity
1:13:42 to put it um
1:13:43 into play yet that because Elsa wrote
1:13:48 songs
1:13:50 um one of britta's Bretta sinks uh it
1:13:54 hasn't come up but I I I like to imagine
1:13:56 that they probably uh you know
1:14:00 collaborated and making music in that
1:14:03 way when they were teaching yeah
1:14:06 Lex so one of the questions
1:14:08 um I'm gonna jump the gun on the first
1:14:10 part of the question for the first part
1:14:11 of the Q a when they wanted to know how
1:14:13 to spell Z's name but uh the question
1:14:16 actual question related to that was uh
1:14:19 why did you decide to fit a demon into
1:14:21 the chronicle
1:14:23 um and how do you handle that kind of
1:14:24 like cross genre stuff while still
1:14:26 keeping things focused on like this is a
1:14:28 camarine vampire game
1:14:30 so uh
1:14:33 the reason I used him was actually
1:14:36 because that Shimmer Chantry was
1:14:40 househorn Society
1:14:41 and the implication that it's supposed
1:14:44 to have is that I'm sorry uh actually
1:14:48 actually sorry not Hawthorne City order
1:14:50 of the worm which is a bit different
1:14:54 um
1:14:54 and there's order the worm Chantry the
1:14:57 implication there is actually meant to
1:14:59 be that
1:15:00 the camera the premiere
1:15:03 um
1:15:04 there's been this quiet conspiracy
1:15:07 regarding
1:15:09 um the ongoing events concerning
1:15:11 whatever it is that's under New York
1:15:13 City
1:15:14 and
1:15:16 Z was uh summoned and bound with the
1:15:22 intent of it being a potential solution
1:15:24 to this problem
1:15:25 and so while there is a demon that's
1:15:28 being introduced uh it is actually very
1:15:29 much a vampire
1:15:32 oriented story
1:15:34 and we've actually had uh numerous cross
1:15:38 genre events at this point right so
1:15:40 we've done uh a team in there's been a
1:15:42 werewolf there's been Hunters like
1:15:44 straight up imbued we started yeah
1:15:47 wraiths
1:15:49 um you know uh
1:15:52 so
1:15:54 the idea right and especially in like
1:15:57 the old like revised
1:15:59 um masquerade book is that these are
1:16:02 things that Kindred do cross paths with
1:16:06 and the vast majority of time they don't
1:16:08 have a very strong understanding of
1:16:10 exactly what it is that they're dealing
1:16:12 with and so my goal was to have it so
1:16:16 that when these crash genre events
1:16:17 happen it's you guys kind of rushing
1:16:19 against the strange and not necessarily
1:16:21 completely understanding what you're
1:16:22 doing you do a good job of like framing
1:16:24 all those things at least I think so
1:16:26 through the lens like our lens of lack
1:16:29 of understanding right so like you know
1:16:32 the auspice and the rank and the tribe
1:16:35 of you know the young fenrir that was in
1:16:39 that scene it doesn't really get
1:16:40 disclosed now someone who knows werewolf
1:16:44 can probably discern details about the
1:16:47 character based on you know things they
1:16:48 were doing in the fight the way they
1:16:50 were dressed the way they looked
1:16:52 um and I think that kind of go holds
1:16:54 true for all of the crush Runner stuff I
1:16:57 haven't really like
1:16:59 we used the the terms of those genres
1:17:03 and kind of kept it through like Kindred
1:17:04 lens and part of the reason Z is
1:17:06 actually so so important and why I
1:17:09 wanted to do it
1:17:11 um was because
1:17:13 Neil
1:17:15 is a practitioner of Duron key and there
1:17:19 are certain parallels to demons and the
1:17:22 covenants that drawn key practitioners
1:17:24 have so I kind of wanted to
1:17:27 to let Neil kind of explore some of the
1:17:30 purpose and secrets of what he does well
1:17:32 it's a shame that so the Z is never
1:17:34 coming back and that's not going to be a
1:17:35 thing and it's done it's done
1:17:36 everything's done and it's done I think
1:17:38 that's really dealt with him yeah done
1:17:39 yeah so those those kind of the ideas
1:17:41 yeah
1:17:43 um so this is the this is the last
1:17:44 question that that we got in we got it
1:17:47 in a few different times but uh
1:17:49 uh which was if we were if all the PCS
1:17:52 were embraced as different Clans how
1:17:54 would they change uh but to narrow the
1:17:56 scope a little bit I'm going to use uh
1:17:57 specifically the version that was sent
1:17:59 in uh on uh through uh coffee uh by
1:18:02 Dirty Sabbat Sim
1:18:04 uh good name
1:18:07 all right thank you question how would
1:18:10 each character react if they were
1:18:11 embraced in in the clan with the player
1:18:13 next to them example if Johnny was
1:18:15 mulcavian
1:18:17 yeah we're doing we're doing on our
1:18:19 right let's yeah let's just go to the
1:18:20 right I think that's the easiest way to
1:18:21 do that
1:18:23 um so if Johnny was a malkadian so Santa
1:18:25 I'm sitting next to you oh yeah if
1:18:28 Johnny was a mulcavian what how would he
1:18:30 be as a character oh God awful
1:18:31 [Laughter]
1:18:33 terrible like seriously like I mean so
1:18:36 what would his derangement be
1:18:39 something bad man
1:18:41 oh God I I think that he would be just
1:18:45 the creepiest [ __ ]
1:18:48 um it would change him in ways that are
1:18:49 not good
1:18:50 [Music]
1:18:51 um
1:18:53 I mean I I think he'd probably have some
1:18:56 kind of weird
1:18:57 uh connection with his truck or the road
1:19:01 um
1:19:04 he'd like stalk people in like parking
1:19:06 lots and stuff it would just be bad
1:19:09 um he probably wouldn't have made it to
1:19:10 the camarilla to be perfectly honest
1:19:13 um
1:19:15 he probably would have come become some
1:19:16 kind of weird [ __ ] pervert Sabbat
1:19:18 milk you know melkavian anti-tribute but
1:19:22 um had he made it to the the camarilla I
1:19:25 don't know
1:19:26 no it's also weird too because like I'm
1:19:29 trying to like like I'm thinking about
1:19:30 like in in terms of the group what kind
1:19:33 of role he would fill
1:19:34 if he was the malkavian would he also be
1:19:37 the practitioner because it'd be it
1:19:39 would be interesting to see him with
1:19:41 with you know weird blood magic
1:19:43 implements in the back of a truck
1:19:46 yeah you know because I think the
1:19:47 trucker aspect of him stays remains
1:19:49 constant yeah I'm just like stripping
1:19:51 out trying to imagine we would be like
1:19:52 to strip out the bruja and replace it
1:19:54 with this weird kind of like
1:19:56 relationship where so one of the things
1:19:58 that like Mark time and like the the
1:20:00 cobweb and all that I can I I'm getting
1:20:03 this picture of Johnny like in his like
1:20:06 in a truck right like driving just like
1:20:09 rambling late at night into a CB yeah I
1:20:13 think that's the CB connection would
1:20:15 probably be amped up where he'd always
1:20:16 feel like he's like talking into this
1:20:19 into the like the CV right yeah you know
1:20:21 the um the the the web just becomes
1:20:24 another extension of that kind of weird
1:20:28 always connected in and talking to other
1:20:30 ghosts on the road right yeah um that's
1:20:33 cool yeah yeah I I think that's really
1:20:36 what I would do is I would probably I I
1:20:39 have a hard time seeing it as just an
1:20:40 alcavian I I see him as being this weird
1:20:44 Road missed
1:20:46 yeah and I I think he takes on a much
1:20:50 more Sinister kind of aspect
1:20:54 um he is not there for emotional support
1:20:55 yeah
1:20:58 um yeah yeah that's that's how I see
1:21:01 that changing
1:21:03 um
1:21:04 [ __ ] that makes me that makes me uh Neil
1:21:07 as a Toyota
1:21:10 oh God
1:21:13 meal with
1:21:14 God so you've talked you've talked in
1:21:16 the past right a couple times about like
1:21:18 um
1:21:19 uh pository door versus like regulatory
1:21:22 radar I feel like Neil would be
1:21:24 expository right like I feel like Neil
1:21:26 will be one of those guys who's had like
1:21:28 a million hobbies that he was trying to
1:21:31 like to still keep him like kind of
1:21:32 kneel right like uh he would be trying
1:21:34 at different things like and he would be
1:21:36 pretty good at a bunch of them like Neil
1:21:39 plays guitar but like you know current
1:21:41 Neil sucks at it he's like he can play
1:21:43 guitar he's not good at it there's
1:21:45 posers artists and critics yeah uh he
1:21:48 would not be a Critic no I think I if
1:21:50 I'm being super honest I feel like he'd
1:21:52 be a poser and he would just like be TR
1:21:55 he would still have that design innate
1:21:57 need to fit in and be liked
1:22:00 um but it would be a lot more
1:22:01 heavy-handed uh yeah Neil Neil isatory
1:22:05 door is a pository door right like I
1:22:07 don't I'm not happy about it but that's
1:22:09 that's it is it is what it is yeah
1:22:13 I don't know if Freda conceptually even
1:22:16 works as a venture because
1:22:18 I mean Venture are so strict about like
1:22:21 getting their gosh done and like
1:22:25 Adventure being embraced without
1:22:28 permission is so much different than a
1:22:30 torador being embraced without
1:22:31 permission
1:22:33 um it's a huge deal but say if that were
1:22:36 navigated say if she so managed to join
1:22:40 the codery even after all of that
1:22:44 Brita as a character because she's such
1:22:46 a blank slate in some ways but she still
1:22:49 retains her sense of self
1:22:53 um in in other ways
1:22:55 I feel like
1:22:57 having maybe been put through the gosh
1:23:00 or maybe not
1:23:01 uh
1:23:03 access to dominate changes you I think
1:23:08 knowing that at any point you could just
1:23:11 take control over someone else's mind
1:23:14 I I think that is innately
1:23:18 um I think it makes you a different
1:23:20 person and that's a hell of a drug
1:23:25 um and I think that Brita as a torador
1:23:29 she's she's very very empathetically
1:23:31 driven she she
1:23:35 I think that she becomes
1:23:37 a darker character I think that she
1:23:39 becomes more directly manipulative I
1:23:42 think that she seeks more control over
1:23:44 herself and her own life and I think
1:23:48 that
1:23:49 she becomes more practical about her
1:23:52 Humanity in the way that she relates to
1:23:53 other people in politics rather than
1:23:55 being very very
1:23:58 artistic and uh yeah I think that's I
1:24:02 think that's the shift that gets made
1:24:03 did she start to Echo some a character
1:24:05 like Arabella
1:24:07 oh
1:24:08 um
1:24:09 I think that she remains
1:24:13 softer and quieter but I think that
1:24:17 instead of
1:24:20 she becomes more deliberate I I think
1:24:22 that like
1:24:24 she would
1:24:26 be deliberately creating social
1:24:29 machinations and webs as a venture is
1:24:32 sort of in a way that Arabella does but
1:24:34 [Music]
1:24:34 um
1:24:35 soft or quieter probably without the
1:24:38 infernalism
1:24:39 allegedly
1:24:42 allegedly without also any idea what
1:24:44 your feeding restriction would be oh I
1:24:46 love feeding restrictions I think that
1:24:48 they have to be something that like
1:24:50 says something about the character like
1:24:54 deeply personally depending on what
1:24:57 um what like what you want to say about
1:24:59 the characters death
1:25:00 her feeding restriction I mean you know
1:25:03 be super [ __ ] tragic
1:25:05 um if you go take the first scene you
1:25:08 were in and just keep on going with that
1:25:10 where it's it has to be [ __ ] young
1:25:13 like Lost Girls yeah
1:25:16 um that's a good one I
1:25:22 villains
1:25:28 gonna run out of those you're not gonna
1:25:29 run out it's not really a feeding
1:25:31 restriction
1:25:32 I also love the uh I I don't know if
1:25:34 I've ever mentioned this but I love the
1:25:36 idea of a venture restriction that's not
1:25:38 type of people but it's the
1:25:41 circumstances in which you feed yeah
1:25:43 like I love the idea of like you have to
1:25:45 be brought food while you're on your
1:25:47 Chase at home right or like you have to
1:25:50 feed at midnight and not five minutes
1:25:53 afterwards I think ultimately that the
1:25:56 choice I'd make for her fading
1:25:58 restrictions are people with
1:26:01 um memory issues of some kind maybe like
1:26:04 other amnesiacs other anyone maybe with
1:26:07 like Alzheimer's sorry an Elders home
1:26:10 Brit is gonna Bonk someone on the head
1:26:12 real hard before she feeds she's she's
1:26:14 such a mirror she's she's a sponge for
1:26:18 like how she learns from other people
1:26:19 that I think she would seek her mirror
1:26:20 for a feeding restriction like that
1:26:22 Miles the Gangrel I don't know which
1:26:25 would be weirder win the venture or
1:26:27 miles to the Gangrel
1:26:30 um I think based on the historical the
1:26:33 way that I operated I really see myself
1:26:35 as some sort of like over-the-top rock
1:26:38 and roll individual
1:26:40 uh as a gangirl
1:26:42 like not actual uh thrash yeah something
1:26:46 like that
1:26:46 um but like I just imagine like weird
1:26:49 snakeskin pants and like ridiculous
1:26:52 over-the-top like just lean real hard in
1:26:55 the 80s hair mail yeah yeah I feel like
1:26:58 that's like an in character opinion too
1:27:00 like miles been like what do kangaroo
1:27:03 wear yes snake skin pants that is what I
1:27:06 would if I was a Gengar I'd basically be
1:27:08 Tommy Lee yeah yeah this seems right you
1:27:11 know and like just survives all sorts of
1:27:12 [ __ ] and just like I I feel like uh
1:27:16 miles the gangirl finally gets the
1:27:19 combats that Tim's been wanting yeah
1:27:23 just be like
1:27:24 I want to [ __ ] cut somebody so bad
1:27:25 but I have to do this politics and Miles
1:27:27 the gangirl is like
1:27:29 politics is for suckers I get to cut
1:27:31 people is is executive Gangrel a type
1:27:34 like a character type I mean it is now I
1:27:37 don't know it feels like it would play
1:27:39 like a werewolf alpha you can make it
1:27:41 work I think
1:27:43 foreign
1:27:45 that's kind of how I feel
1:27:47 um about that and uh yeah you know the
1:27:50 whole sex drugs and rocks and roll kind
1:27:52 of angle [ __ ] yeah dude what do you
1:27:53 still have a katana
1:27:54 I don't know not it's hard with claws
1:27:56 his Claw is gonna be katanas that's no
1:28:00 it's not how it worked at all but you
1:28:02 finally I believe in him
1:28:04 when the bruja would just be faster be
1:28:07 exactly the same
1:28:10 incorrect change out the flannel for a
1:28:13 leather jacket yes
1:28:15 she would have a leather no she'd still
1:28:17 have flannel flannel is still kind of a
1:28:19 bruja thing too but
1:28:22 um I feel like like looking around one
1:28:24 of our coderies there's gonna be a
1:28:26 flannel that no one knows whether it's
1:28:28 uh yours or Johnny's yeah yeah I see
1:28:31 that happening regardless of if you're a
1:28:33 brujar yeah she doesn't buy the fitted
1:28:35 one she doesn't buy clothes are you
1:28:36 kidding me specifically without any way
1:28:38 to talk about how you took it from
1:28:39 campers that got scared by you yes yes
1:28:42 but yeah when the bruja is faster and
1:28:45 hits harder just and doesn't have claws
1:28:47 but she's functionally
1:28:49 functionally very functionally very
1:28:51 similar she her anger probably she
1:28:54 probably doesn't simmer as much
1:28:56 she probably she's less of a diesel
1:28:58 engine and more of a bottle rocket I see
1:29:01 also more of the your boxing Roots being
1:29:04 more right more influential than that
1:29:06 and being much more of a fisticuffs than
1:29:10 maybe the uh what is it the the
1:29:13 fire fist thing yeah she'd have burning
1:29:16 wrath yeah
1:29:18 [ __ ] punch punch for days yeah punch
1:29:21 mom yep punch mom no uh no chaps though
1:29:25 there would not be a chaps no white hair
1:29:28 no white hair no she'd probably still
1:29:30 have the white hair miles the Gangrel
1:29:32 will have something yeah oh my God what
1:29:36 is Miles the Gangrel constrictor
1:29:52 you've got like a like a wet like one of
1:29:55 those like wet curly mullets is you know
1:29:58 what I'm talking about like like oh
1:30:00 miles but oh man now you just look like
1:30:02 the Jake Jake is wrestling Jake The
1:30:03 Snake like you know but like blonde oh
1:30:06 my God yeah just kind of like Mandy or
1:30:09 not Mandy I know we all wanted

1:31:23 the fourth leg for sending us all those
1:31:24 questions uh thank you everybody for
1:31:27 doing this for showing interest uh in
1:31:30 sort of hearing a little bit of behind
1:31:32 the scenes
1:31:33 next up we're gonna have a mini series
1:31:35 that we've talked about on Twitter a
1:31:36 little bit uh for getting Asheville it's
1:31:38 a mixed genre Chronicles of Darkness
1:31:40 miniseries uh where I'm gonna be sting
1:31:44 Lex gets to play for a little while
1:31:45 you've been running this game for years
1:31:48 at this point a little while yeah uh and
1:31:50 also in the Q a part one talked about
1:31:52 how you literally never get to play
1:31:53 anything yep uh so really you play for a
1:31:57 little bit
1:31:58 um and we were talking before about
1:32:00 whether or not we were gonna give you
1:32:02 know descriptions of of who we're
1:32:04 playing and who you guys are playing and
1:32:05 what's going on but uh Garrett had the
1:32:09 idea to just have me give descriptions
1:32:12 and everybody who's listening gets to
1:32:14 kind of trying to figure out uh who's
1:32:17 gonna play what before we're going on
1:32:19 um
1:32:20 so I'm not gonna it is a mixed genre
1:32:23 game so we're we're pulling from uh four
1:32:27 different genres uh for the players
1:32:30 uh two of you are the same thing
1:32:33 and uh so I'm just gonna give like a
1:32:35 weird human description uh and see who's
1:32:38 playing I feel like some people if they
1:32:40 know us might be able to pick out who's
1:32:41 playing what uh so uh intro scenes we've
1:32:46 got a um
1:32:48 final girl on a motorcycle
1:32:50 uh
1:32:51 uh we've got a uh
1:32:55 self-described I look like Macklemore
1:32:59 um
1:33:00 uh Town trickster uh we've got a very
1:33:05 sad emo boy
1:33:08 um we've got a uh a flower child yeah I
1:33:13 think that's like big enough right and
1:33:15 uh
1:33:16 the last one uh is intro shirtless
1:33:21 washing a car so uh
1:33:24 uh big himbo energy so I'm like we've
1:33:28 recorded some of it so far when we're
1:33:29 recording this right now uh I've been
1:33:31 having fun with it I hope people enjoy
1:33:33 listening to uh everybody playing new
