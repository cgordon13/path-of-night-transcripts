0:00:00 path of night is an actual play vampire
0:00:02 the masquerade podcast set in the
0:00:04 classic world of darkness
0:00:06 we're all friends we're here to have fun
0:00:08 but our story can include graphic
0:00:10 violence drug use sexual content and
0:00:12 other mature themes we've talked at our
0:00:14 table about safety comfort and consent
0:00:16 both as players and storytellers we know
0:00:19 what to expect we're all excited to be
0:00:21 here and we want you to feel the same so
0:00:23 listen to discretion is advised
0:00:25 now let's walk the path of night
0:00:32 last time on path of night
0:00:35 recorder took a road trip to jfk airport
0:00:37 to pick up kabir's connection talking
0:00:39 about their own lives the politics of
0:00:41 new haven and how to handle the problem
0:00:43 of veto santosa
0:00:45 but at the airport they were shocked to
0:00:47 find the mysterious passenger they were
0:00:49 there to pick up was neil an azasmite
0:00:52 ally jew by ear
0:00:54 after a few tense moments and the full
0:00:56 quarter he finally reuniting they headed
0:00:58 to a hotel in downtown manhattan to bed
0:01:01 down for the day
0:01:02 in the heart of sabat territory
0:01:05 [Music]
0:01:11 after a busy night headed to
0:01:13 jfk
0:01:15 and reuniting the quarry
0:01:17 the group of you are back together
0:01:19 miles
0:01:21 your quartering is back together
0:01:24 and you find yourself
0:01:27 up high
0:01:28 with an excellent view of new york
0:01:30 skyline
0:01:31 and despite everyone being here
0:01:36 you're alone
0:01:38 what do you do
0:01:40 i know that things have been
0:01:43 rough
0:01:44 between me and johnny since
0:01:46 sheriff with us has been disposed and
0:01:49 i think it's about time to
0:01:51 see if we can't figure out what's going
0:01:52 on there so i would you know
0:01:55 get johnny's attention and like
0:01:58 essentially ask him to come on over to
0:02:00 the edge of the balcony well if you're
0:02:01 out on the balcony it probably wouldn't
0:02:02 actually be long before johnny just
0:02:04 meets you out there to have a cigarette
0:02:06 staring out at the over the city is like
0:02:09 this uh
0:02:10 it's been a while since i've been up
0:02:11 this high
0:02:12 yeah you look like you're in your
0:02:13 natural environment surveying your
0:02:15 domain
0:02:17 i do like being up high
0:02:20 it's
0:02:21 interesting especially after the change
0:02:25 i wasn't a big fan before
0:02:27 he kind of suspiciously gives you some
0:02:29 side eye
0:02:31 so you just uh brooding up here or
0:02:34 thinking i'm thinking that things are
0:02:36 about to get a lot worse but
0:02:39 i am glad that neil is back
0:02:42 johnny pop some morally in his mouth
0:02:43 offers you a cigarette
0:02:46 i'll take the cigarette
0:02:50 light both of them thanks
0:02:52 and as he starts smoking you
0:02:55 it never occurred to me that
0:02:58 i never told you you're my first actual
0:03:00 friend after my change
0:03:04 no i don't think you have
0:03:05 i mean i had marcos for a while but
0:03:07 marcos was an
0:03:10 artifact of my past that i tried to hold
0:03:12 on to
0:03:14 he's been with you that long i knew him
0:03:16 before
0:03:18 we were kind of rivals
0:03:20 he was actually better than me
0:03:22 but we were friends of a sort
0:03:27 i
0:03:28 decided that i needed to keep him around
0:03:31 and it ended up this way you got a weird
0:03:34 habit of that keeping your uh
0:03:36 enemies and rivals close huh
0:03:40 there
0:03:43 i don't know there's a trust there that
0:03:45 i enjoy
0:03:46 what is it you always like to say
0:03:48 something about a measure of a man
0:03:51 yes a measure of a man is determined by
0:03:53 his enemies
0:03:55 is that something from before you
0:03:56 changed or is that something your sire
0:03:58 has dripped in your ear
0:03:59 something i've taken upon afterwards
0:04:02 my sire has been around
0:04:04 mostly at the beginning but after
0:04:07 after he sent me to new haven he hasn't
0:04:08 been around much
0:04:12 and um
0:04:14 yeah i just
0:04:16 i originally recruited you because
0:04:19 i saw
0:04:21 that you were kind of different than the
0:04:23 other Brujah and you were also very close
0:04:25 with weathers and i thought that was
0:04:28 useful
0:04:30 but
0:04:32 i think after a while i'd rather have
0:04:35 you a friend because you were
0:04:38 more of a compass
0:04:40 is this what passes for sentimental for
0:04:42 you
0:04:44 i'm being truthful
0:04:46 fair enough
0:04:47 i don't find much
0:04:49 worth in hiding this kind of stuff and
0:04:52 you would doubt me if i didn't say
0:04:54 things like that
0:05:01 but
0:05:02 you're a good man and you want to do the
0:05:04 right thing
0:05:05 it's not
0:05:06 always possible
0:05:09 but you've tried to do these things
0:05:10 what's not always possible it's not
0:05:13 always possible to do the most right
0:05:15 thing every time
0:05:17 we can try
0:05:21 yeah i
0:05:25 don't know if i agree with you
0:05:29 i'd rather not have it any other way i
0:05:31 think
0:05:32 i think it is possible to do the right
0:05:33 thing
0:05:34 always
0:05:38 just sometimes you're scared of the
0:05:39 consequences
0:05:41 and that's a sentiment weathers also
0:05:43 shares
0:05:45 and it's why
0:05:47 i like the two of you but sometimes
0:05:49 in
0:05:50 everything else that goes on somebody
0:05:52 has to be
0:05:53 the person that does
0:05:56 slightly less the two
0:05:58 find
0:05:59 the best outcome for everyone
0:06:05 it's a balance
0:06:07 do you know what i think
0:06:10 the right thing would have been for me
0:06:11 to do
0:06:12 what's that
0:06:16 i think the right thing would have been
0:06:17 for me
0:06:18 to just set up
0:06:20 on a hill somewhere after i had been
0:06:22 embraced
0:06:24 and just watched the sun come up
0:06:27 maybe
0:06:28 no not maybe definitely
0:06:31 instead i was too scared of the
0:06:32 consequences of leaving
0:06:35 this behind
0:06:37 i was too scared that my kids might need
0:06:39 me or
0:06:42 i was too scared of of all my unfinished
0:06:45 business
0:06:48 the right thing to do
0:06:50 would have been to just accept final
0:06:52 death
0:06:54 but instead
0:06:57 i took the coward's way out and kept
0:07:00 living nights may i posit a different
0:07:03 you may
0:07:04 what if by watching
0:07:06 your family as well as done he's kept
0:07:08 them
0:07:09 more safe than they could have been if
0:07:10 you died
0:07:12 yeah
0:07:14 it's there's always a ton of what-ifs
0:07:17 you don't see much of a person just give
0:07:19 up on things though including yourself
0:07:21 we can't affect change by being dead
0:07:24 no my point is is that
0:07:27 we gotta understand that
0:07:29 most of the time
0:07:32 we're not making the right choice we're
0:07:34 making the wrong choice
0:07:36 i don't know i don't know if i agree
0:07:39 my daughter wouldn't have been drawn
0:07:40 into this [ __ ]
0:07:42 that's i if i hadn't have dived deep
0:07:45 into this [ __ ] pool
0:07:47 maybe
0:07:48 it's hard to say things could have
0:07:50 changed in a different way in the life
0:07:52 and she could have been caught up in a
0:07:53 different way
0:07:54 those are some gilded words that
0:07:57 the path to hell are [ __ ] paved with
0:08:01 and there's a million different paths
0:08:03 people take
0:08:04 to what if yourself into
0:08:08 oblivion
0:08:09 it's not what if miles i know these are
0:08:13 the wrong choices
0:08:15 and i keep making the wrong choice
0:08:18 i don't think so
0:08:20 it's a pretty little lie you're telling
0:08:22 yourself
0:08:23 i think that
0:08:24 myself and others would have died
0:08:27 without you there
0:08:29 and i don't know how much value you put
0:08:31 on some of that but
0:08:32 i feel like we can
0:08:34 affect change for the better there's so
0:08:36 many because even if we weren't here
0:08:38 these others would exist
0:08:40 yeah maybe
0:08:43 look i'm not i'm not greeting the sun
0:08:44 anytime soon
0:08:46 so don't worry about that
0:08:48 truthfully i wasn't but
0:08:50 but you should reflect on the fact
0:08:52 that the whole jihad
0:08:57 it's a terrible thing
0:08:59 the games of on life that we play are
0:09:01 just
0:09:03 cowardice
0:09:05 masquerading as
0:09:08 i don't know
0:09:10 the camarilla
0:09:12 the sabbat
0:09:13 anarchs the whole damn thing
0:09:17 well the only way to remove it is
0:09:19 getting to a place to do that no no no
0:09:21 see now you're playing the jihad again
0:09:23 either you play or you get played
0:09:26 or you walk away from the whole thing
0:09:28 there's never walking away
0:09:30 that's the ventrue line
0:09:32 i'm pretty sure that regardless they're
0:09:34 gonna find you one way or another
0:09:37 something or something will draw you
0:09:39 back to doing
0:09:40 into the supernatural world
0:09:44 it's getting early we should probably
0:09:45 head in
0:09:47 one
0:09:48 thing i need you to have my back out
0:09:51 there
0:09:53 i got your back miles
0:09:55 it's good to hear johnny
0:09:58 let's go get some rest two of them head
0:10:00 inside
0:10:03 [Music]
0:10:06 at the beginning of the next night the
0:10:08 group of you largely wake up around the
0:10:10 same time
0:10:11 though wynn is a bit slower to rise
0:10:14 due to her monstrous nature
0:10:17 there you find
0:10:19 jubeir pacing in front of
0:10:22 the little landline phone to hote the
0:10:25 hotel room
0:10:26 and he glances at the group of you as
0:10:29 you start coming out of your little
0:10:30 rooms and uh the phone rings again and
0:10:34 when it rings he like jolts
0:10:37 and dubai answers the phone yes of
0:10:39 course i'll be right down thank you for
0:10:42 the um the notice
0:10:44 and he hangs up um my friends i think
0:10:47 there is some sort of complication that
0:10:49 has come up
0:10:50 and
0:10:51 i have been requested at the front desk
0:10:54 uh
0:10:55 but there should be no one here looking
0:10:57 for me that was my question so it's time
0:11:00 to not go to the front desk then right
0:11:03 is that
0:11:03 that is perhaps what i am thinking as
0:11:05 well so what do we do go out the window
0:11:07 or from this eye up i don't think that's
0:11:09 an option either let's try to get to the
0:11:11 parking garage
0:11:12 okay
0:11:13 [Music]
0:11:19 the web of knives moves quickly
0:11:23 johnny johnny takes a walk over the
0:11:25 balcony and takes a look how f uh how
0:11:28 close are some of the other buildings to
0:11:30 this one
0:11:31 uh it is quite a jump to the nearest one
0:11:34 uh you think you might actually be able
0:11:36 to make it do you think i might be able
0:11:38 to make it jumping back and forth uh
0:11:40 ferrying the uh the group
0:11:42 the more you try the greater the odds
0:11:44 something's gonna go wrong um but you're
0:11:46 looking at six successes on a run and
0:11:49 jump
0:11:50 do we um
0:11:53 do we have like i don't suppose we have
0:11:54 like 30 minutes 30 minutes that i can
0:11:56 get us out of here
0:11:58 well uh whip up knives maybe not
0:12:01 it's better than nothing but what's the
0:12:03 idea
0:12:06 sorcery
0:12:07 i think words sorcery the power goes out
0:12:10 we do not have 30 minutes it's time to
0:12:12 go
0:12:12 i can jump across to that other building
0:12:14 there
0:12:15 i could get down to the street
0:12:17 but
0:12:18 let's just go for the stairs see if we
0:12:20 can't get to
0:12:21 the parking garage from there we could
0:12:23 probably get a vehicle and get out of
0:12:24 here
0:12:25 if they cut the power that means that
0:12:27 they're going to
0:12:28 they don't want to stick in the elevator
0:12:29 which means they're going to be in the
0:12:30 stairs we don't have a lot of other
0:12:32 options
0:12:33 yeah that's kind of the point
0:12:35 unless we're making
0:12:36 uh
0:12:37 there's got to be a
0:12:39 it depends on how many there are there's
0:12:41 multiple staircases out of a building so
0:12:43 we just have to pick the right one what
0:12:44 exactly are the web of knives again
0:12:46 assassins
0:12:48 yeah what kind of assassins um
0:12:50 they can they can disappear
0:12:53 uh
0:12:54 and and reappear like i can but way more
0:12:56 talented service stairwell or one of the
0:12:58 fire escapes fire exits what
0:13:01 he take this
0:13:03 he takes his uh the other backpack that
0:13:05 he's been taking with him everywhere
0:13:07 and he hands it over to you a little
0:13:10 nervously if the web of knives comes for
0:13:13 me
0:13:14 you must hide this
0:13:15 and do not let them attain it what is
0:13:17 this it is a backpack neil you will keep
0:13:20 it with you and worry not of the
0:13:22 contents
0:13:23 okay we need to move hey
0:13:25 get to new haven okay okay that's it yes
0:13:28 i will see you there
0:13:30 i'll win i will see you there as well
0:13:33 yeah what's happening what
0:13:35 oh okay i'll see you soon there is very
0:13:37 much danger okay cool new gives like a
0:13:40 weird confused look with you by hero
0:13:42 talks to win we have to go that's what's
0:13:45 happening okay
0:13:47 five words why are we leaving assassins
0:13:50 unstoppable assassins come to kill us
0:13:51 wait unstoppable assassins come to kill
0:13:54 damn it that was six sorry we need just
0:13:56 that that was what i needed okay all
0:13:58 right um
0:13:59 i'm repaying a debt to a friend by
0:14:01 getting both of you out of new york yeah
0:14:03 why are you going by yourself duke baier
0:14:06 if they have followed us to the states
0:14:08 it is because they have come for me
0:14:10 or me
0:14:11 they came for me last time
0:14:13 let's stick together
0:14:15 are you sure let's stick together and
0:14:17 let's go the more we debate about it the
0:14:19 closer they close in around us
0:14:22 i mean at this point they're alrighty
0:14:24 right when pulls on her flannel and kind
0:14:26 of gets ready how tall is this building
0:14:27 like megatall it's like a manhattan
0:14:29 skyscraper in there right i mean it's a
0:14:31 world of darkness hotel it's so world of
0:14:33 darkness hotel so which skyscraper it's
0:14:36 150 stories
0:14:37 in manhattan yeah it's 150 stories at
0:14:40 least
0:14:41 there's a castle up here or one of the
0:14:43 gargoyles shuttle to get back to the
0:14:45 ground
0:14:47 that's why that's what i'm thinking that
0:14:48 if we if we find
0:14:50 a uh a window facing out again against
0:14:53 one of the other buildings on the same
0:14:54 block
0:14:55 we might be able to just switch our uh
0:14:58 descent down that feels like an awfully
0:15:00 big i know we just i know we just got to
0:15:02 a don't split up
0:15:04 decision we're not splitting up
0:15:06 okay i can go out the window well no i
0:15:08 don't have time i need everyone to roll
0:15:10 willpower at difficulty
0:15:13 there is your current willpower does
0:15:15 iron will apply to this uh yes it does
0:15:17 this is mind-affecting vomiturji
0:15:24 yay
0:15:29 i do not have it
0:15:30 i am uh one failure one success so
0:15:34 neutral
0:15:35 fail i may have botched
0:15:37 okay three successes three successes one
0:15:40 success
0:15:42 all right everyone has failed and
0:15:45 johnny has botched oh three successes
0:15:47 wasn't enough i asked i've ironed well i
0:15:49 had four and then i had a one i rolled
0:15:52 three nines each of you pick up the
0:15:53 scent of what smells like khalif
0:15:56 oh boy on the wind and you find
0:16:00 yourselves getting lost to this
0:16:02 incredible high
0:16:04 johnny
0:16:05 you succumb far deeper than most
0:16:08 your perceptions simply fade away and
0:16:11 the group of you feel as though you are
0:16:13 drifting
0:16:14 i was going to ask if i was particularly
0:16:15 resistant to this but then there's the
0:16:17 flip side of being an addict where you
0:16:19 you were not at all resistant yeah as
0:16:23 the group of you come to everyone's
0:16:24 safer johnny you hear uh this like
0:16:28 thumping sound
0:16:29 as jubair collapses to the ground in ash
0:16:32 and looming over him having just
0:16:35 consumed
0:16:36 uh his soul is
0:16:39 a woman who is wearing tighter
0:16:42 form-fitting like athletic wear has a
0:16:45 hood up and is dressed kind of like in
0:16:48 street clothes save for the fact that in
0:16:50 her left hand she is carrying a zambia
0:16:53 she's like like a thick bladed knife
0:17:03 this is not the same person who this is
0:17:05 not
0:17:06 that this doesn't look like so much wow
0:17:08 okay fair enough
0:17:09 that's so much worse though
0:17:11 oh it feels like initiative we gotta go
0:17:14 i think you guys are willing initiative
0:17:18 fourteen
0:17:19 seven
0:17:21 miles eight
0:17:22 who way
0:17:26 twelve
0:17:27 johnny uh unconscious okay
0:17:31 this is deeply unsettling
0:17:33 oh this is really bad oh no it's really
0:17:36 bad
0:17:39 uh neil
0:17:41 yep
0:17:42 she doesn't seem to even look in your
0:17:45 direction is kind of focusing on uh
0:17:49 whichever opponent she considers to be
0:17:50 like
0:17:52 a more legitimate threat
0:17:54 um that's fair
0:17:55 and hurtful with a quick gesture
0:17:58 she sends a throwing knife sailing
0:18:00 through the air
0:18:01 at you
0:18:03 what are you doing are you dodging or
0:18:04 are you eating this one
0:18:06 uh i should probably dodge
0:18:09 i don't think i'm gonna be very good at
0:18:10 that what is dodge based on athletics
0:18:13 death of dex athletics oh yeah i don't
0:18:15 think that's worth it at all i have a
0:18:17 two-die pool
0:18:20 so uh
0:18:21 no i guess i'm just surprised eating
0:18:22 this one in the face well you could you
0:18:25 could do it and spend a willpower
0:18:26 possibly i don't know if it's worth it
0:18:28 because then i don't have an action at
0:18:29 all yeah i guess i just take this you
0:18:31 got to decide okay okay so just a second
0:18:33 real sick also a two day pool
0:18:35 you can get lucky
0:18:39 yeah that's it's a nice night
0:18:41 so nope i soak nothing she deals four
0:18:44 lethal to you okay and now i need you to
0:18:46 make a stamina plus fortitude roll yeah
0:18:49 cool uh
0:18:50 that is one success okay
0:18:53 uh
0:18:54 for the next
0:18:56 day
0:18:58 you are reduced to corporate well okay
0:19:00 uh you'll take a minus three penalty to
0:19:01 your stamina does that take you to zero
0:19:03 oh yes it does okay you go to torpor
0:19:05 neal drops neil is hit uh he actually
0:19:08 seems to take the the knife a little
0:19:10 better than he usually does however his
0:19:12 eyes go wide his veins blacken and the
0:19:16 malkavian collapses to the ground
0:19:19 withering into a torpor husk is this a
0:19:21 frenzy chop if you're asking it probably
0:19:24 is
0:19:25 coterie mate just went into torpor and
0:19:27 it was last time yep
0:19:30 uh one success you do not frenzy
0:19:33 um it will go to
0:19:36 Britta
0:19:37 brady your move what do you do would it
0:19:38 be spending an action to look around and
0:19:40 sort of like gauge my uh fellow
0:19:42 quartering like how they're
0:19:45 handling this yeah why don't we go
0:19:46 around the table and you can ask each
0:19:49 player what the expression on their
0:19:51 faces like i'm not trying to like like
0:19:53 empathy anyone i just no dad it's just a
0:19:55 quick just a quick two word uh
0:19:57 description from each person uh why
0:19:59 don't we start with uh miles
0:20:02 sword drawn
0:20:03 glaring
0:20:05 i'm not gonna try and keep it to two
0:20:06 words um glancing between the door and
0:20:08 the window yeah johnny looks stoned okay
0:20:11 just in case you were asking neil looks
0:20:13 torport
0:20:16 corpse-like is my second word actually a
0:20:18 very relevant question Britta has seen
0:20:21 both myself and uh miles in torpor
0:20:26 does neil
0:20:27 look like a normal torpor uh yes there
0:20:30 nothing's normal about torpor
0:20:32 but it looks like the same state status
0:20:34 that the two of you are in okay just
0:20:36 making sure there wasn't any other kind
0:20:37 of weird because you you use the word
0:20:39 withered
0:20:40 yes when a vampire goes to corporate
0:20:42 they actually look like a withered like
0:20:44 dried corpse yep they're skin titans and
0:20:46 something like that just want to make
0:20:47 sure that it's the normal kind of like
0:20:49 skin tightness there was a blackening of
0:20:50 his veins uh but that was the weird part
0:20:53 okay Britta's eyes start to her side and
0:20:56 with her hand on the gun she sees miles
0:20:59 ready with the katana so she'll shoot
0:21:01 okay uh you're at plus four difficulty
0:21:04 for the shot uh i'm going to spend a
0:21:06 well power
0:21:11 not a single 10. i spent the willpower
0:21:12 though right there oh yeah so there is
0:21:14 there's no ones so there is a single
0:21:17 success okay
0:21:19 you fire the gun and the knife she is
0:21:22 carrying parries the bullet away
0:21:24 when is the window open or broken uh the
0:21:29 door to the
0:21:31 big open space of the pool is open the
0:21:34 sliding glass door yep awesome wind
0:21:36 grabs kneel and runs for the door wind
0:21:38 starts booking
0:21:39 for the door back door that leads to a
0:21:42 balcony yes yes this is a relevant
0:21:45 question how many rounds will i be
0:21:47 falling
0:21:49 if i jump over this balcony dev
0:21:51 academics yes
0:21:53 yes i do give me an academic strong we
0:21:54 are 150 stories in the air i can turn
0:21:57 into an owl if i have the time to turn
0:21:59 into an owl as i fall can you carry neal
0:22:01 while you i don't know if you've ever
0:22:03 seen what eagles can do to deer
0:22:06 yeah the gold me like golden eagles that
0:22:08 like pull goats off the side of building
0:22:10 the side of the cliff yeah i don't think
0:22:12 that's the same as the owl i guess
0:22:14 unless she's like a huge [ __ ] if the
0:22:17 difficulty is six i have one success oh
0:22:18 she does get one uh yeah you've probably
0:22:21 got like
0:22:22 five rounds falling okay that's a little
0:22:25 it's a little drop i mean this is gonna
0:22:26 be like bumping into [ __ ] and like it's
0:22:27 not like a clean
0:22:29 uh descent this is not a clean fight
0:22:32 this is not a this is about survival
0:22:33 this is some gangrel [ __ ] i absolutely
0:22:35 understand all right so how many rounds
0:22:38 will it take me to get to the balcony or
0:22:40 am i there uh at the end of your next
0:22:42 section um can i spend a blood this
0:22:44 round yes okay i'm gonna spend the blood
0:22:46 to beef my strength all right miles
0:22:48 you're up i don't know anything about
0:22:50 what she's doing me neither this is all
0:22:52 crazy [ __ ]
0:22:55 so let's go with the old dominating
0:22:58 okay uh jen check that would be
0:23:01 eighth though okay no effect got it what
0:23:04 do you what do you try to say uh just my
0:23:06 normal still be still okay so you're
0:23:08 like you go to say something not only do
0:23:10 no words come out uh but you find
0:23:13 yourself unable to bend her mind to your
0:23:15 will cool cool so that's that's been
0:23:18 checked
0:23:20 yeah we checked the combat we checked
0:23:22 the dominator
0:23:24 those boxes have been checked
0:23:27 can i move you yeah you know how all
0:23:30 right okay
0:23:31 can i like
0:23:32 kick johnny as i move
0:23:35 yeah for fun but not foreign
0:23:38 i will pick high should have gone low
0:23:40 buddy uh you bump his shoe and for a
0:23:43 moment you think you might have almost
0:23:45 snapped him out of his stupor okay uh
0:23:47 but you don't fair enough well now i'm
0:23:49 just standing by your body
0:23:52 for me
0:23:55 man i have to choose
0:23:57 the
0:23:58 mysterious assassin uh will turn her
0:24:01 attention to
0:24:04 i do have one action uh from celerity uh
0:24:07 to dodge probably
0:24:11 by god stop it roll your dutch uh dex
0:24:14 plus athletics
0:24:17 one success okay uh she slices clean
0:24:20 through your gun cutting it into two
0:24:21 parts oh no miles of stuff
0:24:26 uh Britta
0:24:27 it is your turn Britta lets the house of
0:24:29 the gun fall to the ground and seeing
0:24:32 when's example
0:24:33 would i be able to
0:24:35 i don't know if i can drag johnny he's
0:24:38 he's pretty big you can spin some some
0:24:41 blood to make yourself beefy
0:24:44 he hides it beneath the leather jacket
0:24:45 but he's actually quite a muscly dude
0:24:47 yeah
0:24:48 um are we able to spend blood for
0:24:51 strength depends on how much blood per
0:24:53 run you can spend uh but whatever you
0:24:55 can spend per round you may put towards
0:24:56 strength i think maybe the way i want to
0:24:58 do this is to
0:25:01 run by him using celerity
0:25:03 and
0:25:04 try to like
0:25:06 yank him to his feet by his like leather
0:25:08 jacket are you dedicating an action
0:25:10 towards like while on your way somewhere
0:25:12 or are you spending your time to like uh
0:25:14 to get him like is it a choice between
0:25:16 like movement and getting him out of it
0:25:17 yeah uh i'm gonna choose getting him out
0:25:19 of it okay uh there's no need to roll uh
0:25:22 you grab him pull out his jacket johnny
0:25:24 uh you feel high as hell but it fades
0:25:29 very very quickly and you very suddenly
0:25:31 realize that there is a Britta who is
0:25:34 like yanking at your jacket with a
0:25:36 little bit of a panicked expression in
0:25:38 her eyes you've got the feeling like you
0:25:40 fell asleep during a test but the test
0:25:41 is like an assassin coming to kill your
0:25:43 friends
0:25:44 it's a very specific test
0:25:48 nice 18 for initiative boom
0:25:51 johnny back at it i think we have we
0:25:53 have one more action uh from
0:25:56 the assassin who
0:25:58 turns her attention to miles which is
0:26:01 good because i also have an extra action
0:26:03 i was definitely holding it
0:26:05 oh your whole okay all right are you
0:26:07 dodging what are you doing i will
0:26:08 probably try to
0:26:10 if she's trying to hit me with a knife
0:26:12 or anything like that i will probably
0:26:13 try to parry
0:26:14 [Music]
0:26:16 eight okay
0:26:18 uh you cross swords with her uh there is
0:26:21 a
0:26:22 chunk of your katana that like flings
0:26:25 off of the blade as she like damages
0:26:27 your weapon uh but it does not is not
0:26:29 destroyed
0:26:34 i think that's everyone we go to a new
0:26:36 round uh actually no she has one more
0:26:38 action she can do oh my god lord i'm
0:26:40 sorry it's real bad
0:26:43 stupid weapon knives
0:26:49 uh you take two levels of aggravated
0:26:51 damage as you find yourself suddenly
0:26:53 engulfed in flames well that's not great
0:26:56 is that a frenzy test all around uh
0:26:58 that's a raw check check for everyone
0:26:59 all around defeat for Britta
0:27:01 i'm gonna spend the willpower what is
0:27:03 that courage
0:27:04 yep
0:27:05 cool me too
0:27:07 because i'm not on the balcony you're a
0:27:09 little too far away she can lure flames
0:27:10 on a fizzy action not in a phase no no
0:27:12 [ __ ] yeah no she's super
0:27:14 prepared if what
0:27:17 six
0:27:18 feet tens explode
0:27:21 yes they do [ __ ] five successes
0:27:24 one with the wall power okay i don't
0:27:26 think the ten
0:27:30 two successes
0:27:31 we go to the top of the round
0:27:33 three successes
0:27:36 at the top of the round brother we'll
0:27:37 take one level of aggravated damage the
0:27:39 fire burns
0:27:40 and we will go to the assassin
0:27:45 the assassin disappears from view johnny
0:27:49 uh you see bird on fire wind running
0:27:51 with the torped kneel jubair is a pile
0:27:53 of ash
0:27:55 and
0:27:56 miles is beside you with this katana at
0:27:58 the ready i feel like Britta was just
0:28:00 like like holding you by the jacket and
0:28:03 uh shaking you out of it and the moment
0:28:06 like her hands come off that's when she
0:28:08 lights up uh johnny's gonna just grab
0:28:11 britta throw her to the ground and
0:28:14 basically smother her with his jacket
0:28:16 give me
0:28:17 you're not going to need a physical rule
0:28:18 to do this but i do need a courage check
0:28:20 at difficulty 9 to [ __ ] with fire
0:28:26 i'll spend the willpower okay
0:28:28 one success freda you are pulled to the
0:28:31 ground by johnny who lays his leather
0:28:32 jacket over you and starts smothering
0:28:34 the flames
0:28:36 we then go to
0:28:38 Britta all right
0:28:40 well it's time to start running
0:28:43 where is everyone positionally like
0:28:45 miles is the closest to where she was
0:28:47 but she's gone johnny is right over you
0:28:49 he is the closest
0:28:51 next closest is miles wynn at this point
0:28:54 is outside okay
0:28:55 is there a fire escape like we were
0:28:57 talking about earlier
0:28:58 no not here okay
0:29:00 there's like in theory access to one but
0:29:02 would there be one like near the pool
0:29:05 maybe like is that a thing and this kind
0:29:08 of
0:29:09 okay
0:29:09 then
0:29:11 start running off uh towards the pool i
0:29:13 think
0:29:14 okay uh that's right around where wind
0:29:15 is headed so you're basically moving to
0:29:17 join her
0:29:18 is the pool on the balcony or like
0:29:20 several floors down it's like on it okay
0:29:23 the like quote-unquote balcony it's
0:29:25 actually like a pretty big
0:29:26 nice space okay when uh
0:29:30 i jump off the balcony holding neil all
0:29:32 right
0:29:33 boy uh give me a dex plus athletics
0:29:35 actually give me strength athletics to
0:29:37 not let go of him can you spend another
0:29:39 strike spend another blood retract
0:29:41 maybe i don't know just a thought
0:29:46 i'm very nervous uh guess i will spend
0:29:47 another
0:29:49 blood for strength
0:29:51 uh unless you can't turn into an owl
0:29:52 when you do that i don't know turning
0:29:54 into an owl takes three rounds unless i
0:29:56 spend blood for it gotcha so i can spend
0:29:58 the blood for strength but it's gonna go
0:30:00 i'm gonna let you do what you're gonna
0:30:01 do it's gonna cut into that whole time
0:30:03 yeah so i'm gonna
0:30:04 save that
0:30:06 and
0:30:07 dex strength
0:30:09 x yes indeed okay
0:30:12 tying over there i'm gonna throw up
0:30:15 no rebecca's
0:30:17 it's okay to laugh on mike it's fine
0:30:20 just giggling over there i am going to
0:30:21 spend a willpower
0:30:24 sounds good to me you're trying to do
0:30:25 stuff i don't need to be giggling about
0:30:27 owl time
0:30:29 why not the rest of us are
0:30:32 so no success is on the dice but i did
0:30:33 spend that willpower that is a success
0:30:36 my
0:30:38 my renting spec for strength does not
0:30:40 help me here oh please don't wet it no
0:30:45 no this is for you look it's a lot
0:30:46 easier to carry neil if there's only
0:30:48 half of them
0:30:49 you know what that's fair he's not gonna
0:30:51 feel it yeah he doesn't need his legs
0:30:52 that's not a bad strategy right
0:30:55 that is a [ __ ] horrible strategy hey
0:30:57 this is the same exact strategy i gave
0:30:59 him when he wanted to throw the truck
0:31:02 i hate you guys bad friends
0:31:04 so i i managed to hold on to him as i'm
0:31:07 leaping cut a few pounds of his hair off
0:31:09 that's exactly yeah it's just ag damage
0:31:11 right it's fine how does neil feel about
0:31:13 undercuts
0:31:14 but yeah please don't shave me while
0:31:15 we're falling off a skyscraper i promise
0:31:17 nothing there's no props to tommy
0:31:19 if holding on to you means i have to
0:31:21 shave you then i'm going to shave you to
0:31:23 save you to save you shave to save
0:31:26 that's what friends do i'm done
0:31:29 yes oh my
0:31:34 i had that one success
0:31:35 what when you begin your transformation
0:31:38 yep okay uh you are tumbling and like
0:31:40 smashing against the window and it is uh
0:31:44 it's a little scary uh i need um give me
0:31:47 a stamina plus fortitude roll as
0:31:49 the damage begins
0:31:55 two successes
0:31:56 okay yeah you soaked just fine
0:31:58 after when
0:32:00 it is time for miles
0:32:02 hmm
0:32:04 is everyone going to the fire escape
0:32:06 wait there's a fire escape it'd be f it
0:32:08 would i'm assuming instead of a fire
0:32:09 escape is 150 stories up it would be
0:32:11 like fire stairs like the
0:32:13 yeah they could they wouldn't put a fire
0:32:14 escape on the side of like a [ __ ] no
0:32:16 but
0:32:17 they have like those big cements
0:32:18 something like that like it just ruins
0:32:19 the aesthetic of the skyscraper right
0:32:21 right you gotta slap a gargoyle on that
0:32:23 [ __ ]
0:32:24 no but there's usually ways to get down
0:32:26 to like a lower floor yeah yeah i'll
0:32:28 head with the rest of them and like oh
0:32:30 look at generally come on
0:32:32 and then
0:32:33 just move and just
0:32:35 be prepared
0:32:36 is Britta still on fire no no i just like
0:32:39 mashing to put her out
0:32:41 he used his Brujah magic to do it i just
0:32:43 wanted to make sure the fire the magic
0:32:45 fire went out yeah that's a fair point
0:32:47 sometimes it doesn't yeah i figure
0:32:49 before Britta runs off she looks up
0:32:51 behind her shoulder to say thank you
0:32:53 nicely charred Britta
0:32:55 so did anyone take any extractions uh i
0:32:58 did yeah same here
0:33:00 johnny does our assassin friend reveal
0:33:02 themselves again at uh
0:33:04 during the rest of the round or
0:33:06 with any of their actions
0:33:08 so far they have not revealed themselves
0:33:11 uh johnny's gonna reach into his uh
0:33:14 uh he's gonna put his jacket back on and
0:33:16 draw a stake from his bug out bag
0:33:19 and rush over to the edge of the balcony
0:33:22 to watch uh win transform with neil and
0:33:26 make sure that they get to where they
0:33:27 get where they need to go he wants to
0:33:29 make sure that he's got eyes on them and
0:33:31 watching them that be successful okay
0:33:34 miles
0:33:35 i'm continuing forward and just i'm
0:33:38 using my movement and just saving it for
0:33:41 any kind of defense so continue moving
0:33:43 towards these exit stairs wherever that
0:33:45 is wait did you pick up celerity yes
0:33:48 indeed oh
0:33:49 that's the first time i've seen that
0:33:51 yeah i taught him
0:33:52 i was going to save it for a special
0:33:54 occasion
0:33:57 very special
0:33:58 sorry are you doing anything um do we
0:34:01 have eyes on
0:34:02 where the
0:34:04 fire stairs are from the pool do we know
0:34:06 like we have that located yes okay
0:34:09 um
0:34:10 rogue question do they have those window
0:34:14 washer stations anywhere on this
0:34:15 expensive building uh nothing that you
0:34:17 can see okay um that's about to be some
0:34:20 looney tunes ideas but
0:34:22 um
0:34:23 i don't need none of that jason statham
0:34:25 action
0:34:26 uh miles how far are you from johnny an
0:34:29 action at this point yeah however
0:34:32 however much distance that is
0:34:34 in that case Britta will start going
0:34:37 towards the stairs uh yeah you make it
0:34:39 down you make it to the stairs and start
0:34:41 heading down
0:34:42 there is a moment
0:34:44 while you are moving down the stairs
0:34:47 that a single step you make
0:34:49 makes no sound
0:34:52 [Music]
0:34:57 we go to the next round at the top of
0:34:59 initiative is johnny the two of them
0:35:01 both down the staircase already so far
0:35:03 brett has gone down the seconds uh win
0:35:05 is rapidly
0:35:07 descending
0:35:08 [Music]
0:35:11 johnny wants to uh to see if he can spot
0:35:14 a location on
0:35:16 an adjacent building that he can leap to
0:35:19 to kind of keep the two of them
0:35:22 in view
0:35:23 because i want to be a safety net just
0:35:25 in case the assassin goes after them or
0:35:27 if or her plan doesn't work and they
0:35:30 need somebody to help bail him out you
0:35:31 totally spot a space give me a strength
0:35:33 athletics
0:35:35 uh difficulty four remember to add your
0:35:37 opponents
0:35:39 eight successes
0:35:40 and i have leaps and bounds
0:35:42 you jump upwards of 100 feet and land
0:35:46 safely
0:35:47 on the roof of a nearby building you
0:35:49 kind of land on like all this like
0:35:51 gravel and like sediment that's kept up
0:35:53 there and you turn and see when still
0:35:58 like tumbling her way down the side of
0:36:00 the the building just going faster and
0:36:03 faster and
0:36:04 it's starting to look really dangerous
0:36:07 uh do i spot another location further
0:36:10 down that i might be able to intersect
0:36:11 her and maybe grab her out of the air
0:36:14 there are other balconies
0:36:16 for like lower levels in theory you can
0:36:18 try something along those lines but
0:36:20 again she's falling so fast that you may
0:36:22 well
0:36:23 find yourself going down with her it's
0:36:24 true but i do have celerity yeah so yeah
0:36:27 um we really do have to get to teaching
0:36:29 you fortitude
0:36:31 look we all should have gone
0:36:33 punch real hard
0:36:35 he's got he's got faith she's gonna do
0:36:36 what she's gonna do he's really just
0:36:38 kind of uh staying with her on the
0:36:40 descent as fast as he can because i'm
0:36:43 i'm concerned that an assassin is going
0:36:45 to try and take them out of the air we
0:36:48 go to Britta
0:36:50 well
0:36:51 that's a suspicious step
0:36:53 but you can't dread case what you can't
0:36:55 see i don't think so
0:36:58 going going down that staircase i'm not
0:37:00 sure how to best use my Celerity in this
0:37:02 situation um
0:37:04 like
0:37:05 action wise versus speed wise if there's
0:37:07 a difference
0:37:09 uh yes okay so when it's dice you're
0:37:11 more nimble when it's actions you're
0:37:14 physically moving faster okay so if
0:37:16 you're looking to like cover more steps
0:37:18 you want actions okay then i'm gonna run
0:37:22 down and
0:37:24 have two additional actions rather than
0:37:26 one would you so are you just heading
0:37:28 down the ladder this turn okay so Britta
0:37:30 heads down the ladder and when we get to
0:37:33 you how much how many actions and are
0:37:35 you towards your transformation just the
0:37:37 one just the one but i'm spending a
0:37:38 blood this round to accelerate it okay
0:37:41 which means end of this round i will be
0:37:43 an owl you will be an hour okay then we
0:37:46 go to
0:37:48 miles proceeding forward as i have done
0:37:50 okay yeah you you get to the ladder
0:37:52 start going down i guess yep
0:37:54 we
0:37:55 hop ahead to uh actually Britta you're
0:37:58 down the ladder uh there's like a
0:38:00 another balcony to your right
0:38:02 or you can just kind of keep going down
0:38:05 uh it's basically like there's a ladder
0:38:07 that goes down to a point and then you
0:38:08 would essentially move less than five
0:38:10 feet to the next ladder and be able to
0:38:11 keep descending that way it's a little
0:38:14 unobtrusive passageway basically down to
0:38:17 the full quad level sorry the options
0:38:19 are between
0:38:21 staying on the ladder in the unobtrusive
0:38:23 pat situay
0:38:25 right or going out into the balcony i'm
0:38:27 gonna stick on the ladder okay
0:38:29 so it sounds like everyone is descending
0:38:32 down towards ground level
0:38:34 uh when i need a strength plus athletics
0:38:38 role difficulty eight to maintain
0:38:40 control of neil spending a willpower
0:38:43 strength athletics not to apply pressure
0:38:46 uh but if he falls it'll be at terminal
0:38:48 velocity and he'll meet final death
0:38:54 one success
0:38:55 one success is all you need
0:38:58 to get them down close to that ground
0:38:59 level uh he's a bit too heavy for the
0:39:02 wings to carry effectively but it does
0:39:04 allow you to slow the fall and guide him
0:39:06 and down on like the third floor up you
0:39:08 can kind of turn onto a balcony the two
0:39:10 of you slam into that like
0:39:12 like little cement uh area and
0:39:16 he lands torport but in one piece
0:39:18 and you land
0:39:21 give me a stamina plus a 42 draw
0:39:25 five successes
0:39:26 okay you take no levels of damage
0:39:29 as you hit the ground sturdy
0:39:38 the majority of you at this point have
0:39:40 made it down to the ground level
0:39:42 throngs of mortal masses walk by
0:39:46 not particularly interested in your
0:39:48 struggle this evening
0:39:50 two floors up on the balcony that's got
0:39:53 like a crack
0:39:54 in
0:39:55 its floor
0:39:57 is
0:39:58 a
0:40:00 rather
0:40:01 healthy looking owl
0:40:03 and a completely broken kindred
0:40:06 when
0:40:07 you are confident at this point
0:40:09 that neil
0:40:10 did not meet final death from the fall
0:40:13 but now you're here
0:40:15 alone with him
0:40:17 an owl
0:40:18 and a torpid kindred
0:40:23 all right
0:40:24 okay buddy the hard part's done now it's
0:40:26 the easy part
0:40:28 um so at this point
0:40:30 wind kind of gives a
0:40:31 look around to see if anyone is
0:40:34 paying any attention
0:40:36 johnny uh you can see johnny in the
0:40:38 distance kind of having moved somehow to
0:40:41 the building next door
0:40:43 and is watching you
0:40:46 from there kind of keeping lookout
0:40:48 she takes note of the fact that johnny's
0:40:50 there she kind of flaps her wings to let
0:40:52 him know that she sees him
0:40:54 johnny will uh
0:40:57 once again
0:40:59 channeling his superhuman strength and
0:41:01 speed
0:41:03 invigorate his muscles and
0:41:05 do a flying leap across the uh the gap
0:41:08 to join you on the balcony
0:41:11 when
0:41:12 looks around again is there anyone
0:41:13 inside the balcony
0:41:16 inside the glass door is the curtain
0:41:18 shut uh
0:41:19 so there's a light on curtains are shut
0:41:22 okay
0:41:23 so at this point
0:41:25 um if johnny is there
0:41:27 um wynn is going to start turning back
0:41:29 into a person
0:41:31 okay uh johnny uh do you see when
0:41:34 clearly revert back to her human form
0:41:38 okay
0:41:39 good [ __ ] work win yeah uh
0:41:43 desperation makes heroes of us all
0:41:45 oh he's still with us he's still with us
0:41:48 if you can get down i can drop him to
0:41:50 you
0:41:51 and we can get to the car
0:41:53 or vice versa but you're stronger so you
0:41:56 could take the weight of him coming down
0:41:57 better than i could
0:41:59 tell you what you stay up here and keep
0:42:01 an eye out for
0:42:02 uh Britta
0:42:04 and miles
0:42:05 i'll go see if i can retrieve the van
0:42:08 okay there might be people in here
0:42:11 there's a light on we'll tell them to
0:42:13 get the [ __ ] out if they uh if they come
0:42:15 out to the balcony
0:42:17 it'll be at least be a little bit before
0:42:18 his security comes or something like
0:42:20 that
0:42:21 all right just be fast man you got it
0:42:24 johnny wait
0:42:26 if all three of us go get the car then
0:42:28 all three of us are in one spot
0:42:30 and we just have to pick up miles and
0:42:32 Britta
0:42:34 that's true
0:42:35 let's let's keep the team together
0:42:39 counterpoint
0:42:40 if we're all in one spot
0:42:42 that's only one spot that this assassin
0:42:44 needs to hit
0:42:46 you can keep an eye out for the two of
0:42:47 them well i get get that vam all right
0:42:50 i'm not going to keep arguing about it
0:42:52 go for it
0:42:53 uh johnny will
0:42:55 take a moment to try and drop down
0:42:57 amidst the uh the crowd on the sidewalk
0:43:00 hopefully uh
0:43:01 he can pick kind of a discreet spot
0:43:04 where no one's gonna notice that he's
0:43:05 just
0:43:06 jumping off a building
0:43:08 once he lands down there
0:43:10 anybody who gives him any kind of side
0:43:11 eye he'll just be like piss off
0:43:14 and
0:43:15 we'll
0:43:16 walk towards the uh the valet and hand
0:43:19 him a key
0:43:21 or a little um
0:43:22 a number ticket to get the van back
0:43:25 the valley looks a little surprised to
0:43:27 see you
0:43:28 but then gives a slow nod and heads off
0:43:32 wind keeps our eyes peeled to see if
0:43:35 there's any sign of
0:43:37 Britta and miles coming down
0:43:39 um she kind of
0:43:41 she kind of holds neil awkwardly like a
0:43:43 middle school dance
0:43:45 um sort of thing uh to make it
0:43:48 in case anyone happens to be looking it
0:43:49 doesn't look like she's just holding a
0:43:51 corpse it looks like he's moving a
0:43:52 little bit
0:43:54 we get into burnish
0:43:56 yes we're full on weekend at bernie's
0:43:59 and we wait for johnny
0:44:01 or britta and miles
0:44:03 [Music]
0:44:10 that was better what are you two done
0:44:11 once they get to the ground Britta
0:44:13 looking charred uh make sure that miles
0:44:16 is behind her
0:44:18 don't forget fire doesn't add char to a
0:44:20 leather jacket yeah it's character
0:44:23 [Laughter]
0:44:26 right is there a ladder that we're
0:44:27 passing near the balcony that
0:44:29 wynn is dancing with nylon it's a little
0:44:31 bit of a distance
0:44:33 uh it'd be a little difficult to reach
0:44:35 her but you can if you take the time to
0:44:36 do it or we could yeah because i imagine
0:44:38 these fire escapes don't actually come
0:44:40 out on the bottom floor
0:44:42 right so yeah we'll get off and like
0:44:44 head towards her and then see what's
0:44:46 going on
0:44:47 as we're going um
0:44:51 miles
0:44:52 this step went silent
0:44:53 we gotta keep moving
0:44:56 i wasn't planning on standing here too
0:44:58 long but i need to figure out what's
0:44:59 going on
0:45:01 i assume she's still with
0:45:02 us yeah me too waiting for another
0:45:06 opportunity maybe
0:45:08 no i'm sure
0:45:09 do you think the car will
0:45:11 even
0:45:13 i would have trapped it if i were her
0:45:16 that's knowing which car it is
0:45:19 true
0:45:20 i mean
0:45:21 it's a pretty obvious car in this
0:45:23 particular parking garage but i don't
0:45:24 know if she knows that
0:45:26 if not there's plenty of other vehicles
0:45:28 for us to take
0:45:30 there's just ways to get that
0:45:31 information
0:45:33 well this is a lot of what-ifs but we
0:45:35 kind of have to keep moving forward
0:45:38 does wind spot them on the fire escape
0:45:40 yeah you can see them talking
0:45:42 she kind of gives a
0:45:44 wave so comma jazz hands
0:45:47 not wanting to attract too much
0:45:48 attention but wanting to let them know
0:45:50 that she sees them britta while climbing
0:45:52 up the ladder takes a second while
0:45:54 reaching up to still her hand but
0:45:57 doesn't slow that much uh getting to
0:45:59 join the other two yeah so we'll move
0:46:02 over and see what's going on
0:46:05 where's donnie he's getting the car
0:46:09 we should probably start making our way
0:46:10 to the garage
0:46:11 yeah
0:46:12 all right i'm still
0:46:14 blood swollen i'm probably the strongest
0:46:16 one here i'll climb down
0:46:18 can you one of you lower him down
0:46:21 why don't we just go through the inside
0:46:24 because there could be people in there
0:46:26 and i didn't have a way of counteracting
0:46:28 that but if you think you can then right
0:46:30 and we need to wrap neil in something
0:46:32 he's a little conspicuous oh i agree
0:46:35 uh johnny said at this point that the um
0:46:38 the driver comes back and
0:46:41 pulls up the van and gives you the keys
0:46:43 johnny uh pulls a uh
0:46:45 a bill out of his wallet
0:46:48 hands it to the guy
0:46:50 he gives a quick curt nod and uh thank
0:46:52 you
0:46:53 and
0:46:54 kind of moves off to continue his
0:46:56 business
0:46:57 johnny hops up into the uh the van
0:47:00 and pulls it around back to the front
0:47:02 balcony where uh he left win
0:47:05 uh as the group of you are talking you
0:47:06 can see johnny pulling up at the van oh
0:47:08 wait we don't have to go anywhere he's
0:47:10 here
0:47:11 all right can we at least
0:47:13 i don't know check it first
0:47:15 i mean he's driving it
0:47:18 okay we can definitely check it once
0:47:20 we're all inside and neil's out of sight
0:47:21 though
0:47:23 don't even know how i would go around
0:47:24 checking it so we're just gonna have to
0:47:26 keep going let's go
0:47:28 win will climb down the balcony if
0:47:30 possible stand on the roof of the van uh
0:47:33 that's gonna be pretty conspicuous okay
0:47:36 then she won't do that uh the climbing
0:47:38 down
0:47:39 part or the standing on the van part
0:47:41 probably the standing on the van okay
0:47:43 then she'll just climb up there's a
0:47:44 weird [ __ ] happening all the time around
0:47:46 here so they're not gonna care too much
0:47:48 but if you're just standing on a van
0:47:49 then yeah okay then she'll just climb
0:47:51 down
0:47:52 the balcony
0:47:54 uh once he gets to uh to the point on
0:47:57 the sidewalk where he needs to so johnny
0:47:59 will attempt to uh clear the the area
0:48:02 outside the van
0:48:03 by just uh giving kind of a mean mug
0:48:05 glare to anybody
0:48:07 who comes nearby so hopefully there
0:48:09 should be less people to uh
0:48:11 observe this weird
0:48:13 incidence of people coming off of the
0:48:16 the balcony up above and wind climbs
0:48:18 down and
0:48:19 kind of motions for them to
0:48:22 put
0:48:23 can you put a jacket on him or something
0:48:26 uh britta will shrug off her leather
0:48:27 jacket put it over
0:48:29 neil's head and look to miles for help
0:48:32 to
0:48:33 drop him down to heaven over the balcony
0:48:35 okay
0:48:36 i think we can let him down yeah once
0:48:38 he's over Britta will follow and wait
0:48:41 for miles yeah jump on down
0:48:44 wind loads him up into the van crawls in
0:48:46 after him
0:48:47 yeah Britta follows gets her jacket back
0:48:50 checks to see if those black marks are
0:48:53 still there or have they faded
0:48:55 uh in his veins the black marks are
0:48:57 still there okay can i roll
0:49:00 something on that i i'm looking at
0:49:02 academics medicine or science
0:49:05 uh based on your knowledges you know
0:49:06 that he is affected by some sort of
0:49:08 poison
0:49:09 but it's supernatural in nature and
0:49:11 you're not sure what okay
0:49:13 checking his veins breda gets
0:49:15 a closer look
0:49:17 frowns
0:49:18 places his wrist back down and waits
0:49:21 she seems about ready to wait to get
0:49:24 going
0:49:25 but she's still got that nagging thought
0:49:27 about the van
0:49:28 so as people are getting ready to drive
0:49:30 she's going to start searching around
0:49:31 for
0:49:32 something
0:49:33 she doesn't really know what she's
0:49:34 looking for but there's just a paranoia
0:49:36 to it
0:49:37 maybe like
0:49:39 enough to track earth why don't you roll
0:49:40 your aspects difficult to eat
0:49:42 okay she only has one dot of aspect so
0:49:45 you're rolling one die cool
0:49:47 no luck okay
0:49:49 so it looks like the group of you are
0:49:50 loading into the van johnny at the wheel
0:49:53 yep who's passenger albeit in the front
0:49:56 okay and the van
0:49:58 takes off
0:50:02 [Music]
0:50:05 so once they're on the road win will
0:50:08 kind of give neil a look over similar to
0:50:10 how Britta did but um she's going to
0:50:13 look at it with her occult eyes because
0:50:16 black veins that's very
0:50:18 seldom a medical thing
0:50:20 give me intelligence plus a cult
0:50:22 difficulty eat
0:50:25 one success with one success you'll know
0:50:27 that this is
0:50:29 uh something called the scorpion's touch
0:50:32 it is a tool of the Assamites
0:50:34 is there anything she can garner about
0:50:36 how long this is gonna last or anything
0:50:38 that can be done to shorten it there are
0:50:40 instances of it lasting as long as a
0:50:42 month
0:50:43 sometimes supposedly
0:50:45 if the person who has been afflicted is
0:50:47 weak willed
0:50:48 it can last forever
0:50:50 all right why don't you pull that thing
0:50:52 out of him it's not like it's stopping
0:50:53 the bleeding is there a thing in him
0:50:55 there's still a knife that was thrown
0:50:57 into his chest oh yeah we're gonna pull
0:50:58 that out
0:51:01 it is uh
0:51:02 a
0:51:04 thin
0:51:05 steel knife with a stone counterbalance
0:51:09 careful we don't know how potent that is
0:51:11 yep
0:51:12 um does neil still have the bag he does
0:51:16 okay
0:51:17 let's see we're not going to stick the
0:51:18 knife in there
0:51:21 oh no i'm just saying i'm not gonna put
0:51:22 the knife in the bag that neil still has
0:51:24 because i suspect that's important so
0:51:26 she finds like a glove compartment to
0:51:28 stick the knife
0:51:30 so that it's not just bouncing around in
0:51:32 the cab there's not really a glove in
0:51:34 the back as much as there is just like
0:51:35 extra like kind of like maybe under seat
0:51:38 storage
0:51:39 i was gonna say that there's there's a
0:51:40 lot of um
0:51:41 kind of like almost
0:51:43 just uh
0:51:45 travel blankets and like storage
0:51:46 blankets and things like that um that
0:51:48 you could like easily wrap it up in okay
0:51:52 um either way we're gonna stow this
0:51:53 knife safely
0:51:55 um
0:51:56 and win
0:51:57 kind of sits positions herself so she's
0:52:00 sitting beside neal's shoulders and kind
0:52:02 of
0:52:03 picks up the backpack that he has and
0:52:05 starts looking through it
0:52:07 because clearly jubair trusted
0:52:10 the in this in the safety of us more
0:52:12 than his own
0:52:13 and so this has to be pretty important
0:52:16 uh what languages can you read and speak
0:52:18 uh english uh you are not sure what
0:52:20 you're looking at okay
0:52:22 um but it definitely looks like
0:52:24 there are
0:52:25 some things that are very old kind of
0:52:27 like pressed between like very thick
0:52:29 pieces of plastic and kind of like
0:52:31 secured as best he could a lot of it
0:52:33 seems to be information that's been
0:52:34 transcribed from various places
0:52:38 want some kind of
0:52:40 copy
0:52:41 does it look like a copy or does it look
0:52:42 original that's been preserved
0:52:44 it looks like a very old copy okay
0:52:48 this looks like it's
0:52:49 it's old whatever it is
0:52:51 i'm not sure what language this is i'm
0:52:53 gonna have to
0:52:54 look into this some more
0:52:56 we should we need to figure out how to
0:52:58 wake up neil because i guarantee he
0:52:59 probably has more insight than i do yeah
0:53:01 he's the person to ask about this but
0:53:04 we should close that backpack back up in
0:53:06 case there's anything
0:53:08 about it miles do you think you could
0:53:10 you think you could even get them out of
0:53:11 that torpor with some of your blood
0:53:13 it's a possibility
0:53:15 also when i know you've got that knife
0:53:17 wrapped up maybe we should think about
0:53:18 not keeping it i wasn't planning on
0:53:20 keeping it but uh well and toss it out
0:53:22 the window i wasn't sure that's a better
0:53:24 idea
0:53:25 well i just i'm thinking that it might
0:53:27 be a good idea not to be uh
0:53:30 carrying that thing with us it might be
0:53:31 a way of tracking us i'm team toss it
0:53:34 out the window
0:53:35 maybe if you got something more subtle
0:53:36 than that but
0:53:38 i'm
0:53:39 flashing back currently to
0:53:41 the effect that the zantosa house has on
0:53:44 the environment around it and i'm
0:53:46 not sure i want to introduce something
0:53:48 with this kind of poison on it into an
0:53:51 environment i promise you new york
0:53:55 is already poisoned with much much worse
0:53:58 he could just wipe it off
0:54:00 all right well we'll
0:54:02 we'll wipe it off and i guess pull over
0:54:04 i don't just want to huck it somewhere
0:54:05 i'll put it somewhere and when wipes it
0:54:07 off on the moving blankets very
0:54:09 carefully
0:54:10 maybe throw the blankets out with it
0:54:12 yeah

0:58:20 to be yet um
0:58:22 uh i had plans on him confessing his
0:58:25 love for win
0:58:28 yeah he died while we were in a stupor
0:58:29 and got eaten there was not a chance for
0:58:32 final words sounds like jupiter was also
0:58:33 in that stupor yep you know honestly we
0:58:35 were all in a stupor so was he
0:58:37 who those could have been his last words
0:58:41 no no she cannot hear me no
0:58:43 so um but i will say it anyway he spent
0:58:45 all that time instead of getting us out
0:58:46 of the stupor
