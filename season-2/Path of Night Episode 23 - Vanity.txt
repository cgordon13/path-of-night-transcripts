0:00:30 weathers when a masquerade breach out of
0:00:32 dunkin donuts erupted into an explosive
0:00:34 fight with the sabbat pack the killing
0:00:36 spree the pair managed to escape with
0:00:38 their own lives hiding away after a
0:00:40 fortuitous run-in with chinese ally
0:00:42 kabir the ravnos hid them all from the
0:00:44 killing spree's hunters and told johnny
0:00:47 he needed his help to pick up allies
0:00:49 from jfk in new york city territory
0:00:51 crawling with more sabbat johnny agreed
0:00:53 to head out to repay old favors to his
0:00:55 friend before he and gwen headed to an
0:00:58 all-night diner to meet with weathers
0:01:00 the two worked to convince him that
0:01:02 there were still things in new haven
0:01:03 worth fighting for now to meet with the
0:01:06 rest of their quartering and talk about
0:01:07 the nights yet to come
0:01:10 johnny you wake up the next night
0:01:12 feeling a little restless in light of

0:01:20 you can kind of
0:01:21 already hear the buzzing of your beeper

0:01:27 reaches for his pack of morleys grabs
0:01:30 one of the morleys pops it into his
0:01:32 mouth lights up
0:01:34 lazily looks over at the beeper

0:01:39 over takes a look to see who's uh called
0:01:41 him it is
0:01:43 definitely

0:03:57 know what i mean now these men are very
0:04:00 dangerous extremists
0:04:01 and they believe that all of the git of
0:04:03 kaiyen should be destroyed but do not
0:04:06 worry my friend they are no longer able
0:04:07 to commit diabetes like they used to now

0:04:13 that i what the cain
0:04:17 johnny please it's not important and
0:04:19 you're saying they're not dl is this

0:05:06 of course what kind of wood panel piece
0:05:08 of [ __ ] did you find me
0:05:10 uh
0:05:11 perhaps providing you the vehicle is a
0:05:13 bit of a strong term i'm going to give
0:05:15 you some money and then you can use
0:05:16 whatever vehicle you want
0:05:18 from your share all right why do i not
0:05:22 trust a bag of money that you're giving
0:05:23 me
0:05:24 because you are a fool johnny fooled
0:05:26 with morals uh it is a bag of money all
0:05:30 right
0:05:31 all right so i'm going to give you ten
0:05:33 thousand dollars use what you need from
0:05:36 this to get what you want but understand
0:05:38 you are cutting into your share
0:05:41 ten thousand dollars johnny american
0:05:44 you realize that ten thousand dollars is
0:05:46 not going to buy me a decent vehicle
0:05:48 to get down to new york to pick somebody
0:05:50 up in right it will buy you a nice
0:05:52 crowbar and that crowbar will get you
0:05:53 any car you want johnny what is the
0:05:55 problem here
0:05:56 no problem kabir

0:06:00 just right taking down a message you're
0:06:01 going to take down a message give me a
0:06:03 second i kind of snap my fingers to the
0:06:05 bartender and
0:06:07 make a little sign for a pen
0:06:09 hoping that he's got one behind there so
0:06:10 yeah he heads over with a like a pen
0:06:13 like a little like a a little receipt
0:06:15 pad if you take notes he grabs that sets
0:06:18 it aside all right what am i what's up
0:06:20 putting on this uh this sign there's a
0:06:22 call sign
0:06:23 you will write down
0:06:25 a black hand shall rise and choke all
0:06:27 who oppose it
0:06:29 only he will understand i'm sorry what a
0:06:32 a black hand will rise
0:06:35 up and choke all who oppose it that is
0:06:38 the roughly the english translation you
0:06:40 can understand why i'm a little bit
0:06:42 hesitant to write that on a sign and
0:06:44 just be waiting around in new york i've
0:06:46 never known you to be a man who
0:06:47 hesitates
0:06:48 you are the strongest bruh i know all

0:06:54 my ass i mean every word
0:06:58 you are also about to be the richest i
0:07:00 think you greatly overestimate ten
0:07:02 thousand dollars and how far it
0:07:04 stretches
0:07:05 ah
0:07:06 for
0:07:07 a foolish man ten thousand dollars is a
0:07:09 night of fun but you are a wise man
0:07:11 johnny

0:07:16 fortune so getting back to the problem

0:07:38 minute kabir
0:07:39 johnny you just found out you're making
0:07:41 ten thousand dollars more than you
0:07:42 thought you were going to make ten
0:07:43 thousand dollars from you i doubt it's

0:08:09 time
0:08:10 that
0:08:18 i would laugh in any other situation but
0:08:20 i'm looking over my shoulder every
0:08:21 goddamn night with the killing spree
0:08:23 around
0:08:24 the
0:08:25 domain falling apart now is not the time
0:08:27 to be throwing jokes at me like this
0:08:29 johnny through all of your own life
0:08:32 you will be a moment away from death
0:08:35 there is always time to smile johnny
0:08:37 kind of cracks a half smile yeah i guess
0:08:39 you're right
0:08:41 but seriously i know exactly where miles
0:08:42 this place is so i will
0:08:45 drop the money off there i'll see you
0:08:47 then you simply follow the colorful cars
0:08:50 you laughs take care of my friend and he
0:08:52 hangs up is the same uh slaps down some
0:08:55 money to kind of just tip for the fact
0:08:57 that the the bars kind of acts as
0:09:00 johnny's personal office
0:09:02 and heads out with uh his notes about
0:09:05 the sign and his little bag that he's
0:09:08 planning on taking with him okay
0:09:12 [Music]
0:09:15 we will actually cut to
0:09:18 miles uh there's a knock at your door as
0:09:20 you're getting ready to start up your
0:09:22 evening
0:09:22 your manservant answers i also say i
0:09:25 don't answer
0:09:26 and shortly thereafter returns to you
0:09:29 perplexed who is it marcos uh i'm
0:09:32 not entirely sure
0:09:35 he did drop this off with a note for
0:09:37 johnny and he holds up an old navy
0:09:41 shopping bag
0:09:43 and
0:09:45 when he opens it up it is
0:09:48 completely filled with
0:09:50 cash just
0:09:52 fat stacks
0:09:54 of like smelly dirty money
0:09:59 that is the first time i've ever seen
0:10:00 money to needed to be actually laundered
0:10:05 very good sir
0:10:06 [Laughter]
0:10:13 it was a dope ass line tim
0:10:18 and
0:10:19 it was an excellent follower
0:10:21 even better for the follow-up from lex
0:10:23 thank you
0:10:25 i think this is like computer sock money
0:10:31 i believe that's some sort of intended
0:10:32 payment for johnny
0:10:34 which that is the exact impression i had
0:10:36 sir yes i really hope that he did
0:10:38 shimistry this money
0:10:40 and he decided to shimistry it as shock
0:10:43 sock money
0:10:46 like it could have been anything but he
0:10:47 decided to make it just the greatest
0:10:49 believable
0:10:51 i'll never doubt this
0:10:54 it probably means the job is on
0:10:57 do we have any transport for a number of
0:10:59 people
0:11:01 well i can make
0:11:02 arrangements for any sort of transport
0:11:04 you need
0:11:05 um
0:11:06 why don't
0:11:07 we see if the new
0:11:10 hummer is ready excellent i'll make
0:11:12 arrangements at once uh do you wish for
0:11:15 johnny to receive a phone call
0:11:17 yes that would be grand wait
0:11:19 he's probably got a beeper
0:11:21 so yeah attack his paper see if he'll
0:11:22 respond
0:11:23 sir
0:11:24 your quarterly does not yet have phones
0:11:27 oh we will be gifting them the phones
0:11:28 today ah very good then
0:11:30 and he will
0:11:32 uh turn excuse himself
0:11:34 and he will shoot johnny a beeper
0:11:37 message
0:11:38 saying you know ready
0:11:40 and i
0:11:42 after about 10 minutes or so
0:11:45 he returns
0:11:46 uh with a little bit of a perplexed
0:11:48 expression just may i um
0:11:52 is the intent to arrive incognito
0:11:55 i don't
0:11:56 i mean probably i don't really know the
0:11:59 extent of this i don't know that we have
0:12:00 anything on hand that would fulfill this
0:12:02 function
0:12:05 um
0:12:07 anything we could procure or borrow
0:12:09 yes of course
0:12:11 this might be time for one of those
0:12:13 oversized ugly black suv deals
0:12:17 perhaps we should ask johnny what he
0:12:18 prefers no fine
0:12:20 i he kind of pauses when you give a
0:12:23 negative response
0:12:25 it is his thing i just i have standards
0:12:28 i understand uh but if it is not your
0:12:31 intention to keep this vehicle uh who do
0:12:34 you wish to have it
0:12:36 oh right i just figured we'd borrow it
0:12:39 from like i don't know the ventrue
0:12:41 parking lot full of
0:12:43 black suvs or something i believe those
0:12:45 are taken sir
0:12:48 yes by The Ventrue um but i can make
0:12:51 arrangements
0:12:53 so
0:12:54 even worse than a black uh suv
0:12:58 a
0:12:59 grody looking
0:13:01 utility like dodge sprinter van like
0:13:04 just a white just what happened yeah but
0:13:07 yeah i mean it was white at one point it
0:13:09 is like stained now and kind of beaten
0:13:11 up it has a few like just like kind of
0:13:13 like
0:13:14 utility bumper stickers of how am i
0:13:16 driving on the back and whatnot one of
0:13:18 the tail lights is is like out like
0:13:21 fogged up to the point where like
0:13:23 uh
0:13:24 um but it's driving nothing's broken
0:13:26 just doesn't look very good pulls up
0:13:29 outside of your haven
0:13:31 johnny jumps out of the passenger seat
0:13:34 and some guy
0:13:35 just pops out of the driver's seat and
0:13:37 they walk around like they're kind of
0:13:38 doing business
0:13:40 johnny gives him a finger like wait
0:13:42 right here walks up the long pathway to
0:13:45 the uh to the haven
0:13:47 and knocks in the door don't answer it
0:13:50 he gives a silent nod
0:13:52 and slowly draws a revolver no no
0:13:55 different different scenario it's mostly
0:13:58 because that
0:14:00 machine
0:14:01 is an insult
0:14:02 so we shall insult him back yes sir
0:14:05 he needs service he walks over the door
0:14:07 and you hear a click as the door locks
0:14:11 and giving like
0:14:13 like a like a like a sycophant's nod
0:14:16 like you know what i mean like trying to
0:14:17 be getting close with you he gives you
0:14:19 that nod my return is not then he heads
0:14:21 about his business
0:14:22 johnny uh palms the door inwards with
0:14:25 potence
0:14:26 just shattering the lock
0:14:29 i had not expected that response sir
0:14:32 i mean i semi did you're gonna have to
0:14:34 dig out one of the replacements yes sir
0:14:36 he kind of like
0:14:38 sulks off to go take care he gives he
0:14:39 gives an expression like what the hell
0:14:41 have you seen the vehicle that's in my
0:14:42 driveway yeah i'm taking it down to new
0:14:45 york
0:14:46 that is
0:14:48 the most insulting piece of machinery
0:14:49 that has ever been in this parking uh
0:14:51 i'm sorry i thought i did pretty well i
0:14:53 there should be about 10 grand waiting
0:14:55 here
0:14:56 there is 10 grand actually is a pretty
0:14:58 good value for that for that van i'm
0:15:00 sorry what
0:15:01 no
0:15:02 no it's not i have some used bubble gum
0:15:06 look that thing is incognito it's going
0:15:08 to get us down to new york just fine
0:15:11 i checked the engine absolutely the
0:15:13 mechanics are great on that thing what's
0:15:15 the over under on it turning into an
0:15:17 inferno
0:15:18 it's it's fine just because it's not
0:15:21 like
0:15:22 you know
0:15:24 lacquer yellow or you know storm pink or
0:15:27 whatever you drive
0:15:28 storm pink
0:15:30 i don't know so that isn't even a color
0:15:32 yeah i was thinking the same thing is
0:15:34 there the money here yes you may take
0:15:36 your
0:15:37 hard earned money here to buy your
0:15:42 vehicle
0:15:43 johnny reaches out and grabs the old
0:15:45 navy bag looks in it and kind of rolls
0:15:47 his eyes
0:15:49 i think he put nickels in here god damn
0:15:51 it
0:15:53 yeah walks back over to where the uh the
0:15:56 the driver of this
0:15:58 awful utility van is
0:16:00 looks in the uh the bag
0:16:02 just kind of hands it to him he takes
0:16:04 the bag
0:16:05 gives it a look
0:16:06 damn all right well thank you johnny
0:16:09 reaches a handout for the keys he tosses
0:16:11 you the keys offers a handshake and then
0:16:14 he is on his way seemingly taking out a
0:16:16 cell phone to call for a ride johnny
0:16:18 jumps in the van and actually pulls it
0:16:20 into miles driveway
0:16:22 no
0:16:23 if you wanted to be in one piece get it
0:16:25 out of my driveway so that i'm guessing
0:16:27 the gate doesn't open for him
0:16:30 right
0:16:32 johnny just kind of takes a look uh make
0:16:35 sure it's at least out of the road and
0:16:37 leaves it there
0:16:38 heads back up to the uh to the haven
0:16:40 that is
0:16:42 the single most disturbing thing i've
0:16:44 seen look i got to make it down to uh to
0:16:47 new york this is the best thing to get
0:16:48 down there we might have some heat on
0:16:51 the way there honestly i i might
0:16:53 appreciate having the rest of the
0:16:54 coterie with me for this pickup very
0:16:56 good i was thinking that we should
0:16:58 probably all go anyways since
0:17:00 who knows what's going to be down there
0:17:01 hey look at that you and i are agreeing
0:17:03 for once maybe something won't be so bad
0:17:05 after all johnny kind of pushes past in
0:17:08 kind of a
0:17:09 flippant way like he maybe just didn't
0:17:11 completely mean the uh the good
0:17:13 sentiments and heads and doors miles
0:17:16 school looks at him gestures to his
0:17:18 revolver
0:17:22 i whisper quietly to marcos i'm like
0:17:25 we could always have it the police
0:17:26 called and have a tote out of here
0:17:29 yes sir no don't don't oh oh that was a
0:17:32 joke yes of course
0:17:34 good one sir
0:17:37 marcos
0:17:38 yes put it on a schedule we need to talk
0:17:40 when i get back to
0:17:41 of course uh
0:17:42 when would you like it scheduled for
0:17:44 um the next available night once we get
0:17:48 back so it'd be sometime tomorrow the
0:17:49 day after
0:17:50 first thing very well i will do so
0:17:53 otherwise prepare the gear i think we're
0:17:55 moving up i'll prepare your equipment at
0:17:57 once thank you he turns and sets about
0:18:00 to do that
0:18:01 did you call anyone else in he says to
0:18:03 johnny
0:18:04 uh
0:18:05 i uh i gave a uh call out to uh
0:18:09 to wins beeper i figured britto would be
0:18:11 here with you you want to give her a
0:18:13 call yeah so i will dial up
0:18:16 Britta
0:18:20 [Music]
0:18:24 i figure
0:18:25 cell phones used to have like charms on
0:18:27 them right they can't flip the flip ones
0:18:29 that have like one
0:18:34 they definitely can actually they still
0:18:35 do in japan it's a big thing okay
0:18:38 so i figure Britta would have one of
0:18:39 those like flip phones that would have
0:18:41 the charms tingling off the end
0:18:42 and so there's that like that tiny bit
0:18:44 of like it's not really a clatter but
0:18:46 just like flare yeah
0:18:49 as she picks up the phone are Britta and
0:18:51 wynn probably in the same place yeah
0:18:53 yeah having soon woken up recently yup
0:18:56 and Britta flips open her phone
0:18:58 hello Britta this is miles good to hear
0:19:01 from you

0:21:12 sounds good all right
0:21:14 i should be all set i don't think i need
0:21:16 to stop by my place okay then that's
0:21:19 Britta gets together what she would need
0:21:21 that she has mostly just
0:21:23 the red leather jacket from johnny and
0:21:25 they're about ready to go wyn puts on
0:21:27 her own leather jacket and kind of pats
0:21:30 down her pockets just to see what she
0:21:31 has on her all right i'm good to go if
0:21:34 you are Britta make sure she has all the
0:21:35 equipment that she has but she knows
0:21:37 she's getting some from miles so
0:21:39 uh the two do we have a way to get there
0:21:41 should we i was just gonna walk how far
0:21:44 away you probably have a borrowed car
0:21:46 not one of my favorite cars but like
0:21:49 the chevy blazer like a brown like the
0:21:52 brown you have some pathetic shelby no
0:21:54 actually uh
0:21:56 johnny has the blazer last time we
0:21:58 checked um
0:21:59 so she probably has like the brown bmw
0:22:02 man i can't keep track of your cars
0:22:04 hang on i'm going to write that down
0:22:06 that's my incognito video lexus from
0:22:08 last year
0:22:10 in a standard color what is this garbage
0:22:13 all right and you do you need a point
0:22:15 but you just need the point if it's in
0:22:17 uh
0:22:18 manual right you can you drive normally
0:22:20 if it's automatic or do you need it just
0:22:21 for manual how does that work if it is
0:22:24 automatic i'm sorry if it's manual you
0:22:26 need to at least try one okay is it
0:22:28 automatic or manual do you have more
0:22:30 than one drive
0:22:31 it's never been fully discovered in
0:22:33 character let's go with automatic then
0:22:35 because we assume nothing about what you
0:22:37 know to be fair i think it's got five at
0:22:39 this point in the 90s most luxury cars
0:22:42 were just automatic okay
0:22:44 it was an aspect of being on that was
0:22:46 that was considered
0:22:47 honestly like late 80s to like the you
0:22:49 know mid 90s it was unless they're
0:22:51 specifically like sports performance
0:22:52 cars right but yeah i think most of the
0:22:54 sports cars like are like nice luxury
0:22:56 vehicles where like automatically
0:22:58 yeah that was a feature
0:23:00 cool then brett and nguyen are going to
0:23:02 get in the car and head on over all
0:23:04 right uh the two of you rendezvous back
0:23:07 at miles's place
0:23:09 is there an ice cream truck parked in
0:23:11 front of miles house our ice cream
0:23:14 truck's supposed to be that beat up oh
0:23:16 no that's that's a kidnapping van i hope
0:23:18 everything's all right they could go
0:23:20 check
0:23:27 anyways while they're going do you need
0:23:29 anything i don't think so
0:23:31 i've got most of the things i need in
0:23:33 the uh in the bug out bag here um if you
0:23:36 have some heavy duty sleeping bags
0:23:40 might not be a bad idea just in case
0:23:42 we're hit up for a place to stay but
0:23:44 kabir said that he's made arrangements
0:23:46 down in in
0:23:48 new york
0:23:49 for a impromptu haven in case things
0:23:52 work out that way and i guess the the
0:23:55 flight we're grabbing this person at
0:23:56 isn't supposed to be coming in till late
0:23:58 in the evening and i mean more like
0:24:01 early in the morning so got it jesus
0:24:04 what happened to the door oh [ __ ] it
0:24:06 might be a kidnapping all right go loud
0:24:08 or go quiet quiet all right wind kind of
0:24:11 like eases up to the door
0:24:13 why don't the two of you give me decks
0:24:14 plus stealth rules
0:24:18 miles why don't you guys give me
0:24:19 perception plus alertness nah
0:24:24 johnny's boots are up and he's smoking
0:24:25 cigarettes he's not listening
0:24:28 yeah one success all right so that's
0:24:30 enough to get by johnny one success
0:24:33 uh i have six successes
0:24:36 when uh
0:24:38 you agree to go quiet and something
0:24:40 comes over Britta and she gives a nod
0:24:44 gestures hand signals to you that you
0:24:46 don't recognize and then vanishes into
0:24:49 the house
0:24:50 oh god this girl there's no response not
0:24:52 even footsteps and wind
0:24:55 proceeds into the house assuming she's
0:24:57 gonna find a horrible blood scene
0:25:00 because she's lost track of this girl
0:25:03 and doesn't know what she's walking into
0:25:05 inside
0:25:06 you find johnny with his boots kicked up
0:25:10 he's smoking a cigarette inside miles
0:25:13 haven miles what are you doing i am
0:25:15 probably
0:25:16 putting my gear together in a separate
0:25:18 room
0:25:18 and there's
0:25:19 bridal stuff laid out on the counter
0:25:21 miles
0:25:22 you notice wind creeping into your haven
0:25:27 snooping around for any signs of danger
0:25:29 she's got a
0:25:32 very suspicious expression on her like
0:25:34 she just does not trust the situation
0:25:36 with your haven whatsoever usually
0:25:39 people knock
0:25:41 jesus
0:25:42 are you okay i mean someone broke my
0:25:44 door yeah
0:25:46 and there's a kidnapping van parked
0:25:48 outside i totally agree oh my god you're
0:25:51 all overreact all right yes i i may have
0:25:53 overreacted with the door but the van's
0:25:55 perfectly good johnny killing spree in
0:25:58 the area door is busted in kidnapping
0:26:00 ban marcos locked me out purposely it's
0:26:03 because your van is ugly you busted the
0:26:06 because it was ugly yes so everyone's
0:26:09 okay Britta just is behind uh johnny
0:26:13 god
0:26:15 oh i miss neil i'm so proud of you learn
0:26:17 obfuscate what
0:26:19 i can't do can she
0:26:22 can she obfuscate
0:26:26 [Laughter]
0:26:32 what no it just it looked like a
0:26:34 kidnapping all right
0:26:36 it's all
0:26:37 is it
0:26:38 good marcos everything's fine i mean
0:26:40 there's still that ugly ass van out
0:26:41 there but otherwise yes no i knock to
0:26:43 get in and i see these two [ __ ]
0:26:46 standing in the foyer looking at me and
0:26:48 then marcos comes over and just locks
0:26:49 the door i mean did he see you or just
0:26:52 the van i mean i'm pretty sure they saw
0:26:54 me standing at the door knocking okay
0:26:56 dick move but you don't
0:26:58 you're right you're right i took a step
0:27:00 too far as it's but it's been one of
0:27:01 those kind of weeks right it has
0:27:05 just lucky that i keep spare doors
0:27:08 that's a thing how many Brujah friends do
0:27:11 you have i just have the one well it
0:27:13 involves sometimes broken doors i i have
0:27:16 never had that problem how many houses
0:27:18 have you had one is it that it's a shack
0:27:20 right how long it has a door can the
0:27:23 record show that wind has never locked
0:27:25 the door on me when i've knocked can
0:27:26 that door be locked i can prop a cinder
0:27:28 block up against it so
0:27:30 the record can show
0:27:32 that the door cannot be locked i mean
0:27:34 define lock
0:27:36 it's locked against a lot of stuff and
0:27:38 she's and she's never put the cinder
0:27:39 block in my way either so let's just how
0:27:41 often have you actually been out there
0:27:43 Britta's just quietly efficiently putting
0:27:45 on all the gear like that tactical
0:27:47 memory is like kicking back in while
0:27:49 this argument is happening uh kid you
0:27:52 might want to you might want to loosen
0:27:53 up all the gear we're not
0:27:55 it's going to be a while for us to get
0:27:57 down to new york and it might be
0:27:58 uncomfortable to be riding like that the
0:28:00 whole way i mean sure but it looks like
0:28:03 we're expecting to maybe catch some heat
0:28:05 on the way there
0:28:07 i think we're probably more likely to
0:28:08 catch you after we've picked up the
0:28:10 person that uh
0:28:11 we're looking to get johnny gets a nod
0:28:14 and she loosens up just a bit it's uh
0:28:18 enough to qualify as having followed the
0:28:20 instruction hey by the way how good is
0:28:21 your handwriting
0:28:23 we all look over like
0:28:25 how good is her handwriting is there
0:28:27 something that i should is this a thing
0:28:29 is that calligraphy or something
0:28:31 no there's no there's no there's a
0:28:33 totally character choice i am going to
0:28:35 go with Britta has like art school
0:28:37 handwriting you know that's sort of like
0:28:39 tiny but neat it's all in like capitals
0:28:41 unless she thinks about it like a serial
0:28:43 killer
0:28:46 but her answer her answer to johnny
0:28:48 that's pretty good all right great he uh
0:28:50 grabs a little receipt book uh note that
0:28:52 he took hands you uh up the the note and
0:28:55 says can you copy that onto a little bit
0:28:57 of a signage i think miles has uh has a
0:29:00 room where he keeps things like markers
0:29:02 and and poster board and probably one of
0:29:04 his office closets pretty automatically
0:29:07 Britta takes out like a nice quality uh
0:29:10 liquid tip pen and she looks to the note
0:29:12 Britta immediately spaces out looking at
0:29:15 the note so she looks to the note she
0:29:16 picks it up as soon as her eyes connect
0:29:18 to it the hand with a pen goes
0:29:21 completely still Britta goes completely
0:29:23 still but in that kind of lethal muscles
0:29:25 ready way i was just going to ask is is
0:29:28 this a uh is this a manchurian candidate
0:29:30 assassin stiff or is this toried or wow
0:29:34 kabir has a really good hand right or
0:29:35 johnny's really good handwriting yeah at
0:29:37 first uh you're not sure maybe johnny's
0:29:40 handwriting is indeed that wonderful
0:29:43 that a tory door would stop and then she
0:29:45 turns her hand her left hand looks down
0:29:49 at it and with the black pen
0:29:51 she begins to draw this like mark like
0:29:55 like jamming the nail the the the the uh
0:29:58 ballpoint of the pen into her palm and
0:30:00 just dragging it up towards her index
0:30:04 finger and back around towards the base
0:30:06 of her hand just back and forth and
0:30:08 backwards
0:30:10 stop stop stop there's no response i
0:30:13 grab her wrist to stop her from gouging
0:30:16 into herself uh she immediately tries to
0:30:18 stab your hand with the pen
0:30:20 the second she her she's not like just
0:30:22 scratching and and digging into her palm
0:30:25 she comes to and is britta again
0:30:30 what the hell happened do i remember
0:30:31 what happened uh no you
0:30:34 you just feel very anxious what
0:30:36 johnny slowly gets up and
0:30:39 uh moves up the wind's side gently takes
0:30:41 the the note and the pencil and says
0:30:43 i'll or the pen
0:30:45 i'll maybe take care of that myself then
0:30:47 and he leaves the room i'm sorry i i
0:30:50 don't miles is definitely in that ready
0:30:52 stance where he's got the like katana
0:30:54 draw ready to go
0:30:56 win kind of like holds her hand like in
0:30:58 hers and kind of covers it with her own
0:31:01 on instinct
0:31:03 do you you know how to use your blood to
0:31:06 fix it right
0:31:07 i'm sorry when i are you okay do i
0:31:10 remember what i read at all yes okay uh
0:31:14 remind me what it said it said it said
0:31:16 the black hand will rise up and choke
0:31:21 all who oppose all who oppose it am i
0:31:24 left lucks with any feeling i remember
0:31:27 what i read and i
0:31:29 have
0:31:30 probably a bit of gouging on my hand uh
0:31:32 i don't know if i have any damage
0:31:34 gouging no your palm just kind of feels
0:31:36 a little scratchy like you were going at
0:31:38 it uh and you yourself just feel anxious
0:31:42 and
0:31:42 uncomfortable that something engendered
0:31:45 this sort of reaction from you
0:31:47 um it's it's all right when it didn't
0:31:49 really
0:31:50 break the skin much okay after a few
0:31:53 moments johnny comes back in and just
0:31:55 sets a uh
0:31:56 some office supplies from miles office
0:32:00 and
0:32:01 takes a look at what happened to the
0:32:02 hand and notices
0:32:05 that it is in a very distinct crescent
0:32:07 moon shape it's an interesting shape you
0:32:10 drew on your palm
0:32:12 um
0:32:12 i mean it said black hand so
0:32:16 maybe
0:32:17 that has something to do with it
0:32:19 um
0:32:21 i've seen this symbol in someone else's
0:32:22 hand
0:32:23 you have
0:32:25 my sire had a tattoo like this on his
0:32:27 hands and everyone that ever talked
0:32:30 spoke about him
0:32:31 referred to him as the black hand so i
0:32:34 have some connection to your sire i
0:32:36 always thought that
0:32:39 that was his name
0:32:40 now i'm starting to think that whatever
0:32:42 the black hand is
0:32:44 goes way past just him and it connects
0:32:48 to whoever we're picking up
0:32:50 they have something to do with the sabot
0:32:53 so do you
0:32:54 britta kind of takes a breath in and uh
0:32:57 straightens up kind of in the way of
0:32:59 like someone who straightens up to get
0:33:01 away from themselves but you can't
0:33:04 and uh she runs her thumb over the mark
0:33:08 that's on her palm trying to like smear
0:33:11 it
0:33:11 but it's pretty in there after how hard
0:33:14 she was scratching i think that must
0:33:16 have something to do with
0:33:18 the
0:33:19 shadow crusade
0:33:21 then
0:33:22 maybe if it's all connected somehow
0:33:25 how much more have you discovered about
0:33:26 that it seems like you're still doing
0:33:28 things unconsciously i don't know what
0:33:31 sets it off sometimes things like this
0:33:33 just
0:33:34 i don't remember anything and i don't
0:33:36 remember anything to do with a hand or i
0:33:39 guess maybe a crescent that doesn't ring
0:33:41 a bell with anything else that has
0:33:43 popped up for me we need to get this
0:33:45 under control
0:33:47 i don't think you should be armed
0:33:49 coming down this ride with us
0:33:51 okay i think any i think any weapons
0:33:52 that you're gonna have are gonna be in
0:33:54 the care of miles and you gotta ask him
0:33:57 to give him to you Britta kind of stares
0:33:59 forward uh but after a moment of that
0:34:03 emotion underneath the surface she takes
0:34:06 the gun that she has provided flips it
0:34:08 around
0:34:09 and hands it over to miles
0:34:11 miles will take the gun and tuck it into
0:34:14 i guess the behind the bands as he
0:34:15 already has his own holstered so
0:34:18 and that goes for any other weapon that
0:34:19 you might have provided her with is her
0:34:21 hands still kind of cut open from the
0:34:23 pen uh it's she's damaged a few layers
0:34:25 of skin but she hasn't like drawn blood
0:34:27 or anything he looks at the hand
0:34:30 focus on your blood Britta is that really
0:34:32 worth doing for this i mean the ink will
0:34:35 still be there just reminding you that
0:34:38 of
0:34:39 what you are
0:34:40 that's all Britta looks uncomfortable
0:34:42 but there's a nod back to johnny and she
0:34:45 does focus for a second
0:34:47 uh to do as he's asking
0:34:49 so are we good to go
0:34:50 for now
0:34:52 though we might need to dig into this
0:34:53 more your episodes had not popped up as
0:34:56 much but maybe if we dig into the more
0:34:58 we'll be able to
0:35:00 more understand what the blockage is
0:35:02 about
0:35:03 miles you have something that like
0:35:05 i don't know something that could
0:35:07 stop me
0:35:09 if the thing with veto happens
0:35:11 again maybe whoever we're going to pick
0:35:13 up i don't i i don't want to have that
0:35:16 reaction again i don't understand the
0:35:18 blockages that you have but we could try
0:35:20 something i think step one is making
0:35:22 sure you don't have an automatic weapon
0:35:23 in your hands
0:35:25 okay we do but she's
0:35:27 fast and talented so that's not gonna
0:35:30 prevent that no i can try something
0:35:33 would you guys
0:35:34 why don't you follow me to my office
0:35:36 okay i'll load up some more stuff into
0:35:38 the van thank him i'll give you a hand
0:35:40 johnny do you mind if i open the gate
0:35:42 yes i will allow it in the parking lot
0:35:44 johnny nods and heads outside when polos
0:35:47 i bring brett into the offices
0:35:50 i'm going to try the same thing i did to
0:35:51 you right after veto
0:35:53 the veto incident
0:35:55 all right british just kind of head down
0:35:58 uh you can you can feel
0:36:00 almost in the way of like when
0:36:02 something's very hot you can see the
0:36:03 heat waves coming off of it that's sort
0:36:05 of frustration beneath the surface
0:36:07 but it sorts herself we need to
0:36:10 maybe we can break into your memory some
0:36:12 more
0:36:13 especially with the word shadow crusade
0:36:14 maybe we can use that to
0:36:17 dig around and see if that'll uncover
0:36:19 more things and
0:36:21 maybe with what romeo showed me that
0:36:22 won't help as well hopefully and then i
0:36:25 will instruct you to listen to my
0:36:27 breathing and then go into
0:36:30 telling you that
0:36:32 you know fall into a mesmerism because
0:36:33 and
0:36:35 the
0:36:36 general instructions if you are told to
0:36:38 stop by myself or someone in the coterie
0:36:41 you will just stop all actions all right
0:36:44 miles
0:36:45 and sheam
0:36:46 sits if that's what he directs her to do
0:36:49 i believe we can do it standing it
0:36:50 shouldn't take long okay she squares her
0:36:52 feet squares her shoulders and uh looks
0:36:55 towards miles
0:36:56 so that's the three up
0:36:59 oh my god
0:37:01 the hell oh that is
0:37:04 two successes
0:37:07 there's a lot of ones there's a lot of
0:37:08 ones yeah
0:37:11 what's two successes getcha
0:37:13 the vampire score is one or two sets the
0:37:15 subject can be cannot be forced to do
0:37:16 anything that seems strange to her
0:37:19 am i
0:37:20 well we'll find out later i think for
0:37:21 the purposes of story you're perfect
0:37:23 you're exactly where you need to be
0:37:26 dice tell a story man
0:37:29 britta seems to be trying her hardest to
0:37:31 be adherent and to be a perfect student
0:37:35 to being
0:37:36 monitored all right i think we're ready
0:37:38 to go give ourselves a double check and
0:37:40 we'll be on our way all right and we
0:37:42 head outside and i grimace at the van
0:37:45 is this van allowed within a school zone
0:37:47 definitely not this van is perfectly
0:37:50 serviceable that wasn't her that wasn't
0:37:52 my question i mean do we need to be in a
0:37:54 school zone i don't know let's hope not
0:37:57 look it it's good it even has a tape
0:37:59 deck we're fine you know they make cds
0:38:01 now ah i don't trust him of course you
0:38:03 don't i'm just saying you just a little
0:38:06 bit of shake and the thing starts
0:38:07 skipping all over the place
0:38:09 all right
0:38:10 still shotgun Britta climbs into the back
0:38:13 she she is not going to be the driver of
0:38:14 the situation wind climbs in the back is
0:38:17 are there windows in the back of this
0:38:18 fan
0:38:20 yeah absolutely it's a no it's a utility
0:38:22 van so there are uh even most of the
0:38:24 utility events there's one on the door
0:38:26 sometimes yeah that's what i mean and
0:38:28 then the back yeah backpack oh i mean
0:38:30 like the sides of it no the sides are
0:38:31 just it's got you got the two
0:38:33 uh windows uh for driver passenger and
0:38:36 then there's there's a couple of kind of
0:38:38 like just uh tinted windows on the back
0:38:40 door yeah okay
0:38:42 doors is it clean
0:38:44 yeah mostly clean but there's definitely
0:38:47 a layer of of just grime from
0:38:49 it being used as a work van for a while
0:38:52 has a the smell of stale cigarettes in
0:38:54 it but it's not like that's it i mean
0:38:56 it's been vacuumed and stuff
0:38:57 who are you picking up a a friend of
0:39:00 kabirs from the east
0:39:03 how far east
0:39:04 uh not the far east uh i'm i'm guessing
0:39:07 probably from somewhere in the uh in the
0:39:08 middle east i'm assuming there's like a
0:39:10 window between the two so that they can
0:39:12 talk yeah the the front the front two
0:39:14 seats there's a there's a little like uh
0:39:17 there's a little like kind of like uh
0:39:19 there's like a middle kind of like metal
0:39:20 uh cage grating
0:39:22 um but there's a door that uh
0:39:25 a doorway that you could get out of the
0:39:27 front the passenger or the driver and
0:39:29 head towards the back and in the back
0:39:31 there's actually some bench seats that's
0:39:33 um this is fancy because normally it's
0:39:35 just like bucket seats like a literally
0:39:37 overturned buckets in the back there
0:39:40 no johnny spent his 10 grand well
0:39:44 yeah best [ __ ] response to that
0:39:46 possible
0:39:48 guys look i didn't just like blow the
0:39:49 cash all right
0:39:52 it's got an ashtray it's got low mileage
0:39:54 on it too it's got low mileage and it's
0:39:55 been beaten this hard oh yeah and you
0:39:57 should see
0:39:58 contractors use these things like crazy
0:40:00 yeah i can tell yeah but they don't
0:40:02 usually install benches i mean i'm not
0:40:04 gonna be overly picky but i am gonna
0:40:05 comment oh um miles maybe if you've got
0:40:09 some spare curtains or something if we
0:40:12 ever have to stay in the van possibly
0:40:14 actually i've got some tarp in my uh in
0:40:16 my uh bug out bag just for that uh
0:40:20 scenario sounds good though i would
0:40:22 recommend if we're gonna put up if we're
0:40:23 gonna stay in a van and put up tarp we
0:40:25 should also have some sleeping bags to
0:40:26 get inside of as well all right the more
0:40:28 layers between us and the outside the
0:40:30 better we probably have a few sleeping
0:40:32 bags but probably not too many we might
0:40:33 all
0:40:34 it might be a layered thing if i if i
0:40:36 ever have to stay out on the road
0:40:38 usually what i'll have to do is just
0:40:39 i'll put up uh i'll put up some duct
0:40:41 tape on the windows with some cardboard
0:40:44 then usually uh use some tarp to give a
0:40:46 second layer of curtains and then i'll
0:40:48 usually tuck myself into a uh into a
0:40:51 sleeping bag and get all the way under
0:40:52 awesome all right believe me i'd rather
0:40:55 be well underground but let's get on our
0:40:57 way then probably watching marcos
0:40:59 put
0:41:00 put the new parts of the door together
0:41:06 [Music]
0:41:09 so
0:41:10 the group of you are just about ready to

0:44:01 hushes you like like pushes an index
0:44:03 finger to your lips and just keeps
0:44:05 staring uh the woman whoever this person
