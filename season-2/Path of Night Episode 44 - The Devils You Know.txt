0:00:06 story can include graphic violence drug

0:00:11 themes we've talked at our table about
0:00:13 safety comfort and consent both as
0:00:15 players and storytellers we know what to
0:00:17 expect we're all excited to be here and
0:00:19 we want you to feel the same so listener
0:00:21 discretion is advice
0:00:23 now
0:00:24 let's walk the path of night
0:00:28 last time on path of night at wyn's
0:00:31 haven kabir is badly injured by the
0:00:33 elder gangrel raven the coterie manages
0:00:35 to save kabir from final death and wind
0:00:37 speaks to raven about the er codex and
0:00:39 about the demon amidst the coterie
0:00:41 together the gang will make a tenuous
0:00:43 deal that win will see to it that the
0:00:45 demon is handled or raven will
0:00:48 the codery then investigates the
0:00:49 disappearance of jane johnny leads the
0:00:51 group to her haven from which neil is
0:00:53 able to track jane's current location
0:00:55 there the group finds mysterious
0:00:57 protections a strange assortment of
0:00:59 familiar mortals and jane staked
0:01:02 the coterie attempts to talk it out but
0:01:03 ultimately decides to give the mortal
0:01:05 some time in hopes that they won't have
0:01:07 to escalate to more extreme measures
0:01:10 [Music]
0:01:12 winning neil
0:01:14 i had to winshaven pick up little joey
0:01:17 and it's honestly a pretty quick ordeal
0:01:19 he's pretty ready to cooperate with
0:01:21 anything you request
0:01:23 so hey opsin
0:01:25 and the two of you
0:01:27 make your way back
0:01:29 uh the trip is actually pretty quiet
0:01:32 uh the only thing that really kind of
0:01:34 catches your attention
0:01:37 is in the direction of the tray there's
0:01:39 kind of like
0:01:41 a ton of
0:01:42 activity and you hear like the rapport
0:01:44 of like a gunshot
0:01:46 but you make it to british haven
0:01:48 unaccosted
0:01:49 upon entering the haven is
0:01:52 still quite secure
0:01:54 but there is this
0:01:56 this energy to it the place feels
0:01:59 haunted by
0:02:01 the stress of your quartering
0:02:03 and the weight of everything that's
0:02:05 resting on their shoulders
0:02:07 um brita is it right if joey has a look
0:02:09 around um
0:02:10 sure but maybe just warn him that i
0:02:14 don't know that that there might be
0:02:16 another person here
0:02:18 who else is here
0:02:20 well i'm not sure if how any of it
0:02:22 really works with with the
0:02:24 romeo or
0:02:26 oh well
0:02:28 wait i'm sorry it's been a really busy
0:02:30 couple of weeks did you
0:02:32 have romeo's here i haven't seen or felt
0:02:35 him
0:02:36 any time recently that i i think i just
0:02:39 there was that time a while back where
0:02:41 everything was cold and it kind of felt
0:02:43 like there was
0:02:44 yeah like my key was here
0:02:47 johnny is
0:02:48 stomping back and forth
0:02:51 um
0:02:52 quickly smoking through a morley um you
0:02:55 look over to one of the side tables and
0:02:57 see that it is filled with butts
0:03:00 and there's already a crushed up pack
0:03:03 that he's ripped through and it looks
0:03:05 like he's probably halfway through his
0:03:07 second pack at least you guys want any
0:03:09 trouble out there
0:03:10 no
0:03:12 all right
0:03:15 the jane thing did not
0:03:17 go as smoothly as i'd hoped oh you think
0:03:21 i did hope to have her back
0:03:23 and it is uh evolved into something else
0:03:26 oh we just uh we just need to give them
0:03:28 a little bit of time
0:03:29 johnny you left a note right so we'll
0:03:32 just we'll give them some time i mean
0:03:34 uh
0:03:35 your daughter ramirez
0:03:37 seemed like a reasonable guy didn't
0:03:39 freak out when we were covered in blood
0:03:41 that one time
0:03:42 too badly
0:03:43 um
0:03:44 we have so many other things that we
0:03:46 need to focus on so if we can give them
0:03:48 a bit more time and focus on
0:03:51 any of the other things that we got to
0:03:53 move to that's fine this doesn't make
0:03:54 any goddamn sense though
0:03:56 i mean you hear stories about hunters
0:03:59 like maybe one crazy
0:04:02 you know
0:04:02 gun nut who gets a little bit too
0:04:05 paranoid about things but it's usually
0:04:06 like one maybe two at best but
0:04:10 we have religious folk right
0:04:12 but this i mean
0:04:14 there was what five of them
0:04:16 and they're all people that we know that
0:04:18 someone had to be tipping us off this
0:04:19 was rhys i [ __ ] know it
0:04:22 that little premiere [ __ ] probably
0:04:24 like did something with his magic
0:04:28 remember i looked i looked at your
0:04:30 daughter and the nobody's pulling your
0:04:32 strings nobody is
0:04:34 so yeah they're all connected to us
0:04:36 sort of somehow um
0:04:38 but he knows that you can do that so
0:04:40 maybe he could cast some kind of counter
0:04:42 magic to make it so that you wouldn't
0:04:44 think that there were strings no this i
0:04:46 mean
0:04:47 there's always a possibility but um
0:04:49 there's a possibility you just said it
0:04:51 but there's also a possibility that this
0:04:52 is all random happenstance and that
0:04:54 there is no actual connection or that
0:04:56 they're not even connected to us like
0:04:58 what are you really think this is random
0:05:00 think of other people they they're
0:05:02 they're they're humans that we have had
0:05:04 very
0:05:05 strong connections with yeah but okay so
0:05:08 it just doesn't happen like this but
0:05:10 johnny suarez and joey's mom have a
0:05:12 strong connection to one another through
0:05:14 joey being dead suarez was the detective
0:05:17 looking into the case and joey died
0:05:19 because of uh
0:05:21 because of veto basically yeah
0:05:24 right
0:05:25 because of one of the manifestations of
0:05:27 that damage of the thing at the at the
0:05:29 house at the um
0:05:30 the santosa house yeah right so it might
0:05:33 not be us i mean we all went to the
0:05:35 house and maybe everyone who goes to the
0:05:37 house gets tainted somehow my daughter
0:05:39 she didn't go to the house we don't know
0:05:41 what she's been up to looking for that's
0:05:43 true she's connected to you and you went
0:05:45 to the house she was kidnapped because
0:05:47 of veto that's true
0:05:49 well then let's go burn the house down
0:05:50 or something i gotta do something i'm
0:05:52 going out of my mind well no jane and
0:05:53 all those people are in that house i
0:05:55 think no other house
0:05:56 i mean i mean vito's house veto to be
0:05:59 totally fair vito did seem to think that
0:06:01 like it and you know crazy
0:06:04 zealot or not he seemed to think that
0:06:06 you know burning the house down wouldn't
0:06:07 actually solve it raven
0:06:09 sort of gave the same impression i mean
0:06:10 if you could just burn the house down
0:06:11 and solve the problem then i think i
0:06:13 would feel like it would have been done
0:06:15 if anywhere in that place
0:06:17 it's like i thought before i think that
0:06:19 it could spread whatever's in there oh i
0:06:22 mean
0:06:22 look at the mushrooms around my house
0:06:24 where we burned the weeping bear that's
0:06:26 true we burned the weeping beer in this
0:06:27 what are the what is that we do need to
0:06:29 look into that we need to look into it
0:06:30 but that's so far down on the list
0:06:32 here's a weird question right and maybe
0:06:34 this is you know insane uh
0:06:37 do you think vito knows the answer to
0:06:39 those questions i think vito probably
0:06:41 has a more accurate
0:06:43 theory than we do but i think it's still
0:06:45 just a theory well
0:06:47 he's also again like a crazed religious
0:06:49 on the chance that he doesn't i don't
0:06:51 want to tip him off about these people
0:06:54 no i don't want to ask him about those
0:06:55 people at all
0:06:56 vito's the kind of person to do weird
0:06:58 stuff
0:06:59 to them yeah
0:07:01 regardless they are on new force they
0:07:03 are not
0:07:04 anything i have ever heard or dealt with
0:07:06 and it's seemingly
0:07:07 nothing that any of us have the raw
0:07:11 willpower and
0:07:13 destined determination coming off
0:07:14 johnny's daughter was almost
0:07:16 overwhelming from what you said in what
0:07:17 i heard they called us sick
0:07:20 like a thing to be cured they know
0:07:22 something's
0:07:23 off about us but they don't know what it
0:07:25 is i johnny stabs out his morally pulls
0:07:28 out another one and proceeds to
0:07:29 immediately light it up
0:07:32 so we're going to give them at least a
0:07:34 night but we cannot let them hold jane
0:07:35 too long we can't
0:07:38 what are we going to do about it we
0:07:39 can't get in that house we need them to
0:07:41 give we can't get in the house there's
0:07:43 other things we will need to test
0:07:46 can we do that without people getting
0:07:47 killed i hope so
0:07:49 i don't want anyone there to get killed
0:07:51 but honestly jane's my priority
0:07:54 do these people have jobs
0:07:55 i mean suarez got what fired let go quit
0:07:59 unsure i think joey's mom is a teacher
0:08:02 could we check if that's still true i
0:08:04 mean we know that sheila wasn't working
0:08:06 at the bar anymore and
0:08:08 well
0:08:08 suarez and everything
0:08:11 is
0:08:12 a taxi driver so he's
0:08:14 part of cabbies union right but
0:08:16 i mean that and in theory he could
0:08:18 always be claimed to be working that's
0:08:20 true my daughter
0:08:23 i don't know what she's been doing her
0:08:24 money recently i'm gonna make some phone
0:08:26 calls we have some other things to focus
0:08:28 on we are giving the night but we need
0:08:30 to start looking at other options agreed
0:08:32 yeah otherwise
0:08:34 we have things we're supposed to be
0:08:36 looking into
0:08:37 miles remind me what i'm supposed to be
0:08:38 doing it's been i believe you're looking
0:08:41 into trying to
0:08:43 locate uh either sabbat or something
0:08:45 like that oh yeah right right right okay
0:08:48 i can i can start putting some feelers
0:08:50 out
0:08:51 miles you and i need to have words at
0:08:53 some point
0:08:54 do you want that before or after my
0:08:56 phone call it really doesn't matter to
0:08:58 me
0:08:59 i don't think a minute or an hour is
0:09:00 gonna
0:09:01 change what i have to say
0:09:04 all right um
0:09:06 words makes that sound ominous should we
0:09:08 be in the room for this or no it sounded
0:09:10 like a private conversation it's going
0:09:11 to be up to miles whether he wants to
0:09:13 disclose this to the rest of you then we
0:09:15 can make ourselves sparse for a while
0:09:17 yeah i mean we got stuff we got to do i
0:09:20 need to get another pack of more release
0:09:22 johnny just heads right out of here
0:09:25 i'll go with him
0:09:26 you both can we can stick together
0:09:28 actually yeah if you guys have to have a
0:09:29 private conversation i i guess we'll see
0:09:31 ya
0:09:33 and greta runs out too neil runs out
0:09:36 after britta and just oh we're not
0:09:38 supposed to be splitting up like this
0:09:40 and
0:09:41 falls out after johnny leaving wynn and
0:09:43 miles alone
0:09:47 [Music]
0:09:50 i
0:09:51 move to the counter and remove my katana
0:09:54 and gun and put them down
0:09:56 not in preparation but just
0:09:58 kind of a tiredness you want to do this
0:10:01 now we might as well
0:10:03 should i
0:10:05 i have no idea what this is about
0:10:07 so when raven came to my haven
0:10:12 she knows that members of the coterie
0:10:14 made deals with the demon
0:10:17 and she said i have to kill them how did
0:10:19 she find out about the demon because i
0:10:21 told her all right
0:10:22 she knew the demon was there she knew
0:10:24 that the her codex was bound by a demon
0:10:27 with a demon how
0:10:28 nice of her not to let you know that
0:10:30 beforehand
0:10:31 regardless
0:10:32 she seems to think it would be a mercy
0:10:34 killing so did she in the end believe
0:10:37 she was going to have to kill you
0:10:39 no
0:10:40 well how else were you going to get her
0:10:42 that her codex
0:10:43 i don't know
0:10:45 i don't think she expected me to do it
0:10:46 right away
0:10:50 look i'm
0:10:51 telling you this because
0:10:53 not because i have any inclination to
0:10:55 kill you
0:10:56 but because if you get too wrapped up in
0:10:59 this
0:11:00 i don't know that i can let you go on
0:11:03 it is not my intention to use the demon
0:11:06 demons
0:11:08 temptation is their thing man
0:11:10 so we all believe it's a matter of time
0:11:13 all no
0:11:15 raven's been a long alive a very long
0:11:17 time she's seen what demons do to people
0:11:22 but i also see certain areas where this
0:11:24 may
0:11:25 be the only card we have to play what do
0:11:28 you want to do at that point a lot of
0:11:30 that's going to depend on the situation
0:11:31 man i've never been in this situation
0:11:34 before i hope i'm never in it again so
0:11:35 there's no hard line on this right now
0:11:38 for you at least if raven comes back and
0:11:40 you're still alive she's probably going
0:11:43 to take matters into her own hands well
0:11:45 from everything i've heard it wouldn't
0:11:46 be the only person gunning for me and i
0:11:49 would in all likelihood put myself
0:11:52 between you and her
0:11:55 but i felt like you needed to know that
0:11:57 you are probably in danger from this
0:12:01 she doesn't no it's you
0:12:03 i mean
0:12:04 so instead she may discriminately
0:12:06 slaughter whoever she suspects
0:12:08 yeah in a misguided attempt at mercy
0:12:12 also quite possibly freeing the demon
0:12:15 i would put my trust in raven to be able
0:12:17 to do something more productive with the
0:12:19 demon than how is it
0:12:21 maybe i don't know i don't know either
0:12:24 man but i i do appreciate it i didn't
0:12:26 want to keep this a secret from you and
0:12:28 then all of a sudden have
0:12:30 raven show up yeah
0:12:33 it's
0:12:34 tough she's one of the more
0:12:36 difficult people to prepare for
0:12:38 and i think ultimately
0:12:40 she is still our ally
0:12:43 misguided though it may be
0:12:45 all right well
0:12:47 i'm gonna go make sure joey's not
0:12:49 messing up the place too bad you make
0:12:51 your phone calls give me a shout if you
0:12:53 need to i appreciate it win not a
0:12:55 problem man and you i know that
0:12:58 of all things has not always been the
0:13:00 most
0:13:02 fun time that you would have imagined
0:13:06 fun's a relative term never mind
0:13:09 i guess maybe you have been having some
0:13:10 fun with it
0:13:14 do you have any other thoughts that
0:13:16 you would like to discuss with no other
0:13:18 people around at this point
0:13:19 i can't think of anything
0:13:22 are you okay
0:13:25 it's becoming increasingly hard to see
0:13:27 which side of the line i should be on
0:13:28 here we're basically a pentagram right
0:13:31 now of intersecting lines and i we're
0:13:33 being hemmed into smaller and smaller
0:13:36 areas
0:13:37 we're going to have to pick up poison
0:13:38 soon enough yup
0:13:41 my only goal is that all of us stay
0:13:43 together
0:13:45 i guess i should also inform you that
0:13:48 while not
0:13:49 officially
0:13:50 rollins has
0:13:52 essentially given you permission to have
0:13:54 children
0:13:59 okay
0:14:00 it came up casually in a conversation at
0:14:02 one point i mean i could make him regret
0:14:04 that real fast
0:14:06 but that would settle me and us with a
0:14:08 lot of responsibility and honestly
0:14:11 i think brita still needs us a little
0:14:13 too much for
0:14:14 me to be going and taking on another
0:14:16 child
0:14:17 i think
0:14:18 he
0:14:20 doesn't like the change that has
0:14:21 happened recently and
0:14:23 the lack of gangrel in and around the
0:14:25 court has
0:14:26 further
0:14:28 made him upset so he would like to
0:14:30 change that back to the way it was
0:14:32 before okay so here's a question sure
0:14:35 will that help settle him more
0:14:38 oh
0:14:39 more gangrel in the area i mean this is
0:14:42 i i don't think this is really going to
0:14:43 change his general demeanor or mind
0:14:47 you've met the man i've i not regarding
0:14:50 gangrel he is never going to change his
0:14:52 stripes on that one right i just meant
0:14:53 in general he's
0:14:55 i mean like recently with his newfound
0:14:58 mania is it gonna help that go away to
0:15:01 have more gangrel in the area i don't i
0:15:03 don't know i don't know the extent or
0:15:06 how strong the attack that has been put
0:15:07 upon him so
0:15:09 it's divertable but he's erratic at best
0:15:13 if you can find out sure i'll see what i
0:15:16 can do um but i figured just in case you
0:15:19 should no but it hasn't i don't know
0:15:21 anything official
0:15:23 you're senile you're telling me so oh
0:15:25 yeah
0:15:26 sometimes i forget
0:15:28 yeah you've been through a lot in the
0:15:30 past few nights uh so the answer
0:15:32 question uh no i'm probably not okay but
0:15:35 um that's not gonna change anytime soon
0:15:38 what can i do interview about 50 or 60
0:15:41 goals
0:15:43 not nothing really i need somebody to
0:15:45 pick up the slack at the life that
0:15:48 he used to
0:15:50 fill in for
0:15:51 and
0:15:55 it's a lot it is
0:15:58 is this the first big loss you've ever
0:15:59 had
0:16:01 um
0:16:04 i guess if you in terms of people i'm
0:16:06 connected to
0:16:08 but i've been
0:16:09 generally avoiding those kind of
0:16:12 connections they're
0:16:13 exploitable
0:16:15 they're
0:16:18 originally you're all supposed to be
0:16:21 like contractors
0:16:22 you each had a specialty a thing that
0:16:24 you did well
0:16:26 that's why i picked you
0:16:28 unfortunately it came to like you people
0:16:32 and that's the real
0:16:33 rub of it i guess and it's i'm extremely
0:16:36 protective of the people that have done
0:16:38 well by me and i care for
0:16:40 this has
0:16:41 made it difficult at times
0:16:44 i get that so
0:16:46 um
0:16:47 he was
0:16:49 the first thing that i brought with me
0:16:51 and probably the only thing i really
0:16:52 brought with me from my previous life
0:16:56 and
0:16:58 he is now gone
0:17:00 it's a hell of a thing having this
0:17:01 person shaped hole in your life it's a
0:17:04 lot of things
0:17:05 it is quite possibly the end of the
0:17:07 person that i was before a vampire
0:17:10 yeah
0:17:12 so
0:17:13 i didn't engage with my family after i
0:17:15 was turned but i kept watch on the
0:17:17 newspaper for obituaries and i remember
0:17:19 reading when my dad died and it was
0:17:21 almost a relief
0:17:23 that i wasn't hiding anymore
0:17:26 but
0:17:27 it meant that part of my life was over
0:17:29 and i was still moving
0:17:31 for all intents and purposes my parents
0:17:33 are still alive and
0:17:35 how i get a good chunk of my money still
0:17:37 but i've
0:17:38 changed the things that they remember so
0:17:41 they don't necessarily know i exist in
0:17:44 the same
0:17:46 same factor form it's
0:17:48 one of the ways i could keep my security
0:17:51 that had to be a really hard choice
0:17:53 miles
0:17:54 for some parts of it we were never
0:17:56 entirely very close
0:17:58 well
0:17:59 the thing with family is that it evolves
0:18:01 over time
0:18:02 and i think it's
0:18:03 at a crossroads right now so if there's
0:18:06 anything i can do to make crossing that
0:18:07 threshold a little easier
0:18:09 let me know
0:18:10 yeah well
0:18:12 we have a couple different things so
0:18:13 anything you can put your mind to it
0:18:15 looks like a combination of either the
0:18:17 sabbat
0:18:18 vito whatever these new
0:18:21 hunters are
0:18:22 they're just humans man that's the part
0:18:24 that gets me they're just
0:18:26 they're just people people who have had
0:18:29 bad [ __ ] happen to them people can't
0:18:31 block somebody from entering their house
0:18:33 i wouldn't have thought that
0:18:35 so they're a new force i don't know if
0:18:37 there's some sort of i don't know wheel
0:18:39 shapers or something like that some sort
0:18:41 of magic i'm unfamiliar with
0:18:44 there are human
0:18:45 magicians i'm sorry but talk for another
0:18:48 time right
0:18:50 great
0:18:51 nothing you need to worry about right
0:18:52 now
0:18:53 anyways
0:18:55 all right well you go live after joey
0:18:57 i'm gonna make my phone call all right
0:18:59 enjoy
0:19:03 [Music]
0:19:06 while the conversation happens inside
0:19:08 johnny storms out of british haven and
0:19:12 very soon after finds himself tailed by
0:19:14 members of his quarterly both britain
0:19:16 neil as uh the two of you are kind of
0:19:19 walking through downtown new haven i'm
0:19:21 sorry three of you are walking through
0:19:23 downtown new haven um
0:19:25 johnny where do you go
0:19:27 johnny flicks out the butt of the
0:19:28 cigarette that he was uh
0:19:30 finishing off and pulls out the very
0:19:33 last morally from his pack crumples it
0:19:35 up and just tosses it on the side of the
0:19:37 road pops in his mouth lights it up he
0:19:40 sees a small little convenience store
0:19:41 where he could absolutely buy a pack of
0:19:42 moralies but he finds himself just keep
0:19:44 on walking he's got so much energy built
0:19:47 up that he needs this to just be a
0:19:49 longer walk than just to where he can
0:19:51 absolutely get a pack of of uh
0:19:52 cigarettes for himself and then turn
0:19:54 right back and he in the back of his
0:19:56 head kind of thinks maybe
0:19:58 miles and and win could probably use
0:20:01 some time away from him because
0:20:02 he realizes he's being a little much for
0:20:04 everybody right now britta had dodged
0:20:07 out of the conversation the haven to
0:20:09 make sure that johnny wasn't alone and
0:20:12 had that stop by the doorway of bunny
0:20:14 hopping into her heels you know when you
0:20:16 have to put the buckle on and it doesn't
0:20:18 want to go because you're in a hurry by
0:20:20 the time that she kind of jogs out to
0:20:23 try and find johnny
0:20:24 i assume neil is probably caught up yeah
0:20:28 neil
0:20:28 doesn't have to bunny hop to put loafers
0:20:30 on so he he is already yeah just sort of
0:20:34 hustling up
0:20:35 it almost looks out of breath even
0:20:36 though that's not a thing
0:20:39 hey um
0:20:40 jenny kind of looks back at neil gives a
0:20:42 quick uh
0:20:44 i uh
0:20:45 i don't like the cigarettes at that
0:20:47 store oh yeah there's a smoke shop that
0:20:49 has the good ones
0:20:50 yeah
0:20:52 that's fine that makes sense
0:20:53 um
0:20:54 hey man you're not supposed to go
0:20:55 anywhere without a buddy like we we just
0:20:57 talked about that
0:20:59 sorry i forgot
0:21:00 that's okay britta and i well britta did
0:21:03 and then i followed afterwards but
0:21:06 um
0:21:06 yeah
0:21:08 anything on your mind you want to talk
0:21:09 about
0:21:12 ah i got a lot yeah i bet
0:21:15 do i want to talk about it
0:21:17 i'm not sure
0:21:18 yeah that was i i guess that was more of
0:21:20 the tenure the question um
0:21:22 but talking about any of it
0:21:25 help he stops
0:21:27 lowers his head and kind of
0:21:29 looks like he's looking to crack his
0:21:30 neck
0:21:32 what are we dealing with
0:21:34 i know you were you were kind of just
0:21:36 shooting down what i was saying that
0:21:38 this could just be a random occurrence
0:21:40 or
0:21:41 maybe it's due to the house
0:21:43 it's certainly not rhys at least you
0:21:45 don't think it's not racist but there's
0:21:47 a will behind her maybe no strings but a
0:21:50 will that's that's
0:21:52 capable of of so much more than you've
0:21:54 seen what does that mean that's not
0:21:55 random
0:21:56 johnny
0:21:57 i i don't want this to come across as
0:22:00 flip so
0:22:02 please don't take this as flipping but
0:22:03 um
0:22:04 you have a will behind you
0:22:07 um
0:22:08 i mean all of us we're all kindred we're
0:22:11 all we're all tied to things bigger than
0:22:13 ourselves but if you weren't kindred to
0:22:16 put yourself i guess in your daughter's
0:22:18 shoes
0:22:18 if you weren't kindred but you found out
0:22:21 about us
0:22:22 and you didn't have the context
0:22:24 you you only saw i guess the the people
0:22:27 who sneak into houses or pull people
0:22:28 into alleys and feed on their blood
0:22:30 you knew nothing else
0:22:32 and you knew that no one would believe
0:22:34 you
0:22:34 if you told them because you know we
0:22:37 work really hard to make sure that no
0:22:40 one believes anyone when things go bump
0:22:42 in the night um
0:22:44 and you thought it had taken a member of
0:22:46 your family
0:22:47 what would you do
0:22:49 you know what i would do
0:22:51 but answer me this
0:22:53 and be brutally honest with me
0:22:56 that will that you saw in her is the
0:22:58 same
0:22:59 kind of will that i have or is it
0:23:01 something else
0:23:03 is it just a familial recognition
0:23:06 or are you seeing something else
0:23:08 in her
0:23:10 i think one can inform the other don't
0:23:12 double talk
0:23:13 i don't know how not to right now it
0:23:15 because i don't know the answer like
0:23:17 like i say to you guys all the time
0:23:18 there
0:23:19 i don't know an objective answer here
0:23:21 but but you know there weren't strings
0:23:23 attached to her
0:23:25 not in a way that i understood or could
0:23:27 see
0:23:29 when i hear things like that
0:23:31 my mind starts racing and i try to
0:23:33 figure out things that i can solve
0:23:35 i'm not good at solving things other
0:23:37 than beating the hell out of them so
0:23:39 it's kind of funny you mention that um
0:23:42 i
0:23:43 you're going through a lot and
0:23:46 you want to solve some problems
0:23:48 but
0:23:48 you solve problems by cracking skulls
0:23:51 that that's not i'm not trying to
0:23:52 stereotype that's literally what you
0:23:54 just said right more often than not
0:23:55 doesn't solve things but yeah that's
0:23:57 what i trust that's the only way i i
0:23:59 know how to do it win is having a tough
0:24:01 time
0:24:02 right it's a lot of weird stuff going on
0:24:05 and miles is
0:24:07 i mean my god like let alone the things
0:24:10 inside of him right now just everything
0:24:12 that's been taken away and everything
0:24:14 that's on his shoulders and
0:24:16 neil kind of looks over at brita sort of
0:24:17 like trying to gauge
0:24:19 whether or not she's like in support of
0:24:21 what he's saying neil can see that she's
0:24:24 uh running her fingernail over where the
0:24:26 crescent tattoo is at the list beneath
0:24:28 the glove but she does not look as if
0:24:31 she wants to stop him talking talking
0:24:33 it's just an unconscious uh gesture i
0:24:36 got it we're all going through some
0:24:37 heavy [ __ ] and i need to cool my heels
0:24:39 because i'm not the only one what's your
0:24:40 point that's not what i'm saying
0:24:43 i'm not saying that you need to cool off
0:24:45 because everyone's got [ __ ] what i'm
0:24:47 saying is that this codery needs a win
0:24:49 johnny an unequivocal
0:24:52 problem that we can try and solve and we
0:24:55 got a couple in front of us and maybe
0:24:57 that means putting some stuff on the
0:24:58 back burner because we don't know how to
0:25:00 handle it and we don't know what we're
0:25:01 doing hopefully
0:25:03 miles
0:25:04 i don't know with the settings
0:25:05 that's too complicated right now johnny
0:25:07 takes an aggressive step into into your
0:25:10 personal space and jabs a finger into
0:25:12 your chest then do your job look at
0:25:16 those damn patterns and tell me what the
0:25:18 punch because if you keep on asking me
0:25:20 how we gonna win
0:25:22 i'm gonna hit you i'm not
0:25:25 asking you
0:25:26 johnny i'm telling you
0:25:30 that that's what we're going to do
0:25:34 where
0:25:35 i don't know yet
0:25:37 but i will soon
0:25:38 and whether or not it's
0:25:40 i don't know we deal with veto or
0:25:42 whether we start making you know pen
0:25:44 dragon style gorilla strikes on the
0:25:46 killing spree
0:25:48 i mean all these complicated problems go
0:25:50 away if we all die right so uh
0:25:53 or we just feel better because
0:25:56 we're actually solving some problems
0:25:58 don't talk me through it pick one and
0:26:00 tell me it's the right way to go neal
0:26:02 looks over at brita again
0:26:04 not like he can't make a decision but
0:26:07 trying to gauge
0:26:09 where the person more connected to veto
0:26:11 seems to feel british just looking at
0:26:13 neil to hear his answer she is not
0:26:16 viewing herself as a reference at this
0:26:18 point and you can see in her posture
0:26:20 that
0:26:21 there's sort of she's got like a
0:26:22 shoulder tilted in towards the
0:26:24 confrontation in preparation for if it
0:26:26 were to escalate
0:26:28 but she seems to feel that the two of
0:26:30 you voicing your opinions is the right
0:26:32 path forwards seeing absolutely no help
0:26:34 when he looks over a brilliant he looks
0:26:36 back at johnny
0:26:38 johnny's taking a long drag on his uh
0:26:41 mortally almost finishing it off and his
0:26:44 eyes are blazing into you answer me a
0:26:47 question johnny if you can better while
0:26:49 watching them kind of go back and forth
0:26:50 can i get a perception of this alertness
0:26:52 yep
0:26:54 it's a wash
0:26:55 unless the difficulty what's the
0:26:56 difficulty a six it's a wash okay
0:26:59 carry on oh no
0:27:02 okay johnny um
0:27:03 answer me this question how well do you
0:27:06 have anything
0:27:08 and
0:27:08 answer honest because i don't know the
0:27:10 answer to this do you have anything of
0:27:13 your sires or that
0:27:16 woman
0:27:17 who was running around with them the one
0:27:19 who cut me
0:27:20 or
0:27:21 anyone in that pack do you have anything
0:27:22 of theirs or or how well do you know
0:27:24 their faces could i
0:27:26 would you let me pull their faces out of
0:27:27 your brain
0:27:28 i remember every angle and detail of
0:27:31 their faces
0:27:33 so um
0:27:34 i know you're uncomfortable with the
0:27:36 things that i've learned ask the
0:27:38 question
0:27:43 just a second and he looks over already
0:27:45 britta i saw you with a bunch of
0:27:46 notepads and like pens and stuff
0:27:48 how
0:27:49 have you been practicing drawing or
0:27:51 anything like that
0:27:52 can you draw yeah
0:27:54 i mean i
0:27:55 get this feeling like i
0:27:57 i don't know
0:27:58 like there's something to be found there
0:28:00 but that's for something later yes i
0:28:02 think i could draw okay if i pull
0:28:05 a face out of johnny's brain and put it
0:28:07 in your head
0:28:09 could you draw it to a reasonable
0:28:10 likeness
0:28:12 can you draw johnny's thoughts i would
0:28:14 think i could okay
0:28:17 why
0:28:18 i know and he looks back at johnny that
0:28:20 you're uncomfortable with the kinds of
0:28:21 things that i can do the kinds of things
0:28:23 that i've been learning but
0:28:25 there's a ritual
0:28:26 one where if i take an object or a
0:28:28 likeness
0:28:29 it's grotesque and i would need your
0:28:31 help but it would help us hunt them
0:28:34 in the same way that the web of knives
0:28:36 was hunting me
0:28:38 but i need you to be okay with every
0:28:40 step of it at the mention of web of
0:28:42 knives i'd like to look around in
0:28:44 paranoia
0:28:45 are you using heightened senses yeah
0:28:47 okay it's plus one difficulty for the
0:28:49 already failed perception plus alertness
0:28:50 check yep yep uh but now you may now
0:28:52 apply your uh specs modifier to the role
0:28:56 danger senses tingling but super not
0:28:59 it's just what
0:29:00 i just had just said it is
0:29:03 oh well okay paranoia dangerous sense i
0:29:05 would personally argue those are
0:29:06 different things we'll see
0:29:08 that depends on if someone's here so i'm
0:29:10 not rolling i'm not rolling anything
0:29:11 extra for all stocks right that's just
0:29:13 what's your aspect rating i have two so
0:29:15 you're at difficulty five okay
0:29:17 it goes to difficulty seven then you
0:29:19 apply two levels of all specs which will
0:29:21 then reduce the difficulty by two and
0:29:23 take you to the five i am spending a
0:29:25 willpower
0:29:29 okay with the willpower and a 10 that is
0:29:33 two successes with two successes you
0:29:36 find yourself looking around where the
0:29:37 two of them are talking and a lot of the
0:29:40 streets seem pretty typical a car stops
0:29:42 at a light windows are down you hear
0:29:44 like the thrumming base of new metal
0:29:47 music
0:29:48 and
0:29:49 there's like heavy clouds overhead no
0:29:51 stars
0:29:52 uh bright street lights and you know
0:29:55 shops little restaurants what have you
0:29:58 and
0:29:59 it's the dunkin donuts that actually
0:30:01 stands out
0:30:03 because
0:30:04 while you are looking
0:30:06 you see someone else looking
0:30:09 it's two people uh one is a
0:30:13 very attractive
0:30:15 mexican woman wearing a leather jacket
0:30:17 and leaning against the window she does
0:30:19 not seem to be paying a great deal of
0:30:22 attention to anything that's going on
0:30:23 outside the
0:30:24 the little dunkin donuts itself
0:30:26 uh she's just kind of enjoying smoking a
0:30:29 cigarette inside
0:30:31 the the dunkin
0:30:33 with bloodied hands and like
0:30:37 kind of like gross dried blood cake to
0:30:40 her like chin and neck but next to her
0:30:43 far more alert of your presence
0:30:46 is a man
0:30:48 who is wearing a black
0:30:52 suede mariachi style like jacket even
0:30:56 where he's standing and kind of like see
0:30:58 that he
0:30:59 he's wearing these like
0:31:00 spurred boots
0:31:02 he's got is it the kind that's pointed
0:31:04 at the tip you're not quite close enough
0:31:06 to get a look but it definitely has your
0:31:08 toreador attention
0:31:11 and
0:31:12 uh
0:31:13 he's got this like very nice black
0:31:16 studded gun belt kind of hanging at an
0:31:18 angle on his hip
0:31:20 and uh his hair
0:31:23 is like long with that kind of 70s
0:31:26 feathered
0:31:27 look and he himself has this like
0:31:31 constant five o'clock shadow
0:31:34 and he is looking at you with a bloodied
0:31:37 palm
0:31:38 pressed to the window and when he knows
0:31:41 he has your attention
0:31:43 his hand slides down some smearing of
0:31:46 the handprint
0:31:48 just enough
0:31:49 so that you can see the black crescent
0:31:51 moon that's on his palm
0:31:53 well this sounds like a lot of bisexual
0:31:56 confusion but also do i have to first
0:31:59 scroll for
0:32:00 that catching my attention at the toria
0:32:02 door oh yes you do
0:32:03 [Laughter]
0:32:06 i see that i'm very confused right now
0:32:09 my sexual confusion intensifies
0:32:12 oh [ __ ]
0:32:14 what am i rolling that's the sexiest
0:32:16 dunk don't ever seen in my life
0:32:20 i mean the last one was pretty hot
0:32:25 uh you are rolling self-control at a
0:32:28 difficulty of seven i [ __ ] love
0:32:30 dunkin donuts
0:32:32 uh
0:32:34 to not be staring at the spurs or the
0:32:35 whole whole thing
0:32:37 the whole package yeah the whole package
0:32:39 if i fail this role do i not see the
0:32:42 crescent
0:32:44 uh if you fail the rule you're
0:32:45 hypnotized by what you see you're
0:32:48 criticized by the aesthetic
0:32:50 yeah
0:32:51 he is unbeknownst to himself he's kind
0:32:54 of giving you like the creepy vampire
0:32:56 vibe and you are rolling to not be that
0:32:59 hypnotized girl who slowly starts making
0:33:01 her way
0:33:02 helpless to like the vampires like sweat
0:33:06 [Music]
0:33:09 that's what we'll call it yeah
0:33:11 i am going to spend another well power
0:33:13 yep
0:33:17 we're rolling three dice for successes
0:33:19 okay
0:33:21 all right
0:33:23 you it gets you at first and you're kind
0:33:24 of like huh and your head slurs until
0:33:26 it's inside and then you see the
0:33:28 crescent mine there's crescent moon and
0:33:31 every bit of curiosity
0:33:34 like withers away as the stark
0:33:38 realization that this person is a sabbat
0:33:40 vampire
0:33:42 while brita is standing there trying to
0:33:43 think of what to say
0:33:45 johnny
0:33:46 points at neil
0:33:48 and says
0:33:50 tell me
0:33:51 this will be a win johnny johnny johnny
0:33:53 this will absolutely be hey
0:33:55 what
0:33:56 britta is just uh in a certain contest
0:34:00 at this point but as she
0:34:02 is making eye contact with the bloodied
0:34:04 handprint and the crescent moon behind
0:34:06 it that steel is in her spine she's got
0:34:09 a very firm control over herself at this
0:34:12 moment and how she might have otherwise
0:34:14 reacted but she is just
0:34:16 straightened up
0:34:18 and
0:34:19 ready to go back to back with her
0:34:20 coterie as she's looking over at these
0:34:22 two individuals in the dunkin donuts
0:34:24 you can follow her sight line i think
0:34:27 neil and johnny both
0:34:28 trace where she's looking simultaneous
0:34:30 head turns
0:34:32 you definitely see the two and kind of
0:34:34 like
0:34:35 now noticing you with these like full
0:34:38 lips like sharpened with like the lip
0:34:41 liner that she always wears and the dark
0:34:43 lipstick you super recognize carmen both
0:34:47 of us do you do you recognize i
0:34:50 recognize oh yes he does
0:34:53 not the other guy almost subconsciously
0:34:55 kind of slides the hand of the crescent
0:34:58 behind herself
0:35:00 neil slowly like almost in a trance now
0:35:04 does that neil fear freeze up that he
0:35:07 does when he sees this woman who almost
0:35:09 killed him but slowly pulls his phone
0:35:12 out of his pocket and does like the hip
0:35:14 camera click
0:35:16 hey um
0:35:17 i don't need to get it out of your head
0:35:19 anymore
0:35:21 yep
0:35:22 looks like they found us then he folds
0:35:25 the phone back up and slides it into his
0:35:27 pocket just completely frozen otherwise
0:35:30 johnny stays static for a moment like
0:35:34 squaring off almost like they're about
0:35:36 to have a gun battle and waits to see if
0:35:39 they make the first move
0:35:41 i want us to get a win you guys but um
0:35:44 unprepared in the street is not how i
0:35:46 think we're gonna get a win
0:35:48 stop hiding behind that stupid little
0:35:51 persona of a pawn shop owner
0:35:54 i need a duran key sorcerer next to my
0:35:56 side right now neil
0:35:58 like visibly swallows and does not look
0:36:02 any braver after johnny calls him like
0:36:05 to his side but slowly with one hand the
0:36:09 same hand that he used on the phone
0:36:11 unzips the fanny pack at his hip and
0:36:15 sticks a hand inside brita's eyes are
0:36:17 locked onto the crescent on the bloodied
0:36:20 window and
0:36:21 sort of sliding back up to see
0:36:24 if there's any change in the two at the
0:36:28 duncan both of you guys
0:36:30 keep an eye around us
0:36:31 if i know this pack
0:36:33 this is not the only threat johnny he's
0:36:36 is he showing me that on purpose
0:36:39 he's getting your attention
0:36:41 just make sure that there's nothing
0:36:42 coming on our flank at the warning from
0:36:44 johnny neal puts up his heightened
0:36:46 senses which failed him last time
0:36:49 but he's hoping that he can see
0:36:51 something i don't think this is our
0:36:52 moment of sand either we should get
0:36:54 going but we can't leave them back neal
0:36:57 actually sees it right away upon using
0:36:59 his heightened senses
0:37:00 and coming out of the alley beside the
0:37:02 dunkin donuts some of them moving on all
0:37:05 fours
0:37:06 uh but all of them with completely eerie
0:37:09 body language
0:37:10 is the killing sprees hunting hounds
0:37:14 the the city gangrel
0:37:16 that they use
0:37:17 and they while the two have your
0:37:20 attention
0:37:21 the five vampires coming out of the
0:37:23 alley move together and obfuscate and
0:37:27 are slowly making their way towards you
0:37:29 unaware that you can see them
0:37:38 they're coming
0:37:39 how many whispers out of the corner as
0:37:41 well it's uh it was like six last time
0:37:43 right how many is it
0:37:45 there are it's not all of them there are
0:37:47 it's just
0:37:49 five
0:37:50 city gangrel coming out of the alley and
0:37:52 then one lasambra in the in the
0:37:55 restaurant and one bruja into tribute
0:37:58 there's some uh that's it
0:38:00 [ __ ] you
0:38:01 [Laughter]
0:38:03 there's five of them
0:38:05 there's five of them i can see them they
0:38:06 don't know i can see them yet
0:38:08 um
0:38:09 but there's five okay can we outrun them
0:38:12 no what are our options can we fight
0:38:13 them no i mean
0:38:17 i think i'm the only one who can see
0:38:18 them right now
0:38:19 so there's five of them i don't know
0:38:22 so let's walk away
0:38:24 we can start walking but if they start
0:38:26 moving do we preempt and then run i can
0:38:28 try and talk them into a frenzy but
0:38:30 they'll
0:38:32 i don't know what'll happen if we just
0:38:35 make them all go nuts on each other do
0:38:36 it
0:38:38 are you sure
0:38:39 now
0:38:40 jesus
0:38:43 okay but uh you guys get ready to run uh
0:38:46 and neil looks over at the gangrel and
0:38:48 just goes
0:38:49 uh hey guys um you're not as subtle as
0:38:52 last time
0:38:54 you guys get that right like that i
0:38:56 don't know can you even understand me
0:38:57 like god this sucks not knowing and
0:39:00 we'll use voice of madness to try and
0:39:02 freak them the [ __ ] out okay go for it
0:39:04 all right so this is uh diff7 i'm
0:39:07 spending willpower okay
0:39:09 [Music]
0:39:11 uh four successes so i will
0:39:14 affect four out of five of those gangrel
0:39:17 okay let's start with some self-control
0:39:20 tests first one instinct roll number one
0:39:24 a frenzy instinct roll number two they
0:39:26 frenzy but are in control of their
0:39:29 actions three frenzy
0:39:31 four frenzy and are in control of their
0:39:33 actions so the first thing to be aware
0:39:35 of uh that you may not have known uh as
0:39:39 neil probably know um is that they do
0:39:41 not attack each other
0:39:42 at all their supernaturally enforced
0:39:46 sense of brotherhood prevents them from
0:39:48 being able to pursue each other without
0:39:50 expending exorbitant amounts of
0:39:51 willpower so they instead lash out on
0:39:54 the crowd oh no when this happens
0:39:58 they come out of obfuscate howling and
0:40:00 screeching and making completely
0:40:02 unnatural noises
0:40:04 and they turn and start raking at claws
0:40:07 windows
0:40:09 and make an attempt to savage any people
0:40:11 that they can get a hold of people who
0:40:13 spot them start turning and running
0:40:15 immediately irritated carmen seems
0:40:18 forced to direct her attention
0:40:20 on her packmates that have gotten out of
0:40:22 line
0:40:23 when the violence erupts the man with
0:40:26 the crescent moon on his palm his hand
0:40:29 visibly heats up and as it starts to
0:40:32 glow
0:40:33 the glass
0:40:34 starts to melt and he breaks slash like
0:40:38 ruins the window kind of shoving this
0:40:40 like
0:40:41 collapsing
0:40:43 superheated window out of his way and it
0:40:45 smashes onto the sidewalk and he steps
0:40:48 out with claws starting to manifest and
0:40:51 his body starts to kind of like
0:40:53 twitch and
0:40:55 shift
0:40:57 okay
0:40:58 [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ]
0:41:00 go we gotta go we gotta go
0:41:02 come on
0:41:03 please please
0:41:04 i didn't neil looks
0:41:06 horrified the violence is right anyone
0:41:08 who has not seen a
0:41:11 you guys have not seen this enough uh
0:41:13 actually i'm gonna rule that you uh
0:41:16 i'm a sabot survivor yeah i'm gonna rule
0:41:18 that virta and johnny are okay i do need
0:41:19 a courage test from neil i saw wind do
0:41:21 it once yeah
0:41:23 and every time you've ever seen it it
0:41:24 was a horrific experience where in which
0:41:26 your body was warped against your will
0:41:27 you're not wrong
0:41:29 yeah i will spend a willpower on this
0:41:31 thing i'm terrible at what's the
0:41:32 difficulty expendable power once around
0:41:35 well then [ __ ] me
0:41:39 uh
0:41:40 what's the difficulty uh dev6
0:41:45 no
0:41:46 would would you allow me to have made a
0:41:47 leadership check to try and give him a
0:41:49 bonus die from the fact that i told him
0:41:51 i needed duron key sorcerer next to me i
0:41:53 would allow that yes neil's all moral
0:41:55 compunction no courage
0:42:01 one success kneel roll a die add it to
0:42:04 your total number of successes
0:42:06 exactly a six okay one success you do
0:42:09 not raw shrek steeled by johnny's words
0:42:15 okay
0:42:17 down to run where is my sire headed
0:42:20 well it looks like he's going to be
0:42:22 heading to neil but he has not quite
0:42:24 taken off just yet carmen walks over and
0:42:29 reaches somewhere behind uh where the
0:42:32 window
0:42:33 kind of stops and the wall begins
0:42:35 and pulls
0:42:37 a uh
0:42:39 like conquistadors like sword the blade
0:42:42 itself is like
0:42:43 has is like slick with red as though
0:42:46 she's probably been partying at the
0:42:48 dunkin donuts with it
0:42:50 she
0:42:51 yells something and
0:42:53 uh
0:42:54 the brute kind of gives her a nod ready
0:42:56 to chase is that the same sword that's
0:42:59 been inside me you recognize the sword
0:43:02 great
0:43:03 i'm gonna buy you some time the two of
0:43:05 you get out of here no you're coming to

0:43:09 you're gonna need a head start now go
0:43:12 johnny we can't johnny's ready to roll
0:43:14 initiative roll all right they are
0:43:16 delight laid by the use of
0:43:17 transformation powers and uh being in a
0:43:20 chaotic frenzy enough that you guys may
0:43:22 bail or roll initiative
0:43:27 i mean i made that courage check
0:43:32 we literally just talked about how we're
0:43:34 not going this alone [ __ ] you johnny
0:43:38 yeah all right how do you know you don't
0:43:40 have celerity you got to get out of here
0:43:43 dude i'm
0:43:44 fully aware that's why it's better when
0:43:46 you carry him away
0:43:48 it's actually what i thought he was
0:43:49 going to do well i rolled a one
0:43:52 boy i can't do this i can't do this i
0:43:54 can't do this
0:43:57 the brute is going on at 23. jesus

0:44:07 johnny's going on an eight
0:44:09 oh boy

0:44:11 oh
0:44:14 boy
0:44:15 twelve with two celerity actions red is
0:44:17 going in the same initiative as carmen
0:44:20 all right they are going on
0:44:23 and we'll cut from you guys for a little
0:44:25 while yeah
0:44:33 well the three are away the haven is
0:44:36 actually rather quiet
0:44:37 and the two of you two members of the
0:44:41 corey who have probably conflicted some
0:44:43 of the most are actually kind of in a
0:44:45 relaxing situation
0:44:47 you can softly hear the sound of the
0:44:50 piano autoplaying
0:44:52 as the two of you
0:44:54 are together in the lounge
0:44:56 interestingly joey seems to hear
0:44:59 the sound of the music
0:45:01 and curiously heads off
0:45:03 wind kind of follows just to kind of
0:45:05 keep an eye on him if he decides to
0:45:07 manifest and mess things up she wants to
0:45:09 be able to put it back in order
0:45:10 when you follow joey you see he makes
0:45:13 his way over uh to like this like piano
0:45:16 lounge space at the the haven so it's
0:45:18 actually a pretty sizable place and
0:45:21 there kind of sitting and softly playing
0:45:25 is
0:45:27 the spirit of the kindred he recognizes
0:45:29 romeo and he kind of like
0:45:33 has that like very kind of sharp smooth
0:45:35 haircut it's very kind of like well put
0:45:37 together the only thing that kind of
0:45:39 really stands out are the sections of
0:45:42 his chest where claws ripped deeply into
0:45:44 him
0:45:45 and he regards joey with kind of like a
0:45:47 very casual smile and joey looks at this
0:45:50 man
0:45:52 nervously at first but
0:45:54 clearly with an expression full of
0:45:56 curiosity and
0:45:58 romeo
0:45:59 shifts
0:46:00 on the bench and kinda pats on the space
0:46:04 next to him
0:46:05 joey makes his way over and sits down
0:46:08 romeo
0:46:09 asks the boy and he's like hey
0:46:12 you gonna help me play and joe is like
0:46:15 he looks up at him and
0:46:17 says very quietly that he doesn't know
0:46:19 how to play the piano and that he never
0:46:22 got to learn
0:46:23 when he was
0:46:24 alive and he says he makes reference to
0:46:27 having once been alive with this kind of
0:46:28 like deeply rooted sense of shame and
0:46:31 romeo smiles
0:46:33 and he says
0:46:34 i learned the first time
0:46:36 that i died and that there's a
0:46:38 difference between being dead and gone
0:46:40 and while you're still here
0:46:42 you can still learn
0:46:44 and he kind of like takes the kids hands
0:46:46 and like starts walking him through
0:46:49 the song that he had been quietly
0:46:50 playing before joey arrived
0:46:53 and the two play the piano together
0:46:57 wyn just kind of
0:46:59 leans on the doorway it's not often joey
0:47:01 gets to talk to someone other than her
0:47:03 she knows he's had the experiences with
0:47:05 mr perfect and that's not exactly the
0:47:08 kind of relationship she wants him to be
0:47:09 fostering
0:47:11 so she
0:47:12 just kind of leans on the doorway and
0:47:14 kind of a soft smile crawls across her
0:47:17 lips as she watches the older wraith
0:47:20 take the younger one under his wing and
0:47:22 it's weird because
0:47:24 she knows that
0:47:26 in terms of their wraith lives
0:47:28 joey is actually much
0:47:30 more experienced than
0:47:32 romeo joey has actually been right joey
0:47:35 has been a rafe longer
0:47:37 but maybe
0:47:38 because he had been
0:47:40 a kindred and had had more years on
0:47:42 earth to process the world
0:47:45 maybe
0:47:46 he's very well equipped to
0:47:48 process his own life
0:47:50 his second on life and she just kind of
0:47:53 watches
0:47:54 she doesn't intrude
0:47:56 you find yourself hearing uh the same
0:47:59 one of the same songs
0:48:00 that elsa has performed for the elysium
0:48:03 in the past this is one of her songs
0:48:06 and you kind of get the impression that
0:48:08 there's a good chance that
0:48:09 romeo
0:48:10 learned how to play the piano from elsa
0:48:13 and sort of passing that on to joey wynn
0:48:16 just enjoys the music and it's it's
0:48:19 probably not the best rendition of
0:48:21 the song considering joey has never
0:48:23 played a piano before
0:48:25 but it's
0:48:26 it's the music not the song that she's
0:48:28 listening to if that makes any sense
0:48:30 sure does
0:48:31 some part of her
0:48:32 her shoulders relax a little bit she's
0:48:35 normally a little tense when joey's
0:48:38 involved
0:48:39 for myriad of reasons
0:48:41 but
0:48:42 there's just this flicker of a thought
0:48:44 that if something were to happen to her
0:48:46 he might not be completely alone and
0:48:49 once there's a break in the song
0:48:52 wynn
0:48:54 walks up and
0:48:55 kind of crouches by the bench and
0:48:57 gives joey a smile
0:48:59 that was really good dude joey kind of
0:49:02 like
0:49:03 gives this like kind of choked up smile
0:49:05 like
0:49:06 he's a little
0:49:07 too
0:49:08 emotional to kind of like
0:49:11 form manly sounding words so he just
0:49:14 kind of like gives this like uh
0:49:17 elated
0:49:18 grin
0:49:20 some big feelings man i mean there's
0:49:22 like a very fast like it's here yeah i'd
0:49:24 nod that's okay buddy big feelings are
0:49:26 important and she kind of looks to romeo
0:49:28 with a smile and eyes of thank you
0:49:32 romeo seems a little surprised
0:49:36 when you address him
0:49:40 if you ever need anything romeo i'm i'm
0:49:42 someone you can turn to
0:49:44 it's kind of like an awkward but like
0:49:46 accepting nod
0:49:48 do you need
0:49:49 do you need anything
0:49:51 he holds up
0:49:52 his hand
0:49:54 and on it you see a black crescent moon
0:49:56 i need to talk to britta
0:49:58 i can help with that thank you
0:50:01 she's a little busy right now but we can
0:50:03 sure find the time to talk to her
0:50:06 yeah it sounds good
0:50:10 [Music]
0:50:13 miles
0:50:15 you are sitting alone
0:50:17 in a wide space with many empty seats an
0:50:22 empty martini glass beside you i can
0:50:25 hear the piano music and it's both kind
0:50:27 of soothing and also very
0:50:29 melancholy in a way man i take a moment
0:50:32 to
0:50:33 listen to that before
0:50:35 everything comes coming back down and i
0:50:38 reach for the phone to start making the
0:50:40 phone calls that i know i need to make
0:50:43 you pick up the flip phone
0:50:45 open it up
0:50:46 who are you looking for john peterson my
0:50:49 sire you pull up his number yeah yeah
0:50:52 hopefully i can get through to him the
0:50:54 phone rings for a short period of time
0:50:56 and then there is an answer
0:50:58 peterson
0:50:59 sire
0:51:00 miles
0:51:01 how is new haven right to the heart of
0:51:03 it that was not the intention
0:51:06 but i suppose if this is the case how
0:51:08 much do you know about what's going on
0:51:09 here according to
0:51:11 his grace
0:51:13 things are well in the hand his grace
0:51:15 has recently suffered an attack from
0:51:17 the malkavian prince
0:51:19 quentin can't afford
0:51:21 he's become
0:51:23 exceedingly erratic
0:51:24 i see and you have things well in hand
0:51:27 are you controlling things in the
0:51:28 meantime ensuring that there isn't too
0:51:30 much blowback i would love to say yes to
0:51:32 that but
0:51:33 frank miles what is happening rhys took
0:51:36 the opportunity
0:51:38 to
0:51:39 push his agenda while the prince was
0:51:41 extraordinarily weak he has taken
0:51:44 many shots at my coterie the last
0:51:46 week or so on top of that between that
0:51:48 and the sabbat attack a few other things
0:51:51 popping up it is feeling like i'm under
0:51:53 siege
0:51:54 what is
0:51:56 Reiss's agenda
0:51:57 as far as
0:51:59 our end is concerned the tremere have
0:52:01 been extremely cooperative
0:52:03 and supportive in our endeavors to
0:52:06 mitigate the destruction being caused by
0:52:09 the sabbath
0:52:10 i'm not entirely sure he seems
0:52:12 put out by my cavean maybe
0:52:15 some sort of fear
0:52:17 he's using a magic that ramirez doesn't
0:52:19 understand
0:52:20 and it's excuse me um
0:52:24 duran ki
0:52:25 asamite sorcery
0:52:27 yes
0:52:30 miles ah what do you know of the
0:52:32 relationship between the tremere and the
0:52:34 Assamites
0:52:35 not a lot um
0:52:37 they both seem exceedingly dangerous
0:52:39 when the tremere first came to be
0:52:41 they did so through
0:52:44 problematic means
0:52:46 they don't have proper lineages like you
0:52:48 and i
0:52:50 and they stole
0:52:51 their vampiric nature
0:52:54 and in doing so
0:52:56 they lost access to the wealth of magic
0:52:59 that they once had access to in life and
0:53:02 to
0:53:04 rebuild themselves
0:53:05 they turned to preying on the clans that
0:53:09 reside in the same region as their
0:53:12 homelands
0:53:13 and stole magic wherever they could
0:53:16 twisted their rivals and
0:53:18 [Music]
0:53:19 eventually
0:53:20 built monsters from the corpses of their
0:53:22 enemies
0:53:23 the tremere
0:53:25 are
0:53:27 um besieged
0:53:29 by ancient enemies that they earned
0:53:31 through their own
0:53:32 ruthlessness
0:53:35 part of this
0:53:36 has allowed them to build up
0:53:39 hermetical maturity to where it is now
0:53:42 and part of their practices
0:53:45 involve the eradication of anything that
0:53:47 they consider a rogue practitioner of
0:53:49 thormaturgy meaning anyone
0:53:51 who practices blood magic
0:53:54 without
0:53:55 their support without their teaching
0:53:57 without their permission which means
0:53:59 that if your quartery mate has been
0:54:03 learning magics from
0:54:05 diablorist enemies of the tremere of
0:54:08 course he's going to do everything in
0:54:09 his power to eliminate him i'm pretty
0:54:11 sure he learned it on his own but on top
0:54:13 of that rhys has
0:54:16 taken actions against
0:54:17 myself specifically what has he done as
0:54:20 far as we can tell he had my ghoul kill
0:54:22 himself
0:54:25 i'm sorry to hear that miles like my
0:54:27 condolences so
0:54:30 and i have pen dragon out here
0:54:32 offering his support too
0:54:36 bad dragon is a double-edged sword
0:54:38 of course you i i expect you don't need
0:54:40 me to explain this right
0:54:42 but
0:54:44 there is still value in such a weapon
0:54:47 if you can keep it at arm's length
0:54:49 the prince is making that hard
0:54:51 he's also one of the few tools keeping
0:54:53 him away i can tell but
0:54:55 he's
0:54:56 becoming trouble to manage
0:54:58 without arabella here to
0:55:00 deal with it the way she used to there
0:55:03 was
0:55:04 a rumor that i had received
0:55:06 uh from
0:55:08 actually arabella
0:55:09 before her betrayal
0:55:11 it indicated that upton rollins had
0:55:13 dealings with the followers of set and
0:55:15 was
0:55:16 quietly
0:55:18 trading power through them in exchange
0:55:20 for comforts and protections if that is
0:55:24 true
0:55:25 there is a significant threat being
0:55:27 posed to the camera as a whole
0:55:30 within the next few months
0:55:32 once we're done routing uh
0:55:34 rounding up these princes
0:55:36 myself and a handful of other archons
0:55:39 are going to be transporting displaced
0:55:40 princes to new haven a dozen and all
0:55:43 they are going to attempt
0:55:46 to conflict with one another and seize
0:55:50 the opportunity to claim a praxis and
0:55:52 restore themselves to power
0:55:54 if the prince who leads new haven is
0:55:57 weak
0:55:58 i need
0:56:00 i need an honest conversation
0:56:03 when these 12 princes come
0:56:05 how loved and fair
0:56:08 Rowlands has an interesting mix that has
0:56:11 kept him alive
0:56:13 this long this
0:56:14 failure to see the subtleties
0:56:17 that is almost a weapon in itself
0:56:21 while he does
0:56:22 suffer
0:56:24 his shame for it it never touches him
0:56:28 but his paranoia is out of control
0:56:31 and he's let rhys
0:56:32 essentially run rampant and he's given
0:56:34 an ordeal to my malkavian that is the
0:56:38 wishes of the settites
0:56:40 how do you think he will
0:56:43 depends on fare
0:56:43 strengths
0:56:46 but
0:56:48 if they band together with any kind of
0:56:49 cohesion
0:56:50 not well
0:56:52 Reiss will do what he can but
0:56:54 he's been replaced the senator
0:56:57 what do you propose
0:56:59 i doubt you've called me because you
0:57:00 don't have any ideas
0:57:02 i have ideas i
0:57:04 i'm out of my debts here a little bit
0:57:07 i
0:57:08 i feel like removing Rowlands is
0:57:10 possibility
0:57:12 but it's going to lead for pendragon
0:57:14 moving his way in
0:57:16 he's one of the few things stopping
0:57:17 pendragon from completely coming in
0:57:19 i
0:57:20 i need
0:57:21 rollins
0:57:23 on a tighter leash
0:57:25 if he can
0:57:26 he can be strong
0:57:28 if he would just listen
0:57:30 but he refuses
0:57:33 my concern is this
0:57:36 if upton rollins loses control of his
0:57:38 praxis
0:57:39 if that happens
0:57:41 then The Ventrue will lose new haven
0:57:42 forever but after being ousted from
0:57:44 hartford
0:57:45 there's going to be a cascading effect
0:57:47 and pen dragon will ultimately cease
0:57:50 power anyway
0:57:52 so
0:57:53 we need to create a scenario where there
0:57:55 is a prince who is strong enough
0:57:57 to lead the domain
0:57:59 and not show any signs of weakness to
0:58:01 these 12 princes that are arriving
0:58:03 now i see two paths towards this
0:58:06 one is an immediate rectification of his
0:58:09 behavior
0:58:11 or
0:58:12 another venture takes practice
0:58:15 i do not care which it is
0:58:18 and i am so sorry miles
0:58:20 that i have placed this great weight
0:58:22 upon your shoulders
0:58:23 but i cannot stay on the phone any
0:58:25 longer
0:58:26 there's an operation taking place in new
0:58:28 york
0:58:29 i expect that if everything goes
0:58:32 according to plan
0:58:33 i will be able to speak with you more at
0:58:35 length about this in the future
0:58:36 but for now i must go i need one thing
0:58:39 what do you need do you still need vito
0:58:41 zentosa no get rid of him he hangs up
0:58:46 miles
0:58:47 looks at his phone and contemplates just
0:58:49 throwing the damn thing away
0:58:51 he almost goes to kick over a table and
0:58:55 decides against that since it's not his
0:58:56 place
0:58:58 but he's just
0:58:59 so
0:59:01 done
0:59:02 with some of this stuff and he kind of
0:59:04 just
0:59:05 sits
0:59:06 hopes they come back because they need
0:59:08 to start making things in motion
0:59:11 we need to start moving because
0:59:14 he's got a decision to make one way or
0:59:16 another as miles contemplates his
0:59:18 decision the other half of the quarter
0:59:20 is finished rolling initiative god [ __ ]
0:59:29 the brute who is still in the midst of a
0:59:30 transformation
0:59:32 grows in a height
0:59:33 horns start to
0:59:35 manifest kind of protruding from his
0:59:37 skull and he transforms into this
0:59:39 monster and
0:59:42 very casually
0:59:44 it scoops up the two city gangrel who
0:59:47 have lost control of themselves
0:59:50 uh by the scruffs of their necks and he
0:59:52 shakes them
0:59:53 and turns
0:59:55 to johnny
0:59:58 you stay right there siren child need a
1:00:01 conversation
1:00:03 and
1:00:04 the
1:00:05 frenzied gangrel start to kind of like
1:00:08 get meek and freaked out being
1:00:11 so casually manhandled and that's his
1:00:13 action for now
1:00:17 next on initiative
1:00:19 is bretta
1:00:21 bretta will do something she's never
1:00:22 done before out of reflex switches to
1:00:24 pop majesty
1:00:25 what is the total of your charisma and
1:00:27 intimidation
1:00:28 eight a subject must make a card roll
1:00:30 difficulty equal to the vampire scores
1:00:32 plus intimidation to a max death of ten
1:00:34 if he wishes to be rude or simply
1:00:36 contrary to the vampire
1:00:39 success allows the individual to act
1:00:40 normally for the moment although he
1:00:42 feels the weight of the vampire's
1:00:44 displeasure crushing down on him the
1:00:46 subject who fails the role aborts his
1:00:48 intended action and even goes to absurd
1:00:51 lengths to humble himself before the
1:00:53 vampire no matter who else is watching
1:00:56 under majesty's influence hearts break
1:00:59 power trembles and the bold shake that
1:01:01 is
1:01:02 majesty
1:01:04 do you say anything kind of see britta
1:01:06 closing her eyes
1:01:08 stepping forward exuding that air and
1:01:11 that beauty and that control and saying
1:01:14 this is not the time
1:01:16 for a fight
1:01:18 let's all just go
1:01:20 our separate ways
1:01:22 excellent after
1:01:25 brett it goes
1:01:27 uh it looks like carmen is going uh who
1:01:29 will hold her action neil your turn
1:01:32 neil is
1:01:34 unsure what to do
1:01:36 and
1:01:37 just completely freaked out at this
1:01:38 point um but johnny said
1:01:41 he needed a drunky sorcerer
1:01:44 by his side
1:01:45 but britta also said we should all go
1:01:47 our separate ways
1:01:49 and brita's really compelling right now
1:01:52 and in neil's head our separate ways
1:01:55 means
1:01:56 we're a coterie so we should go one way
1:01:59 and you guys are bad guys
1:02:02 so you should go a different way but
1:02:04 he's not really sure what to do
1:02:06 so
1:02:07 i mean we're in downtown new haven
1:02:08 there's like alleys and dumpsters and
1:02:10 stuff everywhere right yes and neil
1:02:13 looks at bread and goes okay yeah let's
1:02:14 um
1:02:15 let's leave
1:02:17 let's leave i'll uh
1:02:18 and he's going to try and make it you
1:02:21 said there was a lot of cloud cover and
1:02:23 things like that right now right
1:02:24 he's going to try and make it rain
1:02:27 really heavy just to start like
1:02:29 make it harder for them to find us if we
1:02:31 get the hell out of here okay
1:02:36 six successes with six successes you
1:02:39 immediately make the change to the
1:02:40 weather and a downpour begins and neil
1:02:43 now soaking wet just looks at johnny and
1:02:45 britta
1:02:46 specifically abreta okay yeah let's uh
1:02:49 let's let's get out of here real fast
1:02:51 okay let's let's go let's go our
1:02:52 separate ways johnny
1:02:54 johnny
1:02:56 completely awestruck is staring at brita
1:03:00 just completely taken out of the moment
1:03:02 by the absolute majesty she's omitting
1:03:06 he turns to look back at his sire points
1:03:09 across the street i'll be seeing you
1:03:11 soon and we'll turn back
1:03:13 scoop up brita grab neil by the scruff
1:03:16 of his neck
1:03:18 and he will take a bounding leap
1:03:21 channeling his potence into his body to
1:03:24 leap at a superhuman speed away from
1:03:27 this scene
1:03:28 to a nearby rooftop where he can then
1:03:30 get away give me
1:03:32 a strength plus athletics role at
1:03:35 difficulty four every success
1:03:38 takes you three yards and then multiply
1:03:41 that total
1:03:42 by the effect of leaps and bounds
1:03:47 lex you want to look at this role for a
1:03:48 second because it's absurd what flavor
1:03:51 what flavor of website give me that
1:03:53 i didn't roll a failure
1:03:56 oh my i wish i had exploded on tens i
1:03:59 don't think i do because i have powerful
1:04:00 arms and not necessarily i mean you're
1:04:02 snatching us up yeah you can actually
1:04:03 work that oh yeah yeah all right jesus
1:04:06 we're not we are literally the smallest
1:04:08 members of the codery
1:04:10 easily the smallest
1:04:12 that is 16 successes
1:04:15 so multiply
1:04:16 multiply 16 successes
1:04:19 by three
1:04:21 for your base number of yards
1:04:23 yep 48. now multiply that number by the
1:04:27 lesser of your potence and celerity so
1:04:29 that would be uh three
1:04:32 hundred forty four yeah holding them you
1:04:34 leave a hundred forty four yards
1:04:37 a football field and a half
1:04:40 as you
1:04:41 bail you kind of give this glance back
1:04:44 to your sire who's looking up at you
1:04:46 and does not seem to have the impression
1:04:49 that you're out of range but carmen
1:04:51 shakes her head no at him and frustrated
1:04:55 he smashes the chew gangrel into the
1:04:57 pavement torporing them and drags them
1:05:00 inside the two frenzies gangrel as you
1:05:03 kind of come out of view of them they
1:05:04 start to kind of calm down
1:05:06 and with like heads low
1:05:10 and worried that carmen is gonna punish
1:05:12 them for their failure and they slink
1:05:14 their way inside to speak to their
1:05:15 ductus and you escape
1:05:18 with my two celerity actions while i'm
1:05:21 still i guess effectively in grapple
1:05:23 flying through the air
1:05:25 i would like to use one
1:05:27 to text smiles um
1:05:30 yeah absolutely no like i i need that t9
1:05:33 lightning super nine
1:05:35 and
1:05:36 where is the exact location where by a
1:05:38 particular dunkin donuts yeah uh you're
1:05:40 like right around dixwell i text miles a
1:05:43 location and i say
1:05:46 actually do i i know these are the spot
1:05:48 because of them they are definitely
1:05:50 that's about explicitly wow same place
1:05:53 the car crash happened during our chase
1:05:54 too
1:05:55 around yes it is i'm just checking this
1:05:57 is brita's first meeting with them yeah
1:05:59 no they used vicissitude
1:06:02 uh you actually do recognize those 
1:06:04 Gangrel
1:06:04 you did fight them yeah one of them and
1:06:07 they're gonna look real close to the guy
1:06:08 at dread gaser
1:06:10 so i text miles a location and i say
1:06:14 the killing spree are here and
1:06:17 we're escaping we're not ready for this
1:06:20 after your celerity action johnny
1:06:21 proceeds to leap again and you go
1:06:23 getting pulled through the air once
1:06:25 again
1:06:27 if i like quote-unquote effectively have
1:06:29 the other celerity action if there's
1:06:31 ever a point at which we land near
1:06:33 immortal
1:06:34 i will tell them to forget this
1:06:37 johnny is going to continue to use
1:06:39 celerity actions to leap he actually has
1:06:41 spent for three celebrity actions
1:06:43 and he will take us from rooftop to
1:06:45 rooftop until we are well out of sight
1:06:48 of the dunkin donuts or any of the
1:06:50 killing spree you will actually make it
1:06:52 back at that speed
1:06:54 just it's okay it's
1:06:56 it's
1:06:57 it's an effect just anything that johnny
1:06:59 has this like kind of superhero landing
1:07:02 i'm getting
1:07:03 the tick vibes if if anything he
1:07:06 actually
1:07:06 if anything he actually takes a
1:07:08 circuitous route
1:07:09 to hopefully
1:07:11 conceal
1:07:12 where we have gone neal who has no
1:07:15 celery actions just gets dragged around
1:07:18 being
1:07:19 pelted by rain drops at like bullet
1:07:21 speeds just
1:07:24 it's like a roller coaster yeah it sucks
1:07:26 to go on a roller coaster when it's
1:07:27 downpouring disagree well
1:07:29 okay
1:07:30 that's what i do with my remaining uh
1:07:32 ability is just try to use my majesty as
1:07:35 it's up to attempt to put some small
1:07:37 cover on the masquerade if we are ever
1:07:39 near someone who had noticed so
1:07:41 unfortunately you cannot cause someone
1:07:43 to forget something with majesty yeah
1:07:45 maybe more like encourage them uh like
1:07:48 like just comfort like it's okay it's in
1:07:50 fact
1:07:51 like uh nothing to see here
1:07:54 that's that's the that's what i said
1:07:55 earlier it's just uh it's okay it's it's
1:07:58 it's an effect is does filming a movie
1:08:00 basically uh nothing is real
1:08:04 everything is something that's good
1:08:06 advice
1:08:07 uh nothing to see here new
1:08:16 so while the two of you are
1:08:18 uh and even kind of relaxing and kind of
1:08:20 figuring out your next step you're a
1:08:22 thumb up on the roof
1:08:24 it's probably right
1:08:26 you're on the first floor yeah
1:08:28 i probably actually get the message and
1:08:30 be like should we meet you somewhere and
1:08:33 then i'm like win trouble
1:08:35 on it at a normal speed you receive the
1:08:37 text message we're here wind starts
1:08:40 pounding her way up to the roof oh
1:08:42 that's something
1:08:43 you may get up to the fire escape
1:08:46 and from the fire escape pursue your way
1:08:48 and pursue uh the source of that noise i
1:08:51 imagine once she gets to the fire escape
1:08:52 she actually sees us coming down the
1:08:54 fire escape yeah you see them kind of
1:08:55 like cresting over like the edge of the
1:08:57 roof and starting to make their way down
1:08:59 hey i'm glad you're back we've got
1:09:00 trouble it's one of those nights huh
1:09:02 miles just gotta just told me that
1:09:04 there's trouble um
1:09:07 yeah hey guys can we go inside it's
1:09:08 raining real hard yeah are you guys okay
1:09:11 brita is probably shaking now that i
1:09:13 believe the effects of majesty is it
1:09:15 would that have been considered the end
1:09:16 of the scene our exit or is it still
1:09:18 running how does that work my majesty
1:09:20 can still be going it's all connected
1:09:23 then i'm not sure if it's really i it i
1:09:26 think it's up to you at that point brett
1:09:27 has never done this she does not know
1:09:28 how to turn this off right now
1:09:31 yeah i know so she's just upset and very
1:09:34 commanding about it uh you can see that
1:09:36 she's
1:09:37 uh shaking her she's still reflexively
1:09:41 hiding the hand that you know to have
1:09:42 the crescent moon on it i assume johnny
1:09:44 you let go
1:09:45 he places her down gently on the roof
1:09:48 she mutters thank you uh and strides out
1:09:51 to the edge of the roof to try to get a
1:09:53 glimpse of whether they've been followed
1:09:55 so if i understand majesty right um and
1:09:58 how this interacts especially if you
1:10:00 have low courage on your sheet
1:10:02 the fact that brita is freaking out neil
1:10:04 when he gets like dropped onto the roof
1:10:07 when johnny slams down here with us
1:10:09 uh just immediately turns and looks like
1:10:11 hey are you okay is everything okay neil
1:10:13 can you help me check and see if they
1:10:14 followed us yeah absolutely and where
1:10:17 this heightened sense is still up starts
1:10:19 looking around just to see if anybody's
1:10:20 following you take a look around and it
1:10:22 actually looks like johnny was pretty
1:10:24 successful in getting away they didn't
1:10:26 pursue okay i don't think they followed
1:10:27 us
1:10:28 okay who didn't follow you the killing
1:10:31 spree what happened we were walking and
1:10:33 talking and there was this guy i think
1:10:36 johnny that was your sire john nods they
1:10:39 the two of them they were in the in a
1:10:42 dunkin donuts and um the guy johnny
1:10:45 johnny sire he
1:10:47 had his hand up to the window and it was
1:10:49 covered in blood and he's trying to get
1:10:51 i think specifically my attention and as
1:10:54 he pulled his hand down um
1:10:56 he had the same tattoo as i had i don't
1:10:59 know if he was trying to show me or
1:11:00 scare me or maybe he knew that maybe he
1:11:03 knew that about me i don't know he felt
1:11:05 like he was trying to show me but maybe
1:11:06 he's trying to get johnny's attention
1:11:07 and
1:11:08 and as she's stuttering and as she's
1:11:12 explaining she does take off her glove
1:11:14 to show the crescent moon when she
1:11:17 pauses talking johnny will kind of step
1:11:21 forward brita perhaps uh
1:11:23 we should go
1:11:24 downstairs and get out of the rain if
1:11:26 that would be all right with you um yeah
1:11:28 i just you're getting soaked out here i
1:11:30 just want to make sure that they can't
1:11:31 get to us the entire point of hiding
1:11:34 here was for us to be safe together i
1:11:35 don't see anyone following us i can
1:11:37 ensure that they haven't followed us if
1:11:39 you'd like how
1:11:41 i can
1:11:42 stay out here and make sure they
1:11:44 don't come anywhere near us no i don't
1:11:46 want you to be alone let's go in i can
1:11:48 stay with johnny wynn is kind of tense
1:11:51 as brita's majesty is still up like
1:11:53 there is another creature attempting to
1:11:54 assert dominance over her
1:11:57 she is just kind of
1:11:59 processing this
1:12:00 she's not having any kind of a negative
1:12:03 reaction so to say but definitely okay
1:12:06 this is weird this is this is weird that
1:12:08 is weird and she's just trying to carry
1:12:10 on as normal not wanting to show any
1:12:12 weakness to a dominant predator not
1:12:15 wanting to notice like the wet hair and
1:12:16 the rain
1:12:18 definitely not wanting to notice
1:12:19 anything trickling anywhere um
1:12:23 just but she her shoulders visibly tense
1:12:27 like her hunches are up brita is going
1:12:29 to walk towards uh the entrance back
1:12:31 into the building and attempt to kind of
1:12:34 indicate to everyone like that sort of
1:12:36 jerk of the head of like get in okay
1:12:38 when kind of pauses like you can't tell
1:12:40 me what to do but ultimately follows
1:12:42 neil immediately says thank you for
1:12:44 telling me what to do
1:12:47 johnny follows the men as well i was
1:12:49 definitely standing inside not going to
1:12:50 go out in the rain
1:12:53 so once they head down the stairs spread
1:12:56 a strides over to the bar kind of puts
1:12:58 her hands down on it to take a moment to
1:13:00 recollect herself and turning putting
1:13:02 her back to the bar and feeling at home
1:13:04 in her haven her eyes kind of catch win
1:13:07 and the tension in her shoulders and
1:13:09 there's confusion across britta's face
1:13:12 before it kind of soaks in that there's
1:13:15 still something happening and there's
1:13:17 still reactions that brett isn't quite
1:13:19 used to she realizes that no one's
1:13:22 talking when she's talking everyone's
1:13:24 looking at her and she just
1:13:27 tries to turn off majesty as i say once
1:13:29 you get settled in there it's like could
1:13:30 you
1:13:31 turn that off
1:13:32 turn
1:13:33 what i mean
1:13:36 yeah um yeah yeah it's gonna make it
1:13:38 hard to communicate with them that has
1:13:39 no effect on miles doesn't no miles is
1:13:41 completely immune
1:13:44 and
1:13:45 [Laughter]
1:13:53 stop it stop it stop it
1:13:55 with that uh brita like recollects and
1:13:58 uh with putting her glove back on takes
1:14:01 that moment to explore how to turn off
1:14:03 the majesty with uh just a moment of
1:14:05 concentration you sort of let that power
1:14:08 you had generate slip between your
1:14:10 fingers and be gone
1:14:11 all right you guys normal again no i'm
1:14:14 still freaked out about the killing
1:14:16 spree yeah but um i don't know how that
1:14:18 worked on the outside yeah what worked
1:14:20 now what i'm good win is visibly more
1:14:23 relaxed
1:14:24 like almost immediately it was a hell of
1:14:26 a thing
1:14:27 all right so what's he ran into the
1:14:29 killing spree um yeah um he had his hand
1:14:33 against the window and he showed the
1:14:35 tattoo
1:14:36 and um
1:14:38 i interrupted you guys i'm sorry and uh
1:14:40 then
1:14:41 you know they looked like they were
1:14:42 going to engage and neil spotted the
1:14:44 city Gangrel and everything they were
1:14:46 coming in and off he skate and there was
1:14:48 some quick thinking on the part of neil
1:14:50 he uh he spooked the city gangrel and
1:14:53 then instead of following my lead of
1:14:55 beings being stupid
1:14:56 bretta pulled some interesting things
1:14:58 i've never seen her do before and told
1:15:00 us to leave hey don't say that okay
1:15:02 because what you want to do is brave and
1:15:05 i just didn't the line between brave and
1:15:07 stupid is whether or not you survive
1:15:09 anyways you all made your escape yeah
1:15:12 neil did this was that your magic or you
1:15:15 made the Gangrel frenzy there's um
1:15:18 yeah but by the way johnny i don't
1:15:19 really know a whole lot about how the
1:15:21 sabbat work
1:15:22 why didn't they turn on each other
1:15:24 there's a weird ritual
1:15:26 sabot packs
1:15:28 used to form their bonds it keeps them
1:15:30 free of blood bonds they can't be
1:15:33 ensnared by that kind of thing
1:15:35 they call it the baldery they drink a
1:15:38 mixture of all their bloods together
1:15:41 consecrated in a goblet johnny you don't
1:15:44 have that um
1:15:45 vaudluri bond for
1:15:48 your sire do you i never
1:15:51 stuck around long enough to be inducted
1:15:53 into their rituals okay i've never
1:15:56 partaken in the baldery so at the end
1:15:58 you know neil made them
1:16:00 frenzy against each other and then
1:16:02 johnny carried us out and got us a
1:16:04 safety well they they frenzied on the
1:16:05 crowd we'll tell you more about the
1:16:07 particulars later
1:16:08 suffice to say there might be a little
1:16:11 bit something on the news that
1:16:13 dunkin donuts continue to be a place of
1:16:16 danger in the city but uh i think
1:16:19 hopefully
1:16:20 that's all we'll hear about it for the
1:16:22 time being why are they targeting
1:16:24 [ __ ] dunkin donuts hang on this might
1:16:26 be a mass great breach i mean they were
1:16:28 ripping into the crowd and the jumping
1:16:29 and i will be handling that in a minute
1:16:32 okay we got people to handle most of
1:16:34 this
1:16:35 i mean we've already got them in gear so
1:16:37 i just have to direct them neil uh when
1:16:40 people are talking sort of thinks and
1:16:42 pats his pockets and then pulls his
1:16:44 phone out and goes well i mean on the
1:16:46 plus side uh and he flips it over to the
1:16:48 picture of the sabbat no no you flip it
1:16:51 over to a picture of the bruh of the
1:16:53 bruja yeah wow the sombra does not
1:16:55 appear so neil flips up on the photo
1:16:57 like he's going to show something
1:16:59 triumphantly and then looks at it way
1:17:01 longer and this curious like
1:17:04 huh
1:17:05 well still him anyways we got a decent
1:17:07 way to track him now johnny did you know
1:17:09 if your sire was um like me i've always
1:17:13 known that he's had that same tattoo but
1:17:15 do you think he was bretta kind of stops
1:17:18 and realizes that she hasn't caught a
1:17:20 coterie up on the rooftop conversation
1:17:23 she's been having did he ever say
1:17:25 anything about um chatter links
1:17:27 no i do know that everyone
1:17:30 only referred to him as the black hand
1:17:33 i thought that was his name
1:17:35 but it seems now that there
1:17:37 might actually be a greater organization
1:17:41 that goes by that title
1:17:42 i think the black hand
1:17:44 when i met with premojin nyx to ask her
1:17:46 more about me she told me some words and
1:17:49 some the black hand are also known as
1:17:52 the tomahera um they have that same
1:17:56 tattoo that i have and that i was before
1:17:59 i died that i was something called a
1:18:00 chatter link well as far as i know
1:18:03 the sabbat is full of all kinds of
1:18:06 secret societies just like the camarilla
1:18:09 if this uh tamahe ra
1:18:11 ham whatever they call themselves is
1:18:13 where you came from
1:18:14 and we just need to figure out if
1:18:16 there's any bonds that they've held on
1:18:18 to control you and break those he was
1:18:21 showing me or us i don't know which one
1:18:24 it is and i don't know what that means
1:18:26 if he knows what i am rita the sabbat
1:18:28 kidnap people and induct them against
1:18:31 their will
1:18:32 it's what they do
1:18:34 just because you were abducted
1:18:36 and tattooed with their symbol
1:18:39 doesn't mean that you're sabot black
1:18:41 hand or tamahera it means that you're a
1:18:43 victim just like i was britta kind of
1:18:45 stands down in her posture sort of looks
1:18:48 to johnny and um not slowly
1:18:51 trying to take
1:18:53 even though she doesn't need it the deep
1:18:55 breath seems to steady her
1:18:57 thank you i
1:18:59 and
1:19:00 it's just um
1:19:02 seeing that i
1:19:03 you must have
1:19:04 had a lot of feelings about it too
1:19:07 seeing your sire again it's a
1:19:08 confrontation that's been a long time
1:19:10 coming don't worry yourself about it
1:19:12 johnny turns over to
1:19:14 win and miles the two you things get
1:19:16 everything worked out
1:19:18 indeed
1:19:19 sounds like
1:19:20 raven has a problem with the demon and
1:19:24 while she doesn't know which one of us
1:19:26 is containing it she may or may not try
1:19:28 to kill one or all of us at some point
1:19:30 or other she feels the demon is out of
1:19:32 control you want me to tell her it's me
1:19:34 no
1:19:35 not not particularly
1:19:37 okay would she accept that the demon
1:19:40 would be gone in 30 days or would that
1:19:42 just make things she is off to hunt
1:19:45 arabella rollins and i suspect when she
1:19:47 comes back she's gonna want the
1:19:49 situation dealt with
1:19:50 she charged me with dealing with it so i
1:19:52 suspect if i don't my life is forfeit
1:19:54 anyway is there something that we can do
1:19:57 to repair those rings of the chantry or
1:20:00 they were repaired arabella repaired
1:20:02 them was working on it okay well it's
1:20:05 how much time is left before it's gone a
1:20:08 couple of weeks
1:20:09 and then so long she doesn't come back
1:20:10 with a couple of weeks and she's in
1:20:12 she's an old kindred so it'll probably
1:20:16 you know she's patient it'll be a little
1:20:17 bit before she comes back and then so
1:20:19 long as you know miles doesn't do
1:20:21 anything stupid in the next couple of
1:20:22 weeks like
1:20:24 then it's problem solved unless she
1:20:26 comes back and decides to just start
1:20:27 offing us until one of us
1:20:30 she can see that right and and i have no
1:20:32 idea i have no idea if she can see her
1:20:34 nazi i mean i can see it she must be
1:20:37 able to see it she's another i'm sorry
1:20:38 what does it look like well i mean i
1:20:40 don't mean with you i mean like if
1:20:42 someone has sold their soul to a demon
1:20:44 you know the green flag same as arabella
1:20:46 and those premier right what does mine
1:20:47 look like because i haven't made it so i
1:20:50 haven't i haven't looked i don't make it
1:20:51 out of practice to look at you guys like
1:20:53 maybe you should maybe you should look
1:20:55 at him maybe it'll look different
1:20:57 can you check for him and
1:21:00 miles of zora
1:21:02 i mean i can look
1:21:04 i don't know if it's better if i can see
1:21:05 it or not i want to know what others
1:21:07 will see if they look at us
1:21:09 we already have so much going on at
1:21:11 court with
1:21:12 and but it looks down as she uh
1:21:15 continues so i'm thinking me and johnny
1:21:17 have
1:21:18 so much to do with the sabbat and all
1:21:20 and everything with you i contacted my
1:21:23 sire what'd he say i guess the question
1:21:26 is how much do you want to know i mean i
1:21:28 feel like at least amongst us this is
1:21:31 not a great time to keep things to
1:21:33 ourselves
1:21:34 unless you think otherwise
1:21:36 but all right um do we want to play
1:21:38 telephone no i just it's gonna be a lot
