0:04:26 okay
0:04:27 he does a
0:04:28 complex gesture with his hands
0:04:31 and upon snapping his fingers and
0:04:33 clapping his hands you find there is a
0:04:36 rose and he holds the rose out to you
0:04:39 offering it as a gift
0:04:41 wind kind of takes it crassly like the
0:04:43 thorns don't even bother her
0:04:45 it just kind of looks at it i kept the
0:04:47 thorns because they remind me of you
0:04:50 is that a compliment
0:04:52 yes
0:04:54 okay because i genuinely couldn't tell

0:05:00 well let's focus on neil
0:05:03 well she does keep the rose
0:05:06 i have uh
0:05:08 acquired strange trinkets during my
0:05:10 travels and one of them
0:05:13 was a gift from a peruvian necromancer
0:05:16 and they
0:05:18 possessed a strange mold and this mold
0:05:21 possessed the ability to remove assassin
0:05:25 toxins from the kindred body wait a
0:05:27 minute is this that same necromancer
0:05:29 that we uh met last time
0:05:31 uh
0:05:34 yes
0:05:35 are you sure we can trust this [ __ ]
0:05:37 i've used it once before and almost
0:05:39 nothing happened that was detrimental to
0:05:41 the kindred it walked them immediately
0:05:44 johnny frowns a bit but then kind of
0:05:46 just acquiesces
0:05:48 all right
0:05:49 do not worry when
0:05:51 the necromancer can largely be trusted
0:05:54 largely
0:05:55 yes well he is a necromancer i will spit
0:05:58 in your coffee again
0:06:00 if you are wrong
0:06:01 and if i am right

0:06:07 i see
0:06:08 um
0:06:10 he uh steps inside
0:06:11 and
0:06:12 just at a quick glance into his motel
0:06:14 room
0:06:15 there are treasures galore
0:06:19 and
0:06:20 he
0:06:21 fumbles among them
0:06:23 and finds what looks to be
0:06:25 a little box of chocolates
0:06:28 and there's four and all and he opens it
0:06:30 up kind of showing the two of you
0:06:32 take one of these
0:06:33 and they will help your friend

0:07:11 chocolate works when

0:07:16 wind kind of looks at the chocolate in
0:07:18 her hand and
0:07:19 decides that no we're gonna do this and
0:07:22 she puts it in her mouth and starts
0:07:24 chewing it
0:07:25 uh it tastes
0:07:27 great
0:07:28 okay like there's there's just this
0:07:30 assortment of flavors that kind of hit
0:07:32 you one at a time and everything about

0:07:50 can swallow that one then i'll give you
0:07:53 uh this one for your friend she lets it
0:07:56 sit in her mouth for a while longer and
0:07:57 she kind of plays with it in her mouth
0:08:00 um she kind of seems to forget the fact
0:08:02 that she is in this crappy motel she is
0:08:05 tasting something for the first time
0:08:07 in
0:08:08 yeah
0:08:09 she's uh
0:08:10 just having at it for him for a minute
0:08:13 and then she finally decides okay we
0:08:16 need to get on with things and she does
0:08:17 swallow it
0:08:18 and this isn't going to make me sick or
0:08:20 anything i should have asked that before
0:08:22 i uh i'm not sure but
0:08:24 here's the other one for your friend
0:08:25 well
0:08:26 gangrel
0:08:28 and she takes it and she still enjoys
0:08:31 chewing it yes it might be hard but i
0:08:34 believe you can handle it
0:08:36 and she kind of turns to neil
0:08:38 johnny how do i do this
0:08:40 just scoop it out of your mouth and put
0:08:42 it in his like it's
0:08:44 paced into a wound
0:08:45 all right
0:08:46 and she
0:08:48 in order for him to ingest that right
0:08:49 you have to use some blood oh well
0:08:52 when bites her lip yep
0:08:54 and kind of swishes it all around
0:08:57 and kind of scoops it out of her mouth
0:09:00 oh buddy i'm sorry
0:09:02 gently opens neil's mouth puts it in his
0:09:04 mouth as you look at the pace and you
0:09:05 like slop it into neil's mouth
0:09:08 you notice that whatever the paste is
0:09:10 made of
0:09:11 it like undulates on its own
0:09:14 and when you slop it into his mouth his
0:09:18 body instinctively starts to draw the
0:09:20 vitae down his throat this
0:09:22 gross chocolatey moss
0:09:25 thing gets slurped right down
0:09:28 over the course of moments his body kind
0:09:30 of starts to twitch and those blackened
0:09:32 veins
0:09:33 start to fade away
0:09:35 [Music]
0:09:42 neil
0:09:44 neil
0:09:45 um
0:09:48 uh neil it does not taste good oh you're

0:10:43 where
0:10:44 you don't have to tell me everything
0:10:46 just the rundown

0:10:52 were poisoned
0:10:54 by the asomite
0:10:56 yeah and um

0:11:00 something that might be able to help

0:13:08 certain something to the look something
0:13:10 to remember new york by
0:13:12 let's go
0:13:13 okay and
0:13:15 neil buckles himself into the middle
0:13:17 seat in the back again
0:13:21 [Music]
0:13:25 the group of you arrive to the navan art
0:13:27 space
0:13:28 it's a cold night
0:13:30 and
0:13:31 there's that filthy slushy snow pressed
0:13:35 everywhere
0:13:36 not very much of it anymore
0:13:38 outside you can already see a handful of
0:13:40 kindred
0:13:41 smoking cigarettes and chatting with
0:13:43 each other
0:13:44 and though
0:13:46 now they seem to say less
0:13:49 and the conversations
0:13:50 are
0:13:52 hard to follow unimportant and
0:13:54 vague references
0:13:56 it seems more like their eyes are
0:13:58 scanning the streets the rooftops and
0:14:01 the environment for any signs of the
0:14:04 sabbat threat
0:14:06 spotting kneel there's something of a
0:14:08 pause
0:14:09 and one of them heads inside
0:14:13 hey johnny thanks for getting us back
0:14:16 safe
0:14:18 that's a rough drive
0:14:20 the problem
0:14:22 it uh could have been a little bit
0:14:23 easier
0:14:25 it could have been a lot harder too and
0:14:27 it wasn't so
0:14:28 thank you
0:14:29 yeah i don't um
0:14:31 yeah it's been a busy couple of days i i
0:14:33 don't know if i actually
0:14:35 thanked all of you for coming to get me
0:14:37 i i didn't know
0:14:39 obviously i didn't know you were
0:14:41 gonna be the ones to come pick me up but
0:14:43 i appreciate it
0:14:45 and i would be dead without all of you
0:14:48 or
0:14:49 at least not here
0:14:51 so um
0:14:53 whatever happens inside
0:14:54 just
0:14:56 thank you everybody we're glad you're
0:14:57 back man
0:14:58 yeah also yeah
0:15:00 i'm pretty sure elsa linda has written
0:15:03 you off a live boon by the way
0:15:05 oh is it
0:15:07 really well at some point as soon as we
0:15:09 have an established hobby but yes that's
0:15:10 what she agreed to she'll probably check
0:15:11 with the harpy on that but okay i just
0:15:14 figured you should know before that
0:15:15 becomes a thing and you're not allowed
0:15:17 to
0:15:18 disappear for a bit again okay
0:15:20 who is the current heartbeat i will try
0:15:22 my best
0:15:23 likes do we the court hasn't been
0:15:25 reestablished yet that would be
0:15:26 something that gets figured out tonight
0:15:28 all right
0:15:29 we don't have one yet all right i think
0:15:32 this is the
0:15:34 without much of a
0:15:36 prompting or much planning apparently i
0:15:38 think this is happening tonight do any
0:15:40 of you all have weapons on you
0:15:42 no
0:15:43 uh i gotta
0:15:45 do you mind looking through my fanny
0:15:47 pack here just to make sure nothing
0:15:48 counts as a weapon
0:15:50 johnny takes a quick look it is filled
0:15:52 with all sorts of weird garbage like a
0:15:55 broken shard of mirror some long ribbons
0:15:58 a bunch of candles um some loose change
0:16:03 there's like a little pocket knife
0:16:05 but like one little tiny swiss army ones
0:16:07 not like a real one yeah just a just a
0:16:10 bunch of garbage shoved into a nylon
0:16:12 fanny pack how are you wearing it around
0:16:14 my waist
0:16:15 i think you'll be fine neil okay i just
0:16:18 wanted to could you maybe like
0:16:20 like bend the leader around her chest at
0:16:21 least that's a little bit better he
0:16:23 shifts it from directly in front of him
0:16:26 around his waist to the side now that's
0:16:28 that's marginally better
0:16:32 um i left it in the car i think and
0:16:34 she'll double check almost as if she
0:16:35 doesn't trust that she did that
0:16:38 bretta does not find a weapon and i
0:16:40 guess you can carry whatever you want
0:16:42 now sheriff as long as it's not in the
0:16:44 open that's why i have my guitar case at
0:16:46 this point i usually don't carry it
0:16:48 around neil did you know that miles is
0:16:50 the sheriff now i
0:16:52 did not did did
0:16:55 weathers not survive the night
0:16:57 no weathers is alive and well
0:17:00 but uh
0:17:02 rhys has been encouraging
0:17:05 roland's to reorganize things in court
0:17:09 that makes sense the cenotrol would do
0:17:10 that
0:17:11 i'm hoping that's not
0:17:13 sorry what
0:17:14 nothing let's go inside and see what the
0:17:17 landscape looks like he's very annoyed
0:17:19 by the whole turn of events and is
0:17:22 putting his game face back on when the
0:17:24 group of you head inside you find
0:17:27 one it is way more quiet at the salism
0:17:31 than it normally is
0:17:32 and there's a tension
0:17:34 that is thick in the air and as you get
0:17:36 closer you find at the center where a
0:17:39 lot of people seem to be
0:17:41 giving sideways glances and peeking at
0:17:43 and
0:17:44 trying to unobtrusively listen to are
0:17:48 some chairs that have kind of been
0:17:49 organized and are facing each other
0:17:52 amidst the beautiful uh modern art
0:17:55 selection is
0:17:57 three kindred on one side
0:17:59 two on the other among the three kindred
0:18:02 you see
0:18:03 upton rollins uh seated
0:18:05 with rhys standing at his right side and
0:18:09 seated at his left
0:18:11 is elsa linden
0:18:13 and the three of them
0:18:15 though they
0:18:16 try to hide it have
0:18:19 concerned expressions
0:18:21 and seeded across from them
0:18:24 is
0:18:25 a
0:18:26 man who is has a very like
0:18:29 has very sharp features a very like kind
0:18:32 of dashing
0:18:33 appearance to him
0:18:35 very nice tucks
0:18:37 he has long dark hair that is swept back
0:18:41 and has these piercing blue eyes
0:18:44 and there's a pin
0:18:46 like right over his heart depicting the
0:18:49 bruja clan symbol
0:18:51 a lot of the bruja seem to kind of like
0:18:55 keep peeking his way trying to figure
0:18:57 out what this guy is all about and
0:18:58 seated next to him
0:19:00 is jane who is very like bubbly and
0:19:03 friendly and is like
0:19:06 seems to be making an effort to
0:19:09 keep whatever conversation that is
0:19:10 happening
0:19:11 peaceful
0:19:13 bretta at a cursory look
0:19:15 some of the kindred that are here are
0:19:16 not local and
0:19:18 of those like five kind of thuggish but
0:19:22 oddly professional looking gentlemen
0:19:24 that are present that you don't
0:19:25 recognize
0:19:26 all of them are packing weapons
0:19:29 way in the back more on roland's side
0:19:33 is
0:19:34 a few individuals that are kind of like
0:19:36 gathered in a semicircle talking to each
0:19:38 other
0:19:39 and it looks to be the nosferatu
0:19:43 and among them
0:19:45 is this kind of
0:19:47 um
0:19:48 tall kind of built figure wearing like a
0:19:51 hood and like a tattered coat
0:19:54 um
0:19:55 and he
0:19:56 uh has this like menacing monstrous
0:20:00 continents
0:20:01 and cat-like eyes that like kind of
0:20:04 glint despite the shadows cast over him
0:20:07 and he
0:20:08 definitely seems to be a newcomer to the
0:20:11 domain
0:20:12 brita kind of looks towards the weapons
0:20:14 and then towards miles for a moment
0:20:18 scanning for reaction as sheriff and for
0:20:20 what she knows about the rules
0:20:21 i'll take it all in and
0:20:23 um it seems if i had to guess who this
0:20:26 is i have a pretty good idea
0:20:28 based on his
0:20:30 previous taking of hartford romeo
0:20:33 politics and while you're rolling pilots
0:20:35 actually just go ahead and rule politics
0:20:36 yep
0:20:40 nope never mind
0:20:41 uh you're not quite sure i didn't um
0:20:46 bretta now i need you to make
0:20:49 a self-control track okay and that's
0:20:51 just self-control correct yes
0:20:53 self-control difficulty six okay
0:20:56 the odd shapes and unique colors start
0:20:58 to kind of catch your eye and you find
0:21:00 yourself pondering the deeper meanings
0:21:02 of those images
0:21:06 no successes
0:21:07 okay you get lost not in the images and
0:21:12 shapes that you see
0:21:15 but in the way they make you feel and
0:21:17 all of the things that have recently
0:21:18 happened to you start to kind of come to
0:21:20 the surface and you find yourself
0:21:22 imagining strange correlations between
0:21:24 the art you see
0:21:26 and the feelings they provoke
0:21:28 and you are lost in it
0:21:34 [Music]
0:21:38 um
0:21:38 [Music]
0:21:39 so what's the
0:21:41 i mean it feels weird but should we just
0:21:43 mingle or
0:21:45 i'm gonna go present myself to rollins
0:21:47 okay feel free to mingle
0:21:49 i'm gonna figure out what's going on
0:21:51 i'm gonna uh
0:21:53 i'm just gonna i'm gonna go
0:21:57 how about we just
0:21:59 neil seems kind of lost like maybe
0:22:01 all the changes in and and looking
0:22:03 around neil i'm gonna go see if i can
0:22:06 find other primogen do you want to come
0:22:08 with me uh neil looks over and then
0:22:10 looks at britta and i was like i don't
0:22:12 know she's um i mean i've been there if
0:22:15 you want to stay with britta too that's
0:22:16 fine i think somebody probably should um
0:22:20 or we shake her out of it
0:22:22 but if she's enjoying herself and she
0:22:23 looks like she is i bet
0:22:26 yeah
0:22:27 if you he looks over at mile he looks
0:22:29 between miles and win actually
0:22:32 if if either one of you
0:22:34 needs anything or can think of a way i
0:22:35 can be useful here
0:22:37 let me know if you get a chance you just
0:22:39 check on festo we haven't really heard
0:22:40 from since that night oh
0:22:43 yeah neil looks over at the like a
0:22:45 little cluster of nosferatu is faster
0:22:47 over there uh fester is and fester is
0:22:50 sliming all over the new guy and making
0:22:52 every effort to kiss his ass
0:22:54 no that tells me a lot miles
0:22:57 if you're gonna go over to uh
0:22:58 talk with the prince i'll be on your six
0:23:01 watching your back
0:23:02 thanks okay um
0:23:05 she'll be okay for a few minutes anybody
0:23:06 stay in touch neil kind of awkwardly
0:23:09 grabs like there's like chairs and
0:23:11 benches and stuff right neil kind of
0:23:13 awkwardly like grabs a chair and just
0:23:14 puts it behind britta
0:23:17 and kind of like just pushes her down
0:23:20 so she's sitting in the chair rather
0:23:21 than just standing there every single
0:23:22 toyota of the room gives you the
0:23:24 dirtiest looks yep um the second you go
0:23:27 to touch her while she's like viewing
0:23:29 the uh they just just get horrific
0:23:31 glares like withering agonizing glare
0:23:35 sounds like neil does not obfuscate but
0:23:38 he
0:23:38 takes on the body position as if he is
0:23:43 but does it anyway
0:23:45 and then sort of slinks off
0:23:48 very uncomfortably a murderer approach
0:23:52 and they're just like are you okay are
0:23:53 you okay and they just check on her
0:23:56 edging you further and further away from
0:23:59 the toreador yep okay this isn't
0:24:01 did him touching me break me out or am i
0:24:04 still in uh roll a self-control check
0:24:06 all right uh just trying to get her a
0:24:08 chair
0:24:11 how dare you
0:24:12 very rude
0:24:16 so that's three successes okay yeah yeah
0:24:19 you do kind of get yourself together
0:24:20 when you come to you kind of realize
0:24:21 that there's like a bunch of who are
0:24:23 like hey are you okay all of this stuff
0:24:25 and they all start introducing
0:24:26 themselves rapid fire and it's kind of
0:24:27 hard to keep track of the conversation
0:24:30 um yes i think thank you and bretta
0:24:33 actually tries pretty hard to
0:24:36 keep up with people's names and
0:24:37 appearances
0:24:38 one of them uh a young woman named
0:24:41 catherine tells you that you know they
0:24:43 just wanted to make sure because elysium
0:24:45 is very tense tonight the prince of
0:24:47 hartford has come
0:24:49 and rumors have it that he is very close
0:24:51 to the prince of boston and apparently
0:24:55 this man is something
0:24:56 of an imperial leader
0:24:58 and he has arrived to make sure that new
0:25:01 haven is well defended a concerned
0:25:03 camera the citizen and they kind of like
0:25:04 give you like this look like yeah wink
0:25:06 wink nudge nudge this guy does not give
0:25:07 a [ __ ]
0:25:09 an imperial leader
0:25:11 yes
0:25:12 he is the sort of prince whose
0:25:16 glory is too great for one domain
0:25:19 i see
0:25:20 um
0:25:21 kind of scanning for emotional reaction
0:25:23 on that uh they seem pretty terrified of
0:25:25 this guy
0:25:26 what's his name his name is roman
0:25:30 pendragon and he comes from england
0:25:32 supposedly
0:25:34 he found himself
0:25:36 out of favor
0:25:38 in london's court because of how
0:25:41 ruthless he can be
0:25:44 him uh
0:25:47 shaw's old sire
0:25:48 and the group of them are very close to
0:25:50 one another
0:25:51 is there someone who would match the
0:25:53 description of possibly being shaw's
0:25:55 sire by him
0:25:57 there's another two you've never seen
0:25:58 before but he doesn't seem to carry
0:26:00 himself with this the level of like
0:26:03 might that
0:26:04 this man roman pen dragon does and the
0:26:07 court seems less concerned about him
0:26:09 than they are about
0:26:11 this
0:26:12 this brouha that's just sitting in
0:26:14 opposition of upton roland's and making
0:26:15 him feel meek
0:26:17 how long has he have they been in these
0:26:19 talks he arrived earlier tonight
0:26:22 has it always been remembered kind of
0:26:25 nods
0:26:26 just very slightly over to the
0:26:28 conversation
0:26:30 like that
0:26:32 i don't know
0:26:33 normally
0:26:34 a kindred of other domains don't travel
0:26:36 very much so his sudden arrival is
0:26:39 something of a shock
0:26:40 i see
0:26:41 upton rollins refused
0:26:44 to activate his scourge supposedly it
0:26:47 would seem that
0:26:49 were
0:26:50 matters to escalate our prince is not
0:26:53 confident in his victory
0:26:55 does he normally not
0:26:57 activate his scourge like that
0:26:59 no often roland's care is little for the
0:27:01 survival of unwelcomed visitors
0:27:03 uh no offense
0:27:05 none taken catherine um
0:27:07 thank you she kind of like gives a
0:27:09 little wave
0:27:10 and
0:27:11 uh the group of them kind of go
0:27:13 wandering off to talk
0:27:15 with that being said uh
0:27:18 brit is pretty sure she would have had
0:27:20 someone near her to put her in her chair
0:27:22 uh did you can she does she know that
0:27:24 neil put her there did it div just break
0:27:26 neil is uh not an obfuscate he's just
0:27:28 kind of standing off to the side
0:27:30 incredibly uncomfortable okay so he's
0:27:32 visible all right uh once they kind of
0:27:35 uh
0:27:37 flock away
0:27:38 bretta kind of looks around spots neal
0:27:40 and says
0:27:42 did you get all that
0:27:43 no
0:27:44 um i
0:27:46 i i heard roman pen dragon and and i
0:27:49 heard um scourge wasn't activated i i
0:27:52 have to admit i wasn't paying a hundred
0:27:54 percent attention i
0:27:56 it's
0:27:56 um
0:27:57 being surrounded by tory door like that
0:27:59 at elysium is about as panic inducing as
0:28:01 running from the web of knives
0:28:03 i'm sorry no it's fine i just
0:28:06 i didn't mean to
0:28:08 they got real mad when i tried to bring
0:28:10 you a chair so um i i wasn't i wasn't
0:28:13 trying to all right take the art
0:28:15 appreciation away i i i've been there
0:28:17 too i've looked at stuff and i i've just
0:28:20 gotten lost in it
0:28:22 yep so
0:28:23 we should probably get that back to
0:28:24 miles when we can all right the chair
0:28:27 bretta shakes her head and looks for
0:28:29 where miles is
0:28:33 [Music]
0:28:36 miles after the end of that conversation
0:28:39 is strode over towards elsa rollins and
0:28:42 rhys just progressing over there the
0:28:44 trio gives you a nod i come up and i bow
0:28:47 you grace elsa reese
0:28:50 yes hello this is
0:28:52 mr pendragon this is my sheriff uh
0:28:56 as i've told you previously he has
0:28:58 everything in hand he actually just
0:28:59 recently engaged in a foray into new
0:29:01 york handling business against the
0:29:03 rebellion there he's quite effective
0:29:06 isn't that so he says looking to you
0:29:08 very much so you guys
0:29:10 good evening mr pendragon good evening
0:29:12 myles
0:29:14 how was your foray into new york
0:29:17 successful
0:29:18 wonderful
0:29:20 your prince and i were discussing
0:29:22 inter-domain relations
0:29:24 and mutual defense against the sabbath
0:29:26 what is your opinion of their threat
0:29:29 the thr of the sabbath hole or the one
0:29:32 particularly attacking new haven the
0:29:34 ones who devastated a local restaurant
0:29:37 surely you've heard of it
0:29:39 yes the
0:29:41 multitude of dunkin donuts we have it
0:29:42 probably made the landscape better
0:29:45 so you welcome this invasion no he like
0:29:48 laughs and the entire elysium laughs
0:29:50 with him
0:29:52 well
0:29:54 starting our information gathering and
0:29:57 we're planning on attacking them
0:29:59 not too so long from now starting
0:30:02 information gathering
0:30:04 some of our pieces had to come back
0:30:05 together i see
0:30:07 i will have you know that i am at the
0:30:08 head of an army the only army that is
0:30:11 feared with the sabbath if you require
0:30:13 help sheriff you need but say so
0:30:16 i
0:30:17 i'm sure that the domain appreciates
0:30:19 your offer but
0:30:21 as the prince says we do have it in hand
0:30:23 and the killing spree will
0:30:26 have its spree ended
0:30:27 soon enough very good i look forward to
0:30:29 this i
0:30:31 hope that this threat does not remain as
0:30:33 long as arabella rowlands has arabella's
0:30:36 threat was ended fairly quickly she's
0:30:38 now on the run the domain of boston
0:30:41 does not agree with your assessment
0:30:42 regarding her threat how so
0:30:45 well she's in boston causing trouble
0:30:48 you no doubt have tails following us so
0:30:49 i know have no need to explain this to
0:30:51 you
0:30:52 but it would seem that the
0:30:54 your office has a great deal of work to
0:30:56 be tending to thus
0:30:58 my offer for aid
0:31:01 perhaps we can help you gather
0:31:02 intelligence too he laughs again and the
0:31:05 elysium laughs with him
0:31:06 we have it in hand and
0:31:09 the kindness of other kindred is always
0:31:11 to appreciate it but
0:31:13 we do have our business i will inform
0:31:15 the prince of boston that you would be
0:31:17 is it your you who will be going to
0:31:19 collect arabella
0:31:21 yes

0:31:57 who else do you have johnny who has been
0:31:59 standing at maybe a like you know a good
0:32:02 few paces behind
0:32:03 uh
0:32:04 miles finally pipes up
0:32:06 and what history is that
0:32:09 the history of your embrace
0:32:11 and what problem do you have with that
0:32:13 well it isn't my domain i welcome any
0:32:16 brouhaha who has the strength to carry
0:32:18 their own weight
0:32:19 but so then the prince of boston is fine
0:32:23 you're not going to interrupt me again
0:32:25 the prince of boston
0:32:27 is malkavian with an extensive network
0:32:29 of information gatherings and he
0:32:33 may not agree
0:32:36 of course i am willing to put in a good
0:32:37 word for you
0:32:38 young neonates like yourself deserve a
0:32:40 chance
0:32:41 i kind of just like signal just let it
0:32:43 go just a nod towards you and just like
0:32:45 johnny flicks his eyes over towards jane
0:32:48 who is sitting next to pendragon correct
0:32:51 [Music]
0:32:52 what's she doing she's being very casual
0:32:55 very chill
0:32:57 gives you like a very desperate look
0:32:59 when you interrupt pendragon like please
0:33:01 do not get everyone killed that gives
0:33:04 you that look
0:33:05 but like totally smiles and is really
0:33:07 happy to see you prince pendragon i
0:33:09 would very much appreciate
0:33:11 if you would extend the honor to my
0:33:14 cotery
0:33:15 by putting in a good word for us
0:33:18 and making sure that we would have a
0:33:19 smooth trip to boston
0:33:22 i would be very pleased to help you in
0:33:24 your time of need uh neil foster and
0:33:28 britta ashford
0:33:30 forgive me
0:33:31 my recent information i told me that
0:33:33 neil foster had been killed by the
0:33:34 sabbat
0:33:36 has this changed he was
0:33:38 m.i.a and has apparently been found
0:33:42 apparently yes
0:33:44 he's over there
0:33:45 yes we picked him up today our
0:33:47 information had
0:33:48 found him and we were able to secure his
0:33:51 did you just come from new york yes
0:33:54 i see
0:33:55 i will happily speak
0:33:56 on behalf of johnny
0:33:59 he is a member of my clan and
0:34:01 a noble
0:34:03 warrior of the bruja
0:34:05 uh seems to have a bit of a complicated
0:34:07 story you've obviously interrogated him
0:34:09 and gathered all the details as to where
0:34:11 he's been um perhaps you can regale us
0:34:14 neil across the art space that is dead
0:34:18 silent has now heard his name multiple
0:34:20 times
0:34:21 and despite being a six foot tall man
0:34:25 is clearly like
0:34:28 sort of shrinking behind brita
0:34:31 as best as he possibly can johnny will
0:34:34 step forward a little bit closer to
0:34:36 miles
0:34:38 respectfully
0:34:40 the details of
0:34:42 neil's absence from the domain
0:34:46 needs to be
0:34:47 kept close to the sheriff's office for
0:34:49 the time being
0:34:51 do you vouch for this man johnny neil
0:34:53 foster yes of course
0:34:56 and that is satisfactory for me
0:34:58 sheriff
0:34:59 when do you plan to
0:35:01 resolve the matter of uh your clan mate
0:35:04 we plan to do it within the next two
0:35:06 weeks
0:35:08 excellent i will
0:35:10 inform my friends
0:35:13 the prince of boston of your arrival and
0:35:16 i have no doubt he is looking forward to
0:35:19 seeing the matter of her presence
0:35:20 resolved
0:35:22 johnny
0:35:23 takes a moment to
0:35:25 move his eyes around the court and
0:35:27 begins counting up the brouha present
0:35:30 there were quite a few last time we were
0:35:32 here has that number stayed the same or
0:35:35 has that grown
0:35:36 that number has actually dwindled a bit
0:35:40 judging by like the looks they're all
0:35:42 kind of like
0:35:44 flustered that up that upton rollins
0:35:47 hasn't rolled out the carpet for roman
0:35:50 pendragon enough
0:35:51 and is like snubbing their clan by
0:35:53 treating roman pendragon like an evil
0:35:55 conqueror follow-up question to that the
0:35:58 brouha who are present are any of them
0:36:00 new embraces or do i recognize most of
0:36:03 them
0:36:04 most of them you recognize
0:36:06 uh there is a handful of new embraces
0:36:09 often rollins kind of gives you a look
0:36:11 well as you can see my
0:36:13 sheriff is ready to
0:36:15 address
0:36:16 uh
0:36:18 the many problems of the main faces
0:36:20 and
0:36:22 we'll be using his
0:36:24 quarterly who is highly experienced with
0:36:26 the sabbat to see this matter results
0:36:31 yeah i'd write rhys looks so upset
0:36:35 you know what that's a positive
0:36:38 i'll take that for a win thank you mr
0:36:40 rule
0:36:40 i'll nod my head along with his words
0:36:43 and move back over to his
0:36:45 side seemingly that this conversation is
0:36:47 at a close
0:36:49 the
0:36:50 prince of hartford stands everyone who
0:36:52 is seated stands
0:36:54 roman pendragon says to the group
0:36:57 uh well you have a
0:37:00 lovely art museum and
0:37:02 it was quite a visit
0:37:05 i look forward to visiting again
0:37:07 but for now i must retire and
0:37:10 see you to the matters of my court
0:37:12 i look forward to seeing you he says
0:37:15 particularly to elsa
0:37:17 and then he turns and looks to jane
0:37:21 and says
0:37:22 consider my offer
0:37:24 we'll speak more again soon
0:37:26 and he walks out and those armed bruja
0:37:31 that have been hanging out in elysium
0:37:32 who are not
0:37:34 deputies
0:37:35 form up a line behind him and join their
0:37:39 prince as he makes his exit and by the
0:37:41 time he's gone there is just this
0:37:44 unspoken sigh of relief between everyone
0:37:47 in the court
0:37:51 [Music]
0:37:55 while this has been going on wind's
0:37:56 looking for other primogen prevention
0:37:58 are gathered in back like in a separate
0:38:00 room
0:38:02 kind of quietly
0:38:04 nervously pacing
0:38:06 and
0:38:08 it seems that they are saying things
0:38:12 along the lines of well you know if a
0:38:14 conflict erupts surely romans can take
0:38:16 care of himself
0:38:18 we have to look after our own clans and
0:38:21 they're
0:38:21 they're kind of talking themselves into
0:38:24 submission to
0:38:26 pendragon should he have decided to rip
0:38:29 the prince's head off and declare praxis
0:38:31 wind kind of waits for a natural pause
0:38:33 yeah i'll turn to greet you nix gives
0:38:35 you a look the malkavian imaging ah you
0:38:38 have arrived
0:38:40 did you think i wasn't going to
0:38:42 well
0:38:43 you were in the midst of a complicated
0:38:45 evening
0:38:47 that's all of my evenings
0:38:51 they all kind of like nervously smile
0:38:54 surely you've seen the arrival of the
0:38:55 prince of hartford what do you make of
0:38:57 it is there anything to make of it he's
0:38:59 another prince well he has his
0:39:02 reputation
0:39:03 he's a big scary prince but this isn't
0:39:06 his domain is it well that's sort of
0:39:08 what we're discussing i
0:39:11 have no opinion on it
0:39:12 what did you want to discuss
0:39:15 mostly i just want to get up to speed
0:39:17 have we selected a harpy
0:39:19 there has been talk of
0:39:22 either jane
0:39:24 or
0:39:25 and
0:39:26 the door opens and before she can finish
0:39:28 her sentence
0:39:29 a
0:39:30 tall kind of hulking nosferatu
0:39:33 and a hood and coat enters and shuts the
0:39:35 door behind him i'll be representing the
0:39:38 nosferatu
0:39:39 pleased to meet each of you i am renwick
0:39:42 pleasure to meet you renwick i'm winn
0:39:44 cabot representative of the gangrel
0:39:46 please continue
0:39:48 uh he kind of like says gesturing for
0:39:50 those who are speaking to feel free to
0:39:52 continue doing so and uh
0:39:55 uh goes on to say that
0:39:57 elsa linden
0:39:58 has also been considered for the
0:40:00 position of primition
0:40:02 uh excuse me uh harpy
0:40:04 are you is the group leaning towards any
0:40:06 particular one our preference is ms
0:40:09 linden
0:40:10 um by supporting her she can in turn
0:40:13 support us and
0:40:15 we are
0:40:17 more confident
0:40:19 that elsa can stand up to the likes of
0:40:21 roman pendragon i mean that's fair
0:40:25 i think it would go a long way to
0:40:27 roman pendragon having another bruja to
0:40:29 talk to but i also think elsa is
0:40:32 eminently more qualified for the job
0:40:35 we are concerned that um the brouha have
0:40:38 a way of rallying
0:40:40 and often toward bad causes
0:40:43 if jane is awarded power if the bahrai
0:40:46 have any power than this domain roman
0:40:48 pendragon will leverage it to his ends
0:40:50 that's a fair concern
0:40:52 i mean as i said i think
0:40:54 for me the
0:40:56 the vote is for elsa linden
0:40:58 but that's simply because of her
0:41:00 qualifications not because of what jane
0:41:02 might do if given the power
0:41:04 would seem that the only one that has
0:41:06 not voted yet
0:41:07 is the bruha premijin
0:41:10 but he seems to have not come tonight so
0:41:13 we will hold this vote without him
0:41:16 who is speaking for the bruja at this
0:41:18 time the former sheriff he's a good man
0:41:21 he'll do well for his client here yes
0:41:23 but the question is is he a good
0:41:24 primogen i thought he was a good sheriff
0:41:27 well
0:41:28 i'm sure some did
0:41:30 with your vote
0:41:31 elsa linden becomes the harpy of new
0:41:34 haven
0:41:35 was this
0:41:36 i don't
0:41:37 know if this is common to ask but i
0:41:39 assume you all have had discussions
0:41:41 is this unanimous well the only one who
0:41:44 has not voted is the bruham primigen and
0:41:47 the brujah primogen is one vote and so
0:41:49 uh if everyone else
0:41:51 uh supports
0:41:53 ms linden she is happy all right then
0:41:56 next kind of looks among the other
0:41:57 primitions it seems like she actually
0:41:59 tends to be in control of the previous
0:42:02 meetings when they happen
0:42:04 does anyone else have any other business
0:42:05 they wish to bring forward anyone
0:42:07 happens across any gangrel
0:42:09 let them know that there's a new
0:42:10 primitive here
0:42:11 who would love to speak with them
0:42:13 yes of course they all kind of like give
0:42:16 nods there's a few people missing here
0:42:18 there's not that the tremendous virgin
0:42:19 is not in here the rapture primogen is
0:42:22 not in here
0:42:23 that's orbital premising is not in here
0:42:26 venture premature does not have their
0:42:27 true provision is not in there
0:42:29 so really is it is it just win
0:42:32 uh renwick and nix
0:42:34 that appears to be the case
0:42:37 unanimous
0:42:40 unanimous
0:42:42 um get call me the kid who comes in late
0:42:45 and asks for everyone else's notes
0:42:48 who is currently speaking for each clan
0:42:51 rhys represents the trumier has voted
0:42:54 for elsa linden
0:42:55 i believe either his grace or miles
0:42:57 represents the primogen
0:42:59 uh
0:42:59 for the venture
0:43:01 whichever um
0:43:02 they're both voting for elsa linden
0:43:05 then there is uh renwick of the
0:43:07 nosferatu she changed gestures to him
0:43:10 gives a little fake salute to reiterate
0:43:13 her greeting uh there is you of the
0:43:15 gangrel
0:43:16 there is uh
0:43:18 former sheriff weathers representing the
0:43:20 bruja uh myself
0:43:22 primogenics of the markavians and
0:43:26 and yes and elsa linden of the torridor
0:43:29 she voted for james
0:43:32 yes she did not vote for jane by the way
0:43:34 i wouldn't expect that
0:43:36 seems kind of defeating all right well i
0:43:38 appreciate the rundown
0:43:40 is there anything else clan gangrel can
0:43:42 help the other clans with at this time
0:43:45 additional security against the sabot
0:43:48 there is some concern that we are in
0:43:50 dire need of proper bully boys
0:43:52 i'll see what i can do to rally some of
0:43:54 the uh wanderers also um
0:43:56 you don't happen to know what happened
0:43:59 with the attack on the anarchs do you
0:44:01 attack on the anarchs yes i consider
0:44:04 this that a no
0:44:05 there was an attack on the anarchs there
0:44:07 is a rumor that anarchs have been
0:44:10 finding themselves waylaid by sabbat
0:44:12 forced to drink from their
0:44:15 infernal cup or
0:44:17 be devoured
0:44:18 that's news
0:44:20 no i haven't heard anything about that
0:44:21 i'm sorry if you hear anything please
0:44:23 let us know and if i hear any more about
0:44:25 the matter i would be happy to let you

0:44:33 uh see if there's anything else to be
0:44:35 learned um premijin nix um
0:44:39 have you heard that neil is returned i
0:44:41 saw
0:44:44 wanted to make sure you knew
0:44:46 he gives a nod and steps out
0:44:49 win kind of once the room is empty gives
0:44:51 a huh and shakes herself off because
0:44:54 politics still just doesn't sit right
0:44:56 with her it's been an evening of growth
0:45:00 a word kangaroo permission
0:45:02 renwick says oh i'm sorry i didn't
0:45:05 realize anyone was still in here

0:45:10 how can i be of service to you mr
0:45:12 renwick i am here to investigate the
0:45:15 death of messiah
0:45:17 it is said that shawn was
0:45:20 assassinated over a matter of politics

0:45:26 him

0:45:45 conveniently the door is closed
0:45:48 excellent so i'm going to be very honest
0:45:50 with you
0:45:51 about everything that went that happened
0:45:54 it started when your sire attacked my
0:45:55 coterie mate he staked him from behind
0:45:58 while he was fighting a werewolf when my
0:46:00 codery mate went down that's when
0:46:02 sanishal reese started doing
0:46:05 things
0:46:06 he did things to me
0:46:08 he did things to
0:46:10 your sire
0:46:11 and he did things to my codery mate
0:46:13 johnny and
0:46:16 it got bad
0:46:17 uh
0:46:18 it
0:46:19 i was dominated to try and hurt your
0:46:21 sire i never got there although you were
0:46:23 there i was in the room i never got to
0:46:25 your sire i see my coda remate johnny
0:46:29 did he and shaw got into a grappling
0:46:31 match
0:46:32 and
0:46:33 i have to believe that he was dominated
0:46:37 because johnny's
0:46:39 johnny's not that stupid
0:46:41 thank you for sharing the story i do
0:46:43 have one question yes
0:46:46 is it true that your friend johnny
0:46:47 embraced zantosa
0:46:51 yes
0:46:52 thank you
0:46:54 he opens the door and just leaves
0:46:56 when
0:46:57 looks around again
0:46:59 and makes sure there's no one
0:47:01 you feel like the room might be empty
0:47:04 shuts the door
0:47:07 [ __ ]
0:47:09 [Music]
0:47:15 now that pen dragon's gone johnny kind
0:47:17 of slowly edges over towards jane you
0:47:20 want to catch me up on what this
0:47:22 [ __ ] storm is about um
0:47:26 well uh to be very uh
0:47:30 open with you johnny i would love for
0:47:32 you to know everything um
0:47:35 but some of this [ __ ] i don't even have
0:47:36 the answers to i don't know why
0:47:39 uh he visited me but he did looked like
0:47:42 you had a seat of honor next to him i
0:47:44 did
0:47:45 and you have no idea why that is he
0:47:47 wants something
0:47:49 yeah
0:47:51 i think he wants the whole goddamn
0:47:52 northeast
0:47:54 he does
0:47:57 and sees a little reason to conceal it
0:48:00 so pendragon thinks
0:48:03 you're the one that's going to help him
0:48:04 give uh give him new haven
0:48:07 yeah
0:48:09 he made some pretty big offers for the
0:48:11 bruja
0:48:14 money shelter power protection
0:48:19 he offered uh
0:48:21 access to
0:48:23 some of the oldest members of our clan
0:48:26 he offered to have me learn the secrets
0:48:29 of intellecki i don't even know what the
0:48:30 hell that is uh
0:48:33 ancient bruja philosophy
0:48:35 what i do know is that he's well
0:48:36 connected and
0:48:39 uh
0:48:40 it's hard to say no
0:48:42 but that's what i'm doing
0:48:44 i haven't agreed to anything
0:48:47 i'm just worried
0:48:49 that i might not even be the only person
0:48:51 he's offered this to
0:48:53 if i had to make any kind of guess
0:48:56 he's probably trying to talk up
0:48:58 the whole of clan brouha down here
0:49:00 considering the numbers
0:49:02 looks like we lost a lot in the past few
0:49:05 nights
0:49:06 but i still think we might be one of the
0:49:08 most populous clan in the domain
0:49:11 i agree he pointed out that we are
0:49:13 attacked by satites called in by the
0:49:16 ventrue
0:49:17 is that true
0:49:20 no
0:49:22 the
0:49:24 the settites
0:49:25 did show up to elysium
0:49:28 miles did call in a favor
0:49:34 but there wasn't
0:49:36 any kind of real fight between the two
0:49:38 of them
0:49:39 the set tight thugs just stopped
0:49:42 all the bruja from jumping us
0:49:45 just long enough for a werewolf
0:49:48 to be dropped into the middle of court i
0:49:50 don't know if the bra are gonna see it
0:49:52 that way oh they're not not if pendragon
0:49:54 can spin it he will
0:49:56 i'm pretty sure what's happening here
0:49:58 is that everything's being engineered to
0:50:00 piss off the bruja in the domain
0:50:04 we lost sheriff
0:50:06 i don't know what's happening with the
0:50:07 other positions
0:50:09 but all it's going to end up looking
0:50:10 like
0:50:11 is clan ventrue
0:50:13 toridor and tremir running a rough shot
0:50:16 on
0:50:17 clan bruja and pendragon is their savior
0:50:21 what's going on with this with this
0:50:22 nosferatu guy
0:50:24 renwick yeah
0:50:26 he's the child of shaw
0:50:29 [ __ ] me
0:50:30 and he's part of the web and if he's
0:50:32 part of the web
0:50:34 that means that he's part of operation
0:50:36 longbow
0:50:37 so he's in the pocket
0:50:39 of pendragon
0:50:41 yep
0:50:44 so i'm sure he's probably gonna be
0:50:45 playing on
0:50:46 all of the old connections his sire had
0:50:49 with
0:50:50 all the bruja
0:50:52 have you seen weathers recently yeah
0:50:54 he's not coming out much
0:50:56 i spoke to him at a diner
0:50:58 yeah he definitely wasn't not too happy
0:51:01 i can't say i blame him
0:51:04 but
0:51:06 you know here's here's the thing
0:51:09 all right
0:51:11 we all signed up knowing that the camera
0:51:13 is not fair
0:51:14 and
0:51:16 to get all uppity and pissed off and all
0:51:18 of a sudden the camera was not
0:51:20 fair isn't really going to get us
0:51:22 anywhere
0:51:23 and pendragon
0:51:26 is telling everyone that all of a sudden
0:51:28 these camera clans aren't being fair to
0:51:30 us
0:51:31 that's probably
0:51:33 it's probably a two-way street there's
0:51:35 no way pendragon is going to be anything
0:51:37 but an oppressive warlord
0:51:39 so i don't know i
0:51:41 i feel like i feel like this isn't some
0:51:43 new problem that we're dealing with this
0:51:44 is just
0:51:45 our client having to face facts that
0:51:47 things aren't the way that we
0:51:50 got comfortable and thought they were
0:51:52 i have to face facts with that we're all
0:51:56 young vampires who are
0:51:58 terrible playing the game
0:52:00 in a city full of
0:52:03 really
0:52:04 really good
0:52:05 elders who've been playing this game for
0:52:08 a long time
0:52:10 yeah have you fulfilled the two
0:52:12 demands of progeny i have
0:52:16 his shoulders sag at that a little bit
0:52:18 and they all went off with roman
0:52:19 pendragon for training
0:52:22 bruja with
0:52:24 sharp claws and red glowing eyes
0:52:27 all shock troops to rip people to pieces
0:52:29 claws and glowing eyes
0:52:31 they learn protein who's teaching them
0:52:33 protein members of his army
0:52:36 he's just making monsters
0:52:38 yep
0:52:41 and if he decides that new haven isn't
0:52:42 being properly defended
0:52:44 he'll protect himself
0:52:46 and all of our brah friends are
0:52:48 clanmates
0:52:49 in hopes of doing the right thing
0:52:52 will sell everyone out and join his army
0:52:54 it's
0:52:55 it's [ __ ] sad
0:52:57 so what's your play here jane
0:53:00 i just want to make it out
0:53:03 let me get out of new haven
0:53:05 make it out of this latest set of
0:53:07 problems
0:53:09 and then on to the next one
0:53:11 it's kind of hard to have long-term
0:53:13 goals under town like this yeah you're
0:53:14 not kidding
0:53:16 i don't think uh
0:53:18 i don't think any of us are going to
0:53:19 make it out of this if we just play
0:53:21 along with this war
0:53:23 what are you proposing
0:53:26 don't know
0:53:28 i know my codery
0:53:32 i know they want to stick together
0:53:34 and new haven is important to miles
0:53:38 and he's going to keep the lot of them
0:53:40 here to try and defend it or something
0:53:45 his sire
0:53:47 asked him to
0:53:49 stay here as a bulwark against the
0:53:51 sabbat coming up the coast
0:53:53 if it were up to me i think i'd just
0:53:56 pack up all my [ __ ] and get the hell out
0:53:58 of here take everybody who matters with
0:54:00 me
0:54:00 and just let them duke it out
0:54:03 where would you go i don't know
0:54:05 i heard boston's pretty nice
0:54:08 the malkavian prince's domain
0:54:10 him and his red coats
0:54:13 are they more of operation longbow
0:54:16 yep and i really wouldn't be getting out
0:54:18 of here apparently all of the best
0:54:20 places around here are operation longbow
0:54:22 they're the only ones winning
0:54:24 i don't know if that's winning i think
0:54:26 it's just shifting power into the hands
0:54:28 of those who already have power
0:54:33 have we filled all the spots for the
0:54:34 court yet
0:54:35 i don't know
0:54:37 honestly i'm still kind of shook up from
0:54:38 pendragon
0:54:40 he really got to you
0:54:42 he knew
0:54:43 about all of us
0:54:46 all about all of us it's the web
0:54:49 yeah
0:54:50 so this is just a power play then
0:54:53 isn't it always
0:54:55 and it's clan
0:54:57 bruja
0:54:59 or
0:55:00 i guess we could just say that it's
0:55:02 roman pendragon yeah the problem is when
0:55:03 you say roman pendragon you're talking
0:55:05 about every brewhou for the 200 miles
0:55:07 around us oh i realize
0:55:09 but locally let's let's just leave it at
0:55:12 that it's roman roman pendragon and clan
0:55:15 nosferatu
0:55:16 going up against
0:55:18 clan ventrue and clan premiere those the
0:55:20 battle lines right no
0:55:23 no
0:55:24 johnny the malkavians are in an
0:55:26 operation longbow
0:55:27 the malkavians are in operation longbow
0:55:30 yes
0:55:34 and the toriador they nominally siding
0:55:37 with adventure it looks like the
0:55:38 torridor
0:55:40 the ventrue and the chemier made a nice
0:55:41 big show tonight
0:55:43 and the gang girl are being independent
0:55:45 as always
0:55:46 currently that's when everybody else who
0:55:50 has that lineage is
0:55:52 gone

0:56:25 that being said
0:56:28 i owe you a life boom and i can stay off

0:56:42 time ago and i think they're in danger

0:56:46 i really hate to
0:56:49 i don't know
0:56:51 call you on it
0:56:53 but uh
0:56:54 he was a cop
0:56:56 did some
0:56:57 really good things for me and mine
0:57:00 uh
0:57:02 a uh
0:57:04 a detective suarez is
0:57:07 being harassed and threatened or
0:57:09 something but he's
0:57:10 he's spooked if you can find out what's
0:57:12 going on let me know suarez yeah
0:57:16 i think i might know something about
0:57:17 that

0:57:21 but i owe him everything
0:57:23 let me uh
0:57:25 let me talk to my codery about that

0:57:35 to them
0:57:37 to get them out to that spot where you
0:57:39 brought them
0:57:42 they all safe
0:57:43 i think so
0:57:47 to be honest uh
0:57:49 your wife kind of hit the road and
0:57:53 they're a little hard to track but i i
0:57:55 and i think might be a good thing i
0:57:58 think it's better that i don't know

0:58:01 but last you saw them they were all okay
0:58:04 they're okay

0:58:14 exactly what to say

0:58:19 i did tell her that you're a truck
0:58:20 driver

0:58:25 yeah your uh
0:58:26 your demeanor or uh
