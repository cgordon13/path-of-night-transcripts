0:01:09 [Music]
0:01:11 foreign
0:01:13 or is it just completely paneled off
0:01:16 there are windows in front not in back
0:01:18 and back everything's covered giant rear
0:01:21 rear mirrors I think you should not have
0:01:23 uh side mirrors I think you should give
0:01:25 that silver hand Cannon over to Brita
0:01:27 sounds like a plan all right Brett are
0:01:29 you wearing you're in the front seat now
0:01:30 uh I am probably in the back the seat in
0:01:35 the back that is closest to the front
0:01:37 therefore the furthest in the back I'm
0:01:40 sorry bud
0:01:41 and you're wearing gloves right she's
0:01:44 wearing gloves but ever since she came
0:01:46 back with when
0:01:47 I sing with them
0:01:49 rubbing her hand her on her Palm
0:01:52 tucking the edge up and down she has not
0:01:56 stopped messing with her hand ever since
0:01:58 she's gotten back yeah
0:02:01 Britta why don't you grab that uh that
0:02:03 hand Cannon and get it loaded all right
0:02:04 we only need to use those bullets
0:02:06 against things that that uh against
0:02:09 targets that are weak to Silver so be
0:02:11 very sparing with it brother sarta she's
0:02:14 listening but she puts forward the
0:02:16 question of I mean what else we know of
0:02:18 other than blue Pines
0:02:21 oh there's all kinds of crazy [ __ ] out
0:02:23 there me
0:02:25 oh well uh uh I hope wait what
0:02:29 I'm allergic to Silver how did I don't
0:02:31 know that
0:02:32 well I don't advertise it wait what's
0:02:35 our plan are you if I frenzy and you

0:02:43 of all all right do you
0:02:46 um
0:02:47 you know like it burns me like fire yeah
0:02:50 but it is is it because you're
0:02:53 um
0:02:53 because she's a Gangrel is that what
0:02:55 you're trying to ask
0:02:56 it's kind of like like a werewolf
0:02:59 you do shape-shift I do shape-shift you
0:03:02 have claws I do have claws a lot of
0:03:05 weird animal features I need a frenzy
0:03:07 check

0:03:31 result of being mocked fear Beast
0:03:32 features
0:03:36 you guys want to maybe lay off win for a
0:03:39 second about that Neil and extremely
0:03:41 empathetic if not socially always aware
0:03:44 person
0:03:46 immediately recognizes that he has like
0:03:48 [ __ ] up and overstepped when he did
0:03:51 not mean to and did not mean anything by
0:03:53 it and just looks at when I'm I'm sorry
0:03:56 that's I didn't mean that I'd shut up
0:03:58 Neil look the answer is pure silver is
0:04:01 one of those weird things in the world
0:04:03 that affects Supernatural there's no
0:04:06 Rhyme or Reason to it just sometimes
0:04:08 that's the right the right solution some
0:04:12 humans are allergic to Silver
0:04:14 metal allergies are a thing
0:04:19 I know I'm
0:04:20 I know you didn't mean anything no I
0:04:22 know it I'm sorry it's my fault for it's
0:04:26 not your fault it's my fault Johnny
0:04:27 Roman both of you shut up
0:04:29 Johnny rumors around a bit in the front
0:04:31 seat and then passes back a morally and
0:04:33 his Zippo to win win lights up
0:04:39 so begins a long awkward drive to Salem
0:04:42 with the three of you in the back
0:04:48 [Music]
0:04:51 Johnny put on some music or something
0:04:53 you got it he fires up some Judas
0:04:55 priests which right to Salem itself is
0:04:57 actually oh do you know what song

0:05:43 time you do it or anything like that
0:05:45 like is it cumulative or get worse no
0:05:49 there's no long-term consequences to me
0:05:51 doing this yeah you see Johnny's eyes
0:05:52 flash at you for a second like [ __ ]
0:05:55 [ __ ] I know you're lying and
0:05:57 then he looks back at the road you don't

0:06:28 to clamber into the front seat realizes
0:06:30 miles hasn't left yet goes back into the
0:06:32 back seat maybe you should collect all
0:06:34 your ingredients I got it all right here

0:06:46 to move this back pushing fast and
0:06:48 whatever explanations just like take a
0:06:50 seat I know what I'm doing he says not
0:06:52 convincingly but you don't need a bowl
0:06:55 this time I have one I have like a
0:06:58 little I have like a little dish in my
0:07:00 no no no no no no that was different I
0:07:03 didn't I didn't technically need that
0:07:05 for that last time
0:07:06 foreign
0:07:19 not for this for another thing
0:07:23 please don't miss you instant equipment
0:07:24 bonus for this from the cigarette I gave
0:07:25 her
0:07:29 does she need to make this since the
0:07:31 same Source made her frenzy in the last
0:07:33 10 minutes
0:07:35 yeah turn that's a new source that isn't
0:07:38 oh man not starting off this well what
0:07:41 success
0:07:43 margin's getting narrower Morley's
0:07:45 saving the day I would like to know if
0:07:48 that was a genuine question
0:07:51 I think it's a genuine question from all
0:07:52 of us now oh boy
0:07:55 another thing it was really it was
0:07:57 related
0:08:00 to step down the rest of the cigarette
0:08:02 in one gulp
0:08:05 and just throws it at Neil
0:08:08 ow ouch ow how much courage do you have
0:08:11 yeah two yeah you're gonna need to make
0:08:14 a courage to four Lord
0:08:17 yeah you just throw fire around I mean
0:08:20 she can she just did
0:08:23 okay it's one of those that's a failure
0:08:25 that is a four and a one in the front
0:08:27 seat Neil offends
0:08:31 [Laughter]
0:08:33 I wish the eliciting audience could see
0:08:36 how much you're losing it right now Neil
0:08:39 offends win and in retaliation she takes
0:08:43 a heavy heavy heavy drag from her
0:08:47 cigarette and flicks her cigarette
0:08:50 through the dark Van Into Neil's face it
0:08:55 sputters and Sparks and bits of red hot
0:08:58 tobacco spray across his face and down
0:09:02 to his lap and he Bears his fangs and
0:09:06 loses his [ __ ] minds trying to get
0:09:08 away from the Cherry so Johnny seeing
0:09:12 this happen and he's in the front seat
0:09:14 now right uh he is now in the front seat
0:09:16 uh Johnny is going to like grab a
0:09:20 handful of uh Neil's beautiful bowling
0:09:23 like polyester bowling shirt that he
0:09:25 wears oh [ __ ] I thought it was polyester
0:09:27 and I threw fire at it just just push
0:09:29 him down into the passenger seat and try
0:09:31 and hold him there so you and because I
0:09:34 don't need him getting out of the van
0:09:36 while it's moving Neil is actively
0:09:38 trying to open the door yell out on the
0:09:39 highway you you need to both World
0:09:41 initiative
0:09:44 can I roll Initiative for a potential
0:09:45 social action yes you may all right
0:09:48 Johnny has a 13. Neil has a nine
0:09:52 17. we begin with uh Brita going I don't
0:09:57 believe I've seen uh what's happening to
0:10:00 Neil before Oh for your frenzy yeah have
0:10:03 we seen this I mean so it's it's not a
0:10:06 clear look at what's even going on what
0:10:08 you hear is a loud Panic hiss in
0:10:11 response to the burning cherry and
0:10:14 having seen a ton of frenzies ever since
0:10:19 the Sabbat came around you do have an
0:10:21 idea as what's going on British In This
0:10:23 Moment she's remembering her first night
0:10:25 that she can remember where Johnny
0:10:28 offered her a cigarette and offered her
0:10:30 the lighter for it and the terror that
0:10:33 she felt then so her first instinct is
0:10:35 going to be to try to calm nail down
0:10:37 without really understanding like why
0:10:40 he's acting like he's been dread case so
0:10:42 she's going to like well can I see him
0:10:45 I'm not I'm confused they barely see him
0:10:48 okay so with that limited the back of
0:10:51 the van does not have very good view of
0:10:52 the front so I I think I'm mostly then
0:10:54 reacting to the hiss and with that Brita
0:10:58 will kind of like turn around and say
0:11:02 but male is okay it's just a cigarette
0:11:05 belation and leadership okay
0:11:09 so with the speck of expressive that
0:11:12 will be 1 10 exploding to two
0:11:16 yeah on your turn to give me a
0:11:17 self-control okay Johnny Johnny's not
0:11:20 too worried about being able to hold
0:11:21 kneel in down in the seat he's pretty
0:11:25 sure he'll be able to do that without a
0:11:26 problem what he is concerned about is
0:11:29 that in his frenzy to escape the vehicle
0:11:32 he might break the window so he's gonna
0:11:35 grab reach across
0:11:38 Neil's chest and grab his arm closest to
0:11:42 the window and restrain him there mostly
0:11:45 and put kind of his forearm into his
0:11:47 chest to pin him into place and that way
0:11:50 hopefully he can prevent him from
0:11:51 smashing glass because that would look
0:11:54 really bad on the on the on the van as
0:11:56 we're trying to get to where we're going
0:11:58 so I'm guessing I'm going to roll
0:11:59 dexterity plus brawl plus Celerity uh
0:12:01 that is correct do you want me to take
0:12:03 any dice penalties for kind of a a
0:12:05 little bit more in-depth kind of grapple
0:12:08 to have uh ambidextrous uh I do not you
0:12:12 are going to be at a minus three die
0:12:15 penalty that's because I'm trying to
0:12:17 drive and grapple correct that's correct
0:12:20 foreign
0:12:21 that's four successes to grab him Neil
0:12:24 you are grappled and it is your turn uh
0:12:27 you may spend a point of willpower and
0:12:28 roll self-control okay self-controller
0:12:31 courage I'm sorry courage damn much
0:12:34 better self-control
0:12:35 am I still div four it is still there
0:12:38 four
0:12:39 that is two successes okay you are on
0:12:41 the path to uh regaining control you
0:12:44 have three successes to go okay uh
0:12:47 should he also try and make a role to
0:12:49 escape or yeah go ahead
0:12:51 [Laughter]
0:12:53 oh so I guess it's humiliate me o'clock
0:12:55 yeah
0:12:57 roll strength Jack here
0:13:00 difficulty six again that is correct
0:13:05 uh well I rolled two ones so that's only
0:13:08 six successes
0:13:11 good thing Johnny is holding me right
0:13:13 now because I got two successes uh Neil
0:13:17 in the panicked frenzy is surprisingly
0:13:20 strong at trying to pry Johnny's arm off
0:13:23 himself and throw himself out an open
0:13:24 door but Johnny is like the bruja is
0:13:27 clearly stronger than Neil is even
0:13:29 despite his hysterical strength top of
0:13:31 the round
0:13:33 Neil when would never actually hurt you
0:13:36 okay it's not going to we're not going
0:13:39 to let you actually light up
0:13:43 no failure no success okay Johnny here
0:13:46 go Johnny threw kind of gritted teeth
0:13:49 trying to keep an eyes on the road and
0:13:51 kneel at the same time Neil listen to
0:13:54 Bruno eyes on me you're with us eyes on
0:13:58 me
0:13:59 going to try to get his friend to look
0:14:02 at him and actually see him roll these
0:14:06 are
0:14:07 Johnny's eyes crystallize for a woman as
0:14:10 he maintains his grapple on Neil
0:14:13 and gets two successes Neil I your
0:14:16 attention this round is on uh Johnny but
0:14:20 you do get the ability to spend upon all
0:14:22 power and roll courage okay I will do
0:14:25 that will power spent
0:14:29 two successes you are in control of
0:14:31 yourself with a round we go to Bretta
0:14:34 it's okay it's okay Neil just listen
0:14:37 right listen to Johnny and listen to me
0:14:39 and we'll pull you back okay we've got
0:14:42 you

0:14:48 look like he's coming down at all he
0:14:49 does look like he is coming down Johnny
0:14:51 kind of like still looking back and
0:14:53 forth between the road and Neil look

0:15:31 mind-blowing expertise

0:17:26 forward and Neil rolls down the window
0:17:28 and then just kind of sticks his head
0:17:29 out the window and is quiet for a long
0:17:31 while before he checks the stars but
0:17:35 eventually he does and will pass a small
0:17:37 little ritual knife
0:17:39 and a little bowl that he pulls out of
0:17:42 his like fanny pack to the back seat

0:18:00 willpower after especially uh regarding
0:18:04 previous scene Johnny kind of glances
0:18:05 over you after you pass the bull back to

0:18:09 you're doing this next to me I know I
0:18:12 I'm if I didn't have to look at this guy
0:18:13 but that's where the answers are but I

0:18:30 like hysterical strength you're already
0:18:32 starting off things pretty rough so I'm
0:18:34 gonna pretend that this isn't happening
0:18:35 we won't talk about it again all right
0:18:37 okay I had another thing I was gonna
0:18:39 propose when we got there but we can
0:18:40 cross that bridge when we get there
0:18:42 fantastic
0:18:43 thank you Johnny
0:18:45 thanks Neil has the Good Fortune to look
0:18:47 ashamed of himself
0:18:49 and in time the group review finally
0:18:51 make it to Salem
0:18:53 there is an Ambiance to the town that
0:18:56 makes you immediately begin to wonder if
0:18:59 the old wives tales are true
0:19:02 as you
0:19:04 kind of creep into town you notice that
0:19:07 unlike so many of the other uh known
0:19:10 towns and cities in Massachusetts and
0:19:12 Connecticut there is virtually no
0:19:14 nighttime activity here
0:19:16 there are no cars no traffic no people
0:19:20 walking the streets
0:19:21 Salem's nightlife does not exist
0:19:28 [Music]
0:19:32 as the group of you arrive into Salem
0:19:35 miles your phone rings
0:19:37 open it up miles speaking now getting to
0:19:40 the actual Chantry is a bit of a
0:19:42 challenge
0:19:43 oh hi miles hello it's me Arabella
0:19:47 something a bit of a challenge uh
0:19:49 because regular roadmaps aren't going to
0:19:51 be able to lead you that so I'm going to
0:19:54 offer you some directions
0:19:55 and if your driver follows them and I
0:20:01 know I know it's difficult for his clan
0:20:02 but if you can follow the instructions
0:20:04 you will arrive to the century quite
0:20:06 soon well I'm glad I didn't put you on
0:20:08 speaker then but I'm going to post a
0:20:10 picture now
0:20:11 um
0:20:12 why don't we just keep it professional
0:20:16 aren't you in the music business
0:20:17 extremely all right
0:20:19 I suppose different standards anyways uh
0:20:21 put them on you're on speaker uh what is
0:20:24 your name again
0:20:25 she were talking to me yeah she's
0:20:27 talking to you Johnny Johnny Yes Johnny
0:20:30 you're going to head to the main street
0:20:32 and follow the main strip all the way
0:20:35 until you reach the other side of Salem
0:20:36 and then you're going to find a chained
0:20:41 up dirt road this road has no name upon
0:20:45 it is an unnamed Road do you understand
0:20:47 what that means very good so uh join to
0:20:50 follow the dirt road all the way to the
0:20:52 end even when you think you want to stop
0:20:54 or if if you hear anything you will
0:20:57 continue to drive none of your quarter
0:21:00 inmates including yourself would you get
0:21:02 out of the van until you have actually
0:21:05 reached the location be advised
0:21:09 that revealing your
0:21:12 Kindred State before arriving to the
0:21:15 Chantry could be disastrous noted
0:21:18 anything else we should be aware of
0:21:19 there's no sense in filling in all the
0:21:21 the unnecessary details follow the
0:21:24 instructions Main Street in Salem all
0:21:26 the way down to the end then I'm finding
0:21:28 a dirt path that's been chained off yes
0:21:31 you're going to follow it following it
0:21:33 the entire way without stopping or
0:21:36 getting out of the vehicle until we
0:21:38 arrive at the Chantry what exactly does
0:21:40 the Chantry look like that was going to
0:21:42 be my next question ah you'll know when
0:21:44 you see it right show me your [ __ ]
0:21:46 got it see you soon Jay hangs up well
0:21:48 she's lovely as ever I mean yeah that's
0:21:51 about it what I expected
0:21:52 she's been generally helpful so far but
0:21:55 you know this time just so we're all on
0:21:58 the same page we do remember that she's
0:21:59 made packs with demons right she's what
0:22:01 you wanna when I want to drive the baby
0:22:03 one more time yeah he informed us about
0:22:05 this before yeah when she clearly has
0:22:07 made packs with demons see I thought I
0:22:09 was just joking about that she actually
0:22:11 made packs of demons uh if you look at
0:22:13 her yeah okay when you look at it when
0:22:16 you look at her oh okay well and you
0:22:18 know that for us that was a collective
0:22:20 View
0:22:20 ah
0:22:22 I still collectively none of us can see
0:22:24 it besides you okay well so Miles you
0:22:27 hung up the phone right yes
0:22:29 I just you know I'm not saying
0:22:32 that we don't do this I just want us all
0:22:36 to remember we're on the same page and
0:22:40 she is her Aura is licked by green flame
0:22:43 right did you hear back from Raven at
0:22:46 all I'm gonna assume no since you
0:22:47 haven't told us no you contacted her
0:22:49 with a very reliable source a pigeon
0:22:53 right it's about as reliable as you're
0:22:55 gonna get in a city oh my God honestly I
0:22:58 think pigeons are probably more reliable
0:23:00 than some of these [ __ ] cell phones
0:23:01 they're kicking around nope you don't
0:23:03 know we're not true you don't know what
0:23:05 those cell phones are considering Raven
0:23:07 doesn't have a cell phone the pigeon is
0:23:08 much more reliable I mean that's true
0:23:10 but not where did that signal go you
0:23:12 tell me that
0:23:14 Johnny have you been talking to people
0:23:15 at the bar again no Johnny and I've had
0:23:17 a lot of really interesting
0:23:18 conversations kind of thing I'm just
0:23:20 saying a pigeon you know what it's about
0:23:22 you know where it's going that's a
0:23:24 reliable kind of form of communication
0:23:27 if there's a Gangrel Scourge there's a
0:23:29 possibility that it was intercepted I
0:23:30 just don't want to talk about this
0:23:31 anymore so let's go
0:23:36 [Music]
0:23:40 so I mean I think it's worth bringing up
0:23:41 that I promised this book to Raven too
0:23:44 think you had mentioned that before
0:23:46 was that the implication that we got
0:23:48 from that what is Arabella here in the
0:23:51 shower not in the car in Salem I have no
0:23:55 idea now that you mention it and you'll
0:23:56 start looking around all paranoid I
0:23:58 heard the CIA put up towers and airports
0:24:01 they [ __ ] just I said we are done
0:24:03 with that all kinds of you know
0:24:05 I'm totally fair I've heard a lot of the
0:24:07 same stuff it did seem like she was
0:24:10 maybe coming to meet us quite possible
0:24:13 look I'm driving down Main Street right
0:24:14 now we haven't even got to the point
0:24:15 where there's the dirt road I don't want
0:24:17 you to get Neil in a tizzy yeah but guys
0:24:20 deciding whether or not we give the our
0:24:23 codex to someone who deals with demons
0:24:27 or Raven who we've worked with it's kind
0:24:29 of a worthwhile discussion I I
0:24:33 acknowledge that it may not be an option
0:24:35 to give it to anyone but Arabella
0:24:39 um I sort of got sidetracked by
0:24:42 curios mites and ghosts what can can
0:24:45 somebody refresh me on why we're doing
0:24:47 this for Arabella Beyond she was gonna
0:24:49 help us like in the city and maybe get
0:24:51 out of the city weren't you the one that
0:24:52 informed us that she believes that by
0:24:54 giving it to them they will remove the
0:24:56 presence of the entity into another time
0:24:59 and space right yeah she said she said
0:25:01 she could help us both get out of the
0:25:03 city which as she's proved that she's
0:25:05 capable of in the first place
0:25:07 whether she can do that again or not who
0:25:09 knows but we're on top of that Dragon
0:25:11 she is she said that this is going to be
0:25:13 able to help us or she will be able to
0:25:15 help us to dispose of that thing that
0:25:19 the zantosa was tending I also kind of
0:25:22 remember her saying that you can't do
0:25:23 that though so right I can't die but it
0:25:26 can be removed is what you told us yeah
0:25:30 I know I just this is outside my
0:25:31 wheelhouse man and I'm not convinced
0:25:33 that Raven couldn't
0:25:35 do something similar I mean honestly you
0:25:37 sent that pigeon if she really wants
0:25:39 that book she'll find a way to get her
0:25:41 ass up here I mean Raven she's is part
0:25:44 of the witch stuff right yeah is she
0:25:49 part of the same stuff that Arabella is
0:25:51 same coven is Arabella clothing Huff
0:25:54 yeah might they maybe work together is
0:25:58 that even a possibility like is giving
0:26:00 it to one giving it to the other they're
0:26:02 both so old that I think they're
0:26:04 pursuing separate agendas if we can
0:26:06 possibly get whatever information that
0:26:08 Raven's looking we might be able to at
0:26:10 least soften the blow but I'm assuming
0:26:13 sheet and tell you what you wanted the
0:26:14 Codex for hey I think I'm coming up to
0:26:16 the uh the turn are we gonna have to
0:26:18 bust through a gate or like you I'll
0:26:20 take care of the chain okay but once we
0:26:22 get on that road
0:26:23 let's listen to what she said no one's
0:26:25 getting out yeah I was gonna ask about
0:26:28 that does the chain count as part of the
0:26:29 road because like then we shouldn't get
0:26:32 out at all I'm assuming not since we
0:26:34 can't just drive through the chain I
0:26:36 don't know why can't we just drive
0:26:37 through the chain because it's really
0:26:38 bad for a vehicle they don't just put
0:26:41 them there for no reason how do we drive
0:26:43 around the train let's just get out take
0:26:47 out the chain it's fine she said after
0:26:50 that do not get off out of the car that
0:26:53 was the set of instructions don't worry
0:26:55 kids we'll see the worst that could
0:26:56 happen oh good God nope we're not gonna
0:26:59 Venture down that road and the group of
0:27:01 you arrived where the chain is
0:27:03 foreign
0:27:05 [Music]
0:27:07 feeling about all of this Johnny takes a
0:27:10 look over at both Wen and Neil Keep Your
0:27:13 Head on a swivel for me all right gotcha
0:27:15 pops open the door
0:27:17 hops out walks over to the chain uses
0:27:20 potence and just pulls it apart
0:27:23 the chain comes undone
0:27:25 drops to the ground and the pathway is
0:27:29 open for you Johnny strides back to the
0:27:31 van hops up and into the driver's seat
0:27:34 as you hop into the driver's seat you
0:27:35 cannot shake the feeling that you're
0:27:37 being watched and there are sounds
0:27:40 coming from the tree lines but none of
0:27:42 them remind you of the living animals
0:27:45 found in nature
0:27:47 all right from this point forward
0:27:49 everybody stays in the van all limbs
0:27:53 inside the vehicle for the duration of
0:27:55 the ride understood understood yeah yeah
0:27:58 yep yep like spiritually and Shadow
0:28:01 landsly what is
0:28:03 what does it look like in Salem so it
0:28:06 actually isn't a terribly bad place in
0:28:10 terms of the spirit world and there
0:28:12 seems to be a lot of belief and all
0:28:16 sorts of like folklore that kind of
0:28:18 breathes life into the area uh these
0:28:22 Woods are like deep and ageless and you
0:28:27 definitely get the feeling that there
0:28:29 are powers at work here I'm gonna put up
0:28:32 uh my heightened senses for the trip
0:28:34 here just out of a raw sense of
0:28:37 malkavian paranoia while you guys are
0:28:39 start driving in uh Neil why don't you
0:28:42 give me a perception plus alertness
0:28:44 check your difficulty of course you get
0:28:46 to reduce it by your aspects and then
0:28:48 increase the difficulty by six wow so
0:28:51 that is diff seven yep
0:28:55 one success
0:28:57 two successes
0:29:02 stupid one the dirt road seems to go on
0:29:04 and on and on uh one thing Neil does
0:29:08 notice is that there's this gnarly tree
0:29:12 that does not seem to grow leaves even
0:29:15 now in the spring and it sort of looms
0:29:18 over the road with like huge branches
0:29:21 you are certain that you've passed it
0:29:24 twice going up this road and then
0:29:28 the road stops
0:29:30 it opens to a very kind of large
0:29:35 Cobblestone Loop that has what looks to
0:29:39 have been uh probably some sort of
0:29:41 overgrown lawn the grass is very tall
0:29:43 here already but like dead
0:29:47 there looks to have been there were
0:29:49 probably Hedges here once upon a time
0:29:51 where they're just overgrown rows the
0:29:54 trees again branches kind of like Loom
0:29:57 casting Shadows there is lots of
0:29:59 moonlight tonight but that seems to kind
0:30:01 of add odd shadows and dimensions to
0:30:03 this place and then you see what looks
0:30:07 like what was once a mansion however so
0:30:10 much of it has sunk beneath the Earth
0:30:12 that there is only a lopsided high tower
0:30:16 that someone might use to survey the
0:30:19 lands that projects not 10 feet above
0:30:22 the ground everything else has been
0:30:24 swallowed by the Earth
0:30:26 fortunately the roof of this this like
0:30:29 small you know single story Tower is so
0:30:33 worn and rotted that you're pretty
0:30:37 confident that you could tear your way
0:30:39 through it now an interesting little
0:30:41 little effect here
0:30:43 the tower itself its walls are made from
0:30:47 like very kind of like thick pretty
0:30:50 marble-like Stone
0:30:52 I already [ __ ] hate this place
0:30:54 so um not to borrow trouble against the
0:30:58 future but getting out of here uh I am
0:31:02 so positive that we passed that tree
0:31:04 like a couple of times on the way here
0:31:06 even though you only went straight so
0:31:09 getting back out I mean unless this is a
0:31:11 sort of Enchantment that turns you away
0:31:13 it might be good to
0:31:15 just in case we get separated or
0:31:17 something something bad happens
0:31:19 um
0:31:20 for taking the van back just do the
0:31:22 complete opposite of what Arabelle said
0:31:24 to get in here
0:31:26 but like same deal go straight back out
0:31:28 don't stop driving I was at the opposite
0:31:31 of what she said she said come straight
0:31:33 in don't come don't step around okay
0:31:35 yeah we'll get the general gist don't
0:31:36 get out of the car between here and the
0:31:38 end of the road there's yeah got it I
0:31:42 got a bad feeling you'd find yourself
0:31:43 wandering around until sunrise if you
0:31:45 made it that far gotcha everyone do a
0:31:47 gear check Johnny pops and mortally into
0:31:49 his mouth lights up how quiet do we want
0:31:52 to be here because if we got if we got a
0:31:54 little bit of time well how the hell are
0:31:57 we getting in this place are we just
0:31:58 going in through that Tower
0:32:02 well I don't see anything but maybe this
0:32:05 is a time for those of you who have
0:32:08 better senses than I or miles to see if
0:32:10 you can find a I can try and go another
0:32:13 entrance yeah let's take a look around
0:32:15 yeah uh watch buddy system nobody
0:32:19 [ __ ] go anywhere why I say we all
0:32:21 stay right here and uh I don't move and
0:32:24 you watch me and I go take a look that's
0:32:26 my suggestion sure sure by me yeah all
0:32:30 right look for your patterns oh yes you
0:32:32 do I will warn win
0:32:34 uh the spirit world is not the same here
0:32:37 what's it like here uh corrupted and
0:32:40 twisted oh and like you one of the
0:32:45 things that definitely stands out to you
0:32:48 you see these very very very tall
0:32:51 kind of like 18 foot figures that Lou
0:32:55 with that are as thin as you know like
0:32:59 telephone poles
0:33:01 and with extremely long spindly arms
0:33:04 long fingers and their head is a single
0:33:11 ring that has no mass in its Center and
0:33:14 they just sort of very slowly but
0:33:17 clumsily wander around the premises in a
0:33:22 confused State
0:33:23 um can I make an occult check for this
0:33:25 or is there a better check I could make
0:33:27 for this ah this is pretty obscured you
0:33:30 have Spirit lore I don't have Spirit
0:33:32 laurae floor yeah you're not sure what
0:33:34 you're looking at here okay but there's
0:33:35 like probably like a half dozen that
0:33:37 kind of quickly catches right then they
0:33:39 just silently run off into the forest so
0:33:43 versus Salem does this look like it's
0:33:46 been like manicured or is this like it's
0:33:49 been made to look like this or does it
0:33:51 look like it's been abandoned it has
0:33:52 been Twisted by a crop force and it also
0:33:55 looks to have been abandoned for a long
0:33:56 time these things that are like loping
0:33:59 around are probably from the Shan trade
0:34:02 and the things that had held them bound
0:34:04 uh no longer hold all right
0:34:08 um guys this is um this place has been
0:34:11 abandoned a long time and there's things
0:34:12 wandering around that probably
0:34:15 weren't intended to be wandering around
0:34:17 I know I don't see anything you got that
0:34:20 thousand yard stare on your face right
0:34:22 now when you gonna be good
0:34:24 I'm gonna keep my head on a swivel like
0:34:26 you said Johnny
0:34:27 but you said things they're not wraiths
0:34:31 or Spirits or spirits of some sort this
0:34:34 is this is like
0:34:35 astral psychic stuff yeah this is a
0:34:39 burden that wind's gonna carry for the
0:34:41 rest of us I don't think we should ask
0:34:42 her too much more about what she saw no
0:34:44 no no no no no no I'm asking for a very
0:34:46 deliberate reason here
0:34:48 um my proposal was that I was going to
0:34:49 project my Consciousness into the
0:34:51 psychic astral realm to go look around
0:34:54 but if there's stuff floating around in
0:34:57 here I don't know if I want to go do
0:34:59 that if I'm being totally honest I
0:35:01 should I mean well are the Chimes going
0:35:04 off or the Chimes do not go off not
0:35:08 around them
0:35:09 no no these aren't setting the Chimes
0:35:12 off
0:35:12 okay so do we want to look around on
0:35:15 foot yes okay let's just do that then
0:35:17 here's my secondary follow-up question
0:35:19 uh how much do we not want to be seen
0:35:22 because I can help all of you walk how
0:35:26 long I walk hour or two couple hours a
0:35:29 couple hours
0:35:30 if I change my shape is that gonna still
0:35:33 cover me no but you gotta walk like I
0:35:34 you know avoid bright lights don't open
0:35:37 doors for yourself that kind of thing
0:35:38 what is this midnight ish now at this
0:35:40 point it's about midnight yeah it'll no
0:35:43 it won't take me a couple hours to do it
0:35:44 it'll last a couple hours that's what I
0:35:46 was asking oh how long it'll take yes
0:35:48 like 15 minutes that's fine we'll see if
0:35:50 Arabella shows up in that time we can
0:35:52 take do we have to stay near you while
0:35:54 you do this yes
0:35:55 just move like you move huh just just
0:35:57 stick to the Shadows try not to bump
0:35:59 into stuff I can only do it for four of
0:36:02 you uh but I can take care of myself so
0:36:06 right and that means I can open the
0:36:07 doors for you and then just kind of like
0:36:09 disappear again you do it we'll stay
0:36:11 nearby and take a look to see if we see
0:36:13 anything else once you're doing that
0:36:14 we'll take a perimeter and then we'll go
0:36:16 inside okay Neil yeah if I turn on my
0:36:20 eyes is that gonna break it no
0:36:22 say eyes glow no okay so we'll all look
0:36:26 around with our eyes our heightened
0:36:28 senses or whatever we can do
0:36:30 right while he's performing that okay
0:36:32 sounds like it sounds uh sounds like a
0:36:33 plan yes I will activate height
0:36:36 instances for sight I will activate the
0:36:38 gangrilize Johnny will rack his shotgun
0:36:41 and Neil will start muttering in Lost
0:36:45 and unknowable languages Gathering the
0:36:49 Shadows around all four of you uh
0:36:51 towards the end of the ritual a car
0:36:54 pulls up a Blackwell polished sedan low
0:36:58 profile but very well cared for
0:37:00 emerging from it are three women
0:37:03 as soon as other people show up Neil
0:37:05 aborts the the ritual okay yeah they
0:37:09 yeah if you guys are doing it right
0:37:10 there then yeah no as soon as other
0:37:12 people show up Neil's like we're not
0:37:13 doing this
0:37:14 three women exit the car one of them you
0:37:17 recognize is Arabella another one you
0:37:19 recognize is Carrie the third recognized
0:37:22 as the young woman who was Carrie's
0:37:24 friend that was a bit more quiet and
0:37:27 carry herself
0:37:28 and the three of them sort of walk out
0:37:32 they're wearing flats
0:37:33 arabella's kind of dressed more like uh
0:37:37 a bit more of like a power suit and the
0:37:40 uh the other young women are kind of
0:37:43 dressed you know with a with like plaid
0:37:47 skirts and button-down shirts and
0:37:50 Dramatic Makeup pentagrams marking their
0:37:54 their outfits particularly like an
0:37:57 upside down pentagram on one of them
0:38:00 they approach the group of you
0:38:02 welcome to the party
0:38:04 you haven't begun they are doing a
0:38:06 perimeter check oh well let me know what
0:38:09 you find one of them kind of like looks
0:38:11 really annoyed at their phone there's no
0:38:13 signal here which kind of like shakes
0:38:15 the damn thing
0:38:16 okay I guess we should just look at we
0:38:18 should I'm gonna let's let's go yep and
0:38:21 they'll start looking for a way in yeah
0:38:23 you you find some space where there's
0:38:25 like kind of some torn up roofing on the
0:38:28 like lopsided and dilapidated Tower
0:38:31 Johnny's probably strong enough to
0:38:33 pretty casually like rip open a larger
0:38:36 passageway but that seems to be probably
0:38:38 the only way in at this point is it easy
0:38:40 to get to or like yeah you're just
0:38:43 walking right up to okay the I wasn't
0:38:46 sure if there's like some sort of like
0:38:47 down sync and then the Mansion kind of
0:38:49 deal or or if it's basically like level
0:38:51 with the ground it's level of the ground
0:38:53 got it how does the ground feel around
0:38:55 here
0:38:56 uh a bit mushy under your boots almost
0:38:59 like swamp or a little Swampy
0:39:01 [Music]
0:39:03 Johnny takes a look over at Arabella
0:39:05 how deep does this go
0:39:07 well the Mansion itself is to be four
0:39:10 stories but we don't know how much deep
0:39:12 under those four stories it is so we
0:39:16 might be going quite a ways down do you
0:39:18 know where it was stored I do not all
0:39:20 right you don't think we're gonna be
0:39:22 sleeping down there do you well that
0:39:24 depends on how effective miles his men
0:39:27 are he kind of gives her like a grin
0:39:29 let's get moving in hey Johnny I think
0:39:32 could you get that bit of tiling there
0:39:35 um I think you could get us in at that
0:39:37 point we'll see how effective uh miles
0:39:39 men are he kind of walks over there
0:39:41 and with a potent tug rips off a section
0:39:45 to give it to give us a larger entrance
0:39:47 would you like me to make a roll uh no
0:39:50 you're you're definitely strong if the
0:39:51 the two terminal one kind of like clap
0:39:53 for you
0:39:54 um
0:39:56 the premier women gave Johnny the clap
0:40:00 it always happens that way
0:40:02 Arabella takes a seat kind of like
0:40:04 leaning on the tower itself she starts
0:40:07 opening this like tin case for
0:40:09 cigarettes
0:40:10 takes one out light it with a fancy
0:40:13 Zippo and she just kind of starts
0:40:15 smoking clearly not having any
0:40:17 intentions of going into the damn place
0:40:18 but the two trimmer that she brought
0:40:20 absolutely kind of like approached the
0:40:22 group of you with the intentions of
0:40:24 helping good enough Arabella kind of
0:40:26 gives you this look like are you going
0:40:27 in there
0:40:28 like like are you [ __ ] do you have
0:40:30 any idea how dangerous that is what are
0:40:32 you doing I give her an Autumn a little
0:40:34 salute not like and I stick go on down
0:40:38 win fights the urge to give a similar
0:40:41 salute but um with fewer fingers Going
0:40:44 Down Johnny uh pulls a deep drag on the
0:40:47 morally he lit when he got here finishes
0:40:50 it off and flicks it down at the
0:40:52 arabella's feet which kind of goes out
0:40:54 the moment it comes anywhere near her
0:40:55 and then turns around and heads inside
0:41:01 foreign
0:41:04 [Music]
0:41:07 you can kind of hear this like very
0:41:10 steady gripping coming from deep within
0:41:12 a lot of the floors like rented and
0:41:15 crushed under the pressure of the earth
0:41:16 swallowing this mansion and everyone can
0:41:20 see in the dark
0:41:21 no I have heightened senses uh Vision
0:41:25 out but then yeah the song she has a
0:41:28 flashlight your high intense is fine
0:41:31 actually yeah let's check gear no miles
0:41:34 got a flashlight I trust him do cell
0:41:36 phones have flashlights right now no
0:41:38 okay I love it because they don't take
0:41:40 pictures love the fact that Johnny all
0:41:45 he has around light source is a Zippo so
0:41:47 if I get separated I'm gonna be [ __ ]
0:41:49 in a horror movie with a Zippo and a
0:41:51 shotgun
0:41:52 I love it am I leading the way I think
0:41:55 so hold on hold on for a minute Johnny's
0:41:59 uh will actually pull out his Zippo and
0:42:02 flick it on and take a look around at
0:42:05 some of the wall Interiors here here
0:42:06 does there happen to be a torch sconce
0:42:09 yes Johnny uh holds the Zippo to the
0:42:13 sconce
0:42:14 lights the torch pulls it out of its uh
0:42:17 spot
0:42:18 and hands it over to Miles this is like
0:42:19 a metal connector
0:42:21 uh that kind of makes it makes you have
0:42:23 to kind of like give a good tug to break
0:42:25 the old metal oh absolutely and you have
0:42:27 it hands over to miles I hope your Beast
0:42:29 doesn't mind a little fire Neil steps to
0:42:31 the back of the group
0:42:33 don't know how I feel about a torch
0:42:35 would you rather me carry it yes yeah he
0:42:38 kind of gives you like an elbow and goes
0:42:39 all right I got you uh one of them uh
0:42:42 speaks up I can hold it
0:42:44 constants y
0:42:47 don't worry you two could stay behind me
0:42:50 you seem cool with that well we have a
0:42:52 couple of new companions I've got my
0:42:53 weird heightened senses up and we can
0:42:54 see I'm just gonna be taking a look at
0:42:57 their auras for
0:42:58 you know similar [ __ ] to their friend
0:43:01 Arabella Rollins there's some Flames
0:43:03 black veins you know yeah all the stuff
0:43:05 that I don't want to be alone with these
0:43:07 people with hey Johnny's got Flames I
0:43:09 know a lot of people are probably a
0:43:11 black leads we don't talk about that
0:43:12 part
0:43:14 are you an assemite
0:43:17 foreign
0:43:18 yeah I'm not I don't remember what my
0:43:20 difficulty is here but uh basically base
0:43:23 eight Okay so seven successes okay
0:43:26 that's the first one you roll for each
0:43:28 you're right now for constants now for
0:43:31 the bunch I will laugh
0:43:34 you can only see it on one eye now
0:43:37 only six
0:43:40 both of them have auras that are licked
0:43:43 with green flames
0:43:46 and are much much more malevolent
0:43:50 creatures than their demeanors seem to
0:43:53 suggest
0:43:55 okay and they they really do seem to
0:43:58 actually like Johnny though
0:44:01 so at walking in the back of the group
0:44:03 as we all sort of start to Scooby do our
0:44:05 way into this [ __ ] Spencer Mansion
0:44:07 anneal just does the weird staring thing
0:44:11 at the two craft extras
0:44:16 they kind of look back at you and
0:44:18 continue let's keep it moving
0:44:21 uh who's walking in the back nearest to
0:44:23 me Johnny you want to sandwich this
0:44:25 group I think it's probably a good idea
0:44:27 all right the wind is walking near the
0:44:30 back okay we got the torch up front and
0:44:31 we got the the girl with the uh with the
0:44:34 night vision eyes in the back yep Johnny
0:44:37 why don't you give me a quick perception
0:44:38 for saluting it's difficulty this is
0:44:40 when you look towards uh wind I was
0:44:43 saying Neil really should be in the
0:44:45 front I don't know why uh because Johnny
0:44:47 chose to do this with fire
0:44:49 which totally valid but I scared boys
0:44:52 difficulty eight still be up close too
0:44:56 one success
0:44:59 with one success you see the silhouette
0:45:01 of something not human in the stone wall
0:45:04 like marking the stone wall animated and
0:45:08 moved past when very quickly
0:45:10 do I have time to level my shotgun at it
0:45:13 and take a clear shot at it
0:45:15 no but you may reactors though oh yeah
0:45:18 that's your plan uh Johnny will
0:45:21 absolutely spin around and like try to
0:45:23 get a beat on it but we'll uh hold off
0:45:26 but he definitely raises the shotgun
0:45:28 amidst the group behind him what the
0:45:31 hell was that what something just moved
0:45:33 out of the stone wall wait out of the
0:45:36 wall
0:45:37 I can't yes somebody's Channel light
0:45:39 over is there anything to see yes good
0:45:42 question uh when you guys take a look
0:45:43 around the room something you do notice
0:45:45 uh ahead the ground is kind of like
0:45:48 roiling and shifting uh there's like a
0:45:50 lot of like Dead Leaves
0:45:52 and
0:45:54 uh you hear this hissing noise upon
0:45:57 close inspection there is what has to be
0:46:01 easily over a hundred snakes coiled
0:46:04 about each other and like writhing along
0:46:07 the ground
0:46:09 um who ordered the Conan set are we so
0:46:12 we're basically walking down a set of
0:46:13 stairs into this Tower is what my
0:46:15 general just no you're moving through
0:46:17 like slopes of broken wall uh like the
0:46:23 Mansion when it was swallowed seems to
0:46:25 have been crushed right in many ways so
0:46:28 there's so the pathway is very unusual
0:46:31 and you're kind of like walking on like
0:46:33 leaning walls Johnny
0:46:36 did you see the snakes or did he see
0:46:38 something else no it was a it was a
0:46:41 silhouette
0:46:42 person so maybe even larger than person
0:46:45 sized I'll keep an eye out blurred for
0:46:48 just a moment when right behind win okay
0:46:50 we're gonna be keeping an eye out for
0:46:52 that like it was a part of the wall I
0:46:55 think it came out of the wall it was
0:46:57 part of it and then
0:46:59 sounds like some sort of camouflage or
0:47:01 maybe like uh I mean when you can go
0:47:04 into the ground right that I can but I
0:47:07 can't usually move within it well well
0:47:09 would it make sense to Johnny this is
0:47:11 perhaps an earth meld can Earth meld
0:47:13 into stone
0:47:15 and you definitely can't move once
0:47:17 you're worth molded so we look pointedly
0:47:20 at the premiere like any ideas one kind
0:47:23 of like puts gum to her mouth and
0:47:24 probably has been paying any attention
0:47:26 to the conversation whatsoever uh the
0:47:29 other one kind of gives a nod
0:47:31 and uh speaks up clearing her throat
0:47:36 um so
0:47:39 uh it's probably like a like a chain
0:47:42 tree monster
0:47:44 what like a like a monster that protects
0:47:47 the Chantry that's like a that's a
0:47:49 that's a thing that's a thing looking
0:47:50 monsters that's kind of a silly question
0:47:53 don't you is there anything we can do to
0:47:55 enjoy
0:47:57 um I mean
0:47:58 you guys are here to fight them right
0:48:01 yeah apparently
0:48:03 that always seems to be my job all right
0:48:07 when yeah
0:48:09 can you talk to these things yeah I can
0:48:13 talk to the snakes maybe they know more
0:48:16 yeah or at least tell him to get the
0:48:18 hell out of the way oh no that was part
0:48:20 of the plan
0:48:21 all right when and Johnny will switch
0:48:24 spots he'll relent the front to her so
0:48:26 she can talk to the snakes and he will
0:48:28 take up the rear being extra wary about
0:48:31 seeing Silhouettes I am keeping my head
0:48:34 on a swivel towards the walls same wind
0:48:37 will Crouch down to the snakes and start
0:48:41 hissing sounds so mundane but she is
0:48:44 she starts speaking to the snakes in a
0:48:46 language they can understand
0:48:48 hey guys
0:48:50 hello
0:48:51 I kind of like start giving you some of
0:48:54 their attention but they kind of seem to
0:48:56 be like huddled together to have
0:48:58 survived winter
0:48:59 and this is kind of a good spot for them
0:49:02 to be right now and they are feeling
0:49:05 aggressive enough to fight to defend it
0:49:08 is it nice and warm here guys not cold
0:49:11 it's not cold if we can make it warmer
0:49:14 would you let us pass
0:49:16 can make warmer if we can will you let
0:49:19 us pass
0:49:20 yes
0:49:21 okay
0:49:23 what kind of snakes do these appear to
0:49:25 be uh it looks to be copperheads and uh
0:49:29 kind of like a smattering of like uh
0:49:32 local breeds okay guys we need to make a
0:49:34 small fire again one shrugs and just
0:49:38 whirls an arc of flame at uh one of like
0:49:43 the rotting couches that are in the area
0:49:46 it lights up one of the tremair does or
0:49:49 one of the snakes does
0:49:50 okay okay
0:49:53 um should be warmer over there
0:49:56 we threw up a bolt of green flame no
0:49:59 just fire just forever okay may we pass
0:50:01 yes
0:50:03 thank you good luck in the winter
0:50:06 you as well a natural thing
0:50:09 it's appreciated natural thing
0:50:11 and wind kind of stands up and waits for
0:50:13 the snakes to move her arms crossed just
0:50:16 kind of like okay it's a very lazy
0:50:18 detangling but over the course of a few
0:50:20 minutes uh they kind of get out of your
0:50:23 way and end up something where not that
0:50:27 close to the fire because of all the
0:50:28 smoke that's building in the area but
0:50:30 they end up kind of traveling a bit
0:50:32 deeper uh into the recesses of the
0:50:35 Mansion oh wow yeah yeah yeah
0:50:39 thank you no problem Johnny you want to
0:50:41 trade spots again yeah all right I don't
0:50:44 mind staying up here I think for the
0:50:45 benefit everybody else who can't see
0:50:47 it's best to have the torch in front I
0:50:49 agree he uh pushes past the tremeer and
0:50:52 gives them some dirty looks
0:50:54 after having seen them toss fire around
0:50:57 Constance gives you a dirty look but
0:51:00 with wildly different intentions
0:51:03 Johnny gets back up to the front and
0:51:04 starts pressing forward now the snakes
0:51:06 are out of the way in the next area you
0:51:08 kind of reach uh what looks like a long
0:51:12 hallway uh that's sort of on its side
0:51:15 and ripped apart where you kind of have
0:51:19 to go through what's essentially like
0:51:21 kind of spiky wooden debris to get to a
0:51:24 staircase that actually faces downward
0:51:26 in this uh space there are what looks
0:51:31 like hundreds of
0:51:33 differently sized copper rings that are
0:51:37 smashed about all over the place having
0:51:38 made this huge mess
0:51:40 again the walls here the roof are made
0:51:44 from Stone
0:51:46 this whole place is insane it's
0:51:49 Mansion got swallowed up by the Earth
0:51:51 but it looks like the way that it
0:51:53 crushed formed these weird
0:51:56 what is this her room the hallway back
0:51:58 there didn't make any sense Neil
0:52:01 something was bad enough to make them
0:52:02 abandon this you got any idea what those
0:52:05 rings are about Neil looks at the Rings
0:52:07 for a minute do I have a
0:52:09 just a general idea yeah I mean you can
0:52:12 probably kind of piece together that a
0:52:13 bunch of these rings are representative
0:52:16 of the solar system and Were Meant to
0:52:20 kind of circle around each other and
0:52:22 kind of be this huge intricate thing
0:52:24 that is in constant motion
0:52:27 Neil looks at it for a couple minutes
0:52:29 and and gives a nod
0:52:30 uh this use debate was was an astrolabe
0:52:35 who would track the positions of the
0:52:37 planets and and think they would all
0:52:39 sort of presumably rotate around each
0:52:41 other to to track where each of the
0:52:43 planets uh was in relation to themselves
0:52:46 in the Sun it's a big it's a big one
0:52:49 it's like an intricate big one now it's
0:52:52 all broken yeah it's a shame I mean I
0:52:56 understand the scientific purpose but is
0:52:59 copper meaningful you know it's just
0:53:02 they're different metals and things but
0:53:05 even beyond the scientific you know
0:53:07 shorting the position of the planets for
0:53:09 your you know your horoscopes and uh you
0:53:13 the position of this the sun and the
0:53:16 planets and well you know I see it deep
0:53:18 into astrology
0:53:20 but I see the one hallway into here I'll
0:53:22 stop and I see the one exit out of here
0:53:25 so it's stairs you said you see there's
0:53:28 a path downstairs and the hallway
0:53:30 actually kind of continues for quite a
0:53:31 distance well outside of torch reach
0:53:33 nothing down is our path
0:53:36 here's a question we hadn't really asked
0:53:39 before do we
0:53:41 know where in this place okay we did ask
0:53:45 them so if this was a a haul that
0:53:49 contained an astrolabe
0:53:52 what might that
0:53:55 let's just keep moving forward come down
0:53:58 speaks up some refer to the Chantry as
0:54:01 the sanctuary of the red sign
0:54:03 it was uh a means of tracking
0:54:08 um
0:54:09 positions within the loom of Fate
0:54:11 various Realms uh both uh for the middle
0:54:15 Umbra and lower Umbra Realms and uh what
0:54:20 is what is very interesting is this
0:54:23 chanchi was something of uh Library
0:54:27 where a number of Kindred had collected
0:54:30 tomes related to undoing the alleged
0:54:34 curse and causes the Kindred condition
0:54:37 the secret of the red sign
0:54:40 the the Reds okay so Library there's a
0:54:44 library in here that's probably three or
0:54:46 four libraries here filled with all
0:54:48 kinds of cursed books well we're looking
0:54:51 for a cursed book
0:54:52 I don't think we're calling it cursed
0:54:55 Jenny spits on the ground don't be that
0:54:58 mad Johnny you hear thump
0:55:01 Thump Thump it immediately
0:55:05 it's way off in the dark okay
0:55:08 [Music]
0:55:08 um
0:55:09 is it does it sound like it's
0:55:10 approaching yes okay hey uh decision
0:55:14 time now we gotta go someone's coming
0:55:16 upstairs yeah all right I already made
0:55:18 that okay okay well then let's let's go
0:55:19 because something is coming right now
0:55:23 [Music]
0:55:25 and drawing close kind of like stomping
0:55:29 into the area is not just one but three
0:55:33 having kind of movement in unison these
0:55:36 very very large bigger than a wolf dogs
0:55:41 however these dogs they do not have fur
0:55:44 they'd not seem to be living they are
0:55:48 formed entirely of stone and the stone
0:55:51 dogs have eyes that begin to gleam red
0:55:54 and
0:55:56 they kind of like growl through uh very
0:55:59 very very sharp looking obsidian teeth
0:56:02 can I understand them you cannot these
0:56:05 things are artificially created you
0:56:07 immediately kind of get the feeling
0:56:08 something's wrong here
0:56:11 Neil tries if nobody's running or like
0:56:14 if they're coming to attack us uh Neil
0:56:16 just ducks behind a cache yeah I'm
0:56:18 holding my weapon I'm like Jamir what
0:56:21 are we looking at
0:56:23 the tutramere draw knives they're very
0:56:28 kind of like small switchblades but the
0:56:31 blades glow with green fire they look
0:56:34 absolutely terrified and way off in the
0:56:38 dark
0:56:39 here
0:56:40 who has come here
