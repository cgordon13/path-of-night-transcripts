0:00:39 missing and that detective Suarez is
0:00:41 potentially bald weathers abandons the

0:01:08 while miles deals with his demons in the
0:01:11 meantime win finds Johnny and the two
0:01:13 manage to talk things out the cautery
0:01:15 reunites after the trial coming together
0:01:18 whole
0:01:19 [Music]
0:01:21 Johnny You Wobble
0:01:23 yeah stagger as you walk and wind
0:01:26 eventually gets you into the truck and
0:01:29 takes you to the woods where her Haven
0:01:32 is
0:01:33 and as you walk that old path that
0:01:36 you've actually noticed something uh
0:01:37 interesting where the Weeping bear had
0:01:40 died some time ago now with a spring it
0:01:44 has brought these mushrooms that grow
0:01:47 over the place where its corpse had been
0:01:48 burned and they grow up along the trees
0:01:51 and there's just this thick patch that
0:01:54 has been overrun by these little
0:01:55 mushrooms and it had passed and arrived
0:02:00 Johnny is uh rough as your night's been
0:02:03 the first thing you notice is that the
0:02:06 door to The Haven is open and there are
0:02:09 pensive sounds coming from within that
0:02:11 you recognize and as the two of you make
0:02:14 your way to the doorway you can see
0:02:16 miles Brita and Neil waiting for you
0:02:18 before we jump in if I had seen the
0:02:21 mushrooms I would have tried to see if I
0:02:23 could figure anything out about them uh
0:02:25 I'd like to make a science role that is
0:02:28 science plus intelligence yes if you
0:02:30 have science I do have science go for it
0:02:32 it's got two science
0:02:35 the difficulty of this rule is seven I
0:02:38 have one success with one success you
0:02:40 will know that these uh you don't quite
0:02:44 recognize what sort of mushrooms these
0:02:47 are but you do notice that they seem to
0:02:50 be uh particularly enduring it looks
0:02:52 like they'll just kind of grow on
0:02:53 anything win brings Johnny up to her
0:02:56 Shack inside the shack currently there's
0:02:58 just an army caught and perhaps a little
0:03:02 oddly a pink beanbag chair with duct
0:03:04 tape on it it's clearly been repaired a
0:03:06 few times and when hurriedly starts
0:03:09 setting up some miscellaneous camping
0:03:11 and folding chairs that look like
0:03:13 they've been scavenged from campsites
0:03:16 I've been collecting these in case you
0:03:18 guys ever came over thank you and put
0:03:21 them to use Neil is awkwardly struggling
0:03:24 in the bean bag chair like no it's
0:03:25 actually it's pretty comfortable it's
0:03:27 it's not good it was good I feel like I
0:03:29 feel like wind would also have like
0:03:31 Christmas lights strung around her area
0:03:34 that like she can plug into like some
0:03:36 kind of generator so like when she's
0:03:38 around she can like turn it on and have
0:03:39 like this weird kind of like she's got
0:03:42 definitely the single light bulb hanging
0:03:44 from the ceiling
0:03:45 um that doesn't really have a pull cord
0:03:46 you have to screw the bulb in and out um
0:03:48 in order to turn the light on and off
0:03:50 but yeah I like the idea that she has a
0:03:52 little Ambiance of this old string of
0:03:54 Christmas lights with some of the bulbs
0:03:55 missing which is really funny because
0:03:57 like she can see in the dark purple
0:03:59 perfectly well so it's literally just
0:04:01 for company
0:04:02 well Joey gets scared of the dark
0:04:05 and Joey
0:04:06 Johnny kind of Pats you on the shoulder
0:04:08 as you get to the uh Shack and uh
0:04:11 quickly heads off to the uh side of the
0:04:14 woods to expel some of the liquid that
0:04:17 doesn't belong in his stomach
0:04:19 that can't exist in his stomach
0:04:22 Brett is about to sit down in the
0:04:24 folding chair that wind just placed down
0:04:26 for her but she walks back out to the
0:04:28 door to check on Johnny
0:04:30 and kind of calls out hey you're not
0:04:33 near those mushrooms right no not near
0:04:36 any mushrooms
0:04:37 thank you with that she just goes and
0:04:40 sits back down after a minute or so
0:04:42 Johnny comes back and finds a spot oh
0:04:46 that's a good idea excuse me win kind of
0:04:49 jogs out to the woods empties the
0:04:52 tequila and the monarch caterpillar
0:04:56 and heads back in
0:04:58 I just don't think anyone should go near
0:05:00 those I I don't recognize them I no I
0:05:03 don't like them I've been meaning to
0:05:04 take a torch to him they seem resilient
0:05:08 anything that's growing near where
0:05:10 weeping bear was I don't think should
0:05:12 stay there
0:05:14 just be cautious right yep
0:05:16 if uh if they come back even with the
0:05:19 fire and things like that let me know
0:05:20 we'll do because I got
0:05:24 I can't I got thoughts anyway but just
0:05:26 you know instinctively Johnny reaches to
0:05:28 grab on our cigarette realizes he's out
0:05:31 in a big sour frown crawls across his
0:05:34 face oh hang on let me see if I've got
0:05:36 anything wind kind of pulls out a milk
0:05:38 crate from underneath her Army cot
0:05:42 um Scott miscellaneous crap that she's
0:05:43 taken from campsites does she have a
0:05:46 pack of cigarettes roll a die
0:05:49 on a seven or higher yes
0:05:52 on a six it's close it's an eight
0:05:55 um more of these
0:05:57 here you go man
0:05:58 so the group of you are outside under
0:06:00 the tarp a win raises the broom pushing
0:06:03 the water that's collecting on it off
0:06:06 and
0:06:07 there is a long
0:06:09 pregnant pause that follows the water
0:06:11 splashing on the ground
0:06:16 well uh
0:06:19 I said sorry I
0:06:21 bounced out a little early but
0:06:23 congratulations Neil I'm glad you're not
0:06:26 dead yet
0:06:28 thanks Johnny yeah um
0:06:30 I'm also glad that I'm Not Dead
0:06:35 so what's the plan
0:06:36 I don't I don't know
0:06:39 well we know what we have to do so
0:06:43 do we well okay so here's here's the
0:06:46 thing that I I've been thinking right I
0:06:48 don't want to ask this if of anybody
0:06:50 else it's technically
0:06:53 technically it's my ordeal
0:06:55 so um
0:06:57 none of you have to help
0:07:02 I'm not gonna ask that
0:07:04 if anybody
0:07:08 I'll just go on I'll
0:07:12 I'll talk to I'll deal with
0:07:16 it
0:07:17 um
0:07:18 by myself so you die anyway
0:07:21 okay well I I might I might not you
0:07:24 don't you don't know I I have
0:07:27 stuff that might be more true if hadn't
0:07:31 been announced out loud in the middle of
0:07:33 Court yeah I am definitely expecting it
0:07:35 jumped by uh Amaya I would have said the
0:07:38 anarchs but there aren't any anymore the
0:07:40 whole point of doing what we did in the
0:07:42 court paying the boons and talking to
0:07:44 the people that we talked to was to give
0:07:45 you a chance and I have it
0:07:47 and I have it
0:07:49 but
0:07:52 I would do this to stay alive for all of
0:07:56 your sakes but that's not
0:07:58 and he looks at Johnny I I am I mean I'm
0:08:02 thinking about it but I I need you to
0:08:04 know it's not
0:08:06 something I want to do
0:08:08 it's not something I'm happy about I
0:08:10 don't
0:08:11 kill Johnny I've never
0:08:14 I've never killed anyone
0:08:16 ever
0:08:18 I I've never
0:08:20 I can't even feed on people when they're
0:08:22 awake it freaks me out too much that I
0:08:24 might be hurting someone I I but
0:08:27 if
0:08:29 I don't do this
0:08:32 Nora's dead
0:08:34 and so am I but
0:08:37 if you don't do this narrow's Gonna Be
0:08:38 Blood hunted by New Haven yeah doesn't
0:08:41 mean she's dead yes it does because
0:08:43 she's essentially blood hunted by Alma
0:08:46 so am I
0:08:48 I'm Sorry by what by the at the children
0:08:52 of Hakeem are hunting her
0:08:55 as far as I can tell as much as they're
0:08:57 hunting me there's a Schism I think it
0:08:59 happened tonight the story stormed off
0:09:01 so killing the anarchs does that solve
0:09:04 that
0:09:04 do you start being blood hunted by
0:09:06 alamoit if you go and kill Amaya
0:09:08 no but being an independent being alone
0:09:13 there's no protection there but there is
0:09:15 a faction of the Assamites
0:09:18 who are going to need shelter and
0:09:21 whether we like it or not the camarilla
0:09:25 they are the political Powerhouse of the
0:09:28 Kindred Society
0:09:30 Rowlands is not the camarilla but he
0:09:34 represents them here because a prince is
0:09:37 his domain
0:09:39 and it's not like anyone above his pay
0:09:43 grade is going to be okay with him not
0:09:45 being here he the archons which speak
0:09:49 with the voice of the Justice cars said
0:09:51 he needs to be here in charge
0:09:56 so as far as politics is concerned
0:09:59 he is the camarilla
0:10:02 at least around here
0:10:04 and
0:10:06 this is my home too
0:10:09 I I'm willing to hear other I don't
0:10:13 think you are
0:10:14 yeah just like you said it you've only
0:10:16 got one option at least that's what you
0:10:19 think it is what I think and I'm waiting
0:10:21 for more information when have you not
0:10:23 known me to be the one dragging his
0:10:27 heels looking for more information or
0:10:30 another way out that's who I am which
0:10:33 means if I'm here if I'm thinking about
0:10:35 doing something I've thought about it I
0:10:38 haven't stopped thinking about it even
0:10:40 when Bretta and I were talking to Nyx
0:10:42 even worrying about Brita that that even
0:10:46 worrying about you
0:10:48 about miles
0:10:50 when you actually seem to be having an
0:10:51 okay day as far as you know
0:10:55 I am thinking about it and if there's
0:10:57 another way I thought about it until
0:11:01 he said the setites want her skull
0:11:04 I thought maybe we could just pull
0:11:05 another
0:11:06 you know another Arabella another we
0:11:09 could we could we could warm our way out
0:11:10 of it but they want her skull so unless
0:11:13 I mean the other way is to to to
0:11:16 to just make war on the entirety of
0:11:18 clansettite in the area undermine The
0:11:21 Prince and and throw miles's reputation
0:11:24 into into a dumpster and light it on
0:11:27 fire so why don't we go to the setites
0:11:29 and see if there's something else they
0:11:30 want other than Amaya
0:11:35 it's not a bad option miles would have
0:11:37 to do that I don't think they're going
0:11:38 to talk to any of the rest of us but
0:11:40 they also made an end run around him for
0:11:42 a reason
0:11:43 the price that they'll want for that
0:11:46 might be
0:11:48 high and doesn't actually help my ordeal
0:11:50 unless they also talk to Prince Rowlands
0:11:52 who by the way he's insane right now I
0:11:54 don't know if everybody caught that
0:11:57 he's crazy
0:11:58 Clinton King got to him he's crazy well
0:12:01 he got made crazy so once we get him out
0:12:05 of that
0:12:06 I don't know how long that's gonna last
0:12:08 I don't know I mean if you look at Zora
0:12:10 right now he's it's flickering
0:12:13 everywhere he's
0:12:14 he is erratic my clan got in his head
0:12:19 and and it's a problem for another night
0:12:23 but that other night could last
0:12:25 you know he could be better tomorrow he
0:12:27 could be better in a week he could be
0:12:29 better next year
0:12:30 I don't know we're putting the cart
0:12:33 before the horse right now but they're
0:12:35 all connected the car and the horse are
0:12:36 all in a horrible mashup Pile in the
0:12:38 middle of the street yeah I mean that's
0:12:40 that's how carts and horses work they're
0:12:41 connected but you have to connect them
0:12:44 in the right order I say we [ __ ] talk
0:12:47 to the setites
0:12:48 and we see if this is even something
0:12:50 that is negotiable
0:12:53 I don't want to kill Johnny's friend I
0:12:56 don't want to either but I don't want to
0:12:57 put miles in a position where he's going
0:13:01 to be indebted to or enslaved to the
0:13:04 saidites do you remember me talking
0:13:05 about what their weird
0:13:08 ritual stuff is they strip away who you
0:13:12 are and make you someone new the other
0:13:15 part is that if we renege on this
0:13:17 they're going to start getting more
0:13:19 serious and how they deal with me and
0:13:21 with us miles you had already agreed to
0:13:25 right do that thing with them correct I
0:13:28 owed them something is this them forcing
0:13:31 that issue yes yes and they did it in a
0:13:33 way that would be worse because if they
0:13:36 just asked me
0:13:38 privately let's say
0:13:40 it would be
0:13:42 it'd be easier this is damaging on
0:13:45 multiple levels and I'm sure they're
0:13:46 loving it probably uh here's a weird
0:13:49 thought though an interesting question
0:13:53 um why did they fire bomb Elysium
0:13:55 tonight
0:13:56 who's they Elysium was firebombed yeah
0:14:00 somebody drove past and shouted freedom
0:14:03 freedom which ordinarily would make me
0:14:06 think it was a bunch of Rowdy anarchs
0:14:07 except that there aren't any anarchs
0:14:09 there's only Amaya that's the
0:14:10 information we got there's Amaya and
0:14:13 everyone else who was in anarch is a
0:14:15 sedite so why did the setites rile up
0:14:18 Elysium tonight I thought it would have
0:14:20 been the spot
0:14:21 Sabbat don't scream freedom freedom
0:14:23 that's an anarchy unless they're trying
0:14:25 to make it look like it's
0:14:27 which they haven't done so far they very
0:14:30 much want us to know that they're the
0:14:32 ones running around
0:14:34 uh making trouble and you know blowing
0:14:37 up Dunkin Donuts and stuff that doesn't
0:14:39 seem like they're Mo but you know random
0:14:42 firebomb that doesn't actually do any
0:14:43 damage uh screaming about Freedom that
0:14:46 sounds like a parody of the anarchs
0:14:49 and the only anarchs are setites
0:14:52 now I know sometimes I make connections
0:14:54 where there aren't connections but that
0:14:55 is my do you see this in the patterns
0:14:58 I didn't look this is just me this is
0:15:01 just me making suppositions but it
0:15:04 tracks
0:15:06 I can ask the Stars if you want but I
0:15:09 this just
0:15:11 I don't know if that really affects
0:15:13 anything that much right now it affects
0:15:15 things if they're putting you into this
0:15:17 kind of position to go kill Amaya and
0:15:19 then they're also trying to ramp up
0:15:21 anti-anarch sentiment
0:15:23 amongst
0:15:25 the camarilla I it I don't know if it
0:15:29 changes anything but if we can
0:15:33 it might be a a a a bar with which to
0:15:36 leverage Rowlands paranoia towards the
0:15:39 set Heights and away from everything
0:15:41 else if that's something we have to do
0:15:43 but
0:15:44 I don't want to kill Amaya but I will
0:15:47 and he looks he can't quite make eye
0:15:51 contact with Johnny
0:15:52 I will if it would keep Nara alive
0:15:57 if I have to choose between two people
0:16:00 my choice isn't hard
0:16:02 I'm sorry and if we know what the set
0:16:04 Heights want before we go to talk to
0:16:06 them if we try to talk to them to get
0:16:07 more information we'll have an easier
0:16:09 time trying to get them to do what we
0:16:12 want yeah that too
0:16:14 this is the end of my expertise I I see
0:16:16 the patterns I look at the things the
0:16:18 rest of I don't know what to do next
0:16:21 if the answer is we go kill Amaya I know
0:16:24 what to do
0:16:25 could you maybe look and see if
0:16:30 I mean I'm sorry I don't know how it
0:16:31 works but with the information that we
0:16:34 have would you be able to see anything
0:16:35 about why the setites might want the
0:16:38 skull
0:16:39 can I make any sort of like a cult role
0:16:41 based on social or whatever what you
0:16:42 could do with like a kindred skull or is
0:16:45 this just a
0:16:46 not really you're not really sure
0:16:48 exactly what they'd be using that for
0:16:50 I I don't know I mean you do magic stuff
0:16:54 yeah but there are different
0:16:56 if I was just taking a wild guess I feel
0:16:59 like a skull could actually identify
0:17:01 that it is the person
0:17:03 see yeah there's not really like an
0:17:06 anarch dignitas to show and make people
0:17:08 feel like it happened the city is also
0:17:10 aware that I'll probably try to screw
0:17:12 them in any opportunity I can
0:17:13 probably
0:17:15 which is why they want to screw you in
0:17:16 any opportunity they can it's Mitchell
0:17:18 but when
0:17:19 Shaw died he turned to Ash
0:17:22 how would we get the skull show is old
0:17:26 on my uh
0:17:27 the couple of times I've seen her in
0:17:29 court which is about the extent of my
0:17:31 knowledge of Amaya um
0:17:33 now Johnny you know her better she's not
0:17:35 more than a decade I think she's younger
0:17:38 than Shaw
0:17:39 okay I don't know for certain
0:17:42 so there'd still be a skull
0:17:45 in theory
0:17:46 if you take this hit
0:17:48 and you actually conduct this
0:17:51 you kill the baron bring your skull back
0:17:54 to the Setites what's next I don't
0:17:57 know
0:17:58 make some guesses look to the Future
0:18:00 you're good at that
0:18:02 if I kill her the last remaining anarch
0:18:06 who's holding out against the settites
0:18:07 in the area
0:18:09 is gone how about you
0:18:12 me what does that do to you what does
0:18:15 that do to Nara
0:18:16 gets to live
0:18:18 for how long
0:18:20 depends I was hoping that I mean I
0:18:23 mentioned it in the trial I was hoping
0:18:25 to because you know what she doesn't
0:18:26 have you know what this ordeal doesn't
0:18:28 get her
0:18:30 hospitality
0:18:31 she is
0:18:33 tolerated so long as I fulfill my end of
0:18:37 the bargain did they say that yes the
0:18:39 prince said that tolerated yeah and then
0:18:42 after that because they are children of
0:18:45 Hakeem I was hoping to leverage things
0:18:48 into
0:18:50 um talking to the prince maybe some
0:18:52 higher ups about uh some of the
0:18:55 good well good thing the prince is so
0:18:57 reasonable that sounds like it'll
0:18:58 probably work he's unreasonable in an
0:19:01 understandable way is that what you want
0:19:03 to call it
0:19:04 Tony
0:19:05 I understand
0:19:08 I understand the logic behind crazy
0:19:11 is not
0:19:13 a random series of unpredictable moves
0:19:16 crazy is based in flawed logic and if
0:19:21 you can understand the kernel of flawed
0:19:22 logic at the base of the crazy you
0:19:24 understand what's going on hmm
0:19:27 he's paranoid irrational he's a
0:19:30 megalomaniac but if you can turn
0:19:33 that paranoia at a different Target that
0:19:36 bolsters his own megalomania
0:19:37 he's crazy but it still makes sense if
0:19:40 you know how to look at it
0:19:42 everyone who's Crazy thinks that they're
0:19:45 not
0:19:46 it's all based on a kernel of reality
0:19:50 and I'm not saying he's going to listen
0:19:52 I am not saying but that was
0:19:54 the thought I mean my actual thought was
0:19:57 that I would just spend the next several
0:19:59 decades quietly living
0:20:01 you know weather is gone
0:20:04 he walked away from his post his
0:20:06 primogen tonight
0:20:07 does that mean he's not part of the
0:20:10 camera I don't know what it means
0:20:13 it means he's looking out for things
0:20:15 that he believes in
0:20:17 I feel like a lot of the bruja in this
0:20:19 city have been forgetting about the
0:20:20 things that they believe in
0:20:22 he's trying to figure that out again
0:20:25 I say more power to him
0:20:27 Jane's missing
0:20:29 missing she wasn't there tonight that's
0:20:31 right she hasn't been answering phone
0:20:33 calls
0:20:34 weather's thinks it's Suarez like Suarez
0:20:38 took her the cop I don't know
0:20:41 what's going on with him
0:20:43 or he's been either fired for the force
0:20:46 or presumed dead and now weathers is
0:20:48 telling me that he thinks that that
0:20:50 Suarez has done something with Jane I
0:20:52 know they had some kind of relationship
0:20:53 but I thought he was taken care of
0:20:56 he's so good die I don't think he would
0:20:58 hurt her
0:21:01 miles it was a masquerade problem
0:21:05 so weather's gone
0:21:08 Jane might be gone
0:21:10 you do this the work of this crazy man
0:21:12 with whatever logic that he's got going
0:21:14 for him trying to manipulate him however
0:21:17 you think that means Amaya is going to
0:21:18 be gone
0:21:20 all the bruja dropping off one by one
0:21:24 where are you
0:21:26 it's a good [ __ ] question
0:21:27 also we're not your enemies you're
0:21:30 saying that to me yes I'm saying that to
0:21:32 you Johnny you've come at us very
0:21:34 aggressively since we started talking
0:21:35 about do you think any of us really
0:21:37 wants to take out miles you need to sit
0:21:40 the [ __ ] down shut up shut the [ __ ] up
0:21:42 uh yep absolutely both of you
0:21:50 okay I'm thinking
0:21:52 so I rolled a three and two ones
0:21:58 uh four tens oh my god
0:22:02 well that's as opposite as you can
0:22:04 [ __ ] I was gonna let you know that
0:22:05 you're a plus two difficulty but okay
0:22:08 you crushed that anyways okay everyone
0:22:11 initiative
0:22:18 Johnny 19 win nine miles 17. brother
0:22:24 13 due to spending one blood for
0:22:27 Celerity Neil Ted uh John needs your
0:22:30 action Johnny is going to uh spend
0:22:33 um not yet but he'll he will basically
0:22:36 uh
0:22:38 try to put miles through the wall with a
0:22:42 uh punch
0:22:43 okay uh Dex was brawl miles are you
0:22:45 dodging are you uh holding off on
0:22:47 burning any actions all right well Dodge
0:22:50 I spent one for slurry
0:22:53 five successes uh take off three okay uh
0:22:57 one die carries over I will spend a
0:22:59 point of blood for potence okay uh miles
0:23:02 go ahead and roll soak
0:23:08 a very good role considering the
0:23:10 circumstances
0:23:11 three levels of bashing
0:23:13 is that counting the automatic successes
0:23:16 yes it is
0:23:19 wow your dice are just not doing it
0:23:21 tonight huh I'm okay with that I mean
0:23:23 yeah that's good right now I take one uh
0:23:26 I have to zero Johnny uh connects with
0:23:30 uh Mal's chin and miles is sent
0:23:35 spiraling into the wall a portion of
0:23:37 winds Haven kind of caves and the old
0:23:41 wood kind of bends and snaps miles is
0:23:44 covered in like Grime and dirt and we go
0:23:48 two miles I'm gonna pick myself up dust
0:23:51 myself off and kind of signal the fact
0:23:55 that he just punched me into his
0:23:57 friend's house essentially not doing I'm
0:23:59 just waiting to see if he hits me again
0:24:00 at this point essentially holding yeah
0:24:02 okay
0:24:04 is going to look to Miles covered in
0:24:07 that sort of white cement dust uh and
0:24:10 her head will whip to Johnny and she'll
0:24:12 say Johnny Johnny please come out of it
0:24:15 okay I know I know but
0:24:17 she's trying to social Johnny out of it
0:24:19 okay uh Romy Charisma leadership
0:24:22 actually manipulation leadership does
0:24:24 expressive count
0:24:26 yes okay
0:24:30 three successes
0:24:32 Johnny you may spend one old Power and
0:24:34 we'll self-control if you'd like
0:24:36 [Music]
0:24:38 no thank you then we will go to Neil
0:24:41 seeing Rita like try and talk him down
0:24:44 and Johnny just continuing to like be
0:24:47 enraged uh and go after miles he'll just
0:24:49 look at Miles and like hey uh just just
0:24:51 get out of sight for a little bit okay
0:24:53 just just just for a minute I'll I'll
0:24:56 hold them off okay where do you expect
0:24:58 me to go into the woods for like three
0:25:00 minutes
0:25:01 foreign
0:25:04 it's raining right yes it is uh and you
0:25:07 will start like moving his hands around
0:25:09 and stepping back from Johnny a little
0:25:12 bit and try and lash out with uh turn
0:25:15 the rain into shackles of water to hold
0:25:17 him still and away from hurting anybody
0:25:19 okay uh the shackles cannot move him but
0:25:22 it can move him in place they will keep
0:25:23 him in place yeah I mean until he pulls
0:25:25 his out of him but it always will talk
0:25:26 about action
0:25:28 oh the rain coalesces into like chains
0:25:32 of water that just entangle Johnny
0:25:35 you'll need six successes on a
0:25:38 unfortunately strength jacket too
0:25:41 how my dice have been going you might
0:25:42 got me two two uh break out but you will
0:25:45 need six successes uh it's difficulty
0:25:46 eight okay water version of Full Nelson
0:25:49 I am waterfall nelsoning him so you can
0:25:52 get away for a little bit when when
0:25:55 stands between miles and Johnny and she
0:25:58 looks Johnny
0:25:59 in the eyes
0:26:00 like like he's a wild animal and she
0:26:04 just said we are not doing this and she
0:26:07 is going to attempt to quell him spend
0:26:09 Point go ahead and give me a roll all
0:26:12 right what's the time to any of my
0:26:14 abilities uh uh affect this no I have
0:26:17 iron heart Iron Heart does not affect
0:26:19 animals that is uh dominate might
0:26:21 affecting domaturgy and presence
0:26:24 two successes with two successes Johnny
0:26:28 comes out of frenzy
0:26:29 how do the water shackles look like do
0:26:32 they move are they like still they are
0:26:34 very clearly magical in nature it is
0:26:37 water
0:26:38 summoning forth like thin tendrils of it
0:26:40 that are have like ensnared his like
0:26:42 wrists and elbows and shoulders and legs
0:26:45 Johnny's eyes go from the kind of
0:26:49 vibrating almost blank expression he has
0:26:53 in frenzy to suddenly call the Lessing
0:26:55 on you his brow is still furrowed in
0:26:58 anger but you see that he has stopped
0:27:01 and has control of himself
0:27:02 I don't know what your end game is
0:27:05 but you just destroyed part of my
0:27:07 [ __ ] Haven try and hurt someone in
0:27:09 this codery
0:27:10 you can be pissed you should be pissed
0:27:14 but we are not the targets here
0:27:17 get it the [ __ ] together I understand
0:27:20 you're not the targets
0:27:22 and I understand you're not my enemies
0:27:26 but I am
0:27:28 barely keeping this together and you
0:27:31 should have [ __ ] known better than to
0:27:33 get under my skin right now yeah we've
0:27:35 all had a hard night oh
0:27:38 Wynn grabs Johnny by the arm and
0:27:40 forcibly Yanks him towards the woods uh
0:27:42 you find that the uh shackles that hold
0:27:46 him are resilient even to you make a
0:27:49 strength roll at difficulty eight you
0:27:52 want six successes in order to tear
0:27:54 Johnny free from his place just strength
0:27:57 yep okay
0:27:58 spending a blood to be for my strength
0:28:01 spending a willpower
0:28:04 one success
0:28:06 you go to poll and the water the water
0:28:10 tension seems unbreakable and holds them
0:28:12 in place Neil drop it should we really
0:28:15 do that it's fine I'll go no no no no I
0:28:18 don't want anything I just came I start
0:28:20 walking off as soon as when like as the
0:28:23 debate starts as soon as wind says Neil
0:28:25 drop it he drops it immediately
0:28:27 um when forcibly takes Johnny on a walk
0:28:29 I'm sorry I just didn't
0:28:32 it's good
0:28:34 I didn't want anyone to get hurt
0:28:37 and he sort of like sags down into the
0:28:40 presumably now wet bean bag chair just
0:28:43 kind of like
0:28:44 one of us should go get miles
0:28:47 I hope he'll probably listen to you
0:28:49 better than me right now
0:28:51 all right
0:28:53 bear it back okay
0:28:55 I'm not going anywhere
0:28:57 Bretta will head off in what she thinks
0:28:59 is miles's Direction
0:29:04 [Music]
0:29:08 miles as you kind of brewed
0:29:10 walking and pacing and kind of quickly
0:29:12 becoming unsure of where you are in the
0:29:14 woods that's very true you start to hear
0:29:16 a voice
0:29:17 it is as I said
0:29:23 so what will it be
0:29:25 just Johnny finally lost you
0:29:28 it's not that time yet do you finally
0:29:30 see the suffering that your clan causes
0:29:32 the way their grip on power types
0:29:36 slips between their fingers
0:29:39 do you really think
0:29:42 that's a death
0:29:43 of Israel is going to result in any
0:29:46 peace for you
0:29:48 no death ends up in peace there is one
0:29:52 death
0:29:53 that can
0:29:55 your grace
0:29:58 you need but Richard
0:30:01 and what is the cost
0:30:07 now this one's for free miles
0:30:12 a prince
0:30:14 can protect their cautery
0:30:16 can see during their rewarding what they
0:30:19 deserve
0:30:21 can stand against the Sabbath defending
0:30:25 their people
0:30:27 not with cowardice
0:30:30 but with the edge of their blade
0:30:34 and I know how much you relish
0:30:38 the edge of your blade
0:30:41 you just kind of size at the demon
0:30:44 unsure what to say that other than the
0:30:47 thought that the first taste is always
0:30:48 free
0:30:50 one comes to you now
0:30:56 that that Miles looks around to see
0:30:58 who's approaching and you see Brita
0:31:01 her arms are crossed tightly over
0:31:03 herself uh he's right there is that sort
0:31:07 of cautious hope in her eyes that she's
0:31:09 trying to find where Miles went off to
0:31:12 she's heightened her sense of vision in
0:31:15 order to find miles which is good
0:31:17 because I cannot see it all in the dark
0:31:19 well she needs to use the residual light
0:31:23 uh in order to heighten her vision
0:31:26 within it but she's got a little bit of
0:31:29 light coming off from her cell phone
0:31:31 screen and so she's looking around she
0:31:33 spots miles
0:31:35 hey
0:31:37 nice night for a stroll
0:31:40 yeah
0:31:41 I am
0:31:43 kind of wish this was what this was
0:31:46 I mean I don't these shoes are way too
0:31:48 expensive for the woods in the rain
0:31:51 they're they're nice shoes
0:31:53 and they're uh they're ruined yeah well
0:31:58 just been those kind of days
0:32:00 I know that
0:32:03 there's been
0:32:05 I don't know how any of us can keep
0:32:07 perspective of all the terrible [ __ ]
0:32:09 that's happened to all of us and it
0:32:11 makes what happened to you and to Marcos
0:32:14 feel like it happened a while ago but
0:32:17 it didn't it happened recently
0:32:20 and I'm
0:32:21 sorry that that's not being
0:32:23 remembered and with every emergency and
0:32:27 it should be
0:32:28 it's okay he was known to but he wasn't
0:32:32 your friend in the same way
0:32:35 though of all of us who did know him the
0:32:37 best
0:32:40 I don't know how to get through this
0:32:42 either but I know that we're doing this
0:32:44 in order
0:32:46 to have each other as safe as we can
0:32:48 and
0:32:51 it's hard not to get angry with each
0:32:53 other when it all goes against
0:32:55 everything that we're
0:32:56 trying for and everything that we want
0:32:58 to be
0:32:59 visit I'm not angry
0:33:02 not at them not at you guys not for this
0:33:05 I understand that circumstances are
0:33:08 outside of our control and that we have
0:33:09 fight against them but it's not your
0:33:11 fault it's not any of our fault
0:33:14 in the end of the day we need to figure
0:33:16 out how to get through it and what we
0:33:18 want to do to get through it
0:33:20 and that's what I was trying to say
0:33:23 forehead an untimely meeting with a wall
0:33:26 well you've set up pretty well to me so
0:33:31 maybe next time after the practice
0:33:35 um
0:33:36 although winds probably gonna need to
0:33:39 stay with probably me for a bit or
0:33:43 if you need someone there
0:33:46 I don't know what I'm doing yet
0:33:48 yeah we can do whatever you need okay
0:33:54 anyways there's a lot of things going on
0:33:57 and we need to deal with it yeah
0:34:00 but not if we keep coming at each other
0:34:02 like enemies like where the problem
0:34:05 when we come back
0:34:08 just maybe
0:34:10 miles you keep the objective so much
0:34:14 Forefront in your mind
0:34:16 and that's a good thing we need that
0:34:18 that helps lead us through so much but
0:34:21 you know
0:34:23 a lot of us work a lot more with our
0:34:25 hearts
0:34:26 we'll be able to hear it better if you
0:34:28 remember that
0:34:30 in summation I use my heart a lot less I
0:34:34 don't think so
0:34:35 I think that you don't let it show so
0:34:38 much
0:34:41 and I think sometimes people need to see
0:34:43 it too
0:34:44 get that
0:34:46 I'm sorry we couldn't do anything about
0:34:47 your blood bonding I know that doesn't
0:34:49 mean much right now but it should have
0:34:52 been your choice if you wanted it to be
0:34:54 I
0:34:56 came in knowing that I was willing to
0:34:58 pay a lot of prices to try to keep Neil
0:35:00 alive and well this was about keeping
0:35:02 you alive
0:35:04 Prince said that I that he trusts me now
0:35:07 so
0:35:08 that'll help keep me safe
0:35:10 that's true but it shouldn't have been
0:35:12 necessary
0:35:13 maybe it's just the way that it should
0:35:15 have gone I could be better this way
0:35:18 my words stand
0:35:20 thank you
0:35:22 I am
0:35:24 it just helps me see more clearly that
0:35:26 we need to help his grace yeah in these
0:35:29 sets of circumstances you know
0:35:32 limits the options
0:35:34 at least the ones that we can
0:35:36 ultimately discuss
0:35:38 all right
0:35:39 are you ready to try again
0:35:44 I'm always ready
0:35:45 that's true
0:35:48 I'm just not sure if it's going to be
0:35:50 readily accepted but sure lead me back I
0:35:54 have no idea where I am I think part of
0:35:57 being ready is uh you know that
0:35:59 willingness to try again well when would
0:36:01 have had to find me I would have
0:36:03 probably died to sunlight
0:36:05 if I'd gone too far
0:36:07 I'll help you back
0:36:12 [Music]
0:36:15 when miles and Bretta come back both of
0:36:19 their nice Court shoes are ruined and
0:36:21 they find Neil so sprawled out on the
0:36:25 beanie what do you call that it's a bean
0:36:28 bag chair uh and Neil has pulled out
0:36:32 from somewhere or maybe he got it from
0:36:34 wind stuff maybe he had it in his
0:36:36 pockets the whole time somehow who knows
0:36:38 a little pen and like a notepad scrap
0:36:42 paper and he's just writing it doesn't
0:36:46 really react when you guys get back he's
0:36:48 just
0:36:49 like inside his own head
0:36:52 writing bretta's vision is still uh
0:36:55 heightened and at the sense of Neil's
0:36:58 distraction she will look over towards
0:37:00 the page his hand is obscuring a lot of
0:37:02 it but you can definitely still even in
0:37:04 the dark around here see that it just
0:37:06 starts hi everyone it's your friend Neil
0:37:10 Beretta comes closer to read over his
0:37:12 shoulder
0:37:13 pretty clearly Neil trying to order his
0:37:16 thoughts because as his hand moves down
0:37:18 the next sentence says I've written my
0:37:20 thoughts down because sometimes I get
0:37:22 jumbled
0:37:23 the next word is Johnny and then he like
0:37:26 also with his heightened senses can't
0:37:29 quite help but notice that like
0:37:31 someone's looming over reading his
0:37:32 handwriting hey I'm not done yet
0:37:35 sorry and Bretta takes a step back and
0:37:39 acts as if she was not doing the thing
0:37:41 that she was just called up for doing
0:37:42 whether you're better with this help me
0:37:43 see if we can put some of these concrete
0:37:45 blocks in some sort of order
0:37:47 I am do you really think that's gonna
0:37:51 help no
0:37:53 all right
0:37:54 and she agrees to do it
0:37:58 [Music]
0:38:03 when is dragging Johnny what is dragging
0:38:06 Johnny I think Johnny is following wins
0:38:09 when should we make your way deeper into
0:38:11 the woods wind is moving with purpose
0:38:13 she's taking Johnny to a very specific
0:38:15 location a fair of distance away from
0:38:18 the cabin what we're calling charitably
0:38:21 a cabin there's this old huge dead tree
0:38:25 and when let's go of Johnny
0:38:28 this is the punch and tree work some
0:38:30 [ __ ] out could have just left me at the
0:38:32 bar with the tequila you're no good to
0:38:35 me in a bar I don't think I'm good to
0:38:37 anybody right now that's why we're here
0:38:39 at the punching tree cracks of
0:38:41 half-hearted smile
0:38:43 he kind of puts a fist out to the tree
0:38:45 and just kind of touches it raises his
0:38:48 other arm like he's gonna punch and then
0:38:49 just kind of sags
0:38:51 hidden trees really isn't my my gig here
0:38:54 when
0:38:56 when kind of gives him a look like she's
0:38:58 thinking about saying something mean
0:39:01 and thinks better of it the tension in
0:39:03 her shoulders goes a little bit she
0:39:05 comes over and she just wraps him in a
0:39:07 bear hug
0:39:08 thumps his back a couple times
0:39:11 it's a shitty nightmare
0:39:12 yeah
0:39:14 been a hell of a year
0:39:16 yep
0:39:18 we're not done yet
0:39:19 you need me back in the cabin
0:39:22 yep
0:39:23 yep I do
0:39:25 I need my people to be okay and I need
0:39:28 us to be okay together even if it's not
0:39:30 good when we're okay together
0:39:32 it's at least honest
0:39:34 I'll try and be there as best I can
0:39:37 I'll be there to pull you back if you
0:39:39 lose it again man
0:39:41 I was trying to
0:39:43 I was trying to be honest and talk it
0:39:44 out with you guys
0:39:46 I saw
0:39:47 I know I know that you're not my enemies
0:39:52 I'm not gonna treat you guys like
0:39:53 enemies
0:39:55 despite what I did back there
0:39:57 I think sometimes friends take a swing
0:39:59 at each other
0:40:00 I hope so
0:40:02 I mean that's the basis of our
0:40:03 relationship isn't it
0:40:05 we should probably try and try and have
0:40:07 a healthier relationship then yeah we
0:40:09 should probably stay out of the bars so
0:40:11 much
0:40:12 kind of nods his head a little bit
0:40:13 follow you back yep
0:40:16 wind does not seem at all bothered by
0:40:18 the muck and the rain and the distance
0:40:21 from the cabin she knows exactly what's
0:40:24 what
0:40:24 and she leads Johnny back
0:40:29 [Music]
0:40:32 as the rain starts to die down win and
0:40:36 Johnny both return
0:40:38 bread and miles are attempting to put
0:40:42 bricks into a semblance of a functional
0:40:45 wall I imagine the floor is soaking wet
0:40:48 if those manacles did they dissipate
0:40:51 when when pulled them off Neil sort of
0:40:53 waved his hand and they just dissipated
0:40:54 with a splash so I imagine it's a little
0:40:56 crooked this place is on a little slant
0:40:59 it's not really sealed well together but
0:41:02 it's standing and with all that brick
0:41:05 dust and water both The Ventrue and the
0:41:07 torador are usually pretty well put
0:41:09 together
0:41:10 are just absolutely not thriving in the
0:41:13 muck the way that the Gangrel and the
0:41:16 bruja are existing I appreciate the
0:41:19 effort guys
0:41:20 we were thinking that um you'd probably
0:41:23 want to stay somewhere else for a bit
0:41:24 anyways
0:41:25 I can sleep in the ground
0:41:27 Joey knows where this place is and I
0:41:29 don't really want to risk him going
0:41:30 anywhere further from here then I guess
0:41:32 we just gotta bring you some
0:41:35 wall fixing
0:41:37 stuff while fixing stuff correct I'll
0:41:40 figure something out I think this is
0:41:42 what they spackle for but I'm not
0:41:43 entirely sure it was my mistake I'll
0:41:45 make sure it gets fish for you when
0:41:47 it's I appreciate it
0:41:50 okay I have some extra doors
0:41:56 Windows chuckle it's a little unsettling
0:41:58 to hear when you guys get back Neil is
0:42:00 just still kind of sitting in a wet
0:42:02 beanbag chair like hunched over now now
0:42:05 that he like caught Brenda looking over
0:42:07 her shoulder one time writing notes in a
0:42:10 little notebook
0:42:11 can we
0:42:12 start this over a little bit and just
0:42:16 acknowledge that we're here for each
0:42:18 other
0:42:20 uh Neil tries to get up out of the
0:42:22 beanbag chair finds it as impossible as
0:42:25 a gangly six foot tall man getting out
0:42:28 of a beauty mag chair can possibly find
0:42:30 it uh and eventually makes it to his
0:42:32 feet
0:42:32 holds up the notepad to read off of it
0:42:37 hi everyone it's your friend Neil I have
0:42:41 written my thoughts Down Johnny talked
0:42:43 about losing perspective on what's
0:42:45 important to you so I wanted to talk
0:42:47 about what's important to me so you know
0:42:50 why I'm doing what I am these are the
0:42:52 final nights I know you don't want to
0:42:55 maybe hear that or can't believe it yet
0:42:57 but please try and see what I see I
0:43:00 can't help but to see the signs
0:43:01 everywhere all the time let's say for
0:43:05 the sake of argument I'm right the end
0:43:07 is coming the red star Burns why am I
0:43:10 still here what's important to me
0:43:13 you
0:43:15 all of you
0:43:16 I want to fight the apocalypse futile as
0:43:20 it may be side by side with all of you
0:43:23 because I have so little in my life that
0:43:26 isn't bad but I have you
0:43:29 I don't have ambition other than all of
0:43:32 you and Nara so I don't want to lose
0:43:34 this I'll do what I have to to keep it
0:43:38 no matter what I will now take questions
0:43:44 sorry I know this is maybe a little um
0:43:46 weird uh but I I just everybody was
0:43:49 walking away and this keeps happening
0:43:52 um over and over again and
0:43:55 I I
0:43:57 know sometimes we all have different uh
0:43:59 things to um
0:44:01 think about and we have different
0:44:03 perspectives on stuff and I just I
0:44:04 wanted everybody to know
0:44:06 why I'm
0:44:08 so uh
0:44:11 sometimes I I get a little
0:44:14 it's hard to you know stay on one topic
0:44:16 all right all right okay
0:44:19 besides some of that stuff making zero
0:44:22 sense to me
0:44:24 um which part something about a red star
0:44:27 yeah that's new to me too great
0:44:30 um is that important to the next like
0:44:32 two weeks
0:44:34 I do not know the answer to that sounds
0:44:36 like a no hmm
0:44:38 not knowing an answer is not a no um
0:44:40 it's just another sign of gehenna that's
0:44:42 fine great Bretta is self-consciously
0:44:44 running her fingertip over the palm of
0:44:47 her hand within the glove
0:44:51 so I didn't mean to make things
0:44:52 uncomfortable it's just it's not
0:44:54 uncomfortable Neil we just don't have
0:44:55 the words right now we are all
0:44:57 contemplating the things that we want to
0:44:59 say I think to one degree or another
0:45:01 yeah I thought maybe this might act as a
0:45:03 prompt yeah
0:45:04 um
0:45:05 can I make a note
0:45:06 to me yes yeah go ahead uh you're
0:45:09 supposed to use that as like notes for
0:45:12 yourself and not just read straight from
0:45:14 it
0:45:15 just FYI what do you mean
0:45:18 no I wrote myself a thing so I I know I
0:45:20 couldn't help myself sorry
0:45:22 um is it like a script writing note is
0:45:24 that that's a public speaking no
0:45:26 okay
0:45:27 good feedback I guess
0:45:29 where
0:45:31 moving from one not so great thing to
0:45:35 another
0:45:36 for a while now
0:45:38 and was still caught in a web of things
0:45:42 that is calling for us to do things
0:45:46 and the choices aren't clear
0:45:48 and as much as Rowlands was erratic I
0:45:52 believe that was largely played upon by
0:45:55 various outside forces
0:45:58 to do harm to us
0:46:02 do you think maybe
0:46:04 you could appease the sarits by doing
0:46:07 that thing that they wanted you to do
0:46:09 with the key
0:46:11 I mean that was a thing we were
0:46:12 discussing I
0:46:14 I'm not even sure that this isn't a play
0:46:16 by them to get me to do two favors
0:46:18 because I'm not sure that Rowlands can
0:46:20 even take that favor for me but that's
0:46:22 what I'm trying to say is there anything
0:46:24 that could we Dodge this situation by
0:46:28 working with the sarites
0:46:31 [Music]
0:46:32 I'm willing to discuss talk to them I'm
0:46:35 going to have to either way I need to
0:46:36 confirm that this will at least absolve
0:46:39 the favor owed if nothing else
0:46:41 and make sure that's the thing that's on
0:46:44 the table doesn't necessarily mean I
0:46:47 want to do it
0:46:48 I'm not a big fan of giving setites
0:46:51 anything
0:46:52 but they put us in a way that I can't
0:46:56 necessarily just
0:46:58 maneuver around it currently for this to
0:47:01 have gone through when and I we
0:47:04 currently have our names in for
0:47:07 lifeboats
0:47:08 um I hope that that will go down once we
0:47:10 get through this but
0:47:12 I've already said that I'm willing to
0:47:15 risk my life to try to keep me alive so
0:47:20 um
0:47:21 that's how I feel about the situation
0:47:24 that we're in look I don't know Amaro
0:47:26 but she's pissed off the subtites so
0:47:27 that makes her better on my book already
0:47:30 but I also don't know Amara and that is
0:47:34 a factor yet again I'm not really
0:47:37 interested in being somebody else's
0:47:38 mercenary either what if Neil you did
0:47:42 the water thing the the
0:47:45 Medicals that's a simple application of
0:47:48 the Covenant of enki yeah oh okay um
0:47:51 yeah the water magic can you
0:47:54 miles do you think maybe if we brought
0:47:56 Amara alive just for strained like that
0:47:59 maybe they won't kill her that's just us
0:48:02 shifting who's killing her I can't move
0:48:05 her around when she's restrained like
0:48:07 that and I that was it
0:48:11 sort of a sacrifice play
0:48:13 um Johnny's easily strong enough to bust
0:48:16 his way out of them and Amaya is his
0:48:20 clan so johnny makes a sour face and
0:48:24 Pops another cigarette into his mouth I
0:48:26 I just figured if um
0:48:28 yeah worse comes to worse he'd be mad at
0:48:30 me for doing it or being mad at miles
0:48:33 that's what I'm trying to put forwards
0:48:35 is our options
0:48:38 so we can talk about them
0:48:40 um
0:48:41 on topic off topic I I kind of think
0:48:43 miles is Right we've we've been jumping
0:48:45 from you know
0:48:48 corner to corner
0:48:49 um emergency to emergency we've just
0:48:52 been reacting for a long time but
0:48:55 I think that's also to each other
0:48:59 if that makes sense
0:49:01 it's kind of why I I said I I wanted to
0:49:03 say why I'm doing what I'm doing why I'm
0:49:05 here why uh
0:49:07 because
0:49:09 um
0:49:10 I mean we've been doing so much and
0:49:12 we're so exhausted I I'm I I know I am I
0:49:16 everybody else has to be
0:49:17 and I don't want us in all these
0:49:20 emergencies and horrible things that we
0:49:23 have to do
0:49:24 to not recognize why we're doing them
0:49:27 and and why we are doing what we're
0:49:30 doing even if we disagree
0:49:32 I just
0:49:34 I'm here because I
0:49:37 because you guys chose me and I chose
0:49:39 you back
0:49:41 I'm here because I
0:49:43 want to be
0:49:44 because I wouldn't be if it wasn't for
0:49:47 you guys and
0:49:48 I see that in all of us just
0:49:51 watching out for each other and not just
0:49:53 our lives
0:49:54 who we are and
0:49:56 um
0:49:57 yeah
0:49:58 that's why I'm here
0:50:00 ugh
0:50:02 the world's ending and I I I want to be
0:50:05 with
0:50:07 my friends when it happens
0:50:10 uh looking it straight in the eyes and
0:50:12 giving it the finger uh
0:50:16 I don't want to just quietly have it
0:50:18 happen while I'm alone
0:50:20 I've had my own life to choose who I
0:50:23 want to be knowing that that choice
0:50:25 might not last long so I
0:50:28 choosing to be a part of this
0:50:30 Brita kind of looks around inviting
0:50:32 people to
0:50:34 speak to that as well
0:50:36 there's quite a few moves tonight that
0:50:38 have been made that may have been
0:50:41 smarter than they originally intended
0:50:42 which limits some of the options that we
0:50:44 can discuss
0:50:46 but
0:50:47 I've risked quite a few things
0:50:51 and will continue to risk them to keep
0:50:53 the rest of you safe
0:50:55 and what you care about safe
0:50:58 and it's come at a cost
0:51:00 miles how loud is the voice in your head
0:51:03 depends on the moment
0:51:05 okay
0:51:06 I'm just checking in
0:51:08 but it's a near-constant presence
0:51:11 it's
0:51:12 been weirdly comforting at this time
0:51:15 that makes sense wait comforting I'm
0:51:18 never alone
0:51:20 this tape friendly
0:51:23 he'll pretend to be
0:51:25 here's what he is
0:51:27 if he is even appropriate but I
0:51:30 understand the nature and I can
0:51:32 appreciate it I just don't forget
0:51:35 um it will tell you the truth
0:51:37 when it serves it and it will lie when
0:51:40 it serves it and it will tell you the
0:51:42 truth exactly enough to make you think
0:51:44 it knows everything so that when it says
0:51:47 something that's a lie you'll believe it
0:51:49 last week I know we've talked about that
0:51:51 just so don't trust it got it oh no not
0:51:54 ever not ever
0:51:56 even if it has completely true answers
0:52:00 don't trust it right
0:52:04 we have the we have the new audio
0:52:07 and we have the Sabbat
0:52:10 and we need to figure out what's going
0:52:11 on with Jaden Suarez yeah we need to
0:52:13 make sure she's okay
0:52:16 um
0:52:16 is veto part of the Sabbat or is that
0:52:18 still a different problem because he was
0:52:20 creeping on Roto like a few weeks ago I
0:52:23 mean he's around I know but
0:52:26 well I'm just thinking of solvable
0:52:27 problems I know it's just I'm trying to
0:52:31 deal with the the currently staring in
0:52:34 his face ones not the ones just waiting
0:52:36 for the moment when we're weakest
0:52:39 do we have to deal with veto now sooner
0:52:41 the better I mean we have a little time
0:52:43 before the other ones if we can find him
0:52:45 I could find him yeah I think I I mean
0:52:50 I've never done it but um there's this
0:52:53 feeling like I could call his name and
0:52:55 he would come I don't know how to
0:52:58 describe it better it just gives you a
0:53:00 wary eye like um like we were afraid of
0:53:03 Pendragon doing to us
0:53:05 yeah
0:53:07 like that I mean else is your Mentor
0:53:10 right or Ally she was willing to give me
0:53:14 a shot and help me do what I did at
0:53:17 court I what do you ask I'm just that's
0:53:21 a well-known thing that people
0:53:24 possessing the power that Venture and
0:53:28 others have called summoning I think I
0:53:32 might be able to do it yeah better looks
0:53:35 to Johnny at the caution in his face
0:53:37 I
0:53:39 don't know anything about it obviously
0:53:41 it's just I if we really needed to find
0:53:43 him I mean we do
0:53:45 I mean what are we gonna do with him
0:53:47 currently we're supposed to give him
0:53:49 give him over to Rhys is there a reason
0:53:51 not to letting Reiss have something he
0:53:53 wants pretty much that but it solves the
0:53:56 problem Maybe
0:53:58 I'm not a fan of giving Rhys anything he
0:54:00 wants but I'm also not a fan of a rogue
0:54:02 flesh crafter running around New Haven
0:54:05 I'd rather give Vito to the justicar
0:54:07 personally oh that's where the archon
0:54:10 wanted him at some point before dealing
0:54:12 with Shaw for dealing with Shaw and
0:54:13 that's not really it doesn't matter I
0:54:15 still think the dress car would be the
0:54:16 best place to handle him that was the
0:54:18 whole reason that we kept him alive
0:54:20 could we always and I kept him alive
0:54:23 that sin Falls in my head could we give
0:54:26 them
0:54:27 could we give him a pen dragon
0:54:29 it's technically what he was for and it
0:54:32 might be a minor appeasement at least
0:54:35 keep him in the neutral looking at us
0:54:37 I'm not even sure how we would capture
0:54:39 him stick him to the heart he's a
0:54:41 kindred right but he does that thing
0:54:44 where he goes through the drains and
0:54:46 becomes all bloody I can do that too
0:54:49 it's not that big a parlor trick
0:54:52 I'm more of a Mist but oh
0:54:56 um right but I get the idea that he can
0:54:57 shape his body yeah but uh so how do we
0:55:01 know where his heart is why are we
0:55:03 thinking about taking him on physically
0:55:05 what a well I mean if British if Brita
0:55:09 asks him to come he'll come and then
0:55:11 the rest of us could be ready to uh
0:55:13 mostly because I can't guarantee other
0:55:15 things will work I could tell him that I
0:55:17 want him to teach me the blood
0:55:20 stuff you could tell him to just go to
0:55:23 Elysium that's true I could summon him
0:55:25 and just say that I want him to go
0:55:27 somewhere but I don't think he would if
0:55:28 he thought that would endanger him also
0:55:30 maybe I mean there's already enough
0:55:32 about rumors going around with our
0:55:34 friend group
0:55:35 um maybe we don't send because it's a
0:55:38 BNC fleshcrafter to Elysium all right
0:55:41 maybe we arrange a meeting of folks
0:55:45 skilled in maybe we invite pen Dragon
0:55:47 over if I touch him I can mess up his
0:55:49 blood at least a little bit regardless
0:55:52 that's not I mean we're talking about
0:55:54 these things but in reality other than
0:55:56 not wanting him running around does not
0:55:59 it's not I'm sorry to say overly
0:56:02 pressing in some ways he's not actively
0:56:04 battling or fighting against us no my
0:56:06 Plumbing issues are a tomorrow problem
0:56:09 can we I also wouldn't be completely
0:56:12 surprised if we know exactly where he is
0:56:15 right now in that house back in the
0:56:17 house tending to the thing that probably
0:56:20 owns him right and we don't know what
0:56:23 will happen if he stops doing whatever
0:56:25 he does with that thing so we would need
0:56:27 to be prepared to deal with that thing
0:56:29 also the domain I mean has known about
0:56:31 that thing and kind of covered that up
0:56:33 quietly for a while hasn't it yep
0:56:37 I mean I don't want to masquerade bridge
0:56:39 but
0:56:40 maybe people will take things seriously
0:56:43 if it I don't know good I don't know
0:56:46 I know we wanted to burn the house down
0:56:47 I've still
0:56:49 a place freaks me out it should Arabella
0:56:51 is convinced that burning the place down
0:56:54 wouldn't do anything anyways
0:56:55 it's not like any of us get directed
0:56:57 into the sun right so that's why I
0:56:59 wanted to focus on the things that we
0:57:00 possibly have answers for right now I
0:57:03 think
0:57:04 if you want my opinion
0:57:06 um
0:57:07 we could use a proactive win not that we
0:57:10 haven't been getting wins I'm alive
0:57:11 you're the central none of us is dead
0:57:14 yet
0:57:15 um but the status not a win
0:57:17 I'm a proactive win Johnny cracks an
0:57:21 honest smile for a second I was waiting
0:57:22 for I thought it was to set up but I'm
0:57:24 glad you okay I you set him up I knock
0:57:26 him down buddy great great
0:57:28 um we need to start I mean the prince
0:57:30 also on top of the ordeal is complicated
0:57:35 but we have a little bit of time
0:57:37 although the longer we wait
0:57:39 the narrower options are going to become
0:57:42 but we can at least take a few nights to
0:57:43 think about it in the meantime the
0:57:46 prince also asked charged you San Angelo
0:57:49 with dealing with a spot in the city and
0:57:51 we need to do that to prove to you know
0:57:54 Stave off Pendragon either way
0:57:56 it's gonna take a lot you know we're not
0:57:58 gonna be able to do it in one time but
0:58:00 it Pendragon did have a point you know
0:58:03 what if we go and we Face Down the sabot
0:58:06 and I mean not to be morbid but I think
0:58:10 that has the very real possibility of
0:58:13 removing our choice about Amaya anyway
0:58:15 and if we have to do it and we have to
0:58:17 do it as a group and we all know that
0:58:18 we're gonna do that together
0:58:20 maybe that first
0:58:22 fighting the Sabbat not all of them at
0:58:24 once but taking a swing that's what I
0:58:27 meant by Pendragon had a point hit and
0:58:30 run tactics and
0:58:32 using a little bit of their own medicine
0:58:33 against them this is our city they're
0:58:35 nested around but we know it better we
0:58:38 can move through the tunnels we know
0:58:40 what we're doing at least a little one
0:58:42 or two at a time at least make them
0:58:44 afraid the way that they've been making
0:58:45 everybody else and then a man afraid we
0:58:48 have a month to solve your ordeal right
0:58:50 yeah we have a month and there's the
0:58:53 entire possibility that in that month
0:58:56 if we're waiting Amaya will either
0:58:59 come and and kill me uh proactively you
0:59:03 know which I completely understand or uh
0:59:05 she will beat feet and get out of town
0:59:07 uh which is a failed ordeal
0:59:10 um it's possible but I am fine waiting a
0:59:13 little bit
0:59:14 at least to talk that's my point I don't
0:59:16 think we should wait long before solving
0:59:19 this Brita has a point though if um if
0:59:22 we go to try and deal with this bot and
0:59:24 I'm not an issue anymore then none of
0:59:26 this is an issue and you can all still
0:59:28 hang out and be fine so maybe I can get
0:59:32 Amaya back the same way that I'm not
0:59:34 sure you've never met her right yeah it
0:59:37 doesn't feel the same I think the first
0:59:39 step should still be talking to the
0:59:41 settings we need to confirm with that
0:59:43 but what kind of person is a liar
0:59:47 she's a
0:59:49 a true anarch Baron
0:59:51 she cares about the well-being of her
0:59:53 people
0:59:54 trying to do what's right
0:59:56 fighting for the small bit of land the
0:59:59 anarchs have managed to carve out for
1:00:00 themselves
1:00:01 she doesn't believe on trampling people
1:00:04 for the sake of the Jihad
1:00:06 I haven't seen her in a while but I get
1:00:08 the feeling that she's the kind of bruja
1:00:10 that doesn't forget those ideals is
1:00:13 there something she'd die for
1:00:15 I don't know about that
1:00:18 miles if you talk to the setites um
1:00:20 here's a question maybe to keep in mind
1:00:23 uh why are they poaching taking over or
1:00:27 killing all of the anarchs I mean I can
1:00:30 ask them but they're probably not gonna
1:00:31 tell me well don't ask them directly but
1:00:33 you know you're political I'll see what
1:00:35 I can do
1:00:36 if we knew why they were doing this what
1:00:39 they even wanted but it seems like many
1:00:41 of the Onyx based on the information we
1:00:43 have have turned to the setites promises
1:00:46 I can take a guess yeah
1:00:49 the satellites
1:00:51 just like the anarchs are smaller
1:00:54 independent groups kindred
1:00:56 starting a war with the anarchs is a
1:01:00 battle that can win without stirring up
1:01:03 a nest like something of the camarilla
1:01:04 or this or the Sabbat that's territory
1:01:07 and bodies they can claim and add to
1:01:11 their own cause
1:01:13 I think it's just a land grab a while
1:01:15 ago now we brought them a lot of guns
1:01:18 we know they're trying to defend
1:01:20 themselves or attack someone you gotta
1:01:22 remember you got it mixed up girl they
1:01:25 brought us weapons oh
1:01:27 sorry it's
1:01:29 memory and I it's been a busy couple of
1:01:32 months no and I seem to be subverting
1:01:35 not going to war
1:01:37 that's a form of War it's a lot less
1:01:40 bloody and it seems to be working well
1:01:42 they're winning them over through they
1:01:44 kill the ones they can't convert they
1:01:46 convert the rest they can Amaya's the
1:01:48 last one that was the word right I'm
1:01:50 sure there's a few other anarchs with
1:01:52 her I can't believe that she's on her
1:01:54 own I would have to think she's just the
1:01:56 only one of note left I don't know
1:01:59 I mean she might be alone in the world I
1:02:02 got no idea right
1:02:04 so questions
1:02:05 a lot of questions can we start with
1:02:09 miles you going to talk to them the
1:02:11 sarits and seeing if there's maybe
1:02:14 anything more to this or any deal that
1:02:16 we could make I will talk to the
1:02:17 settings and confirm whether what we
1:02:20 heard is true or not
1:02:22 let's see what other information we can
1:02:23 gather other than possibly learning
1:02:26 about what's going on with the anarchs
1:02:28 and Amaya I also like to table that for
1:02:31 a second and deal with the thing and for
1:02:33 a person that we know we need to see
1:02:36 what's going on with Jane she's helped
1:02:38 us out in numerous amount of times
1:02:40 she's missing it does it does seem like
1:02:42 the most pressing issue and it seemed
1:02:44 like she may be in trouble you were
1:02:46 saying something about Suarez we should
1:02:47 figure out what's going on and that is
1:02:49 something that we can do and something
1:02:52 that we should do
1:02:54 Johnny kind of nods slowly and and gives
1:02:57 you a very
1:02:59 thankful and honest kind of look when he
1:03:04 does so and Suarez is a good person we
1:03:07 dealt with him I tried to deal with him
1:03:10 in a way that would
1:03:12 keep the Masquerade intact but we're
1:03:15 going to be left with a few choices if
1:03:16 he's if it's not taken his will was
1:03:19 strong so it may have done things to him
1:03:22 too
1:03:23 the I've always thought the methods that
1:03:25 you've used for that have been a little
1:03:27 sloppy but I've never questioned the
1:03:29 effectiveness of it I'm really surprised
1:03:31 that he's he was good so we may need to
1:03:36 if you do to keep him alive he may need
1:03:39 to be brought in
1:03:40 I'm not sure how we're gonna find him
1:03:42 I can work on that and Johnny could
1:03:45 bring him in not not bring him in
1:03:48 physically I mean bring him into our
1:03:50 world that's what I mean we have
1:03:52 permission Oh I thought you meant like
1:03:53 cooling him putting him into the no
1:03:56 either way works it's really up to him
1:03:58 okay maybe present him with a choice
1:04:01 well because otherwise if he continues
1:04:04 this line of thought and pursuit we're
1:04:06 not
1:04:07 we're not going to be left with a lot of
1:04:08 options and I'd rather not remove a good
1:04:11 person in this world for asking
1:04:12 questions
1:04:13 yeah
1:04:14 yeah
1:04:15 so
1:04:16 some some thoughts there but that is
1:04:19 something we can concretely move on and
1:04:21 do something about and help a person
1:04:22 that has helped us absolutely let's do
1:04:25 that let's do that let's start there and
1:04:26 we can gather information on other
1:04:28 things so
1:04:31 Bob movements and about Amaya and what's
1:04:34 going on there we want to know
1:04:35 information we need information if we're
1:04:38 going to find some other solution to
1:04:39 this when everything feels overwhelming
1:04:42 um one bite at a time right one little
1:04:44 one thing at a time and we can we can do
1:04:46 it town and eats a buffalo
1:04:48 is that how that phrase goes yeah okay
1:04:51 that's a lot
1:04:52 yeah it's a lot of Buffalo yeah
1:04:55 one bite at a time
1:04:57 okay so we have a con we have a set of
1:05:00 things we can try to look at now when
1:05:02 weather's left tonight
1:05:05 he
1:05:06 made mention of the fact that
1:05:09 you wanted to start fighting for the
1:05:10 things that he believed in again
1:05:13 don't know if I
1:05:15 knew exactly what he meant and I still
1:05:17 don't know if I know exactly what he
1:05:19 means
1:05:20 but when I walked away from him there
1:05:23 people were avoiding me as I walked down
1:05:25 the street
1:05:27 it was an uncomfortable feeling because
1:05:29 they were making way for something
1:05:32 terrifying
1:05:35 think I'm forgetting what's important to
1:05:38 me
1:05:39 and through all this
1:05:41 I think I'm starting to remember
1:05:44 there are a lot of people
1:05:46 working to different ends in the
1:05:49 Northeast right now
1:05:51 Longbow the Gemini League
1:05:55 Sabbat
1:05:56 satites anarchs
1:05:59 premiere
1:06:00 I want to protect
1:06:03 my allies my friends and my family
1:06:09 and if somebody puts me against one of
1:06:11 those people
1:06:12 those are the ones I'm going to push
1:06:14 back against this might mean we go into
1:06:18 some hard fights and some fights that
1:06:20 might not even be winnable
1:06:22 a lot of these fights are not going to
1:06:23 be able to be fought with fists or
1:06:26 crowbars or katanas or high-powered
1:06:29 rifles we're gonna have to be smart I'm
1:06:32 really bad at that
1:06:33 you all are very important to me
1:06:36 I might get upset with you but none of
1:06:39 you are my enemies
1:06:41 people who are putting me at odds with
1:06:44 you and other allies of mine
1:06:46 those are my enemies
1:06:49 if you can if you all can count on one
1:06:51 thing
1:06:52 that's as simple as it is with me Greta
1:06:55 give Shawnee like a very quiet grateful
1:06:58 smile
1:06:59 not wind gives an approving nod when
1:07:03 Johnny mentions I'm here to fight for
1:07:05 the things that I believe in and that's
1:07:08 why I'm here Neil gives sort of a an

1:08:18 [Music]
1:08:26 well win would have had to find me I
1:08:28 would have probably died to sunlight
1:08:31 if I'd gone too far
1:08:33 I'll help you back
1:08:34 so that was really funny because it's a
1:08:36 small
1:08:40 forests
1:08:43 look that is a two-day roll for me yeah
1:08:46 and I have no glasses right now yeah
1:08:49 what do you roll uh that would probably
1:08:52 be with survival to get your way out so
1:08:55 I have three wits and no survival so
1:08:57 that's a minus one it's too nice and no
1:09:00 I and my perception checks are down
1:09:02 higher difficulty for trying to get out
1:09:04 my perception checks all right one die
1:09:07 with the rain and the fact that there's
1:09:09 probably snow in the ground like foggy
1:09:11 the rain causes a minus two times two I
1:09:13 would die I would die to sunlight
1:09:16 well Smiles needs to not be what doing
1:09:19 what he's doing it is simply the end
1:09:24 and I know myself
1:09:26 what happened to that political
1:09:28 Powerhouse no he just wandered into the
1:09:30 like yeah he got lost in the woods he
1:09:33 got lost city yeah I know
1:09:36 it was a park
1:09:38 she kept going in circles where's my son
1:09:40 of Shaw I wish you speak to him he died
1:09:42 in the woods my Lord
1:09:44 horrible fate
1:09:47 I've lost too many Center shots this way
1:09:52 Heavens forbid I never find myself
1:09:56 damn right
