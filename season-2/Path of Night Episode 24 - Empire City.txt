0:00:00 path of night is an actual play vampire
0:00:01 the masquerade podcast set in the
0:00:03 classic world of darkness we're all
0:00:05 friends we're here to have fun but our
0:00:06 story can include graphic violence drug
0:00:08 use sexual content and other mature
0:00:11 themes we've talked at our table about
0:00:12 safety comfort and consent both as
0:00:14 players and storytellers we know what to
0:00:16 expect we're all excited to be here and
0:00:18 we want you to feel the same so listener
0:00:20 discretion is advised
0:00:21 now let's walk the path of night
0:00:25 last time on path of night
0:00:27 the quarterly rallied at miles's haven
0:00:29 to prepare for their trip to new york
0:00:31 city so that they can pick up a
0:00:32 mysterious acquaintance of kabirs
0:00:35 as they prepared archon peterson arrived
0:00:37 alongside a woman named lucida to
0:00:40 reclaim the hunting box left in miles
0:00:42 care and to take the ventrue's midnight
0:00:45 blue ferrari
0:00:46 soon after the group hits the road
0:00:48 headed to new york
0:00:50 [Music]
0:00:53 the van takes off
0:00:55 and
0:00:56 together
0:00:57 the Coterie
0:00:58 has small talk listens to music on more
0:01:02 than one occasion the group of you find
0:01:03 yourselves actually singing along
0:01:06 at a certain point you cross the state
0:01:09 border and
0:01:10 it's around then
0:01:12 that all of you
0:01:14 get the feeling that kindred get when
0:01:16 they are far from the safety of their
0:01:17 havens their boons and allies
0:01:21 and you descend into what you know
0:01:24 is territory that is controlled by the
0:01:26 sabbath
0:01:28 yeah so uh
0:01:30 i mean i always kind of imagined that if
0:01:32 i
0:01:34 didn't end up being embraced you know
0:01:35 maybe i would actually get onto the
0:01:37 radio or something like do like a radio
0:01:38 morning show and i'd be like the johnny
0:01:40 the hound or johnny kung foo's you know
0:01:42 some kind of like you know
0:01:44 weird
0:01:45 morning persona i don't know johnny kung
0:01:48 fu huh yeah
0:01:49 i mean he spent a lot of time on the
0:01:51 road i mean
0:01:52 leaves impressions
0:01:54 that'd be pretty cool i'd listen to it i
0:01:57 don't know i haven't really listened to
0:01:58 music since woodstock i haven't really
0:02:00 gotten into a whole lot
0:02:01 um
0:02:02 like not at all
0:02:04 oh no i've listened to it like it comes
0:02:05 on i just haven't found anything that
0:02:07 kind of like
0:02:09 inspired me since woodstock miles
0:02:11 weren't you like a music producer before
0:02:13 uh you were embraced why were using the
0:02:15 past tense oh wow i suppose you you
0:02:18 still have your uh your your little
0:02:19 Ventrue claws and all that kind of world
0:02:21 huh i'm still doing productions how do
0:02:23 you think i keep track of musicians and
0:02:25 such never really kind of put that
0:02:27 together but that makes sense yes i'm
0:02:28 still involved in that and still putting
0:02:30 together but i've
0:02:32 less of a public face than i used to be
0:02:34 but i make deals happen
0:02:38 does leaving always
0:02:40 feel like this
0:02:42 she's looking at johnny as yes
0:02:44 to be honest i uh i try not to think
0:02:46 about it too much
0:02:48 honestly most most a bit thing about
0:02:50 driving
0:02:51 is just
0:02:52 being aware of what's going on ahead of
0:02:55 the ahead of you it's just awareness and
0:02:57 putting yourself into the right
0:02:59 situation
0:03:00 so it's just a lot of forethought and
0:03:02 planning out your route and then just
0:03:04 being casual about it
0:03:07 in the back of your head there is that
0:03:10 worry
0:03:10 it's weird because i didn't i used to go
0:03:13 to new york city all the time
0:03:15 and it never really bothered me
0:03:17 and now
0:03:18 when the border crossing sign happens
0:03:21 it's like a whole different world it's
0:03:24 like part of me is just
0:03:26 happy to get some space between the
0:03:28 problems back home i guess but the other
0:03:31 part of me is thinking about
0:03:33 well
0:03:34 everything else
0:03:35 yeah i i don't think i have it as bad as
0:03:38 you guys gangrel wander and as long as
0:03:41 there's ground
0:03:42 around i'm safe from the sun so i mean
0:03:45 it's
0:03:46 i get it
0:03:47 being far from home
0:03:49 but i don't know that it's any worse for
0:03:51 me right now than any other time
0:03:53 do you think will
0:03:55 be followed
0:03:56 no i think uh
0:03:58 you know considering the the uh the
0:04:00 vehicle we're in
0:04:01 the fact that we're just moving along on
0:04:03 the highway sabot territory is never fun
0:04:05 to travel through but uh
0:04:07 it takes them a little bit to
0:04:09 organize and
0:04:11 track down so you don't think that
0:04:14 Britta just kind of looks down uh at her
0:04:17 hands and she rings them for a second
0:04:19 before she says
0:04:21 if
0:04:22 if vito were following us this would be
0:04:25 a good time to get some allies
0:04:29 yeah
0:04:30 well
0:04:31 i don't think he's gonna follow us
0:04:34 very honestly i don't think he's gonna
0:04:36 go too far from that house
0:04:38 he did seem to have a connection he was
0:04:39 very worried about it before we took him
0:04:42 out of there
0:04:43 speaking of which we we really do have
0:04:45 to get back to that house sooner than
0:04:47 later
0:04:48 i was wondering if during the time
0:04:50 period when if you had looked in it upon
0:04:52 it or heard anything from raven
0:04:55 nothing about the house no
0:04:57 and i didn't want to go back on my own
0:04:59 it's
0:05:00 i wasn't sure
0:05:01 the spiritual landscape there isn't safe
0:05:03 for anything and um
0:05:05 it's not a place to go alone it was
0:05:07 always something i
0:05:08 meant to deal with but with veto
0:05:11 escaping it's been difficult to nail
0:05:14 down
0:05:15 i mean what can we really do about that
0:05:16 house you think it would even if we had
0:05:19 enough to get rid of it explosives or
0:05:22 fire or vito didn't think that would
0:05:24 make a difference though he might have
0:05:26 been bluffing exactly
0:05:28 i think
0:05:29 i think if it's something that's
0:05:30 survived this long i think
0:05:32 it's going to take a lot more than just
0:05:34 physical fire i was hoping that raven
0:05:36 might have some more information since
0:05:38 it was one of her major projects it
0:05:39 seems like i can talk to her about it
0:05:43 and according to
0:05:45 other information nyx might be helpful
0:05:47 in locating vito we do need to talk to
0:05:50 next at some point yes i'd really like
0:05:53 that she's the malc for imogen she is
0:05:56 the permagen of the malcavians it seems
0:05:58 to
0:05:59 make other mulcavians
0:06:01 uncomfortable from what i've heard maybe
0:06:04 she'd be more open to it now that you're
0:06:06 a primogen too
0:06:07 maybe
0:06:08 worth having a discussion with her for
0:06:10 now
0:06:11 i mean we have to figure out what to do
0:06:13 about the house but also what to do
0:06:15 about well to be honest
0:06:17 after johnny you
0:06:19 turned him and everything i kind of
0:06:20 thought i suppose if we get him
0:06:23 well where are we
0:06:25 bringing him to
0:06:27 veto yeah i definitely thought we'd have
0:06:29 him more under control but honestly i
0:06:32 feel like bringing him back to my place
0:06:33 is probably the safest option right but
0:06:35 he's got to go somewhere a lot of people
0:06:37 want him we got to figure out who we're
0:06:39 giving him to
0:06:40 right i think the best best is to try
0:06:43 and give him the have your sire deal
0:06:45 with him that's going to mean political
0:06:48 [ __ ] [ __ ] in the domain though
0:06:50 because people in the domain want him
0:06:52 really it's just Reiss last time i
0:06:55 checked so it's Reiss
0:06:57 my sire are the last two people that i
0:06:59 know that are wanting him though Reiss
0:07:01 doesn't still have anything over you
0:07:03 right win not me
0:07:05 well if Reiss wants him
0:07:07 that would mean that his grace wants him
0:07:09 as well not necessarily i mean he would
0:07:12 back whatever Reiss wanted but Rowlands
0:07:15 doesn't seem to really care as long as
0:07:17 the problem is dealt with i mean it
0:07:18 would make sense for the prince to want
0:07:20 Reiss to study him veda was saying that
0:07:23 thing needed feeding right i believe
0:07:25 he's still going back to that house yes
0:07:27 i think that's that house is how we're
0:07:29 gonna is one of two ways we're gonna
0:07:31 figure out where he is
0:07:33 i just i'm not sure what's down there
0:07:36 and i'm very inclined to just
0:07:38 light it all on fire even if he did say
0:07:40 it wasn't going to work i just
0:07:42 i don't know i mean to be fair the main
0:07:45 the main reason we wanted veto in the
0:07:46 first place was as leverage against shaw
0:07:49 shaw's no longer in the picture
0:07:51 taking veto out might be the best thing
0:07:53 to do at this point
0:07:55 if he can be taken out i'm pretty sure
0:07:57 we all can die with the right tools yeah
0:08:00 i have very strong concerns facing him
0:08:03 again yeah i can imagine no we need to
0:08:06 pick our own grounds this time last time
0:08:08 was
0:08:09 a surprise was it i mean we walked in
0:08:11 looking to apprehend him
0:08:13 right but the fight had gotten
0:08:16 chaotic we had spread out and stumbled
0:08:19 upon him without us all being grouped up
0:08:21 and still dealing with the different
0:08:22 issues i think it would have been
0:08:24 different if we'd been i'm starting to
0:08:26 walk together
0:08:27 yeah
0:08:28 if the books
0:08:29 the copies that he had might have some
0:08:32 information on how to destroy the thing
0:08:34 in the basement that's worth a shot i
0:08:36 can definitely start perusing those with
0:08:38 a little more earnestness definitely not
0:08:41 my area i i think
0:08:44 if you look into those you should do it
0:08:46 with us around i don't think it's a
0:08:48 smart idea to be reading whatever pages
0:08:50 he was squirreling away by yourself i'm
0:08:54 pretty much solidly of the opinion that
0:08:56 none of us should be doing anything by
0:08:58 ourselves right now
0:09:00 that's true we've talked multiple times
0:09:02 about being on the buddy system so we
0:09:03 should continue to do so
0:09:05 yeah all right it makes sense to look
0:09:07 into the book and to consider whether or
0:09:09 not
0:09:10 veto's worth more dead or alive but well
0:09:13 between the two options which one
0:09:15 actually helps us
0:09:17 i mean
0:09:18 Reiss
0:09:19 who knows why Reiss wants him probably
0:09:21 to figure out what kind of magic he has
0:09:24 going on or what kind of
0:09:26 wood he's got going on
0:09:28 i thought your sire miles wanted him so
0:09:30 that he could apprehend shaw so is he
0:09:33 still even interested in him no i'm not
0:09:36 entirely sure i think he still might be
0:09:38 of interest but i planned on asking him
0:09:41 next time i saw him you saw how well
0:09:43 that went yeah that was a weird
0:09:45 interaction tonight shaw
0:09:47 wanted him because he was full of
0:09:49 information right
0:09:50 getting rid of him
0:09:52 is a good thing
0:09:54 but
0:09:55 it does turn off that type of
0:09:57 information but
0:09:59 information is always a double-edged
0:10:01 sword
0:10:02 we're also not entirely sure whose side
0:10:05 he's on
0:10:06 in
0:10:07 a way if we can get him to turn against
0:10:10 let's say the killing spree and such
0:10:12 like that it would be
0:10:14 not a bad ally to have
0:10:16 we've seen the things that he can do
0:10:18 i think if we have a chance at turning
0:10:20 him i think Britta's our best option
0:10:22 don't want him involved in whatever
0:10:24 weird flesh magic he has them well he
0:10:26 was talk that that pile of flesh he was
0:10:29 keeping in the basement of that thing he
0:10:31 referred to it as a god
0:10:33 i don't think that it's gonna be easy
0:10:35 changing the mind of a zealot i don't
0:10:37 think we have to change his mind i i
0:10:40 think he's a survivalist at heart so
0:10:42 we'll see if there's anything we can get
0:10:44 gained from having him around
0:10:46 or
0:10:47 passing him off if it's a thing we want
0:10:49 to try to do but having him be a
0:10:52 temporary ally if nothing else may also
0:10:55 work
0:10:56 his allegiances don't seem to be to
0:10:59 neither the camera or the sabbat i think
0:11:01 his allegiance is fully to the thing in
0:11:02 that basement that is my understanding
0:11:04 also which would mean he would do
0:11:06 anything to prevent us getting to it i
0:11:08 think if we showed up at that house and
0:11:10 waited i think he'd we'd eventually run
0:11:12 into him i think so yeah but
0:11:15 i hate that we can never set the stage
0:11:18 for our dealings with him i mean
0:11:20 we also
0:11:21 don't know what the thing he was
0:11:23 guarding is actually capable i mean he
0:11:25 referred to it as a god so
0:11:27 i mean typical sabbat [ __ ] we'll see
0:11:30 what the book says what you have from
0:11:32 maybe it'll lead to some clues see if we
0:11:34 can't get more information on that maybe
0:11:37 veto will be more forthcoming the next
0:11:38 time he decides to pull his
0:11:40 drainpipe act Britta's self-consciously
0:11:43 running her fingertips over the spot on
0:11:45 her palm where there's still
0:11:48 a lot of ink remaining from the crescent
0:11:50 so step one read the book let's see
0:11:52 where we can go from there i will see if
0:11:55 anybody is
0:11:56 still wanting i believe Reiss still
0:11:59 wanted him
0:12:00 for whatever reasons but i'm not
0:12:03 inclined to give Reiss anything that he
0:12:04 wants pretty much ever fair i mean
0:12:08 it depends on what you could get from it
0:12:10 right like on a
0:12:11 playing the jihad and all right
0:12:14 if it provides usefulness but i do not
0:12:17 Reiss is always going to give me the
0:12:19 lesser of the deal and i'm not
0:12:20 interested in that half the i'd rather
0:12:22 give him nothing than not get equal
0:12:24 you'll get better at that as things go
0:12:26 we'll see Reiss is an old douchebag with
0:12:28 no morals
0:12:30 you have some morals you're always going
0:12:32 to be at the disadvantage with him
0:12:35 i like to set my own boards
0:12:36 i won't necessarily play the same game
0:12:38 as him i'll change the terms i don't
0:12:40 think any of us are all playing the same
0:12:42 game you met with him in the night right
0:12:45 yeah
0:12:46 what was it about he wanted me to be his
0:12:48 apprentice for what blood magic but
0:12:50 you're not a chemir isn't that a isn't
0:12:53 that their thing i mean neil learned
0:12:55 blood magic sometimes
0:12:58 rarely ventrue can
0:13:00 learn magics from the premiere so he
0:13:01 wanted you to be his apprentice huh yes
0:13:04 he wanted me to stop talking bad about
0:13:06 him
0:13:07 would you tell him he gave me a book but
0:13:10 essentially i told him no but you have
0:13:13 this book yeah it's somewhere do you
0:13:15 have it on you now no it's some weird
0:13:18 book with a rose on it i couldn't read
0:13:20 it
0:13:21 was it a rose like
0:13:23 anything to do with my clan i did not
0:13:25 recognize it
0:13:26 okay i mean while i'm
0:13:28 reading obscure books i can throw that
0:13:30 on the pile i mean if you want i don't
0:13:33 uh premiere is giving you secret
0:13:35 knowledge i
0:13:37 feel like that's worth prying into a
0:13:39 little bit that's um
0:13:41 feel free to look in the book just
0:13:43 fill me on why don't you find out but
0:13:45 i'm not inclined to take his offer he
0:13:46 wants me
0:13:47 he either wants me to shut up or he
0:13:49 wants me to keep talking and i'm not
0:13:50 entirely sure his game right now because
0:13:52 he came at me strong and he knew i
0:13:54 wasn't going to respond well if he was
0:13:56 upset about you talking bad about him i
0:13:58 mean that could really be a courtly
0:14:00 matter at the end of the day right
0:14:02 possibly i think there's some sort of
0:14:05 there's something between him and roland
0:14:06 some sort of relationship that i haven't
0:14:08 fully figured out yet and i'm not sure
0:14:10 if that's what's upsetting him or if he
0:14:12 wants me to talk bad in a way to set me
0:14:14 up to take me down later
0:14:16 so i'll be looking into that also johnny
0:14:18 is this the exit no we're looking at the
0:14:20 next one okay we could take here but
0:14:22 it's going to be faster to get to where
0:14:24 we want to go i trust you man oh when i
0:14:26 tend to be pretty good with books and
0:14:28 that sort of thing maybe i could help
0:14:30 yeah all right after a long trip a
0:14:32 little bit you get to queens and
0:14:35 find yourselves pulling up to
0:14:37 jfk
0:14:39 it's got tons of activity it's almost a
0:14:42 little disconcerting
0:14:44 how hard it is to keep track of
0:14:46 everything that's going on
0:14:48 are we really gonna hold up that sign
0:14:51 yep
0:14:52 i don't believe we have much choice all
0:14:54 right it's new york city anything flies
0:14:56 here and unfortunately kabir did not
0:14:58 give me a very solid window so we're
0:15:01 gonna i'm just gonna have to be standing
0:15:02 out here for a while we can take turns
0:15:04 waving it around if you want yeah
0:15:07 i'm gonna
0:15:08 i'm gonna move a little bit away from
0:15:09 the van so you guys can just keep an eye
0:15:11 on me but i'm gonna head over to the uh
0:15:13 those bench area over there where people
0:15:16 are coming out and keep the sign up all
0:15:18 right we'll watch your back all right
0:15:20 hey kid man uh
0:15:21 grabbing in my uh my duffel bag there i
0:15:23 got a carton of more leaves might pull
0:15:25 me one of the packs it's gonna be a long
0:15:27 night i was thinking you wanted the
0:15:28 whole carton for a second there
0:15:31 Britta goes into the duffel bag and uh
0:15:33 efficiently fishes out the uh cigarettes
0:15:36 and tosses the lighter along with it
0:15:38 grabs it stuffs it in his jacket all
0:15:40 right
0:15:42 he nods uh
0:15:44 leaves the keys in the ignition so that
0:15:46 it you know there's there's still
0:15:49 radio and like that and the uh van gets
0:15:51 out with the sign and heads over to
0:15:53 where people are coming out and posts up
0:15:56 when pulls her hood up and stands
0:15:58 outside the van she doesn't want to have
0:15:59 to open doors if [ __ ] goes wrong how
0:16:02 many visual distractions are there would
0:16:04 this be somewhere that Britta could use
0:16:07 enhanced sight or was it two sort of
0:16:09 flashing lights oh you can use your own
0:16:10 hand sight here
0:16:12 sounds not great too much too many horns
0:16:15 honking and people arguing and people
0:16:18 traveling everywhere to keep an eye on
0:16:20 johnny she will use her aspects to
0:16:22 enhance her site
0:16:26 [Music]
0:16:29 neil
0:16:30 you
0:16:31 jubaire
0:16:32 and
0:16:34 a certain someone who is not actually
0:16:37 left off she's not conscious yet no
0:16:39 she
0:16:40 is being transported as a corpse uh
0:16:44 overseas there's a whole process to that
0:16:46 but jubair explained to you that he's
0:16:47 got it well in hint and it's just a
0:16:49 matter of getting the two of you into
0:16:51 the states
0:16:52 uh you find yourself way up in the sky
0:16:55 on this plane and the dead of night down
0:16:58 below are all sorts of lights
0:17:01 the plane kind of circles around
0:17:04 nice and slow and eventually
0:17:07 it lands and you find yourself back
0:17:10 in america
0:17:12 at first you know there's like this mad
0:17:14 dash for everyone to grab their luggage
0:17:16 and they all make their way off the
0:17:18 plane flight attendants are thanking
0:17:20 everyone for their business everyone's
0:17:22 kind of been putting out cigarettes and
0:17:24 you
0:17:25 get out of the plane and
0:17:28 jubair is looking around with an
0:17:32 expression full of wonder as if he
0:17:36 were now the person wandering a strange
0:17:38 land with all sorts of curiosities
0:17:42 you um you said
0:17:44 you said you had a way past customs or
0:17:46 are we just gonna have to disappear for
0:17:47 a little bit here don't worry we will
0:17:50 there are times customs is very loose
0:17:53 here and in new york
0:17:55 yes of course
0:17:57 okay i i don't know i don't travel a lot
0:18:00 we've already landed yeah but we're
0:18:02 supposed to go over in that line over
0:18:03 there for customs
0:18:06 yes we could or but that's what that was
0:18:08 what i was asking or
0:18:10 okay yeah
0:18:12 fine let's do that then although we have
0:18:14 to get nora
0:18:16 it felt really weird checking her as
0:18:18 luggage
0:18:19 right she's not going to be delivered
0:18:21 here
0:18:22 where's she going
0:18:23 don't worry about it just
0:18:25 relax
0:18:27 enjoy the surroundings very hard to
0:18:29 relax
0:18:30 this is about slaps you in the mouth
0:18:32 it's okay
0:18:33 ow
0:18:35 you have to relax
0:18:38 a tense man is suspicious
0:18:41 yeah so stop being suspicious right
0:18:45 i will you will go to the bathroom come
0:18:47 with me it'll be fine sure just kind of
0:18:50 like two dudes
0:18:52 and by the time he steps into the
0:18:55 bathroom itself for that
0:18:57 across that like little passageway he's
0:18:59 unseen
0:19:00 neil uh not quite as smooth on the
0:19:02 uptake uh goes into a stall
0:19:05 and then disappears then realizes
0:19:07 there's a door that he can't open now
0:19:09 he's disappeared so like shimmy's out
0:19:11 underneath the stall floor jubair waits
0:19:14 awkwardly just trying to not listen
0:19:17 to you like
0:19:19 wiggle across that cold and for some
0:19:22 reason wet floor
0:19:25 after you've eventually made it to your
0:19:26 feet he kind of gestures to the the
0:19:29 doorway and as it's opening and closing
0:19:31 he just kind of steps out can i see him
0:19:34 get my yeah my aspect is pretty good
0:19:36 okay
0:19:37 um i just follow after him
0:19:40 and neil neil just walks quietly
0:19:43 thankfully uh across like shitty airport
0:19:46 carpet muffling the squish of his shoes
0:19:48 from the bathroom and uh follows
0:19:51 the two of you make your way outside
0:19:54 uh at a certain point the obfuscate
0:19:56 drops but it's after
0:19:57 uh customs is reviewed every
0:20:00 after you guys have gotten past customs
0:20:02 it's
0:20:03 around when you get outside that you see
0:20:07 a strange sign being held by a not so
0:20:11 strange man

0:21:29 johnny mentioned
0:21:31 black hand thing once and it was in
0:21:33 reference to the sabbat who was john my
0:21:35 son that's johnny oh and the last time i
0:21:38 saw him i thought he was going to die
0:21:40 and
0:21:41 he'd mention the black hand and this is
0:21:43 okay before he goes starting to get
0:21:45 before i go further do you owe this man
0:21:46 money
0:21:47 what no
0:21:49 i don't well
0:21:50 yeah i don't know the answer to that
0:21:51 question
0:21:53 okay fine then a very long time until
0:21:55 you figure out the question to the
0:21:57 answer to a very basic question i don't
0:21:58 think i owe him any money okay then
0:22:00 let's go it's fine he's not going to
0:22:01 kill you um
0:22:03 okay fine
0:22:04 why is he going to kill you because i
0:22:06 don't know if that's johnny or not so
0:22:08 you don't even know if this man is the
0:22:09 man that you think it is um excuse me
0:22:12 for being a little bit paranoid right
0:22:13 now
0:22:15 i knew
0:22:17 at any moment
0:22:18 someone could leap out of a chateau and
0:22:20 devour your soul yeah yeah yeah i'm
0:22:22 aware that's why i'm paranoid do you
0:22:24 know what they will not be doing holding
0:22:26 up a sign waiting for you in the middle
0:22:28 of public let's go that's what they want
0:22:30 you to think but he falls anyways
0:22:32 um he stops what if that is what they
0:22:35 want us to think yeah exactly
0:22:37 all right sort of we'll find another way
0:22:40 just hold on hold on it sounds stupid
0:22:42 now doesn't it let's go
0:22:51 [Music]
0:22:54 johnny uh
0:22:56 spots
0:22:57 a man he does not recognize and with
0:23:01 he's kind of waving
0:23:03 when he sees the sign you're holding and
0:23:05 next to him looking mildly uncomfortable
0:23:08 is neil
0:23:10 or at least
0:23:11 neil's visage
0:23:14 tell us the order in which we see him
0:23:16 because that's going to be important
0:23:17 here right now we're on johnny seeing
0:23:19 him johnny saw a strange man with you
0:23:22 know
0:23:23 like hand complexion
0:23:25 dark hair is kind of like swept back and
0:23:28 kind of curly in some areas uh
0:23:30 accompanying him is
0:23:32 neil what is neil wearing uh neil is
0:23:35 wearing khakis
0:23:36 sandals and a button-down shirt that
0:23:39 depicts palm trees like a black
0:23:42 button-down shirt with like a little
0:23:44 like a little palm tree pattern that
0:23:46 just kind of like repeats itself over
0:23:48 and over again
0:23:51 i can't tell whether or not this would
0:23:53 be a frenzy check well whenever you're
0:23:55 unsure vote for frenzy
0:23:59 because i am
0:24:00 super
0:24:02 high strung
0:24:03 municipal city
0:24:05 i am worried that i may have been
0:24:07 followed
0:24:08 um the people who would follow me would
0:24:11 absolutely have access to his face yep
0:24:14 and i'm convinced he's dead so this is
0:24:16 this is somebody wearing my friend's
0:24:18 face this is not neil by the way if i
0:24:20 die right now i'm gonna laugh my ass off
0:24:23 because this is the truth and then i'm
0:24:24 gonna ask you for me
0:24:26 this is the tradition of guarantee
0:24:28 there's nothing to worry about
0:24:30 by accident
0:24:31 he's not going to kill you right i don't
0:24:33 know so neil owes him ten bucks i don't
0:24:34 know if that's johnny no probably not
0:24:37 but i don't know if that's somebody
0:24:38 pretending to be johnny that's what am i
0:24:40 rolling self-control here you are going
0:24:42 to roll self-control at difficulty eat i
0:24:45 am going to spend a willpower on this
0:24:46 roll okay
0:24:47 i am in the middle of an airport this
0:24:49 would be a bad time to break uh the
0:24:51 masquerade
0:24:54 that's two successes
0:24:56 okay with two successes
0:24:58 you manage to maintain control uh when
0:25:01 watching johnny you can very clearly see
0:25:04 his hackles rise and he gets this mean
0:25:07 mugging look staring off at something
0:25:09 she
0:25:10 takes a few steps towards him looking to
0:25:13 figure out what's got him agitated yeah
0:25:15 neil immediately recognizes aggressive
0:25:18 johnny posture
0:25:20 okay that might actually be him but i
0:25:23 just good i'm gonna ask hold on
0:25:26 stop here for a second i'm going to ask
0:25:28 him a question that's fine i will smoke
0:25:30 okay i spend he takes out a pack of
0:25:32 camels i spend blood up my strength and
0:25:34 my dexterity johnny what's going on
0:25:37 hey uh
0:25:39 johnny
0:25:40 um
0:25:42 what's
0:25:43 what's something that only you would
0:25:45 know
0:25:46 that i would know
0:25:47 johnny takes a uh drops the sign
0:25:51 takes a few steps forward
0:25:53 and uh wraps a hand around the back of
0:25:56 your neck so that to all other uh people
0:25:59 it looks like i'm just kind of
0:26:01 embracing a friend maybe and you feel
0:26:04 the strength of which is threatening to
0:26:06 start to uh crack bone okay
0:26:09 that's not really i'm going to need
0:26:11 an appearance
0:26:13 plus subterfuge role
0:26:15 because i feel like absolutely no one is
0:26:18 convinced
0:26:20 look i'm just hugging my friend on the
0:26:22 back of his neck
0:26:23 [Music]
0:26:26 like johnny's like muscle arms as well
0:26:28 no regular human being any anybody
0:26:31 watching would i feel like would
0:26:32 definitely be uh nervous that
0:26:34 something's going on here but i just
0:26:36 want to be that it's not a fight
0:26:37 breaking out right like immediately
0:26:39 heads aren't snapping and going oh god
0:26:41 this guy's jacking this other guy up
0:26:43 against a wall in an airport yeah but
0:26:46 i don't have subterfuge so that's
0:26:49 minus one die or is that minus one
0:26:51 difficulty
0:26:53 okay nope you just roll your appearance
0:26:55 if six
0:26:56 yep
0:26:58 that's a botch
0:27:01 so i i think i actually uh
0:27:03 i mean to do that but instead i just
0:27:06 kind of i can't you subtly quote-unquote
0:27:09 grab him there's a lot of popping noise
0:27:12 and uh some of the people watching like
0:27:15 give you mortified looks and start kind
0:27:19 of start making get getting as much
0:27:22 distance between you and them as
0:27:23 possible without quite running away uh
0:27:26 quinn runs when she sees this happening
0:27:30 hey buddy i you got any last words you

0:27:55 pushes her hood back just enough so she
0:27:57 can see who this is
0:28:01 what color did you tell me to be what
0:28:04 what color did you tell me to be when i
0:28:06 was pissed off

0:28:48 back with one hand while he's still
0:28:50 pressing him into the uh the masonry
0:28:52 okay this is some kind of sabbat trick
0:28:54 when not falling just like a lot of
0:28:56 hands on me right now and i don't uh

0:34:01 we just
0:34:02 everybody
0:34:03 oh boy
0:34:05 neil is that really you neil sort of
0:34:07 like what his his expression has changed
0:34:10 from like panicky
0:34:12 paranoid to
0:34:14 sheepish paranoid
0:34:16 as the vandor opens he sort of steps
0:34:19 inside
0:34:20 what time is it by the way yeah it's
0:34:23 it's like 4 30. kabir gave me directions
0:34:26 to a place i could go uh post up for the
0:34:29 night down in new york here right right
0:34:31 or did he say that that the contact was

0:34:34 uh so he told you you're going to be at
0:34:37 a place in queens okay and the contact

0:34:42 yeah it's it's me hi i'm
0:34:45 really glad all of you were alive i
0:34:47 didn't i didn't
0:34:49 think you were
0:34:51 looking him over like with the enhanced
0:34:53 eyesight as if she might find like some
0:34:55 seam in the disguise
0:34:57 but once like she scans him and she
0:35:00 scans
0:35:01 wynn and johnny's reactions
0:35:03 after a moment of hesitation she does
0:35:06 hop off the bench fully and hug neil oh
0:35:10 thanks um i
0:35:12 yeah i'm glad you're all okay what i i
0:35:16 mean what happened is is new haven
0:35:18 safe is it taking over is where
0:35:21 i didn't know where to go
0:35:22 where did you go
0:35:24 i i was in baghdad we're not just having
0:35:27 this conversation out in the open you're
0:35:29 shutting your mouth you don't none of
0:35:31 you are saying anything else to this guy
0:35:32 i don't even know this is [ __ ] neil
0:35:35 johnny take the wheel
0:35:37 get in the van he kind of like growls to
0:35:39 the two of these guys
0:35:41 what is this thing
0:35:42 that's an excellent question it is
0:35:46 you're right for tonight you have an
0:35:48 address for me
0:35:49 you will take us to the hotel sofitel is
0:35:52 that over in queens no it is not where
0:35:55 is it uh it is in downtown manhattan
0:35:58 manhattan
0:36:00 very close very close practically the
0:36:02 same so you think yeah clyde climbs to
0:36:04 the front of the van and starts heading
0:36:06 to uh to one of the bridges to get back
0:36:08 over to manhattan okay
0:36:10 brit is still kind of staring like even
0:36:11 though she hugged him she's not quite
0:36:13 believing it nothing bad happened when
0:36:16 she hugged him but she's not convinced
0:36:19 wynn is sort of vibrating with
0:36:21 indecision about whether to believe this
0:36:23 is neil or not she has
0:36:25 every reason to believe that those
0:36:26 answers were true and only neil would
0:36:28 know them but johnny knows the sabbat
0:36:31 somehow
0:36:33 during this whole ride whenever neil
0:36:35 looks up to the rear view
0:36:37 johnny is staring daggers at him
0:36:40 it's still driving fine but man oh man
0:36:44 every time it's just like he looks up
0:36:46 and he he johnny chose that moment to
0:36:48 look back in the rear view to stare
0:36:50 already be staring daggers at him neil
0:36:52 is
0:36:52 spends most of the trip
0:36:54 basically in the far corner on one of
0:36:56 the benches at like away from everybody
0:36:58 but maybe jubair
0:37:00 is kind of looking down and like he's
0:37:02 trying to curl in on himself as much as
0:37:04 possible and coincidentally every time
0:37:07 he was like i can't take the silence
0:37:09 anymore i'm gonna say something is when
0:37:10 he looks up and catches johnny staring
0:37:13 at him and just
0:37:15 puts his head back down after
0:37:17 doesn't say anything after a few minutes
0:37:20 did he clear anything what are you
0:37:22 getting anything
0:37:23 win
0:37:24 i mean he looks i'm using
0:37:27 my sight and he
0:37:29 looks right
0:37:30 i asked him a bunch of questions only
0:37:32 the real neil would know
0:37:34 and he answered them all right yeah
0:37:36 to be
0:37:37 and then he sees johnny looking at him
0:37:39 and just sucked up again
0:37:40 neil i've never known you not to speak
0:37:42 what's going on
0:37:43 i um
0:37:44 johnny would you stop glaring at him
0:37:47 johnny slowly takes his eyes and puts it
0:37:49 back on the road not to um
0:37:51 you know play the play the hand here but
0:37:54 uh you got me at a disadvantage um
0:37:56 i asked johnny for clarifying questions
0:37:58 earlier too and he didn't answer me so i
0:38:01 don't actually know that you guys are
0:38:02 you it's not a fun way to [ __ ]
0:38:04 throttle him if he puts that [ __ ]
0:38:06 out one more time
0:38:08 just
0:38:10 i've got it
0:38:11 what would you like to know neil
0:38:13 i i don't know
0:38:14 i
0:38:15 i mean i'm
0:38:16 being chased by murderers i i would love
0:38:19 to know that
0:38:20 you guys are
0:38:22 or are actually you not those murderers
0:38:25 you're still being chased by
0:38:27 the sabbat no no no no no so somebody
0:38:30 different
0:38:31 more yeah
0:38:32 like some lights yeah somebody
0:38:35 who scares me a lot more than the spot
0:38:37 fantastic
0:38:39 great so what do you what do you want to
0:38:41 know
0:38:43 i don't know tell me something that i
0:38:44 would know that only you would know that
0:38:46 i would know
0:38:47 the same with the winded to me
0:38:50 um
0:38:51 i'm unsure uh we never came up with a
0:38:54 series of passcodes not that anything is
0:38:56 technically
0:38:58 feeling pretty convinced right now you
0:39:00 can you can you know my annoyance level
0:39:02 is way higher than it was previously
0:39:04 asked me what was in your haven
0:39:06 um
0:39:08 what uh
0:39:09 what's underneath the bed in my haven
0:39:12 there's a trap door down into a cellar
0:39:14 there's a shitload of newspapers and
0:39:17 magazines and
0:39:19 some weird occulty stuff and some red
0:39:21 plant um is it is it still there
0:39:25 because i i haven't been home and like i
0:39:27 certainly hope so
0:39:29 no i don't just mean that kind of
0:39:32 okay
0:39:34 there's the bathtub neil
0:39:36 okay
0:39:38 yeah
0:39:39 i guess as good as
0:39:41 how many guys just get inside your head
0:39:42 but i don't wanna if it feels like
0:39:45 i could have done the same thing i've
0:39:47 been trying not to exactly it seems rude
0:39:50 you can appreciate the fact that i'm
0:39:51 listening to miles and not smoking your
0:39:54 ass the second we get to where we're
0:39:55 going
0:39:56 yeah i appreciate it
0:39:58 is that proof that i'm johnny enough for
0:40:00 you it's proof that you know the dynamic
0:40:03 between johnny and miles what happened
0:40:05 to you inside zantos house or do you
0:40:08 want me to tell you what happened inside
0:40:09 that yeah no i know what happened to me
0:40:11 i want to know if you know what happened
0:40:12 i know what happened to you but would
0:40:13 you like to tell you yeah that's kind of
0:40:15 the whole like we're doing a thing
0:40:16 although yes
0:40:18 miles is kind of smiling at him yeah you
0:40:20 had your ribs
0:40:22 exploded inwards it seemed by
0:40:25 mr vito and causing you to fountain
0:40:27 blood out of you yeah that did happen
0:40:30 and then you try to scramble behind the
0:40:32 bar yes yeah that's
0:40:35 yep Britta looks for a second and neil's
0:40:38 companion at all these
0:40:40 strange mentions of strange things does
0:40:42 he appear to have any reaction to any of
0:40:44 this
0:40:44 you will notice that he is very subtly
0:40:47 looking at when
0:40:49 Britta follows that
0:40:52 he just does not seem to care about the
0:40:55 is there a beer with a mustache
0:40:57 does he have a mustache
0:41:00 britta Britta follows that line of sight
0:41:02 like kind of subtly as well and like her
0:41:04 eyes flick back to him
0:41:07 checking where on when his eye line
0:41:09 might be falling
0:41:11 uh he's he's like pretty clearly
0:41:12 checking her out noted Britta kind of
0:41:15 like blinks and
0:41:18 reattends the very important
0:41:19 conversation
0:41:22 have all of these things we're asking
0:41:23 tell each other
0:41:24 could have easily been been figured out
0:41:27 by the sabbat
0:41:29 vito might still be running with them we
0:41:31 don't know that you want to actually
0:41:32 prove me your neil wawa 91 what did you
0:41:36 say
0:41:38 oh um
0:41:41 i mean
0:41:42 do i
0:41:43 okay the whole thing dad you guys went
0:41:45 to a wawa what is a wawa it's a
0:41:48 convenience store johnny and i were
0:41:50 man this is embarrassing do i
0:41:52 do it
0:41:56 i um
0:41:57 [Music]
0:41:59 jesus johnny i don't
0:42:03 it was the phil collins stuffed turkey
0:42:05 rant i i don't don't make me do it in
0:42:07 the van
0:42:09 all right i think that's neil
0:42:11 we all just watch him and then look
0:42:13 between the two like johnny actually has
0:42:15 tears uh blood tears running down his
0:42:17 face at this point neil looks deeply
0:42:20 ashamed
0:42:21 what wynn kind of reaches up and kind of
0:42:23 returns the favor of wiping johnny's
0:42:25 eyes so he can drive Britta just
0:42:27 muttering under her breath for what
0:42:30 let's just let's just drop it okay we
0:42:32 don't have to it's right now that uh
0:42:34 johnny makes it to fifth avenue
0:42:37 [Music]
0:42:41 this is a lot nicer than i'm dressed for
0:42:44 uh he looks for a parking garage
0:42:46 attached to this uh oh yeah you find uh
0:42:50 a parking garage attached to the hotel
0:42:51 uh they kind of there's a person that's
0:42:54 there they're waiting to park the
0:42:56 vehicle for you starting to think i
0:42:57 should have picked the vehicle for this
0:42:59 look no offense but getting in and out
0:43:02 of new york
0:43:03 with no one noticing i think they just
0:43:06 noticed right now as we pulled this
0:43:07 kidnapper van into a fifth avenue hotel
0:43:10 yeah but honestly there's also six of us
0:43:12 and i don't know if johnny knew how many
0:43:13 people he was picking up oh no a larger
0:43:15 van makes a lot of unlocks knocks on the
0:43:17 window a lot more sense yo

0:43:43 of pockets the 20 and he's gonna go park
0:43:47 the van joey kind of very casually
0:43:49 strides
0:43:51 into this like
0:43:53 stunning
0:43:54 five-star hotel just kind of assuming
0:43:56 that the group of you are coming along
0:43:57 i'll follow him along with my guitar
0:43:59 case when follows carrying whatever bags
0:44:02 she thought to grab on the way out when
0:44:04 inside he has just a very quick exchange
0:44:07 with the receptionist and
0:44:09 key cards are distributed he kind of
0:44:12 gives the group of you like a little
0:44:13 smile and he's like don't worry this is
0:44:16 uh just a little way of showing um
0:44:19 appreciation for your assistance
0:44:22 he leads you to the elevator
0:44:25 where you travel very very high on this
0:44:29 old like 1940s 50s elevator uh it's very
0:44:33 classy lots of like gold uh and art deco
0:44:37 like style designs everywhere
0:44:40 you come up to this like
0:44:43 massive penthouse room
0:44:46 that has a gorgeous view of the city you
0:44:49 can kind of see that there's there's
0:44:51 definitely a swimming pool uh outside on
0:44:53 this like rooftop like uh hideout and uh
0:44:58 there are rooms there like rooms in this
0:45:00 like you know dormitory essentially and
0:45:03 he hands you guys uh card keys question
0:45:06 are there enough rooms for each of us
0:45:09 the room itself does not quite have
0:45:11 enough rooms for everyone
0:45:13 it's pretty clear he probably didn't
0:45:14 expect a van this full Britta is keeping
0:45:18 an eye on
0:45:19 the dynamic between him and when jabir i
0:45:22 have to appreciate your accommodations
0:45:24 here oh thank you my friend my name is

0:45:34 the pool you're welcome to join me i
0:45:36 might spend some time on
0:45:38 but please the group of you make
0:45:40 yourselves comfortable this is not
0:45:41 exactly the sort of place that the
0:45:43 sabbat would visit so i think we can
0:45:46 relax for a while i uh i don't mean to
0:45:49 ruin your plans for the evening but we
0:45:51 only have maybe an hour
0:45:53 two at best before the sun is up and
0:45:56 then i should like now then he kind of
0:45:58 like laughs takes out a camel cigarette
0:46:02 like you know those like
0:46:03 ridiculous camel wides
0:46:05 he lights himself a camel wide and uh
0:46:08 steps outside camel wide yeah is it just
0:46:11 a bigger cigarette it's a wider
0:46:13 cigarette that's really what it is yeah
0:46:14 okay they're fat looking
0:46:18 it's good to know thanks guys
0:46:22 in the rooms or like big windows and
0:46:24 stuff huge okay there are definitely big
0:46:26 windows uh joey doesn't seem concerned
0:46:29 uh but yeah neil looking at like
0:46:32 wherever the big windows are
0:46:33 still seems a little skittish around
0:46:35 everybody like he's not sure how this
0:46:37 dynamic is gonna play out and just
0:46:39 cut
0:46:40 his thumb on one of his fangs and starts
0:46:43 writing cymbals on windows uh why don't
0:46:45 you go ahead and give me a casting
0:46:48 yeah that's like six successes okay
0:46:50 perfect uh and he just does it on like
0:46:53 basically anywhere where sunlight might
0:46:54 come in he just starts writing and like
0:46:56 muttering himself still kind of looking
0:46:58 around at everybody just not really sure
0:47:02 how to proceed from here
0:47:03 what are you doing um
0:47:05 i am
0:47:07 enacting a curtain a will there's
0:47:09 there's a lot of windows in this place
0:47:11 that i don't think we want
0:47:13 sunlight coming through
0:47:14 i don't remember you doing anything like
0:47:16 that before
0:47:18 it's um it's been enlightening a couple
0:47:20 of weeks has it only been a couple of
0:47:21 weeks it feels it's been a few weeks
0:47:23 yeah
0:47:24 i was
0:47:25 just drugged out most of the time
0:47:27 my mind was
0:47:29 elsewhere so i don't i lost a lot of
0:47:32 time what
0:47:33 happened
0:47:35 i tried to get elsa out like i said i
0:47:37 was going to we were going to escape um
0:47:40 uh i saw uh i saw jane and johnny's
0:47:43 daughter get away
0:47:44 they they peeled out they drove off um
0:47:46 that was good that that all worked and
0:47:48 then this woman came out of nowhere she
0:47:51 had a cutlass there were a bunch of um
0:47:54 just these animalistic looking gangrel
0:47:56 with her and then when i stopped and i
0:47:58 looked back they were they were just
0:47:59 gone there was there's no
0:48:01 there was no out there was no escaping
0:48:03 that and
0:48:04 she said she just needed a victim and
0:48:07 she
0:48:08 i don't know
0:48:09 i knew
0:48:10 miles
0:48:12 needed elsa just
0:48:14 something
0:48:15 i couldn't just she said she wanted a
0:48:17 victim and it was a choice i i could
0:48:19 have and it just didn't seem right i i
0:48:21 couldn't just
0:48:22 sacrifice somebody else and i
0:48:25 neil elsa made it
0:48:28 that's good i i didn't know what was
0:48:29 going on
0:48:30 at last i saw miles and johnny were were
0:48:33 running at a like a werewolf or
0:48:35 something and
0:48:36 and then um
0:48:38 i asked her
0:48:39 i pushed ellison back inside and then i
0:48:41 asked that woman i said i i don't really
0:48:43 want to be here for this
0:48:45 can i
0:48:46 and
0:48:47 she sort of shrugged didn't really seem
0:48:49 like she cared either way so i
0:48:52 i i keep blood uh drugged blood in in
0:48:55 coins and little objects sometimes and i
0:48:57 i just took one out of my pocket and i
0:49:00 i just wanted to disappear i didn't want
0:49:01 to feel it at the end
0:49:03 and
0:49:04 um then everything started to go black
0:49:06 and there was a pain in my chest and
0:49:08 then i woke up in baghdad
0:49:10 um how's that nora
0:49:13 told me she um she said the the whiff of

0:51:04 impressed with wind but also kind of
0:51:06 terrified that this is where the
0:51:08 conversation's going
0:51:09 small i saw it
0:51:11 that night that i ascended the ladder
0:51:12 when when we went out to wallingford
0:51:14 when we did all of that
0:51:16 at the end uh and then new year's eve
0:51:18 too
0:51:20 just a small
0:51:21 child
0:51:22 skin
0:51:23 black and charred
0:51:25 coming out of a tomb
0:51:27 and told me the paths have to split up
0:51:29 apparently
0:51:31 it's important to
0:51:33 nourish people there's some sort of
0:51:34 schism happening and
0:51:36 i am
0:51:37 so they wanted to know more they needed
0:51:39 to know more and the last night i was in
0:51:41 baghdad which must have been just last
0:51:43 night the night before i had just
0:51:45 started for a new vision when
0:51:48 one of the members of the web of knives
0:51:50 was clutched on the outside of the tower
0:51:52 and
0:51:53 tried to pull me out and we ran
0:51:56 because that's all we could do and just
0:51:58 ran there's like a
0:52:00 like over rooftops and
0:52:02 eventually threw ourselves into the
0:52:04 river and escaped as best we could
0:52:07 lost him somewhere along the line but in
0:52:09 in the process nara um
0:52:11 was struck down
0:52:13 and she was put into torpor and i
0:52:15 managed to hold on to her but are you
0:52:18 are you still having these
0:52:20 visions
0:52:21 not in the last day or so have you been
0:52:23 off the drugs in that time period yeah
0:52:25 i i um alamo has
0:52:28 obviously uh
0:52:31 of kalief not not like the
0:52:34 little grow lab underneath my haven they
0:52:36 they have a lot so
0:52:38 i could be pretty consistent just pretty
0:52:41 consistently gone and searching i mean
0:52:43 on the plus side and he's like continues
0:52:46 to sort of draw symbols and stuff on the
0:52:47 windows it um
0:52:49 opened my mind to a few things that had
0:52:52 been difficult to parse i've been trying
0:52:54 to work on for a while now but
0:52:56 you know that's the benefit of having a
0:52:58 teacher
0:52:59 sure we can call it that
0:53:01 uh but on the good side on the plus side
0:53:03 if this works the way it's supposed to
0:53:05 um
0:53:06 sun
0:53:07 even with the windows wide open sun
0:53:08 won't come in here
0:53:10 how do you test this before
0:53:12 it's a good question i had not
0:53:13 considered that
0:53:14 all right why are you back in new haven
0:53:16 then
0:53:17 oh we had to get out of baghdad
0:53:19 and you ended up in new haven uh jubair
0:53:21 asked me where i should go where we
0:53:23 should go that was safe i i i didn't
0:53:25 know if new haven was safe or not i have
0:53:26 no idea if it's been taken by the sabbat
0:53:28 i didn't know if any of you were alive i
0:53:30 i don't know what happened to any of you
0:53:32 but it was the only place i could think
0:53:33 of to go
0:53:34 you know there's international phones
0:53:36 right yeah i i
0:53:38 i was in a i was in a stupor for a
0:53:40 couple of weeks and then i was running
0:53:41 from assassins i didn't have a phone
0:53:45 well it's good that you are back
0:53:47 the domain is
0:53:49 still standing
0:53:50 good the werewolf is dead
0:53:53 yeah
0:53:53 what the hell i thought we had agreed
0:53:55 that we were just gonna run no no i
0:53:57 never agreed to that that's what i
0:53:59 thought too but no i was fairly sure the
0:54:01 plan was not to run i was never gonna
0:54:03 run that's not what i remember talking
0:54:05 about but i'm glad you i'm glad you're
0:54:08 all alive i didn't
0:54:10 i wasn't sure is um yeah because i
0:54:12 thought that leaving the building would
0:54:14 be
0:54:14 problematic since there would be a bunch
0:54:16 of spot around but yeah okay
0:54:18 and we managed to recover joey yeah
0:54:21 good joey's okay he's he's still with me
0:54:24 i'm glad when unfortunately Reiss is
0:54:26 still alive shaw is not shaw's not what
0:54:29 happened to shaw johnny happened to shaw
0:54:31 Reiss happened to show i mean yes but
0:54:33 ultimately
0:54:34 wait so what
0:54:36 wait wait
0:54:37 what happened after you left
0:54:39 was the werewolf tore through
0:54:42 damn near quarter of the court before
0:54:44 miles and i managed to put it down
0:54:47 barely
0:54:48 i wouldn't say barely you
0:54:50 handed that thing a defeat the um
0:54:54 the werewolf was just a young girl
0:54:57 that the killing spree
0:54:59 bagged
0:55:01 and tossed in to scare everybody out so
0:55:03 they could grab the victim
0:55:05 um
0:55:07 when we put it down shaw saw a chance to
0:55:09 try and put the rest of us down
0:55:11 i don't know how much of a heads up he
0:55:13 had about what was going down
0:55:15 but he put a stake through miles and
0:55:18 damn near got to me
0:55:20 until Reiss
0:55:21 somehow pulled the blood from both of
0:55:23 our bodies
0:55:24 sending us into hunger frenzy that makes
0:55:27 sense and i tried to diaboloize him
0:55:30 are you
0:55:31 it didn't work didn't take
0:55:34 a short Reiss but he
0:55:36 it wasn't him
0:55:38 i'm sorry i i should have seen that it
0:55:40 was a cool suit i i no one's blaming you
0:55:43 neil i should have seen anyways
0:55:46 not much we could have done differently
0:55:48 i should have been less focused on him
0:55:49 as a target but i got joey back so
0:55:51 there's not a lot of room for regret the
0:55:53 real kicker is
0:55:55 not a whole lot has changed since that
0:55:57 night the sabbat are still warning on
0:55:59 the city causing massive masquerade
0:56:03 breaches wherever they can that we're
0:56:05 barely managing to contain in some cases
0:56:08 we're not there's a lot more panic
0:56:11 and positions people it's all being
0:56:13 shuffled i mean
0:56:15 miles you're the sheriff now and wait
0:56:17 what what happened to weather is this
0:56:19 weather's okay well this is okay Reiss
0:56:22 hasn't lost any status in the domain and
0:56:25 instead punished weathers for allowing
0:56:28 things to happen and has put miles in
0:56:30 charge so now miles is reporting to
0:56:32 Reiss to relevance
0:56:34 well we can well what happened to
0:56:36 arabella split hairs in there
0:56:38 we haven't found her yet she just
0:56:39 disappeared she hasn't been seen since
0:56:41 then
0:56:42 she took off okay i might be able to
0:56:45 help with that kind of thing um
0:56:48 we really need help with is tracking
0:56:49 down santosa okay
0:56:51 we can do that what about you
0:56:53 besides getting away from these
0:56:55 assassins um i imagine things have
0:56:58 changed since you've now been
0:56:59 transported halfway across the world
0:57:01 again i um
0:57:03 i wasn't really
0:57:04 fully aware for most of my trip
0:57:08 but
0:57:09 like i said there's some sort of schism
0:57:11 that either has to happen or is going to
0:57:13 happen or has already happened
0:57:16 with the children of hakim
0:57:18 naras that you wanted my help i wanted
0:57:20 to talk to her more about it more
0:57:21 context but i
0:57:23 she's
0:57:24 in a box right now so
0:57:27 jubier and naru need something and
0:57:30 they've decided to
0:57:32 it seems like flee the
0:57:34 middle east and now in new haven yes
0:57:36 yeah um it's not safe there for people
0:57:39 who are on to whatever it is the web of
0:57:41 knives is doing i'm not sure it's going
0:57:42 to be that much safer for them here i
0:57:45 said that but
0:57:46 the web of knives is
0:57:49 terrifying
0:57:50 anyway they're hoping they'll stick out
0:57:52 more here
0:57:53 when a web of knives assassin wants to
0:57:55 kill you
0:57:56 they don't stick out they just appear
0:57:58 and then you're dead they're still alive
0:58:00 i managed to get lucky
0:58:02 so it's doable or they didn't want to
0:58:04 kill me i
0:58:05 it's unclear well i mean all three of
0:58:08 you are still alive they still have to
0:58:11 travel and they still have to feed
0:58:12 correct as far as i know
0:58:14 i mean there are ways to travel faster
0:58:16 than
0:58:17 plane but
0:58:19 i don't know who's supporting them i
0:58:21 don't know where they are well there's
0:58:23 clearly support she says looking around
0:58:25 at the very opulent who knows
0:58:28 not remember knives but he is an
0:58:30 asyllate yeah oh this ought to be
0:58:33 interesting do you know if the web of
0:58:35 knives is support or no they are
0:58:38 their own thing
0:58:39 like the satellites yeah if the zedites
0:58:42 were scary i mean i think the zedites
0:58:44 would disagree with you but i'm sure
0:58:45 they would but
0:58:47 neil you'll be fine coming back into new
0:58:49 haven but i would like to point out that
0:58:51 if we're bringing two Assamites into the
0:58:53 domain
0:58:54 that could get a little bit sticky
0:58:56 unless they ask for proper
0:58:58 hospitality we should be able to make
0:59:00 that happen did they are they gonna is
0:59:03 your friend you by ear and nara gonna be
0:59:06 okay with
0:59:07 letting themselves be
0:59:08 put on record like that i don't know
0:59:11 it's gonna have to be a conversation i
0:59:12 guess i i'm not
0:59:14 entirely sure what next steps are for
0:59:16 them other than don't die i know i was
0:59:18 trying to help them get information but
0:59:20 i'm missing a lot of the context do you
0:59:22 trust these people completely with my
0:59:24 life i mean jubair has saved me multiple
0:59:28 occasions
0:59:29 and uh with nara i just sort of like
0:59:33 fall silent you know sort of a very
0:59:35 clearly like
0:59:36 i'm fond of this person i don't really
0:59:38 want to talk about it kind of way i
0:59:40 might be able to handle something do
0:59:41 they have a can they put together some
0:59:43 sort of
0:59:44 present
0:59:45 i can talk to jubilee here if um i mean
0:59:48 there's gonna yes but also uh
0:59:51 historically
0:59:52 i mean if paris is still around and has
0:59:54 a lot of sway and status that might be
0:59:56 an issue historically the um children of
0:59:59 hakeem and the premier do not get along

1:01:16 a while
1:01:18 i'm just getting real deep in there with
1:01:20 all kind of
1:01:21 i don't like when he says real deep in
1:01:22 there is anybody else sorry

1:01:30 winning johnny at night sun 95k the howl
1:01:34 oh
1:01:37 oh dear god that could actually be a
1:01:38 decent segment
1:01:40 no not
1:01:41 not that specifically but putting people
1:01:43 in like a radio show i hate this let's
1:01:45 move on
1:01:47 he hates it so that means it's
1:01:48 automatically win radio
1:01:50 like segment where they have a guest
1:01:53 just like 30 minutes of them just
1:01:55 interviewing someone and here we have
1:01:57 some miles the producer occasionally
1:01:59 cuts in kibera i hear you like spitting
1:02:01 your coffee let's discuss
1:02:04 wait is this okay so here's the thing i
1:02:07 gotta have a sound effect board oh spin
1:02:09 this coffee
1:02:11 so yeah
1:02:12 if we're doing radio shows
1:02:16 i love this sound board man
1:02:18 i like it better if he just makes up
1:02:20 before if we're doing more if we're
1:02:21 doing radio shows
1:02:23 it's johnny you realize the sound
1:02:24 board's actually a thing right like you
1:02:25 don't just make noises with your mouth
1:02:28 what do you make them with i'm sorry
1:02:30 what was that rob you need to fake
1:02:38 we need at least two different radio
1:02:39 shows one is the [ __ ] morning zoo
1:02:42 crew
1:02:43 johnny
1:02:44 yeah yeah that's us and then the other
1:02:46 one is just an npr style podcast neil
1:02:49 and britta
1:02:50 just talking to whoever and then miles
1:02:53 obviously is producing for both and just
1:02:55 jumps into the middle of all or he's
1:02:57 just the music segment playing the new
1:02:59 hits and now miles with the news
1:03:02 you're all terrible
1:03:05 this is miles speaking
1:03:07 look i love the idea of everyone doing
1:03:09 anything and then miles just being so
1:03:12 uncomfortable on mike
1:03:15 you guys can each do a commercial
1:03:17 johnny's like if you don't you big red
1:03:18 [ __ ] you
