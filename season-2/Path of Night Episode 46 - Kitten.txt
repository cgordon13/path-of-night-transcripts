0:01:13 [Music]
0:01:15 Johnny and Neil hit the road headed up
0:01:17 to Wallingford to perform the ritual
0:01:19 Route 15 is kind of dark there isn't
0:01:21 really a lot in the way of lights over
0:01:22 the road just these like little
0:01:24 reflective beacons showing either way
0:01:26 the two of you ride Johnny what's
0:01:29 playing the Stooges
0:01:31 hey
0:01:32 um what was her name again
0:01:34 are we talking about
0:01:35 sorry I'm having trouble concentrating
0:01:37 after all that the um the the what is it
0:01:40 the Abbott abbess
0:01:42 yeah so I have the name Cynthia stuck in
0:01:45 my head and I know that's not right or
0:01:47 is it wait is it right
0:01:49 is it Cheryl it's like a see something
0:01:52 but like a soft C it's not like Chris
0:01:55 you're right it is Cynthia okay
0:01:58 um yeah so you know what we're gonna do
0:02:02 here right if you have like a basic idea
0:02:03 I just don't want to freak out on me I
0:02:05 have no idea what you're about to do
0:02:07 last time I drove you out here there was
0:02:09 a mention of a cow you're in in
0:02:13 drenched in blood yeah it's kind of
0:02:15 squad it's fine I guess I do have some
0:02:17 kind of idea what's happening out here
0:02:18 yeah
0:02:20 um so this is gonna be several hours
0:02:22 um and then after that I'm there's a
0:02:25 ritual thing I can help find her I can
0:02:27 help you find her Hunter
0:02:30 it's gonna get a little
0:02:31 grotesque
0:02:33 um but it's okay
0:02:35 I just
0:02:37 there's a ritual that um Masters Of
0:02:39 Heaven and Earth can do where a
0:02:41 representation of a person or an object
0:02:43 that they held uh is swallowed by the
0:02:46 Sorcerer And then either they or someone
0:02:48 else will cut it from their stomach
0:02:51 and until the next inauspicious night
0:02:53 your um if you possess it it'll help
0:02:57 guide you to your killing Target Johnny
0:03:01 takes a one final drag on his morally
0:03:03 flicks it out the window and rolls the
0:03:05 window up I'm sorry you want to try that
0:03:07 again we're cutting your stomach open
0:03:09 yeah but only after the whole the
0:03:12 different ritual with the bull there's
0:03:13 there has to be some
0:03:14 I need more insight than the closer I
0:03:17 get to approaching the veil than the
0:03:20 more that the secrets are revealed and
0:03:21 the easier this becomes all right let's
0:03:24 make a deal here I'm gonna keep my worst
0:03:27 thoughts in check and not say all the
0:03:29 things I want to say about this I'm
0:03:31 going to support you in this Dark Magic
0:03:35 Ritual and you're not gonna explain any
0:03:38 more of this [ __ ] to me because I don't
0:03:40 want to have that bouncing around in my
0:03:42 head later tonight all right do you yeah
0:03:44 yeah deal just remember the less Johnny
0:03:47 has to know about this the better okay
0:03:51 um
0:03:52 we're kind of a rough night kick
0:03:54 can I ask your opinion on something
0:03:56 yeah go for it
0:03:58 I um
0:04:00 I I know we just came from my place and
0:04:03 I trying not to think about it or I'm
0:04:05 just gonna start freaking out again I
0:04:07 want to apologize to you again because I
0:04:09 for lying about all of this any kind of
0:04:12 gestures towards like his like plastic
0:04:14 shopping bag full of the remnants of his
0:04:16 magical accoutrement
0:04:18 are just the reason I kept it hidden is
0:04:22 so that I wouldn't have to be sitting
0:04:24 here the way that I am in the ruins of
0:04:26 my life again
0:04:27 I get it man no it's Secrets there's
0:04:31 secrets for a reason I just it's hard
0:04:34 for me
0:04:35 to not see a direct thread between miles
0:04:39 finding out and
0:04:41 just the destruction of everything I
0:04:44 care about
0:04:45 something to be aware of
0:04:48 you see patterns and you see the future
0:04:51 and you see all these things coming at
0:04:53 you from places people don't normally
0:04:56 look
0:04:56 that's got to give you some weird
0:04:58 Insight in what your day looks like if
0:05:03 you already know that something's coming
0:05:05 because you saw it in the stars or
0:05:07 wherever you look I imagine that messes
0:05:10 with your head you start to believe your
0:05:12 own hype
0:05:13 now I'm not saying that you're making
0:05:16 this stuff up I'm not saying that is
0:05:18 strictly a self-fulfilling prophecy but
0:05:21 when you start getting obsessed with how
0:05:25 things are supposed to go or how they're
0:05:27 going to go you stop being
0:05:31 clever enough to think of all the other
0:05:33 options you have in the moment I don't
0:05:37 do well with in the moment decisions I
0:05:41 realize that it makes a lot of sense
0:05:43 because like I said I think you see too
0:05:46 much of what's happening in the effects
0:05:48 and ripples of any action you take but
0:05:51 all that's doing is making you scared
0:05:54 that you're doing something wrong but
0:05:57 there has to be there's no right there's
0:06:00 no wrong in the moment I realized that
0:06:03 certain actions are going to carry all
0:06:05 kinds of Ripples and effects with them
0:06:07 but that's just a new world that you
0:06:09 create right I mean sort of but
0:06:12 sometimes you can see a forward path and
0:06:15 a direct through line and I worry that
0:06:19 we do a lot of shooting from the hip and
0:06:22 not being aware of the consequences I
0:06:25 think that's the Human Condition if that
0:06:28 applies to any of us anymore but uh the
0:06:31 thing that stuck in my head right now
0:06:33 and I'm trying this is why I wanted to
0:06:35 talk to you about it because I'm trying
0:06:37 not to apply to the Future and to be
0:06:39 totally honest I can't Levy these kinds
0:06:42 of criticisms against miles and win
0:06:46 if they're near me talking about
0:06:48 shooting from the hip
0:06:50 no one waited even a minute even a day
0:06:54 to see if I was gonna wake up and we're
0:06:56 about if I'm extrapolating the patterns
0:06:59 of where I think we're extrapolating
0:07:00 them miles is thinking about Praxis
0:07:05 right now and the reason he's doing it
0:07:08 is yes because of the domain and because
0:07:11 of the archon and to keep everyone safe
0:07:14 but it feels to me like the real reason
0:07:17 he's doing it was the same thing that
0:07:20 pissed all of us off is that the prince
0:07:23 Roland's blood-bound Brita and is
0:07:26 continuing to do so and is going to push
0:07:28 for more and I get it I'm mad about it
0:07:32 too I don't necessarily even think that
0:07:34 Praxis is a bad idea
0:07:36 which is wild for me to say I'm
0:07:39 terrified of it but we're doing that and
0:07:42 I can't be angry at them for doing it to
0:07:45 me when I'm near them doing what to you
0:07:49 Johnny on I'm bound to them
0:07:53 because of a short term because of
0:07:56 short-term thinking
0:07:58 and my Haven and all my things are
0:08:01 destroyed and my secrets are made public
0:08:02 and I'm on an ordeal where I have to
0:08:04 kill someone
0:08:06 because of short-term thinking I
0:08:08 understand
0:08:10 that I can be paralyzed with choice
0:08:14 but there are direct lines between
0:08:17 short-term thinking
0:08:18 and my present condition
0:08:22 I just I didn't realize you were so
0:08:23 invested in the Jihad my friend pulls
0:08:26 out another morally pops it in his mouth
0:08:28 it's funny because in some ways
0:08:30 long-term thinking is it's just I mean
0:08:33 yeah and on other ways I talk about the
0:08:36 inability to not see patterns I see them
0:08:38 everywhere right now I know you don't
0:08:40 want to hear it I know that everybody's
0:08:42 throwing it around
0:08:43 ever since I came back from Baghdad even
0:08:46 before that the signs of gehenna are
0:08:49 everywhere
0:08:51 and I can't not see them and I don't
0:08:54 know I'm rambling at this point I just
0:08:56 Johnny pulls the truck over to the side
0:08:58 of the road he puts on the emergency
0:09:00 lights and looks over at Neil
0:09:03 you are a pile of anxiety right now my
0:09:07 friend
0:09:08 yeah
0:09:09 you got a lot of nonsense going on
0:09:13 what do you want to do here
0:09:15 I don't know I don't know if I had a
0:09:18 point to any of this I just gehenna's
0:09:20 coming all right what are we gonna do
0:09:22 about it my goal is to stay alive and
0:09:26 with all of you as long as I can well
0:09:28 that doesn't really sound like you're
0:09:29 staying alive doesn't really sound like
0:09:30 Johanna does it as long as I can being
0:09:33 the operating word there all right and I
0:09:36 it sounds like there's some resentment
0:09:38 about the bonds you have to win and
0:09:40 Miles what do you want to do about that
0:09:43 there's nothing to do about that I can't
0:09:45 be apart from them I can't it's just
0:09:48 reality I'm not even you asking me to do
0:09:51 anything about that no I'm not I just
0:09:53 look I care about everybody in this
0:09:56 cotery I do and that includes you it
0:09:58 just there's been a lot of short-term
0:10:00 thinking recently and I'm paying the
0:10:02 price for it and I don't want to see you
0:10:03 do the same thing I appreciate you
0:10:05 looking out for me if the rest of us and
0:10:08 trying to keep us aware of the bigger
0:10:10 picture but I feel like you're getting
0:10:12 lost in that bigger picture yourself
0:10:13 it's doing more damage than it's doing
0:10:16 good for you there's not really a whole
0:10:18 lot more damage to be done right now I
0:10:20 think that there's plenty more damage
0:10:21 that can be done
0:10:23 there's still plenty of people from your
0:10:25 life that could be stripped away that's
0:10:27 hard for me to see right now nara's
0:10:29 still alive isn't she I don't know I
0:10:31 haven't seen her I'm not allowed to all
0:10:33 right so I'm supposed to take your
0:10:36 Visions for their face value and you're
0:10:39 not gonna trust me that I that we have
0:10:41 her safe with weathers no I that's not
0:10:43 what I meant
0:10:45 it's fine yeah
0:10:47 that's fine
0:10:49 sometimes I feel a little clearer-headed
0:10:51 when I'm not near her too
0:10:52 I get it speaking of clear-headed that
0:10:55 uh at least you grew in your basement is
0:10:58 that something that helps you out with
0:10:59 all this it's required
0:11:01 and I have so little of it left
0:11:04 Johnny I think uh I was reminded
0:11:07 actually stuffed some of that away in
0:11:08 his jacket from uh the the raids so uh
0:11:12 he actually reaches into his jacket and
0:11:15 pulls out a significant amount of caliph
0:11:18 that was saved during the uh Haven raid
0:11:21 Neil looks over
0:11:23 surprised where did you get that it's
0:11:25 from you Haven that's what they're
0:11:27 trying to take and they got away with a
0:11:30 lot of stuff he holds his hand out to
0:11:32 passes it over
0:11:34 um I mean to be fair you know like we
0:11:37 were saying there is more to lose here
0:11:39 and he starts to roll down the window
0:11:40 and go to reach for it like he's gonna
0:11:42 throw it out the window
0:11:43 you sure yeah all right I'm sure come on
0:11:47 all right just
0:11:49 I needed to help okay and and all I'm
0:11:52 doing is to help I I don't know I'm
0:11:53 rambling Johnny I just you're gonna see
0:11:56 me do some things here and I'm gonna ask
0:11:59 of you The Impossible the same way that
0:12:02 I asked Gwen and Bretta last time just
0:12:05 try not to look at me different if you
0:12:07 can
0:12:09 I don't think the way I look at you is
0:12:11 Gonna Change Neil
0:12:12 I'm not sure I like how you said that he
0:12:15 gives you a knowing glance like yeah
0:12:17 exactly
0:12:21 look just you got sticks in everything
0:12:24 that's going on too I know you do do you
0:12:26 want to talk about it
0:12:29 because
0:12:31 part of the reason I want to bring this
0:12:32 up now
0:12:33 miles told Arabella that I could do all
0:12:35 this Arabella was hanging out with
0:12:37 Premiere and then a day later the
0:12:39 premiere are essentially blood hunting
0:12:42 me as my secrets are revealed
0:12:45 short-term thinking is going to get the
0:12:46 people and the things we care about
0:12:48 destroyed and I don't want to see that
0:12:49 happen to you do you want to talk about
0:12:51 it
0:12:52 the people that I care about
0:12:56 they're already caught up in this
0:12:58 [ __ ]
0:12:59 Okay so
0:13:02 at some point
0:13:04 this whole [ __ ] situation is Gonna
0:13:06 Come collecting
0:13:08 it's gonna take them
0:13:10 and I'll probably follow
0:13:13 or you won't recognize the Johnny Saxon
0:13:15 that stays sticks around
0:13:18 simple as that
0:13:20 you need help disappearing
0:13:24 let me know oh I don't think you catch
0:13:27 my drift no I know what you mean I meant
0:13:29 the first one not the second
0:13:31 yeah and the first one
0:13:35 No One's Gonna have to worry about me if
0:13:37 that's the case let's try not to have
0:13:39 that happen then
0:13:40 um I don't know there's a whole lot of
0:13:42 Point worrying about it oh who are you
0:13:44 talking to
0:13:45 um
0:13:46 hey last time we were really focused on
0:13:51 Jane and confusion and trying to find
0:13:55 advantages and and missions but if I
0:13:58 could offer
0:13:59 a little piece of
0:14:01 human to Human
0:14:02 connection advice that's weird coming
0:14:05 from me but I would
0:14:08 call
0:14:09 or send a text with no ulterior motive
0:14:13 not thinking about Jane if you can
0:14:16 manage it
0:14:17 just to reach out
0:14:18 and say hi
0:14:20 masquerades already blown when it comes
0:14:22 to that anyways no more harm can be done
0:14:24 from it on a grand scale
0:14:26 we should look at a guy who looks at
0:14:28 Futures who looks and extrapolates
0:14:31 patterns of behavior and I left the note
0:14:36 she's got my number that's just passing
0:14:38 the ball
0:14:39 cool Johnny
0:14:41 not now you don't have to but you're
0:14:42 gonna have a couple of hours while we're
0:14:44 hanging out
0:14:45 just think about it I'll think about it
0:14:51 [Music]
0:14:53 miles and wind
0:14:55 the two of you have assemble the code
0:14:58 already to meet outside of winds Haven
0:15:02 in the Woods by The Shack
0:15:04 to go over and finalize your plan to
0:15:08 strike against Vira zantosa each of you
0:15:11 arrives kind of one at a time Milling in
0:15:15 and once everyone is assembled miles
0:15:18 gets right to it all right I have
0:15:20 assembled uh some extra gear for all of
0:15:22 you I'm gonna replace anything that may
0:15:24 or may not be damaged
0:15:27 but this should be hopefully a mostly
0:15:30 simple steak and grab is the hope we
0:15:34 know it probably won't go that way but
0:15:36 everyone take some steaks Johnny you're
0:15:39 literally and figuratively on point on
0:15:41 this absolutely Johnny Johnny actually
0:15:44 will as you're kind of describing the
0:15:45 gear that you've assembled he actually
0:15:47 opens up the back of the uh of the black
0:15:49 Suburban that we're taking for the
0:15:50 mission
0:15:51 um I'm sure it's another kind of black
0:15:52 but uh he only knows it as just regular
0:15:56 black suburban and it opens opens up the
0:15:58 back and shows off all the gear that
0:16:00 Miles has assembled and starts passing
0:16:01 things out Britta is going to bring Mr
0:16:04 santosa to us using the powers of
0:16:07 presence yeah I think so I mean it
0:16:10 worked what I tried when we ran into the
0:16:13 Killing Spree
0:16:14 um I was thinking that I could do that
0:16:16 again just to make his life a bit more
0:16:18 difficult if that's okay with you guys I
0:16:20 know that it's uh kind of uncomfortable
0:16:23 to I think as long as we're doing what
0:16:26 you want us to be doing it's not going
0:16:27 to make our lives any more difficult hey
0:16:29 if it makes it a little bit more likely
0:16:31 that all of us are going to survive this
0:16:33 um yeah you know what it's fine the
0:16:36 permission and and all that I mean it
0:16:39 doesn't affect me so
0:16:40 okay there's one more thing
0:16:43 um talking about all of us well I guess
0:16:46 not us but everyone involved surviving
0:16:49 this
0:16:50 I am
0:16:51 Bretta takes out from her pocket she has
0:16:55 acquired some handcuffs and she shows
0:16:58 them to the group I think I'll just be
0:17:00 able to get out of those he can turn
0:17:01 into a blood monster
0:17:03 um well I'm a little worried that I can
0:17:04 get out of them too but they're actually
0:17:06 for me are you going for a damsel in
0:17:09 distress angle well I thought that might
0:17:12 maybe convince him but I was thinking
0:17:13 more about the fact that well the last
0:17:16 time we did something like this I tried
0:17:18 to blow his brains out it's a good point
0:17:20 actually that's very good really true
0:17:22 miles Narrows his eyes but nods and like
0:17:25 we can do that if you'd like I'd you
0:17:28 should still keep some sort of weapon on
0:17:29 you just in case but not maybe a knife
0:17:32 right or a steak that'll give us time at
0:17:35 least I'll keep a sake on me
0:17:38 um maybe a knife but I think I'm
0:17:40 probably too good with a gun how are you
0:17:43 with your fists it's really not my
0:17:45 specialty which is possible but I have a
0:17:48 set of extra brass knuckles if you think
0:17:50 that would be helpful I mean a gun
0:17:52 shouldn't finish him now that he's
0:17:55 embraced but then how much accumulated
0:17:58 damage but
0:17:59 no that's for best keep a little bit of
0:18:02 something to keep you armed it just
0:18:04 makes me feel better that we're not
0:18:06 leaving you completely unprepared but
0:18:08 I'll keep a knife and the sake and we'll
0:18:12 leave my guns in the car and maybe this
0:18:15 way I mean yeah damselves in distress a
0:18:19 little bit maybe he'll be occupied for a
0:18:21 bit while you guys bag him trying to
0:18:23 help or trying to do whatever right
0:18:27 me and win will be uh assisting Johnny
0:18:30 with the staking and laying some her
0:18:33 into veto regardless if the staking
0:18:36 doesn't work for whatever weird body
0:18:38 magic that he might have
0:18:40 we want to take him alive but we should
0:18:42 have multiple methods of doing so so
0:18:44 we're trying to damage him without
0:18:46 killing him so win that means no claws
0:18:49 yeah
0:18:51 now that leaves you on support I can try
0:18:53 and um sort of uh depending on how much
0:18:56 you can move his body around I can try
0:18:57 and at least lock him down uh and if he
0:19:01 can turn into blood and things like that
0:19:03 I can at least try and turn him and turn
0:19:05 some of his blood into water like moving
0:19:07 down a little bit make it a little bit
0:19:09 tougher for him to to act out sounds
0:19:11 good um considering the fact that he's
0:19:14 probably got a lot of potence and
0:19:16 Celerity he's gonna be burning like a
0:19:18 hot furnace so if you can remove some of
0:19:20 the fuel for that fire good idea it
0:19:23 means I have to be right up in his face
0:19:24 but I I can we can give it a shot
0:19:28 um go for it Ambush right I can help us
0:19:31 with all all of us being hidden staying
0:19:34 hidden you'd mentioned things like that
0:19:35 before I was hoping that you could do
0:19:36 something like that again yeah um at
0:19:39 least the the three of you uh yeah and
0:19:43 can you call upon the hunting Moon thing
0:19:45 again I can yeah um if we get to the
0:19:48 site
0:19:49 um
0:19:49 if we get to the site like half hour
0:19:51 hour early before we want Vito to be
0:19:54 around before we call him right then I
0:19:56 can make sure we're all set sounds good
0:19:59 and that suggests be prepared for any
0:20:01 weird tricks and that this may not go
0:20:04 the way we want but our goal is to take
0:20:06 him alive where are we thinking about
0:20:08 having this whole thing go down you want
0:20:10 to use that same warehouse District yeah
0:20:12 um it's pretty abandoned doesn't see a
0:20:15 lot of traffic allows us to be loud
0:20:17 without drawing too much attention and I
0:20:19 weirdly it it went well last time you're
0:20:23 talking about over at elf storag by the
0:20:24 by the water yeah you worried about the
0:20:26 set tights no one about this they might
0:20:29 still have eyes in that location having
0:20:30 been jumped there once before right but
0:20:33 currently we're working for the subtites
0:20:34 so I'm not worried for them coming for
0:20:37 us yet that's true they we are supposed
0:20:39 to be doing a job for them right now if
0:20:41 they get the chance to double cross us
0:20:42 they might not be able to pass it up I
0:20:45 think they might try to double crosses
0:20:46 what we're going to accomplish the thing
0:20:47 that they want us to do would be would
0:20:49 be my move if she was if we were playing
0:20:52 that game you know the uh the workings
0:20:55 the set tights better than any of us so
0:20:57 I'll Trust you on that but as always
0:20:59 keep our eyes out
0:21:00 um what's the plan if he uh turns one of
0:21:03 us into a hideous Beast again I'm going
0:21:05 to try to dominate okay or if it's not
0:21:08 you well oh yeah if it's not me right
0:21:11 here's the question
0:21:13 um the blessings of the Hunter's Moon
0:21:15 make it a little bit more difficult
0:21:16 strengthen your will against things like
0:21:18 dominate should we maybe not do that if
0:21:21 we're worried we don't want to make our
0:21:22 our contingency plans harder on
0:21:24 ourselves at least for when I don't know
0:21:28 when you are turned into a monster do
0:21:30 you remember if there was any particular
0:21:32 resistance to it were you fighting it
0:21:33 and I mean I fought it but it was sort
0:21:36 of like trying to fight a tidal wave it
0:21:39 seemed like you are in frenzy um I was
0:21:41 trying to frenzy I don't think I
0:21:43 actually you managed to keep yourself in
0:21:44 track I think I kept myself in check are
0:21:46 you planning on doing this ritual for
0:21:48 this event Neil yeah I believe she was
0:21:51 under the effects of it then I I say
0:21:53 that you you get us ready to Alpha
0:21:56 strike him and we don't worry about
0:21:58 being on the back foot okay that's
0:22:00 that's what I needed to hear I like that
0:22:02 plan
0:22:03 let me just check everybody Johnny does
0:22:05 a walk around to make sure everybody's
0:22:07 armor is uh put on correctly kind of
0:22:10 just as a double check win has two
0:22:11 stakes through her belt loops with the
0:22:13 points facing backwards that way if she
0:22:15 bends over she doesn't impale herself
0:22:16 Freda has the leather jacket that Johnny
0:22:18 gave her on over the armor partly to
0:22:21 conceal it and partly it almost seems
0:22:24 like she pulled the armor up a little
0:22:25 bit too much as if remembering the
0:22:27 gargoyle incident so he can actually
0:22:29 adjust it down a bit uh Neil's body
0:22:31 armor is just way too loose on him like
0:22:34 every time he puts on body armor and
0:22:36 forgets to tighten the straps or does
0:22:38 not have the chest for how it's like the
0:22:40 standard default is set John it
0:22:41 definitely definitely gives you an extra
0:22:43 tightening to make sure it's in spot
0:22:45 pick one of those bro tightenings where
0:22:46 he's like kind of
0:22:49 miles is going in his usual battle guard
0:22:51 but he's a little less put together than
0:22:53 he has previously he's
0:22:55 things are a little a little sloppier
0:22:57 just a little off from previous times
0:22:59 not everything's at it's the perfect
0:23:01 angles and everything else but he still
0:23:03 has the katana and the gun and some
0:23:05 stakes in his long black trench uh
0:23:08 leather trench coat Johnny Shores up any
0:23:10 of the uh adjustments that he can see on
0:23:13 the armor gives everybody a meaty slap
0:23:16 on the shoulder and nods to Miles we're
0:23:18 ready to go
0:23:19 roll out gang it's time to put this
0:23:22 problem to rest
0:23:23 [Music]
0:23:29 it's a pretty short ship uh to get to
0:23:31 the warehouse when you do there's a it
0:23:34 was a bit of nostalgia that hits you as
0:23:36 you arrive and see one of the walls has
0:23:39 like a huge hole in it it looks like
0:23:41 this place has seen some uh seen some
0:23:45 unusual trouble I don't know why I
0:23:47 thought they would fix that I don't
0:23:49 think anybody cares about this property
0:23:50 enough to fix the wall there were holes
0:23:52 in the roof last time I mean I don't
0:23:55 even know who owns this place Britta
0:23:57 goes to look for something to attach
0:23:59 herself in the handcuffs to Johnny takes
0:24:02 a look at pipes pretty quickly Johnny
0:24:03 takes a look at the ground some of the
0:24:06 footprints and things that have moved
0:24:07 around and uh Taps Neil and says hey can
0:24:10 you put your eyes on these Footprints
0:24:12 and see if there's anything weird about
0:24:13 these patterns I mean yeah if you need
0:24:15 me to just uh just to be be on the safe
0:24:18 side all right if I get lost in this I
0:24:20 don't know if we talked about this
0:24:21 before I mean we're on a time schedule
0:24:22 so slap me out of it okay Johnny Kenny
0:24:24 gives you a quizzical look but nods uh
0:24:27 yeah and I will I guess I'll just try
0:24:28 and get a sense of what's been going on
0:24:30 here roll me eyes Cass
0:24:33 foreign
0:24:35 difficulty six four successes you uh
0:24:39 space out a little bit walking the
0:24:41 premises and examining all the little
0:24:43 connections that people can't quite see
0:24:45 and examining it you start to get the
0:24:49 feeling of this being this place of
0:24:52 hopelessness only visited by rats and
0:24:55 those who are afraid and nowhere left to
0:24:58 go and you quickly come to the
0:25:00 understanding that there is no
0:25:02 Supernatural events associated with this
0:25:05 place that you yourselves did not cause
0:25:07 but there are people who come here and
0:25:10 when they do it's because it's because
0:25:14 this environment is the sort of
0:25:16 environment that they feel connected to
0:25:19 like this is the kind of life and place
0:25:21 they deserve Neil walks around the
0:25:23 grounds and sees all of that and then
0:25:27 comes back to Johnny and goes when he
0:25:29 comes back to Johnny he notices that
0:25:31 Johnny who wasn't smoking a cigarette
0:25:33 when you started looking at them is
0:25:34 about three quarters of the way through
0:25:36 a morally and the time that you spent
0:25:39 walking around past a little bit faster
0:25:42 than you might have thought
0:25:44 um
0:25:45 yeah this place is fine uh there's
0:25:47 nothing wrong but like very clearly the
0:25:50 the tone of like yeah this place is fine
0:25:52 does not match the like sort of just
0:25:55 absolutely depressed look on Neil's face
0:25:57 Johnny kind of gives you a knowing
0:25:59 glance like yeah there's more to what
0:26:03 you saw than you're letting on but he
0:26:06 kind of just nods along and
0:26:08 that's good enough for me okay
0:26:10 um I have to do some rituals here uh a
0:26:13 little bit of time so Neil goes and
0:26:15 pulls out of the trunk this like Gauzy
0:26:18 black kind of halfway between like a
0:26:20 hoodie and a robe that just comes down
0:26:22 to about mid thigh when it's hanging on
0:26:25 him comes a little bit past his fingers
0:26:26 there's like holes at the ends of the
0:26:28 sleeves where his fingers don't quite
0:26:30 match the end is it a snuggie kind of
0:26:33 holds up but no no no no no you
0:26:36 described a snuggie it's open in the
0:26:37 front not the back okay okay pulls the
0:26:40 hood up over his head uh and then just
0:26:42 walks into the middle of the thing kind
0:26:45 of right in the middle where around I
0:26:47 guess Brett is looking for like places
0:26:48 to chain herself
0:26:50 um and starts pulling a bunch of weird
0:26:52 ritual components out of his out of his
0:26:54 bag like ashes and uh a weird Shard of a
0:26:58 broken mirror and a bunch of stuff like
0:27:00 that and just starts going and doing
0:27:03 things uh occasionally beckoning people
0:27:05 over to like come closer and then sort
0:27:07 of dismissing them are there any final
0:27:09 preparations that are made what's the
0:27:11 floor made of concrete okay just the
0:27:14 fact that Bretta will be readying to use
0:27:18 Majesty when vetoes within range after
0:27:21 she has chained herself appropriately
0:27:23 when will go over and check britta's
0:27:25 handcuffs Brita kind of like holds up
0:27:27 her wrists as much as she can but
0:27:30 there's that little Clank against the
0:27:32 pipe so that wind can look at it pipe
0:27:35 seems secure enough to hold her the how
0:27:37 are the Cuffs secure okay you can press
0:27:40 down on them to make sure they click in
0:27:42 probably dealt with enough with cops at
0:27:43 one point or another that you're aware
0:27:45 of it or handcuffs or handcuffs win was
0:27:49 arrested for protests at some point in
0:27:51 the 60s oh definitely what sock oh yeah
0:27:55 otherwise I'm checking around the
0:27:57 perimeter and seeing is there drains in
0:27:59 these floors here uh yes okay like a ton
0:28:01 of them or just like yeah they're pretty
0:28:04 well spaced and I don't suppose like
0:28:06 putting a tarp down would help that
0:28:08 would they you could probably flow under
0:28:10 it I was thinking of plugging it with
0:28:11 like mud or something
0:28:12 I don't think it's gonna work I think we
0:28:14 should just open up our sight lines
0:28:15 let's try and get as much as possible so
0:28:17 tell you what um who are we looking for
0:28:21 um who's who's calling the blessing of
0:28:23 the moon what do you mean by calling
0:28:24 someone for the moon who wants the
0:28:26 moon's blessing ah I'm thinking that
0:28:28 Johnny and wind should take a giant one
0:28:30 I was thinking Johnny and Britta I'm not
0:28:33 gonna be able to do too much chained
0:28:35 here I don't think
0:28:36 um so maybe you too okay but I'll need
0:28:39 some of your plate second verse same as
0:28:41 the first she holds out her arm and
0:28:44 opens her hand for to receive a knife
0:28:46 Johnny pauses for a second giving you a
0:28:50 hard stare reaches down and grabs his
0:28:53 boot knife pulls it out and kind of puts
0:28:55 the blade over to win so she can open
0:28:58 herself wind takes the knife and opens
0:29:00 the vein with practice Neil catches the
0:29:03 spilling blood in a bowl Johnny slowly
0:29:05 brings the knife back over himself cuts
0:29:07 his open his palm and the whole time not
0:29:10 breaking eye contact from you gives the
0:29:12 point of his Vitae into the bowl as well
0:29:14 Leo watches Johnny do that making eye
0:29:17 contact back just very clearly
0:29:20 understanding what it's taking the bruja
0:29:22 to try and be okay with this after
0:29:26 everything that they've gone through
0:29:29 all right uh so the three of us have six
0:29:33 additional willpower for tonight very
0:29:35 nice it's a good roll the uh the whole
0:29:37 time while we're kind of prepping the
0:29:39 site Johnny keeps on floating around
0:29:40 everybody and making sure their gear is
0:29:43 double checked and whispering and
0:29:45 encouraging word here or there giving
0:29:47 everybody kind of reassuring nods and
0:29:49 stairs and he will spend a point of
0:29:51 willpower to kind of bolster everybody
0:29:53 with the effects of Iron Heart what does
0:29:55 that give us it's a willpower per person
0:29:57 you're affecting so that would be four
0:29:59 willpower yes beautiful I spend it okay
0:30:01 wow
0:30:03 Tom was listening what is the effect of
0:30:05 iron heart so the difficulty to
0:30:09 manipulate you through uh any the means
0:30:12 of disciplines is increased by one for
0:30:14 the duration of the scene it's uh
0:30:17 dominate presence and mind affecting
0:30:18 vomit surgery I'm gonna utilize those
0:30:21 that aren't busy doing rituals and stuff
0:30:22 like that immediately to clear the space
0:30:24 around so that we have a bigger sight
0:30:26 lines in and around the area sounds good
0:30:28 so as basically as the time is is coming
0:30:31 Neil who's been just sort of sitting in
0:30:34 the middle chanting and getting
0:30:37 occasionally pulling people over towards
0:30:39 him to like Mark them with Ash
0:30:41 Whispering occult stuff to himself
0:30:43 eventually looks up and goes okay
0:30:46 um everybody know where they're supposed
0:30:48 to stand wind gives the nod saying wow
0:30:50 you're under these effects you'll be
0:30:52 vanished from sight like I offer them
0:30:54 but that also means same rules apply so
0:30:57 don't stand in any spotlights don't
0:30:59 knock anything over still trying to hide
0:31:01 like normal we don't know what Vito can
0:31:03 see but so long as you can move like me
0:31:06 you'll remain out of sight so that when
0:31:09 Brita calls him we can all just jump out
0:31:11 of the shadows and get him before he
0:31:13 knows what's happening
0:31:15 understood understood got it
0:31:18 Brita when everyone disappears I'll be
0:31:21 the last one to go I'll give you the nod
0:31:23 and then it's time to go okay I'll call
0:31:26 him then and Neil finishes an
0:31:28 incantation and to the three of you
0:31:31 nothing really seems to change Neil
0:31:33 certainly doesn't disappear Brita the
0:31:36 three of them vanish from sight you see
0:31:38 brita's eyes adjust to the sudden lack
0:31:42 of you but she knew what would happen so
0:31:45 she moves on relatively quickly and
0:31:47 looks to Neil Neil is still sitting in
0:31:49 the middle and then he pulls out that
0:31:51 mirror Shard that he had set aside like
0:31:54 slowly cleans up his ritual things
0:31:56 continues to chant for a few more
0:31:58 minutes and then sort of stands up and
0:32:01 adjusts his back but is holding that
0:32:03 mirror shard in his left hand kind of
0:32:05 like a dagger with a reflective surface
0:32:08 looking at himself and then goes okay
0:32:11 um let's do this and then steps behind a
0:32:15 pillar or like a series Alexa some old
0:32:17 boxes and doesn't come that doesn't
0:32:19 appear to come back out pretty takes a
0:32:22 moment just to be sure that everyone has
0:32:24 disappeared and then another moment
0:32:26 because everyone has disappeared and it
0:32:28 gives that illusion of being alone in
0:32:30 the space even though that she knows
0:32:31 that she's got her code right
0:32:34 which takes that strange breath the one
0:32:37 that you don't need but you still have
0:32:39 that impulse to take in and goes to
0:32:42 summon Vito okay give me a roll I spend
0:32:45 a blood for summon if the character you
0:32:47 is present successfully on the Target in
0:32:48 the past this difficulty drops to four
0:32:51 all right I will say the minimal
0:32:53 difficulty I will be spending a
0:32:54 willpower on this regardless okay Johnny
0:32:57 starts spending blood to swell his
0:32:59 dexterity when also starts spending for
0:33:02 all of her physicals you don't like the
0:33:04 fact that I'm getting swole it's just
0:33:05 well for next muscle swell and throb
0:33:07 ready for combat it was just I expected
0:33:10 to say strength and then you said
0:33:11 dexterity
0:33:12 [Laughter]
0:33:14 Neil actually pumps his stamina for once
0:33:17 only a little though
0:33:22 the shit-eating grin on Rebecca's face
0:33:24 right now it's not even there's just the
0:33:27 part of me that's like oh this is
0:33:29 working too well again
0:33:31 I can't see it because I know it's there
0:33:34 on veto every time
0:33:38 eight nine because of willpower I think
0:33:40 nine is like he [ __ ] busts ass to get
0:33:42 here yeah he's Bullet Bill getting there
0:33:44 Nine's not on the chart
0:33:46 um five successes means that the subject
0:33:49 rushes to the vampire doing anything to
0:33:50 get to her
0:33:51 so you use it and there's a silence
0:33:55 between everyone that lasts upwards of
0:33:59 10 minutes and then
0:34:01 this grotesque turkey vulture descends
0:34:06 from a hole in the roof and with its
0:34:10 wings flapping it lands right on the
0:34:12 pipe next to you and the turkey vulture
0:34:15 changes shape
0:34:17 over the course of a moment there is a
0:34:21 man in obscenely tight leather pants
0:34:26 with a fishnet shirt and a leather
0:34:29 jacket over it that is covered in two
0:34:32 inch spikes he's wearing exceptionally
0:34:36 well applied makeup and has long boots
0:34:39 that come to points and he leans against
0:34:44 the pipe with his arm kind of crossing
0:34:47 over yours invading your personal space
0:34:49 instantly and you can hear Vito
0:34:53 breathing your scent in I have waited
0:34:56 for you to call me and I hope that you
0:35:00 taste the way you smell
0:35:02 and he does this thing with his tongue
0:35:06 that sense shivers down your spine as he
0:35:09 lands and he does all of that Britta is
0:35:13 just kind of freezing deer in headlights
0:35:16 she's doe eyed as usual but that is not
0:35:19 her favorite in this moment but she
0:35:21 steals her resolve that thing with the
0:35:23 tongue is just so gross that it breaks
0:35:25 her out of it to jump into Majesty
0:35:27 gorgeous and Afraid
0:35:30 that's the way I like
0:35:31 I'm gonna stab us right through his rib
0:35:35 cage directly into his heart okay that's
0:35:37 initiative yeah I think we're I think
0:35:39 we're here I think we're here
0:35:40 that's enough yeah forever
0:35:46 I hope you brought your gun especially
0:35:48 for you I did not
0:35:55 Vegeta says is 21.
0:35:59 anyone topping that Oh I thought you
0:36:03 were gonna say is anyone topping Vito
0:36:04 Santos really uncomfortable hey I'm a
0:36:08 10. he has a 10 on his courage check and
0:36:11 then with his actions he leans down
0:36:15 and traces his tongue along the length
0:36:19 of your hand and forearm the part that's
0:36:22 cuffed
0:36:24 I can taste your Goosebumps
0:36:27 it is like you are alive
0:36:30 so who's next brother your move
0:36:33 I'm sorry but I just have a technical
0:36:35 question I don't know

0:36:42 well I do have blush of Health
0:36:45 so I don't know if that actually
0:36:46 functions to give you Goosebumps and I
0:36:49 want to know now

0:36:53 right now is a six
0:36:56 yeah I can yeah me yeah you're you're on
0:36:59 Humanity
0:37:01 so he traces his tongue his like hips
0:37:05 move
0:37:06 suggestively I'm going to stutter out
0:37:10 the words
0:37:12 I'm gonna need some help as I pop my
0:37:14 Majesty yes my
0:37:18 mic so there's one more willpower spent
0:37:20 um and as he calls her his kitten every
0:37:25 disgusting word somehow seems reflective
0:37:27 of everything that makes Brita appealing
0:37:30 nothing that he can do once the Majesty
0:37:33 is up can tear down the way that Brita
0:37:36 projects herself into the room and the
0:37:38 way that people just now want do what
0:37:43 she wants my Monument of sin foreign
0:37:50 strikes and then I'm going to use try to
0:37:52 use dominate on him okay I think Johnny
0:37:54 is up next to the 13 leaping out of the
0:37:56 obfuscation he will plunge a stake
0:37:59 directly into where he assumes the heart
0:38:02 is my little bunny
0:38:05 will spend one of his uh gifted
0:38:08 willpower uh to drive a stake through
0:38:10 him let's see if we can silence him
0:38:15 six successes to stake five successes
0:38:18 were rolling over into damage uh veto
0:38:21 has an additional two dice of soak
0:38:23 against staking attempts because of the
0:38:25 bones he has wrapped around his heart
0:38:30 Johnny will spend a point of blood to
0:38:33 gain five automatic successes on damage
0:38:36 Daddy YouTube
0:38:40 eight damage he has two successes untook
0:38:43 and will take six levels of lethal
0:38:45 damage and just as his hand is reaching
0:38:50 for Buddha's hair so he can run his
0:38:52 fingers through uh hers across her scalp
0:38:55 he freezes in place
0:38:58 I'm not your kitten
0:39:00 and she wipes her arm off as well as she
0:39:04 can a little impeded by the Cuffs but is
0:39:07 attempting to scoot away it like sticks
0:39:10 Johnny leans down to the staked uh veto
0:39:13 and hisses into his ear I'm gonna burn
0:39:16 that down that house and that thing in
0:39:19 the basement please don't antagonize
0:39:21 them win quietly doesn't really try she
0:39:25 attempts to try and stay concealed
0:39:28 but she definitely empties out her
0:39:31 little messenger bag that she carries
0:39:32 everywhere with her and just throws it
0:39:34 over his head secures it hey um Britta
0:39:38 Neil sort of like Steps out from behind
0:39:41 I feel like you should be able to kick
0:39:42 this man in the head but uh if we let
0:39:45 you out of the Cuffs are you gonna go
0:39:47 full moon anything okay so I guess we
0:39:50 didn't talk about this part of the plan
0:39:51 then right you're gonna take him away
0:39:53 and some of us stay here with Brita
0:39:54 until he's gone we're gonna we will take
0:39:56 I like the sound of that idea I'll I'll
0:39:59 load him up in the Suburban and miles
0:40:02 and I'll move them to a secure location
0:40:03 three you guys
0:40:05 either stay here or you can head out on
0:40:08 foot we'll head out we're going straight
0:40:12 before you go actually Johnny Could you
0:40:15 um and she lifts up the Cuffs I don't
0:40:18 know if we do this now or once you guys
0:40:20 have gotten him wherever you I think
0:40:22 Neil and I can get you out of them I
0:40:24 would rather yeah
0:40:27 are you still projecting Majesty oh good
0:40:32 question
0:40:33 I forgot to narrate stopping when you
0:40:36 lift up the Cuffs Johnny nods and just
0:40:39 reflexively reaches up and just snaps
0:40:41 the uh the Cuffs apart with that snap
0:40:44 Brita realizes and it instantly turns
0:40:46 off Majesty
0:40:47 uh oh
0:40:50 um okay when could you uh
0:40:52 uh win reaches out and kind of bear hugs
0:40:55 Brita keep pinning her arms at her sides
0:40:58 Johnny kind of blinks and looks at his
0:41:00 hands a little bit and kind of realizes
0:41:02 what happens and kind of just ashamedly
0:41:04 picks uh Scoops up veto and kind of
0:41:06 starts heading out towards the Suburban
0:41:08 I'm sorry Johnny that was my fault I
0:41:10 we're all learning kid don't worry about
0:41:11 it I don't know this is a weird weird
0:41:13 bad bad day let's keep it all calm we're
0:41:16 gonna go take this and we're gonna
0:41:17 offload him at the Chantry right now I'm
0:41:20 gonna call on the way all right call us

0:41:30 Johnny uh puts him in the back pop some
0:41:34 morally into his mouth lights up and
0:41:37 goes jumps in the driver's seat and
0:41:39 starts driving once miles is also loaded
0:41:42 up and has eyes on veto kind of meekly
0:41:45 from inside the hug
0:41:46 Bretta looks at a wrists and says
0:41:48 actually um to get this off I think I so
0:41:51 probably will need some help yeah that's
0:41:53 fine we'll take care of that once the
0:41:56 vehicle's gone you're good
0:41:58 brother you okay that was
0:42:01 that was not cool that was way grosser
0:42:04 than I expected it to be I don't know
0:42:05 what the hell I was expecting but that
0:42:06 was not that not that was about as gross
0:42:10 as I was expecting to be honest then I'm
0:42:13 sorry you know you could have brought
0:42:15 that up when we were talking about this
0:42:17 like I know that we need him for
0:42:18 politics and stuff but also there's a
0:42:21 big part of me that thinks maybe you
0:42:23 should just shoot that guy right in the
0:42:24 [ __ ] head
0:42:25 or the balls listen
0:42:27 you might not like it but
0:42:30 part of what I am
0:42:33 being torador is
0:42:35 taking the things about myself that
0:42:38 other people could use to hurt me to
0:42:41 victimize me or to view me in that kind
0:42:44 of way without
0:42:46 me wanting that
0:42:48 and making that my own and making it my
0:42:51 own power if you need something from me
0:42:55 and I can use that
0:42:57 then that's what I want to do and yeah
0:43:00 he's
0:43:03 a lot but I knew I had you guys here to
0:43:07 back me up when Brita talks about using
0:43:10 the things that people want Neil gets
0:43:14 this look on his face that's really sad
0:43:17 but in a very like personally
0:43:20 understanding way
0:43:21 nods at her
0:43:23 yeah I get all that
0:43:25 um just because you can do it doesn't
0:43:27 mean you have to do it also if it makes
0:43:29 you feel any better you scare the [ __ ]
0:43:31 out of me maybe more than anybody else
0:43:32 does like in like a good way so that's
0:43:35 why you can make us do what you want no
0:43:38 that's not even what I was talking about
0:43:39 that's what it scares me well miles can
0:43:40 do the same thing that's
0:43:42 um it's
0:43:44 you can use that in yourself for sure
0:43:49 um but also if there was anyone
0:43:52 if we were going to war with somebody
0:43:54 I'd rather have you there with gun in
0:43:56 your hand
0:43:58 than most other people that I know I
0:44:01 know you guys wouldn't make me handled
0:44:03 well I realize that I don't remember a
0:44:05 lot but I don't
0:44:06 you guys have made it so clear that you
0:44:09 would protect me more than I would
0:44:10 protect myself
0:44:12 and that matters a lot to me that
0:44:15 matters that you guys
0:44:17 have shown that that you guys
0:44:20 want me to protect that in myself I mean
0:44:22 it showed through right when I was new
0:44:24 here and
0:44:26 maybe it's not the same but you see what
0:44:30 I'm facing when it comes to this kind of
0:44:32 thing and
0:44:33 yeah I know that you respect that that
0:44:36 you wouldn't make me do something like
0:44:37 this and I'm glad that I can help
0:44:39 there's a noble history of women
0:44:42 weaponizing femininity to [ __ ] up men
0:44:45 and if you want to be part of that proud
0:44:46 tradition I am here to back you up a
0:44:48 hundred percent
0:44:50 you'll take a couple steps back and nods
0:44:52 just recognizing a moment when win has
0:44:56 way more ability to talk here than he
0:44:58 does
0:45:00 it's one of the best weapons I've got
0:45:01 right
0:45:03 you have some pretty good [ __ ] in Your
0:45:05 Arsenal kid
0:45:07 hey win yeah
0:45:09 thanks for the hug it's one of my unsung
0:45:12 abilities
0:45:14 [Music]
0:45:19 miles it's time for you to make the
0:45:21 delivery you're taking Johnny with you
0:45:22 yes all right so you're gonna hit the
0:45:24 road and the trip affords a few moments
0:45:27 moments of conversation before the
0:45:29 meeting itself uh where are you headed
0:45:31 towards the sanctuary I will I'll make a
0:45:33 brief call before then just to confirm
0:45:36 where he would want this particular yeah
0:45:38 it would be the century yep so you're
0:45:40 telling him that you're dropping off
0:45:41 virus entosa I kind of have I feel like
0:45:44 I kind of have to I want to be prepared
0:45:45 I would like to also surprise him but I
0:45:47 feel like this is a bad time for him
0:45:49 surprise xantosa is the worst dancers
0:45:52 there's options
0:45:54 yeah when you call him he's like yes
0:45:57 bring him immediately Johnny is swapped
0:45:59 out for a more respectable vehicle for
0:46:01 you to arrive to the shanterian but has
0:46:03 ported over his tape collection and is
0:46:05 now listening to the cramps so I'm kind
0:46:07 of sitting there back there with
0:46:08 basically a sword partially unsheathed
0:46:11 just making sure he doesn't move and I
0:46:14 with it back to Johnny as he's driving
0:46:16 um this is going to be particularly hard
0:46:19 was it because of all the things that
0:46:23 Reiss has done I don't mean it hard for
0:46:26 you I mean hard for me I realize I'm
0:46:28 just trying to get you to vocalize it
0:46:30 because what he did to Marcos yes
0:46:34 so if possible maybe stay in my line of
0:46:39 sight more than likely I will be looking
0:46:42 to you than I will be to Reiss I
0:46:45 understand do you want me to interject
0:46:48 at any point if things start to get out
0:46:51 of hand it hopefully will not come to
0:46:54 that it should be a more
0:46:56 civilized conversation if I lose control
0:46:59 then yes inject remember this
0:47:03 we are gonna kill this [ __ ] at
0:47:06 some point not tonight maybe not anytime
0:47:09 soon but this is the first step on the
0:47:12 path for when we turn him to Ash I have
0:47:15 not forgotten so remember this opening
0:47:19 Skirmish it's just words and the best
0:47:23 thing that he can do to get the better
0:47:24 of us is to provoke you outside of
0:47:27 having a conversation
0:47:29 right having a conversation in this case
0:47:32 is Vengeance I cannot think of one
0:47:35 person who's done more direct harm to
0:47:37 this code than this man man seems like a
0:47:40 strong word but I am preparing myself
0:47:43 I just want you to be aware I got your
0:47:45 back on this it also means no no getting
0:47:48 into fights with Reiss either I'm gonna
0:47:50 be cool as a cucumber my friend as that
0:47:52 promise is made
0:47:54 the two of you arrive as that promise is
0:47:56 made Johnny will spend a point of
0:47:58 willpower to extend the uh the benefits
0:48:01 of iron heart so that puts you up plus
0:48:04 one difficulty for manipulations like
0:48:06 dominate and dominate presence of Mind
0:48:10 affecting vomit surgery thank you from
0:48:12 that [ __ ] from that [ __ ] yeah
0:48:14 from that [ __ ]
0:48:17 wait wait we'll stop at the Duncan
0:48:19 before we get there no
0:48:29 no probably can't go that bad it could
0:48:31 go up worse shots fired Saxon
0:48:35 I'm just saying like when you when you
0:48:38 and I go places it's a good time just a
0:48:40 [ __ ] [ __ ] show the pattern has been
0:48:42 noticed oh yeah
0:48:44 miles the last time you were here uh it
0:48:48 was to have a conversation with Reiss
0:48:50 about actually learning her medicines
0:48:53 since then the relationship is crumbled
0:48:55 to Ash
0:48:57 but maybe you can rebuild something as
0:49:00 you approach uh this you know little
0:49:02 building mostly Stone very old probably
0:49:07 one of New Haven's oldest buildings the
0:49:09 doors sort of just open for you I'm
0:49:12 having Johnny Carey zentoso and I will
0:49:14 lead us into the Chantry Johnny uh has
0:49:17 uh the staked form of zantosa cradle in
0:49:21 his arms and is wearing his leather
0:49:23 jacket the pair of sunglasses and has
0:49:25 his uh boot knife tucked away keeps the
0:49:28 goods Paces back from uh miles just to
0:49:32 give him that air of venture Authority
0:49:34 that looks good on him upon crossing the
0:49:36 threshold into this place it feels like
0:49:39 entering a haunted home there is this
0:49:43 emptiness to it everything is
0:49:45 specifically organized every wall the
0:49:49 paint the tomes that are like laid out
0:49:52 for for visitors to see everything is a
0:49:56 specific choice you see a great deal of
0:49:59 writings in Latin and to a sharp mind
0:50:04 you sort of kind of piece together that
0:50:06 none of these things are are the true
0:50:09 secrets of hermetic moment surgery but
0:50:11 our works that are simply there to be
0:50:13 shown off to guests art almost almost
0:50:16 not quite
0:50:19 Johnny gets a free hand out from under
0:50:21 zantosa and reaches into his pocket to
0:50:24 pull out a morally pops it in his mouth
0:50:26 and then looks over at you he's like
0:50:28 this would be bad taste
0:50:30 yes Johnny lights up a Zippo good and
0:50:33 takes a nice big long drag and a
0:50:34 cigarette Reiss enters seems to notice
0:50:38 Chinese smoking and the Cherry goes out
0:50:39 oh I'm sorry is there no smoking in here
0:50:41 he Winks at Reiss and Tucks it back into
0:50:44 his pocket I was unaware he would be
0:50:45 bringing your Sidekick miles I must ask
0:50:48 why are you here and why have you
0:50:51 brought me Mr zantosa serious things
0:50:54 have been there have been many Troubled
0:50:57 Waters between us in recent months I'm
0:50:59 sorry to hear you struggled how might I
0:51:01 help you
0:51:03 well there has been a change of the game
0:51:07 and I've been brought to my attention
0:51:10 that the city is going to be playing
0:51:13 host to a number of important
0:51:15 individuals so I thought it best to
0:51:18 repair the relationship between us by
0:51:22 bringing you the zentoso and by bringing
0:51:25 you this information after I have
0:51:27 received explain this information to me
0:51:29 who's coming you've heard of this about
0:51:31 attacks in the South yes I have well it
0:51:34 turns out that a number of archons have
0:51:36 been able to evacuate individuals
0:51:40 specifically the princes of these
0:51:43 domains these displaced princes will be
0:51:46 heading to New Haven uh he gives this
0:51:50 look like a few things are clicking into
0:51:52 place I was reached out to him by an
0:51:55 agent of your sire it would seem that he
0:51:58 has designs upon New York and seeks the
0:52:01 aid of the tramir
0:52:03 in addressing some of the hurdles that
0:52:07 he faces
0:52:08 Messiah spoke well with the effort and
0:52:12 help that you've provided to him and the
0:52:15 justcarian and you were here and have
0:52:19 been working in support of your sire
0:52:21 since the beginning
0:52:24 I see
0:52:25 but these moves weren't ordered by him
0:52:28 they were
0:52:29 he has not given me directives to do
0:52:31 this this is me reaching out to one end
0:52:35 miles to come to an understanding
0:52:38 we do not always see eye to eye
0:52:40 but we do need to come together
0:52:44 these princes will be looking for cracks
0:52:46 in our court they're going to look to
0:52:48 force their way in here
0:52:50 and take it over and they will seek
0:52:52 allies
0:52:54 they'll seek allies and why should I
0:52:56 side with you over them I have found
0:52:58 that I can come to an understanding
0:53:00 Messiah has explained a few things that
0:53:02 I missed and that
0:53:05 together we can be stronger than any of
0:53:08 these Outsiders they don't understand
0:53:10 this place and we understand each other
0:53:14 at least a little
0:53:16 and also allies can be temporary yes
0:53:19 they can there's no saying that these
0:53:22 princes will not get the power they seek
0:53:24 and remove those that may trouble them
0:53:27 in the future
0:53:28 I suppose what I'm asking miles is what
0:53:30 makes you different why do you have
0:53:32 spoken of as true of you because I can
0:53:35 keep my word
0:53:36 and I always have
0:53:39 very well what is your strategy for when
0:53:41 they arrive to present a united front a
0:53:44 strong court for when they appear here
0:53:47 to pull this domain together with the
0:53:49 will and the power that I have to
0:53:51 present
0:53:53 an unbreachable defense or at least one
0:53:56 that I hope is stronger than our current
0:53:58 one I see if I want I cannot deny that
0:54:02 your acquisition of Vita zentos not once
0:54:05 but twice is impressive
0:54:07 you have my interest do not squander it
0:54:10 miles
0:54:11 I hear you he snaps his fingers and a
0:54:14 hulking lumbering monster with wings
0:54:18 sharp fangs pointed ears and a body of
0:54:21 stone enters the room and you
0:54:24 immediately recognize it to be the very
0:54:27 same gargoyle that you found in Salem
0:54:29 and it enters it does not speak Rhys
0:54:33 points to veto and the hulking monster
0:54:37 makes its way over to collect it
0:54:41 Journey kind of gives a knowing grin at
0:54:43 the gargoyle and lifts up veto so that
0:54:46 it can be easily plucked from his hands
0:54:49 magargo picks him up holding veto by his
0:54:53 belt phony running into you with another
0:54:55 shantry he doesn't speak he doesn't
0:54:58 actually seem to quite have the sort of
0:55:01 awareness needed for that kind of
0:55:03 conversation I look over at Rhys I don't
0:55:06 think I've seen that around here before
0:55:07 you don't exactly visit often bring
0:55:10 video to the lab the monster nods and
0:55:13 immediately complies wandering off with
0:55:16 the prisoner
0:55:17 his uh heart is still in the right spot
0:55:20 but there seems to have been bone growth
0:55:22 surrounded
0:55:23 just for your future knowledge for what
0:55:26 is in store for him
0:55:28 his physiology will make a little
0:55:29 difference
0:55:31 it kind of like gives this knowing smile
0:55:33 well
0:55:35 I thank you for your visit miles and I
0:55:37 look forward to working with you and
0:55:39 seeing what the future holds for you and
0:55:42 your agents
0:55:43 I will see you Reiss he gestures and the
0:55:48 doors open I did basically just like
0:55:51 turret on the hill just start walking
0:55:53 out Johnny will follow behind the door
0:55:55 is shut behind you and you're outside
0:55:57 again one of the cool night sky I move
0:56:01 towards the car but get in the driver of
0:56:04 the passenger side Johnny walks over uh
0:56:07 just kind of pokes his head into the
0:56:08 driver's side to look at you it seemed
0:56:10 like it went uh less than ideal and what
0:56:14 about as well as I thought you think
0:56:15 that's enough to let him know what your
0:56:18 plans are it's enough for him to
0:56:21 hopefully be on board
0:56:23 let's get in the car if you want to
0:56:25 discuss anymore all right Johnny uh
0:56:27 mounts up pulls out the cigarette that
0:56:29 had been prematurely put out lights it
0:56:32 up and then heads out after about two
0:56:34 minutes of driving I punched the
0:56:36 dashboard about as hard as I can does it
0:56:39 buckle with potent uh no
0:56:42 it's actually not particularly hot
0:56:47 if you want me to teach you how to how
0:56:49 to smash stuff properly you let me know
0:56:52 quite possibly but when working on a
0:56:55 number of abilities that I might need in
0:56:56 the future hopefully your conversation
0:56:58 with Elsa went better than that much
0:57:01 better
0:57:02 so what's the next part of our play it
0:57:06 is
0:57:13 Reiss is your ally
0:57:15 you traded your closest friend
0:57:23 his own family
0:57:25 you replaced him with the man who killed
0:57:29 not replaced see we'll see
0:57:32 you said you'd stick to all of these
0:57:35 morals these ethics you claim to have
0:57:39 but every time they've pushed you have
0:57:41 faulted
0:57:43 you could take practice right now
0:57:46 be Prince
0:57:48 instead
0:57:49 instead you blanket your enemies
0:57:53 you're replacing up enrollments with you
0:57:56 is no change at all you are the same man
0:58:00 Johnny gets a look over you look kind of
0:58:02 concerned you all right you with me
0:58:04 having a conversation
0:58:07 oh Johnny the miles seems to be keeping
0:58:10 it together his fangs are visible in his
0:58:13 mouth Johnny what is the cost of pride
0:58:19 the cost of pride
0:58:22 I have a few paths forward God damn
0:58:25 later tonight wind's gonna want to go
0:58:28 for a drive and ask me about existential
0:58:30 things what do you mean uh not nothing
0:58:33 look
0:58:35 pride is
0:58:38 I feel like pride is for some something
0:58:39 that is for people who haven't hit and
0:58:42 bottom before so there's no value in it
0:58:45 you're gonna have to give me more than
0:58:46 just this man what what exactly are you
0:58:48 asking me here when this goes down when
0:58:51 we deal with rolands yeah we
0:58:56 have a unique opportunity here uh
0:58:58 Rollins has made himself incredibly
0:59:00 vulnerable in his own Haven how so he
0:59:03 sent all of his ghouls away what why
0:59:06 would he do something like that because
0:59:07 of whatever the mulcavian prince did to
0:59:10 him the paranoia has driven him to push
0:59:14 everyone away he is now ordering in food
0:59:18 apparently
0:59:19 I scooped up the ghouls
0:59:22 so you basically have the back door to
0:59:24 his Haven yes
0:59:26 so when you're talking about the cost of
0:59:29 Pride you're talking about whether you
0:59:32 confront Upton as the honor of your clan
0:59:36 would dictate I don't know or whether
0:59:38 you just sneak in the back and put a
0:59:40 stake in his chest while he's sleeping
0:59:42 very much like it less when you put it
0:59:43 that way but yes one way is my preferred
0:59:49 way I'd much rather
0:59:51 make my claim make my argument as it is
0:59:55 and finish it with two men standing I
1:00:00 will point this out as incompetent of a
1:00:04 prince as Upton ruins is
1:00:06 there is a reason he is still prince in
1:00:09 this domain and that is because he is
1:00:11 old and his ability with his disciplines
1:00:15 is terrifying
1:00:17 the danger isn't to myself necessarily
1:00:20 I'm willing to risk that
1:00:22 what are the odds with some preparation
1:00:25 still somewhat in his favor he's not
1:00:28 much of a fighter as far as I can tell
1:00:29 odds in his favor doesn't sound like a
1:00:31 risk that I think we should ever think
1:00:33 about taking right so then if he snaps
1:00:36 his fingers and suddenly I stop and
1:00:39 start dancing to his tune who knows what
1:00:41 the hell he might do right so that means
1:00:44 embracing things that I have not wanted
1:00:46 to do in a lot of ways
1:00:49 hmm
1:00:52 so embracing things you don't want to do
1:00:54 means
1:00:56 simply taking care of this the Smart Way
1:00:59 smart way is one way to put it but it's
1:01:01 going to involve me
1:01:03 most likely
1:01:05 subsuming and others will
1:01:07 I'm taking over their body whose will
1:01:10 probably a goal we're talking about
1:01:13 killing the prince and you're concerned
1:01:16 about possessing one of his goals
1:01:19 yes you realize if we kill the prince
1:01:21 his ghouls are pretty much all but
1:01:23 forfeit anyways right
1:01:26 I would try to maintain those services
1:01:29 well that means that you would be
1:01:31 bonding them to you
1:01:33 I would ask well that's not really a
1:01:35 question because if you if they say no
1:01:37 they're dead they can choose that
1:01:39 problem that's correct I don't have
1:01:41 another offering to them I can't own all
1:01:43 of them all I'm I'm not saying that this
1:01:45 is wrong I'm just saying that I'm
1:01:48 pointing out that possessing them in
1:01:51 this moment of going after the prince is
1:01:54 not completely different from taking
1:01:56 them over after he's dead
1:01:58 I get it it's a different line though
1:02:01 it's you got some weird lines my friend
1:02:04 when it comes to using the powers of
1:02:07 dominate yes
1:02:08 hmm
1:02:10 so your thought is we just possess one
1:02:13 of his ghouls we go in during the day
1:02:15 that would be my first thought it's
1:02:17 going to be tough you know that right I
1:02:19 was hoping to see if wind would low Taps
1:02:22 the run back up on that but yes it'll
1:02:25 still be difficult but it's possibly the
1:02:27 safest route
1:02:28 talk with Neil see if he's gonna get any
1:02:30 other precautions we should be worried
1:02:32 for and stake him and then I would come
1:02:34 as myself at that early night
1:02:37 I see a stake him during the day and
1:02:40 then arrive a little bit later once
1:02:42 you've woken up to finish things off
1:02:45 yeah
1:02:46 miles
1:02:48 if we do this
1:02:49 there are a million other risks
1:02:52 and calls to action that we're going to
1:02:55 have to take and go through after we've
1:02:58 put a stake through Upton Rollins's
1:03:00 heart so if you want to start pushing
1:03:02 your luck before that for your pride
1:03:05 I get it but I think we should take all
1:03:08 the advantages we can either way I got
1:03:11 your back
1:03:12 all right but we have to keep this
1:03:15 unfortunately somewhat hidden less
1:03:17 people that know about this the better I
1:03:19 also mean within our Circle oh I
1:03:22 understand all right so I've started
1:03:25 putting things in motion for it
1:03:27 we need to deliver this victory over the
1:03:29 Abbott
1:03:30 that'll be the easiest way to get the
1:03:32 rest of the court is a favorable opinion
1:03:34 I might also want to call a rant for the
1:03:37 bruja right now there is no bruja
1:03:41 Prevagen weathers nominally left it in
1:03:44 my hands but
1:03:46 a conversation that we had on his way
1:03:49 out of the domain does not give me that
1:03:53 position in my opinion and I can get
1:03:56 damn well assure that it does not give
1:03:58 me the position in the eyes the rest of
1:04:00 the clan of the city we might want to
1:04:02 hammer that out before we make a move
1:04:04 whatever may work but removing rolands
1:04:09 is an obstacle will make it easier to
1:04:11 not have to do what he wanted to Amara
1:04:13 and it may sway some of that opinion
1:04:16 back all I'm saying is is that if we're
1:04:19 gonna throw the court into flux let's
1:04:21 have as many of the pieces of the Court
1:04:23 stable so that we're changing as few
1:04:26 things as possible you feel me yeah
1:04:29 Neil conducted his ritual out in
1:04:33 Wallingford yeah successful we're ready
1:04:36 as far as I could tell so we're ready to
1:04:39 start hunting down Cynthia whenever
1:04:41 we're ready
1:04:42 how is he doing after I saw his Haven
1:04:48 it's kind of like uh
1:04:50 reminded me of you after Marcos but you
1:04:53 seem to Tire yourself out
1:04:55 I think if I had let him go he would
1:04:58 have gone on till morning torped himself
1:05:01 I had destroyed the thing the rest of
1:05:03 that was a release less I was more in
1:05:07 control I think Neil blamed the entire
1:05:11 neighborhood for what happened to his
1:05:13 Haven I'd be careful about bringing him
1:05:16 anywhere close to there
1:05:17 noted I'll put out word that I want to
1:05:20 rant I don't know when that can happen I
1:05:23 don't talk to Neil about steps to trying
1:05:25 to find Cynthia right and then having
1:05:28 good news to deliver to the Gemini
1:05:30 League after the deed
1:05:32 like a successful raid upon the Sabbat
1:05:35 will be a good way to establish your
1:05:38 Praxis on a good foot that was my
1:05:40 thought also
1:05:41 see if you can I know wind has been
1:05:44 tracking them see if we can't figure out
1:05:46 about getting Jane back
1:05:48 if we can manage it in this period I
1:05:51 know there's a lot going on so
1:05:55 it's going to make the rent a whole lot
1:05:56 harder without her

1:07:10 you okay
1:07:12 you're alone in a car with Miles he's
1:07:14 frustrating turning like if you want to
1:07:16 learn how to smash properly let me know
1:07:23 gotta love that
1:07:26 I'm sorry you look stressed yes
1:07:31 are you trying to talk fan art now
1:07:34 please

1:07:38 not draw us
1:07:42 let's not draw a sensual tussle between
1:07:44 miles and Johnny please oh we'd hate
1:07:46 that we'd hate to see a lot of fan art
1:07:49 of miles and Johnny Johnny teaching
1:07:51 miles how to wrestle bonus points if
1:07:54 they're in a tree
1:07:55 that's an in-choke
1:07:58 so are they Giles or money
1:08:00 money oh they gotta be money I always I
1:08:04 always find that it helps to grease up a
1:08:05 little bit when you learn how to Grapple
1:08:07 because it makes it a little bit more
1:08:08 difficult to really get a hold like a
1:08:10 greco-roma
1:08:13 and we'll get some like nice olive oil
1:08:15 and just kind of drizzle it I assume it
1:08:17 would be sex important but money's
1:08:19 really good how is win the horny one
1:08:22 well she is so I know I'm not fighting
