0:00:30 the quarterly was pursued into the
0:00:32 Boston Subway t-line by a mysterious
0:00:34 invisible Assassin from the web of
0:00:36 knives
0:00:37 in order to escape when navigated the
0:00:39 group passed a wave of destructive
0:00:41 specters lingering there still from the
0:00:43 great Molasses Flood the ganger was
0:00:46 plunged into a world of nightmares
0:00:47 Johnny sought the help of Kabir and
0:00:49 together the group managed to Rouse when
0:00:51 in time to meet with Arabella Romans
0:00:54 Arabella revealed not only that she was
0:00:56 searching for The Architects but she
0:00:58 knew where it was Neil spotted demonic
0:01:01 corruption in arabella's Aura Arabella
0:01:03 gave the mark of her dignitas to Miles
0:01:05 imploring his Aid in retrieving their
0:01:07 codex from an abandoned Premier Chantry
0:01:10 in Salem
0:01:11 [Music]
0:01:13 after the meeting the woman who was
0:01:17 possessed by the Kindred comes through a
0:01:19 witch and is very confused about how she
0:01:21 ended up on the rooftop and sort of
0:01:24 frightened she ends up needing a little
0:01:25 bit of a guidance and a nudge to get off
0:01:29 the roof and go about her business and a
0:01:31 little bit of mind-wipiness to just
0:01:34 settle that all down miles takes care of
0:01:36 her memories and the group of you head
0:01:38 back to the hotel yes okay shortly after
0:01:41 arriving to the hotel group of you find
0:01:43 your ways into your room and get a
0:01:45 chance to relax after all of The
0:01:47 Oddities and intensity that you've
0:01:49 experienced since you arrival to Boston
0:01:51 miles actually gets a phone call as
0:01:53 things draw closer to Dawn I will go out
0:01:56 to our balcony and take the phone call
0:01:58 Miles arabello I am seated at my desk at
0:02:03 this time and I'm beginning to make
0:02:05 preferences for the foray into the
0:02:09 Chantry
0:02:10 um what is it that your quarter is going
0:02:12 to need in the meantime we're gonna need
0:02:14 a place to stay that's safe we're in a
0:02:16 hotel right now that's moderately safe
0:02:18 but a hotel it's a good hotel if such a
0:02:23 thing exists should have saw the place
0:02:25 we were staying before that sounds
0:02:27 terrible it was
0:02:29 so I have access to a handful of
0:02:34 Victorian houses that you can use for
0:02:36 the meantime I'll give you a handful of
0:02:37 addresses and you may make use of anyone
0:02:41 you prefer fantastic so we'll be getting
0:02:43 the address into you by the way after
0:02:46 that why don't we talk
0:02:49 um Hardware we do need it we came up
0:02:52 light thinking this was a mostly a meet
0:02:54 and greet and maybe just a talk we're
0:02:56 almost totally unprepared we have a
0:02:59 couple main weapons but nothing else all
0:03:01 right
0:03:02 why don't you give me a list of what you
0:03:04 think your group is going to need in
0:03:05 order to be fighting fit for the journey
0:03:07 uh assortment of uh body armors
0:03:10 high-powered rifles how many rifles hmm
0:03:14 three I'm talking automatic or something
0:03:16 longer distance
0:03:17 one long distance to automatic one of
0:03:19 them preferably a shotgun of some sort
0:03:21 perfect what else
0:03:24 do you have any way to store blood that
0:03:28 we can trust I do have a mean to store
0:03:30 anxiety
0:03:32 um was there some sort of hunting issue
0:03:34 no will we find a hunt once we get going
0:03:37 here but if we're traveling abroad it
0:03:39 becomes more difficult for say me did
0:03:42 you resolve the issue with your last
0:03:43 Haven you mean the fire yes I'm in the
0:03:45 fire we're working on it I see why don't
0:03:48 I call some blood dolls and send them
0:03:50 your way fantastic I figured the less
0:03:54 time you spend out on the streets
0:03:56 um roughing it the better off you are
0:03:58 that's true especially in this city
0:04:00 please don't kill any of the blood dolls
0:04:02 not a problem uh was that the extent of
0:04:04 what you needed in terms of equipment I
0:04:06 mean after that we can start talking
0:04:07 about like I don't know small explosive
0:04:10 devices I don't trust record with that I
0:04:13 mean it's more fun that way
0:04:16 um other than that uh you happen to have
0:04:19 any silver I know of a person who can I
0:04:22 can purchase silver ammunition from okay
0:04:24 that might be okay it's just we keep
0:04:27 running into things that it could be
0:04:29 useful against and you can churn for
0:04:31 lupines after the one that I killed a
0:04:33 little I see are you not no
0:04:37 do you just not run into them or
0:04:39 something well the Lupine was a result
0:04:41 of Sir button I'm here in the city
0:04:42 because they're in the Sabbat Fair do
0:04:44 you know if there's anything particular
0:04:46 that we should be arming ourselves with
0:04:47 against
0:04:49 Arrangements all right so if you don't
0:04:51 need any other weapons I'm going to tap
0:04:54 a contact for an inscription I need some
0:04:57 place to repair a katana
0:04:59 Hana yep
0:05:01 I will repair your katano we had a small
0:05:05 asomite problem it notched my blade I'm
0:05:08 sorry a small assomite problem in New
0:05:11 York I see and now there are also smites
0:05:13 in Boston apparently who are they
0:05:15 contracted for
0:05:17 I think Neil and you have not killed
0:05:20 Neil I mean we just got him back from
0:05:22 being dead it seems kind of gauche oh it
0:05:25 doesn't need breaking even at that point
0:05:26 and eliminating the acid my threat well
0:05:29 it seems like we also have asomites
0:05:31 coming to New Haven at this point too
0:05:32 like friendly ones friendly asomites
0:05:35 friendly asamites right so I don't know
0:05:38 if your friend Neil has warned you but
0:05:42 his sire trafficked with asomites quite
0:05:44 frequently and ended up being blood
0:05:46 hunted within the domain the reason that
0:05:49 this happened was because when asamites
0:05:51 leave the secret Hideaway they go to
0:05:55 kill Kindred and disrupt camera the
0:05:57 politics if there are friendly asamites
0:06:00 who are coming to New Haven those are
0:06:02 simply asomites who have not killed
0:06:04 whatever Kindred they've come for I
0:06:06 think something is happening
0:06:08 that's alarming what has happened I
0:06:11 don't know for sure we haven't had a
0:06:13 huge don't download but and you've
0:06:15 allowed them near into your company
0:06:17 without knowing exactly what's happening
0:06:18 one of them saved us so what I
0:06:21 understand that you don't care but it
0:06:23 means something in Kindred Society it
0:06:26 means that they were making a purchase
0:06:28 so now these acid mites are in Boston
0:06:30 well one
0:06:32 we've seen one
0:06:34 miles you are infuriating sometimes
0:06:37 sorry I haven't had a lot of practice
0:06:39 with all this outside the realm stuff
0:06:41 what does that even mean I don't know
0:06:43 about the asomites there aren't any of
0:06:45 that I've been mostly focused with
0:06:47 Sabbat in the New Haven allow me to warn
0:06:50 you the Shabbat attack as wild dogs the
0:06:55 asomites or precise assassins if they
0:06:58 have come it is because they intend to
0:07:00 eliminate someone and there is a very
0:07:02 very good chance that they were hired by
0:07:05 the Sabbat of New York
0:07:07 think there I can get back to you but I
0:07:10 don't I think there's more going on get
0:07:11 back to me yes anyways as for your
0:07:15 Tana yes
0:07:16 I will make the arrangements to see to
0:07:18 it that things it is repaired this
0:07:21 should settle everything you need in
0:07:22 terms of raw equipment do you also need
0:07:25 a vehicle yes no wait I have one I'm
0:07:28 sorry no we have a vehicle you have a
0:07:30 vehicle yes good what else do you need
0:07:33 right is there any kind of like primer
0:07:36 you can give us on the things we should
0:07:37 expect inside this place that I can hand
0:07:39 off to somebody else to read I think I
0:07:41 can make some sort of arrangement there
0:07:43 we go I would like to be informed at
0:07:44 least now uh
0:07:47 the inscriptions yes you're mentioning
0:07:50 that I can acquire three of them whether
0:07:52 in each inscription is the ability to
0:07:54 perform a ritual as a one-time use what
0:07:57 rituals is it that your quarter is going
0:07:58 to need access to scratch that put
0:08:01 someone who is competent in this uh area
0:08:04 of expertise on the phone Neil I need
0:08:06 you what what's up the sliding door and
0:08:10 hold the phone out Neil oh yeah actually
0:08:12 yeah you're right speaking of fun there
0:08:14 we go please pay attention
0:08:16 yeah hi if you were to arm your cautery
0:08:19 with the rituals that they do not
0:08:20 possess what rituals would they be
0:08:23 uh
0:08:25 from what Paradigm hermetic Pharma
0:08:28 surgery oh okay
0:08:31 um give me Neil like gives miles a weird
0:08:34 look like why are you having me on the
0:08:36 phone with Arabella asking about
0:08:38 thamaturgy does not say anything it was
0:08:40 just like uh she's offering to give us
0:08:42 inscriptions for rituals and you want my
0:08:46 opinion yes because I don't know
0:08:48 anything about magic why do you think I
0:08:51 would there's something wrong because
0:08:53 you know about weird stuff I mean it's a
0:08:55 little hurtful
0:08:56 but uh I don't know like let me
0:09:00 I mean what are we walking into in there
0:09:02 like what would you suggest all right so
0:09:05 why don't you just put miles back on the
0:09:06 phone if you're asking what I should
0:09:08 should suggest smiles here
0:09:10 so you have a thought material I'm sorry
0:09:13 what
0:09:14 intriguing
0:09:16 a secret between colleagues now I will
0:09:19 make arrangements to have the
0:09:20 inscriptions created and I will provide
0:09:21 them to you I will ensure on the perhaps
0:09:24 one of the inscriptions helps with your
0:09:26 concerns regarding being summoned
0:09:28 excellent an odd method but I think I
0:09:31 think you will appreciate it now with
0:09:34 everything in order I'm going to need a
0:09:36 week to acquire everything for you that
0:09:40 should actually give us an opportunity
0:09:42 to have some of my agents Scout the area
0:09:45 and once the Chancery is probably cased
0:09:48 we can begin sounds fantastic how weak
0:09:52 is about what we need to recover in
0:09:54 general I look forward to hearing from
0:09:55 you miles call me when you're ready
0:09:57 we'll do
0:10:00 [Music]
0:10:03 the show Begins the week of waiting and
0:10:06 as the cautery makes preparations Neil
0:10:09 and Johnny make their way back to the
0:10:11 site where the fire took place in hopes
0:10:14 of gathering information and finding out
0:10:15 precisely who it is that's responsible
0:10:17 for striking against them when you get
0:10:19 there it is no longer uh there's no
0:10:22 longer tape but the area is kind of
0:10:23 closed off because the fire was actually
0:10:26 enough to where this whole building may
0:10:28 need uh to be shut down and may be
0:10:32 condemned oh man it's it's like really
0:10:35 upsetting seeing it from the outside
0:10:37 like just because we were in there and I
0:10:39 I don't know I just those thoughts don't
0:10:41 cross your mind no really why is that
0:10:44 building upsetting because we were in it
0:10:46 when it was on fire you there's no like
0:10:48 emotional connection or memory that just
0:10:51 sort of sticks in your head that you
0:10:52 can't get rid of ask me to get more one
0:10:54 more inside maybe okay speaking of which
0:10:57 quiet Johnny goes and takes up kind of
0:10:59 like Peaks a look around cracks open the
0:11:02 the uh the door
0:11:03 you hear anything listen out to just see
0:11:06 if there's anybody in the building or if
0:11:07 it actually is abandoned inside the
0:11:09 building you can actually hear the
0:11:11 sounds of like pigeons that have made
0:11:13 their way in and rats that kind of Crawl
0:11:16 Through the space but that's about it no
0:11:18 nothing really specific nothing crazy
0:11:21 Johnny nods like that's satisfying to
0:11:23 him he ushers you inside closes the door
0:11:26 or gives a quick sweep around outside
0:11:28 looking to make sure no one's following
0:11:30 closes the door behind us so do me a
0:11:33 favor as they're sort of like walking
0:11:34 through the building up towards where
0:11:36 they had been staying walk me through
0:11:38 what you saw in the hallway
0:11:40 like what happened what happened in the
0:11:42 hallway
0:11:43 all I remember is passing out and then
0:11:46 waking up to you covered in blood and
0:11:48 bodies well when you woke us up my uh my
0:11:53 blood was pretty fired up
0:11:55 no point intended I managed to put the
0:11:57 uh fire out for the most part and then
0:12:00 figured that whoever had said it was
0:12:02 likely still waiting outside so I burst
0:12:04 into the hallway and that's when I Saw
0:12:06 Three Goons it didn't really
0:12:09 strike me as
0:12:11 vampiric or even really knowing a lot
0:12:14 about our society just three guys hired
0:12:19 muscle with weapons that they didn't
0:12:21 necessarily know were going to be
0:12:22 effective but were effective against us
0:12:25 blades not guns you know yeah did you
0:12:29 get a read on like if it was hired or if
0:12:31 it was implanted or honestly Neil I was
0:12:35 fading so quick no all I could focus on
0:12:39 was putting them down as fast as I could
0:12:41 yeah I mean that makes a lot of sense
0:12:44 um it was loud you know that was a
0:12:47 pretty Brazen over the last week or so
0:12:49 the last couple of days Lex has there
0:12:51 been any mention in like the paper or
0:12:53 anything of arson or arrest the fire is
0:12:56 not discussed at all okay yeah honestly
0:12:58 in the grand scheme of things it was a
0:13:00 small small little house fire that
0:13:02 didn't actually bring the building down
0:13:04 or do any proper damage outside of the
0:13:06 one main building I mean granted this
0:13:09 place might have to be uh shut down for
0:13:12 some extensive Renovations but sure the
0:13:16 fire is not really that noticeable in a
0:13:18 city this size and you know and the
0:13:20 bodies end up being disappeared by these
0:13:22 by the uh The Scourge it's true yeah
0:13:24 that's fair so at least the scourge took
0:13:27 care of stuff just kind of hoping we
0:13:29 could find I don't know Finding I I was
0:13:32 pretty sure it was everyone says my help
0:13:34 it might I can't imagine that they've
0:13:36 already pulled the carpets out just just
0:13:38 anything any little any little droplets
0:13:40 any little patterns something because
0:13:42 like you know I was pretty sure it was
0:13:44 Arabella but she
0:13:46 was telling the truth at least as far as
0:13:48 I could tell when she said she didn't do
0:13:49 it Johnny uh pushes open the door to the
0:13:51 apartment that we had been in the
0:13:53 carpets have definitely been pulled ah
0:13:56 whoever the cleaners that kind of came
0:13:58 through here were very very thorough
0:14:01 however in this like very dark kind of
0:14:05 damp space you can kind of see these
0:14:08 like water stains that have like soaked
0:14:11 through the floor
0:14:12 and Neil you do notice strange patterns
0:14:16 about the water they got some weird
0:14:17 splotches on the walls and some marks on
0:14:20 the ceiling I don't suppose you can just
0:14:22 read weird [ __ ] like that uh
0:14:25 well
0:14:26 and Neil looks around to read weird [ __ ]
0:14:30 like that you take a look around and
0:14:32 give me a roll
0:14:35 what difficulty do you want for as a
0:14:37 chaos because it's set by you seven
0:14:39 seven okay so diff two seven successes
0:14:43 nasty with seven successes you look at
0:14:46 the water and the water is like a mirror
0:14:50 and the marks make you feel like this
0:14:52 happened because of the group of you
0:14:54 this was retribution something that you
0:14:57 asked for and then you hear the chirping
0:14:59 of the pigeons
0:15:01 and you realize birds are watching the
0:15:05 rats are listening
0:15:06 and the vermin
0:15:08 are The Messengers through which this
0:15:11 Revenge has brought to you
0:15:14 Neil looks around a little bit more and
0:15:17 he kind of sags and looks a little sad
0:15:18 hey man I didn't mean to put you down
0:15:20 but no no no no it's not that um
0:15:24 you know you know when you're friends
0:15:26 with somebody or somebody likes you a
0:15:28 lot and then all of a sudden you know
0:15:29 they're real mad at you and like it just
0:15:31 hits a little bit harder does that make
0:15:33 sense then if like some Rando was mad at
0:15:35 you I I guess I can kind of understand
0:15:38 this
0:15:40 um I think you know was a message from
0:15:44 as a retribution I mean we kind of knew
0:15:45 that right we knew it was targeted we
0:15:47 knew it was targeted directly at us
0:15:48 right
0:15:49 um but who are we talking here who else
0:15:52 what other Clan do you think we pissed
0:15:54 off
0:15:54 besides Arabella that night
0:15:57 well we did uh Papa a suit onReiss yeah
0:16:03 but I may have uh I may have helped
0:16:06 Watcher I mean everybody's listening
0:16:07 down uh sure yeah you're listening who's
0:16:12 listening
0:16:14 pigeon takes off them you think this is
0:16:16 the NOS oh yeah yeah I do Johnny kind of
0:16:20 like stands back a little bit and like
0:16:22 makes kind of like a a face like he's
0:16:24 whistling but doesn't actually uh
0:16:26 whistle the things you know
0:16:29 so here's the deal man
0:16:32 um we know that Shaw was connected right
0:16:35 he was working for the web I mean I gave
0:16:37 information for the weather that's why
0:16:39 they like me when we get back to New
0:16:40 Haven we're gonna have to really I mean
0:16:42 you and me
0:16:44 sit down well the new primage man show
0:16:47 us kid right yeah so you think he's the
0:16:49 one who called this hit I don't know if
0:16:51 it is I mean the clan
0:16:53 every Clan has a thing right like every
0:16:56 Clan has a rallying cry the NOS are no
0:16:59 different
0:17:00 do they oh we shot sir uh Prince Warwick
0:17:04 Providence he's part of Longboat too
0:17:07 right yeah yeah he is
0:17:10 I mean he's the one who has been setting
0:17:12 up the web like that's his thing Shaw
0:17:15 was his child as part of the web which
0:17:17 is the whole NOS
0:17:20 house of cards I wonder how tight pen
0:17:23 Dragon Warwick and King are don't know
0:17:27 because the North's making a move on us
0:17:29 I wonder if Pendragon knows about that I
0:17:31 don't know if he cares he might care so
0:17:34 much is that it's questioning his
0:17:37 authority by making a move of petty
0:17:40 revenge against us when he's got other
0:17:42 plans just something to think about it I
0:17:44 mean it's completely something to think
0:17:45 about but they I mean they are still on
0:17:47 the cam tossing around a couple of Boons
0:17:50 just to say hey is it okay
0:17:51 all I'm saying is that uh and he kind of
0:17:54 gets a little bit quiet about this I
0:17:56 mean if you want you can just think it
0:18:00 what if you don't want to say it you can
0:18:02 just think it it kind of Shivers a
0:18:04 little bit at the remembering the time
0:18:06 that you kind of just broke into say
0:18:08 things into the head if you if you if
0:18:10 you don't want to miss words he closes
0:18:12 his eyes and kind of like nods like he's
0:18:15 kind of accepting an uncomfortable truth
0:18:18 and thinks into his head that if
0:18:21 operation Longbow is worrying about
0:18:25 petty little power struggles that could
0:18:28 potentially be in our favor it's
0:18:30 possible Neil says out loud so if we do
0:18:33 and this he continues this line of
0:18:35 thought if we do have to negotiate with
0:18:38 Pendragon having knowledge about Shaw's
0:18:43 kid or Warwick making moves behind his
0:18:47 back might be something worthwhile to
0:18:50 have in our pocket
0:18:51 something to keep in mind if the
0:18:53 opportunity to talk comes up if he
0:18:54 doesn't know about it and we spring on
0:18:56 him in the moment bruja even an elder
0:19:00 one like like Pendragon are prone to
0:19:03 little fits of
0:19:05 tantrum
0:19:06 especially when friends of theirs start
0:19:08 acting ways that they weren't expecting
0:19:10 yeah I know
0:19:11 sorry
0:19:12 it's fine so I didn't I I didn't know
0:19:15 how to do it better I'm sorry about that
0:19:16 by the way I just didn't know how to do
0:19:18 it better what's that on the street
0:19:21 earlier when I I know it was
0:19:23 uncomfortable I just I didn't know how
0:19:24 to the um
0:19:27 after that though you did something
0:19:29 that's kind of kept me a little bit more
0:19:31 centered yeah uh you were you were
0:19:34 pretty mad uh sorry about that too no
0:19:37 that's um honestly
0:19:40 it's not even my Beast
0:19:42 just something inside me gets rattled up
0:19:44 way too easy it always has ever since I
0:19:47 got embraced it's nice to have a little
0:19:49 peace and quiet like that uh thank you
0:19:52 yeah I mean if things get too loud you
0:19:55 know let me know I know what it's like
0:19:57 to see you so you read that just from
0:20:00 these water stains and the and the birds
0:20:03 and the Rats that are currently
0:20:04 scattered around in the walls yeah all
0:20:06 right Sherlock so we're walking around
0:20:08 like just having this conversation I'm
0:20:10 gonna look at like the toilet the tub
0:20:12 that like all that water is just gone at
0:20:14 this point right yeah but they're like
0:20:16 stains the stains are there but like
0:20:18 sewers and sewage there's not like a
0:20:21 pool of stagnant water there's no pool
0:20:24 of stagnant water okay yeah it's just
0:20:26 I mean I I sort of talked about it
0:20:28 before but
0:20:29 ever since I've embraced right like
0:20:31 there's the world is just patterns and
0:20:34 if you just start seeing them right like
0:20:36 you ever think about how river deltas
0:20:39 look a lot like how your veins look in a
0:20:43 human body Look a Lot how the veins look
0:20:45 inside a leaf look a lot how like Vine
0:20:48 the patterns that Vines grow up trees
0:20:50 they're all the same
0:20:51 um you just you just gotta look at them
0:20:53 different as you're talking and Johnny's
0:20:56 usually pretty active listener he'll
0:20:58 grunt along and kind of like just you
0:21:00 know in response to things he's been
0:21:02 very quiet back out in the main room
0:21:04 um and when you kind of like poke your
0:21:06 head back around the corner he's just
0:21:07 standing there staring at the the back
0:21:09 of the door where he had kind of slumped
0:21:11 down after killing the guys
0:21:13 you okay
0:21:15 oh what what's that Neil like nods his
0:21:19 head towards the door where there's
0:21:20 probably I mean there's probably not
0:21:22 blood stains at this point if cleaners
0:21:23 came through but like nods his head
0:21:25 towards the door well with your senses
0:21:26 yes okay
0:21:28 you um
0:21:29 you okay
0:21:32 yeah
0:21:35 yeah it was just a hell of a night
0:21:37 yeah
0:21:39 um
0:21:40 hey man um
0:21:42 I know the I know the sorcery thing
0:21:44 makes you uncomfortable
0:21:46 and I'm you know
0:21:49 that I can miles just outed me to
0:21:53 Arabella Rollins he did what I it was an
0:21:55 accident but that was the kind of thing
0:21:57 so that kind of thing that's why I've
0:21:58 been hiding it I like I didn't wanna I I
0:22:01 wasn't trying to be like deceptive or
0:22:04 anything I just I'm afraid you know so
0:22:07 that's just but I I wanted to apologize
0:22:09 for lying to you anyways I know it's not
0:22:12 I mean we're Kindred this is what we do
0:22:14 but you know not your friends so I just
0:22:17 I'm sorry
0:22:18 thanks for coming out and stuff I get it
0:22:21 Neil
0:22:23 um
0:22:24 what you do is never going to sit right
0:22:26 with me
0:22:27 oh my God something about it that
0:22:30 I feel like deep deep down that's just
0:22:35 wrong
0:22:36 but at the same time
0:22:39 when I think about that
0:22:40 I don't know if I have a leg to stand on
0:22:43 and telling you what you're doing is
0:22:45 wrong
0:22:46 well so here's the deal right you want
0:22:48 to make a you want to make like a like a
0:22:50 gentleman's agreement here
0:22:52 if I ever go off the deep end and I
0:22:54 start getting into [ __ ] like Arabella
0:22:56 got into you know what kind of [ __ ] do
0:22:58 you mean
0:22:59 demon [ __ ] he kind of like lowers his
0:23:02 brow a little bit and kind of gives you
0:23:04 a wide eye of like yeah I mean in theory
0:23:07 right in theory or fully destroy them
0:23:11 all but you know after what I saw
0:23:14 when we were talking around the rooftop
0:23:15 the other night she's uh she's doing
0:23:18 some dark [ __ ] like by by my standards
0:23:22 so just something to keep an eye out and
0:23:25 if I ever start showing signs like that
0:23:27 you don't have a conversation with
0:23:28 people first but if you know you know we
0:23:33 will
0:23:34 uh speaking of which not to Super change
0:23:37 the subject
0:23:38 um

0:24:52 some answers about uh the Visions you've
0:24:54 been having
0:24:55 but um I wouldn't
0:24:57 I wouldn't ask too many questions about
0:24:59 it it just might be an opportunity for
0:25:01 you to learn more about the shadow lens
0:25:02 just listen and learn probably the best
0:25:05 call All right we don't really know
0:25:07 what's going on with you so we don't
0:25:09 know if what we may know may is
0:25:11 dangerous do you think they'd have any
0:25:13 way to help Romeo they might be able to
0:25:16 contact him if he's following you around
0:25:19 we can certainly ask I just don't know
0:25:22 if it's um we've heard some different
0:25:24 things about them the Giovanni yeah
0:25:28 this is definitely going to be one of
0:25:29 those go with your gut
0:25:31 all right
0:25:32 well I'll be following your lead you're
0:25:35 the one who knows anything about this
0:25:36 subject I really hope you don't need to
0:25:38 eat those words but I won't well I trust
0:25:41 your confidence all right we're supposed
0:25:42 to meet at the Prudential Center ready
0:25:44 when you are the two of you uh make your
0:25:47 way to the potential and uh outside is a
0:25:50 kind of smaller Irish gentleman very
0:25:53 well dressed in like Grays and Earthen
0:25:56 tones and he makes his way over to the
0:26:00 two of you greetings welcome to uh the
0:26:02 prude and uh you know why don't we uh
0:26:07 head on inside uh so I have to ask
0:26:10 um what do you know about the Boston
0:26:12 anomaly that it's reached all the way to
0:26:15 New Haven interesting very interesting
0:26:16 uh come on in he like brings you in kind
0:26:19 of get out of the way for him there's
0:26:21 this cold breeze that rolls with him as
0:26:25 he enters the Prudential the two of you
0:26:28 get onto an elevator and it kind of
0:26:30 quickly zips up to one of the higher
0:26:32 floors I mean it looks overlooks all of
0:26:35 Boston at the highest point there is a
0:26:38 little bit of a social Gathering none of
0:26:41 the Kindred present were present at the
0:26:43 Elysium that you visited and awkwardly
0:26:46 you do kind of get the impression these
0:26:49 people could like all be related they
0:26:51 all kind of like there's some family
0:26:53 resembles there's some family
0:26:54 resemblance and uh well it's kind of
0:26:57 standing and looking out the window and
0:26:59 immediately you can sense just chains of
0:27:03 enslaved ghosts latched onto him or
0:27:07 bound into like rings that he wears is
0:27:10 an old world Italian looking gentleman
0:27:14 out of the corner of his eye you can see
0:27:17 that he glances to milliner Mr milliner
0:27:19 turns into the two of you and is like I
0:27:22 think he's ready to see you very good
0:27:24 thank you thank you
0:27:27 [Music]
0:27:31 Mr Giovanni I'm Regina turns
0:27:35 welcome I am pleased to meet your
0:27:39 acquaintance
0:27:40 but I have
0:27:42 questions
0:27:44 so do I hopefully we can provide answers
0:27:47 for one another
0:27:48 I would like that I was to understand
0:27:50 that the Gangrel Clan left the
0:27:53 camarilla most of us did and you
0:27:56 remained I did
0:27:58 I find that quite curious why
0:28:01 he kind of like turns and he starts like
0:28:03 lighting a cigar and one of the
0:28:09 geophonics of the party kind of just
0:28:10 drops what they are doing and rushes
0:28:13 over to be available to light his cigar
0:28:15 for you or lay his cigar for him while
0:28:18 he's waiting for you to tell your story
0:28:20 there's an awful lot of people I care
0:28:22 about who still have ties to the
0:28:24 camarilla I'm tied to them they're my
0:28:26 family and I don't walk away from family
0:28:30 and it's going for a woman to have an
0:28:32 anger to family
0:28:33 win kind of just kind of nods she was
0:28:35 kind of expecting that kind of demeanor
0:28:38 you've come about the anomaly a medium
0:28:40 is that correct that is correct sir I
0:28:42 find that also interesting new is your
0:28:44 friend
0:28:45 um this is Britta Ashcroft
0:28:47 also of New Haven it's good to meet you
0:28:50 I do apologize but that is some
0:28:52 strangeness about your friend
0:28:54 and she is going to have to have a seat
0:28:56 any kind of gestures pretty far away
0:28:58 from where the two of you are standing
0:29:00 we can address it after you and I speak
0:29:03 all right all right I'll see you after
0:29:05 thank you for being understanding of
0:29:08 course Roberta will stand and go to the
0:29:10 directed seat Wynn kind of gives her a
0:29:13 look like it's going to be cool it's
0:29:15 going to be okay British it's just very
0:29:17 like Prim and ladylike ever since a
0:29:21 great storm came
0:29:23 many of the wraiths who serve their
0:29:26 death Lords have fallen to the Wayside
0:29:29 consumed by the stone
0:29:31 but in case
0:29:33 they still hold power I think it is best
0:29:37 your friend remain at Arm's Reach
0:29:40 all right she is involved in things that
0:29:43 makes her an enemy of them she is an
0:29:45 enemy of The Wraith Lords by the way Lex
0:29:47 I am listening okay in case that's not
0:29:50 apparent yes it matters that I am not
0:29:54 terribly familiar with even myself and
0:29:55 that should concern you I will take that
0:29:59 into account so how can I indulge your
0:30:01 curiosity for the anomaly I know about
0:30:04 the stories about the sixth maelstrom
0:30:07 being the last and that this could be
0:30:10 the sixth
0:30:11 I can tell you
0:30:14 I can tell you that the stories appear
0:30:17 to be true what will happen to the
0:30:19 wraiths and they will be consumed by the
0:30:22 Maelstrom drawn deep into Oblivion and
0:30:25 should anything return it would be
0:30:28 spectori we encountered some of them in
0:30:30 the Boston tunnels
0:30:32 victims of the molasses
0:30:35 still loose he kind of like gives this
0:30:38 look of like
0:30:39 the kind of distinguished gentleman that
0:30:42 loves like a good Safari and hunting and
0:30:45 like killing like
0:30:47 of a large animal like he wants a lion
0:30:49 yeah like that horrible monster that you
0:30:52 guys fled is like a thing of amusement
0:30:53 serious Dos Equis most interesting man
0:30:58 well that's so much building material I
0:31:01 am afraid that if there are loved ones
0:31:03 on the other side it is time for you to
0:31:05 make peace with them because that entire
0:31:08 world everything that lies Beyond
0:31:10 will be gone when the storm has finished
0:31:13 there's nothing that can be done ah I
0:31:16 don't know if that's necessarily the
0:31:18 case that's the answer I wanted thank
0:31:20 you for giving me at least a little bit
0:31:21 the storm carries with the great winds
0:31:23 and these winds have
0:31:25 thrown Souls into corpses and the Dead
0:31:29 Walk I've encountered some of these
0:31:32 actually yes yes when we believe that
0:31:34 this is tied to the dead subconsciously
0:31:38 desperately attempting to flee the storm
0:31:41 and so in its own way the world of the
0:31:45 living and the dead become one
0:31:47 and you kind of like gives this insanely
0:31:51 charming smile at the thought of the
0:31:53 world of the dead and the living being
0:31:55 unified so
0:31:57 may I offer what maybe some conjecture
0:32:00 of course
0:32:02 that's why you're invited I think it
0:32:05 sounds an awful lot like you want to be
0:32:06 a sailor
0:32:07 and you want to harness these wins to
0:32:09 direct the wraiths into the bodies that
0:32:11 you choose
0:32:12 the Giovanni have had the power to do
0:32:16 this for centuries the the dead riding
0:32:19 of corpse is not new to me one is new is
0:32:23 that this happens against their will so
0:32:26 frequently normally in order to for the
0:32:29 dead to animate a corpse and ride it
0:32:32 they must draw upon the magic of the
0:32:33 arkanoi this is nothing this is the
0:32:36 state of the world causing strange
0:32:38 events between the world living and the
0:32:39 dead this is something that has never
0:32:41 happened no and that Sparks my curiosity
0:32:44 you are the only member of the Camarillo
0:32:47 seems to have an interest in this behind
0:32:49 uh members of the chimere that doesn't
0:32:52 surprise me I have a vested interest in
0:32:55 keeping the Land of the Dead
0:32:58 as hospitable as possible for the
0:33:00 wraiths there I'm afraid your own life
0:33:04 is spent in an era where Thrones have
0:33:06 crumbled
0:33:07 and kingdoms have fallen what lies on
0:33:10 the other side of this storm is not
0:33:12 known even to me but I promise you this
0:33:14 Madonna
0:33:16 if there is a way
0:33:17 I intend to find it and I do not intend
0:33:20 to keep the secret to myself you would
0:33:23 share it even with the camarilla as a
0:33:25 whole I don't know if they're even
0:33:26 interested
0:33:28 but I would share with a few if you
0:33:30 would count me among that I would be
0:33:31 very grateful
0:33:33 I don't know that there's anything I
0:33:35 could do I don't know that anything I
0:33:37 can do extends Beyond seeing and
0:33:39 interacting with them you said that you
0:33:43 have a con you have witnessed this
0:33:46 creature of molasses yeah he grabbed me
0:33:50 that is something of Interest
0:33:52 she kind of points across the room is
0:33:55 also something of Interest
0:33:58 New Haven
0:34:00 I am also interested there's a lot of
0:34:03 that going around New Haven is very
0:34:05 close to New York it's
0:34:07 safely out of Arm's Reach of it
0:34:10 there are there is something I seek
0:34:14 um perhaps you and I can work together
0:34:16 towards it in the meantime
0:34:19 I noticed that you are concerned that
0:34:21 all you can do is hear and speak to them
0:34:23 have you come in search of more I
0:34:26 wouldn't say no to more
0:34:27 there's one I
0:34:29 just want to punch in the face but
0:34:31 honestly it extends further than that I
0:34:34 am the child of Augustus Giovanni and I
0:34:36 have great sway within the clan perhaps
0:34:39 a trade
0:34:40 I'm listening
0:34:42 oh
0:34:45 an exchange for necromancy I'm afraid
0:34:48 there's no deal there Mr Giovanni what
0:34:50 is that because she's family family can
0:34:53 take many forms
0:34:54 she is my sister she is my child she is
0:34:58 a great many things to me and even the
0:35:01 ability to save
0:35:03 things that I hold very precious
0:35:06 I wouldn't trade her for
0:35:08 then perhaps something different
0:35:10 you have my attention
0:35:12 because of the presence of the storm
0:35:15 those of the Dead have become
0:35:18 few and far between
0:35:20 it is the will of my sire
0:35:23 that uh how close I be kept on the
0:35:27 presence of spectori
0:35:29 be my eyes and ears
0:35:32 in the courts of the camarilla and seek
0:35:35 out where the inspectorial eye and if
0:35:39 you can do these things to me if you can
0:35:40 provide useful information
0:35:42 perhaps similar in the Arts of
0:35:44 necromancy that's a deal I can make
0:35:47 yeah
0:35:49 bring your friend over wind turns and
0:35:52 motions for Brita Brita comes over uh
0:35:55 casually as if she were waiting and not
0:35:58 listening I understand you are someone
0:36:00 of Great Value to my guest
0:36:04 but where you go brings trouble even for
0:36:06 me I'm afraid that I don't understand I
0:36:09 don't know what you're talking about
0:36:10 what do you be willing to willing to
0:36:12 explain give me your hand Brita extends
0:36:15 her hand and places it in his palm he
0:36:18 turns so your hand faces up if you are
0:36:22 to remain family of my dear friend win
0:36:24 you need to get answers you need to know
0:36:28 why you are such a threat and I believe
0:36:31 this will help you
0:36:33 and he very gently
0:36:37 rubs his thumb along the inside of your
0:36:40 palm
0:36:41 and exerting some sort of like Eerie
0:36:44 countermeasure against Magic
0:36:46 reveals a crescent moon on your palm
0:36:48 that was not there before
0:36:51 he lets go I have matters I must attend
0:36:54 to thank you for your time I hope to see
0:36:56 you soon Bretta pulls her hand back and
0:36:58 kind of grasps walks away in her other
0:37:00 hand and looks to the looks to the
0:37:03 Crescent does it look the same as when
0:37:04 she was like etching it into her hand
0:37:06 yeah and I imagine he does right along
0:37:09 like the lifeline probably yep so Brett
0:37:13 is staring at this Crescent trying to
0:37:15 like pull any association of memory from
0:37:17 it
0:37:18 nothing
0:37:20 is it black it is a black crescent moon
0:37:23 in your palm
0:37:27 [Music]
0:37:31 so Johnny is standing outside the uh the
0:37:34 van waiting to see the Hall of equipment
0:37:37 that Miles has procured and he pops one
0:37:40 of his few precious remaining more
0:37:42 leaves into his mouth and lights up no
0:37:45 right looks like we've got a pretty good
0:37:47 haul here so it's popping up in some
0:37:49 cases here
0:37:50 um let's see we've got a very large
0:37:52 sniper rifle I'm not sure if this is
0:37:54 going to be useful interior wise but it
0:37:57 could be this is a Beretta 50 cal and
0:38:00 then we've got two assault rifles uh
0:38:04 looks like there's European stay Hogs a
0:38:07 famous shotgun very much likes the
0:38:09 European Brands uh looks like we got a
0:38:11 red hawk and a special case with two
0:38:14 what looks like two full about 12 shots
0:38:18 I'm sorry what's a red hawk right it is
0:38:22 uh pulling it out as a large caliber
0:38:25 revolver what's special about the show
0:38:28 why only 12 shots looks like they're
0:38:30 silver at least that's what the case
0:38:31 that's what the writing indicates we're
0:38:33 not going anywhere with a Lupine are we
0:38:34 I don't know do you know I mean there
0:38:37 might be other things affected by silver
0:38:38 too better safe than sorry that is
0:38:42 exactly correct okay and even if we
0:38:44 don't use it now we have it uh here is
0:38:47 uh my Katana he slides and holds on to
0:38:51 that and looks and slides it out well
0:38:53 this looks very good and then I've got
0:38:55 these chimes with a note on them that
0:38:58 says chime of unseen Spirits uh it looks
0:39:01 like they will chime if there's a spirit
0:39:03 in the nearby vicinity oh she she went
0:39:06 all out then huh just and it looks like
0:39:08 I've got some Scrolls or something like
0:39:11 that I can't make them out it looks like
0:39:13 gibberish so I assume this must be for
0:39:16 you Neil do you want to take a look at
0:39:17 it yes
0:39:19 okay Johnny picks up the the shotgun
0:39:22 while Neil and specs so the esoteric
0:39:24 materials you've picked up he kind of
0:39:26 just gives it a once over shrugs and
0:39:28 kind of Pops it in the back seat behind
0:39:29 the driver's side when do you know how
0:39:32 the Chimes thing works
0:39:35 um it alerts us to the presence of
0:39:37 spirits okay so if we split up we'll
0:39:40 take it yeah away from you maybe yeah
0:39:42 all right it probably would be not best
0:39:44 to give that to Neil what does that mean
0:39:46 do you really want something that could
0:39:47 go off at any time without oh oh yeah
0:39:50 okay no that totally makes sense yeah I
0:39:52 don't know that didn't click it didn't
0:39:55 got it sorry Johnny cracks a smile and
0:39:58 shakes his head Neil starts looking
0:39:59 around at these like weird Scrolls and
0:40:01 stuff
0:40:02 um miles did she give you a note did she
0:40:04 tell you what these are uh yeah let me
0:40:06 take a look here uh my thing says uh
0:40:10 inscription for extinguish and something
0:40:12 says inscription for iron body iron okay
0:40:15 okay so and then some sort of mirror so
0:40:19 these are um this is these are these are
0:40:21 rituals any anybody can sort of do these
0:40:23 uh also tells me she either got them
0:40:25 from a Premiere or she is a thermometer
0:40:27 herself to create these but so so one of
0:40:29 them is going to to uh just put out fire
0:40:31 which is you know extremely useful to
0:40:35 have and then the other one is going to
0:40:38 you know make you stronger to look
0:40:40 tougher to hurt or harder kill the
0:40:42 ritual will just sort of go off and
0:40:44 affect whoever does it
0:40:46 um you said something you made a mirror
0:40:48 yeah I think this mirror says something
0:40:49 about it it can hold three people
0:40:52 comfortably in like an extra dimensional
0:40:54 Spain I have to assume otherwise it's
0:40:57 not very big otherwise okay so three
0:41:01 people okay so so so so what I'm hearing
0:41:04 here is um so we need to get out of the
0:41:06 city and we need to get past Roman
0:41:08 Pendragon I believe Arabella said she
0:41:10 was working on that she's working on it
0:41:11 yes okay but there's to go to Salem not
0:41:14 to go back home no obviously and we have
0:41:16 to go to Salem what was that right now
0:41:18 well there's always everywhere though I
0:41:20 mean I would think that the prince would
0:41:22 let him know right if he saw us the
0:41:25 prince has yet to recover Arabella
0:41:28 Rollins and she's been operating up in
0:41:30 here for quite some time let's give her
0:41:32 the benefit of the doubt she can figure
0:41:34 out how to do the same for us and we're
0:41:36 not going to be gone once we're ready to
0:41:38 hit the road you give her a call make
0:41:40 sure that we got the uh we got the cover
0:41:42 that we need right so all alternate
0:41:44 potential solution okay uh so there's
0:41:48 there's the the five of us if we need to
0:41:50 get out is any of us I mean who of us
0:41:54 could resist maybe a Roman Pendragon
0:41:57 trying to summon us the answer would be
0:41:59 done how would we know if we could do
0:42:00 that I don't know I I don't you know I
0:42:03 was kind of asking people who aren't me
0:42:06 um but if like one of us could right
0:42:08 just just in theory so one of us could
0:42:11 if one of us could they could drive the
0:42:12 van three people could hide inside the
0:42:14 mirror you're in different convention
0:42:15 you can't get out I ain't going to no
0:42:17 [ __ ] excremental space okay well then
0:42:19 maybe you're the one to drive the van
0:42:20 then uh he should really be the one to
0:42:22 drive the van I don't disagree uh I
0:42:24 think we should save off and then
0:42:26 putting ourselves into a weird Marathon
0:42:27 okay I'm just saying it's a possibility
0:42:29 and then I could sever like for me I
0:42:31 could sever my own Consciousness from my
0:42:32 body and we could just do it that way
0:42:34 well that's that's good to know but
0:42:35 let's we're putting the cart before the
0:42:37 horse a little bit let's focus on
0:42:38 getting to Salem and getting back but
0:42:40 this is part of getting to Salem and
0:42:41 getting back that's what I'm talking
0:42:42 about
0:42:43 in case our bill doesn't come through I
0:42:45 don't know right if Arabella doesn't
0:42:47 come through I feel like we've got
0:42:48 bigger problems it's fair enough I mean
0:42:51 maybe just starting with a Basics and
0:42:53 keeping our faces covered and taking the
0:42:55 back roads yeah I mean it sounds fine to
0:42:58 me I mean is completely cut off so
0:42:59 Johnny also wants to make an occult role
0:43:02 now he's not very good at this and most
0:43:03 of his cult knowledge is gained from
0:43:05 hanging out late with Kabir and him
0:43:08 telling me stories about what kind of
0:43:10 [ __ ] to not get involved with is there
0:43:12 any chance that maybe Kabir has told me
0:43:14 some stories about what not to get
0:43:16 involved with in a Chantry let's find
0:43:18 out
0:43:19 no
0:43:22 unless I get an extra die from having an
0:43:25 ally tell these stories you sure don't
0:43:28 he told you not to get involved with the
0:43:30 Chantry most like yeah
0:43:31 if you really want to know what kabir's
0:43:33 advice would have been you know you
0:43:35 think and it's something along the lines
0:43:36 like Kabir being like my friend no
0:43:38 matter what happens never go into a
0:43:41 Premiere Chantry it is nothing but pain
0:43:43 and confusion and they never pay you for
0:43:46 the services rendered can it really be
0:43:48 that bad my friend it is much worse I'm
0:43:51 sure we're quoting it so you don't go
0:43:52 insane with the truth all right all
0:43:55 right Jenny reflects on that
0:43:56 conversation he once had yeah all right
0:43:58 why don't we uh why don't we all try to
0:44:01 just remain calm you give uh you give
0:44:04 your uh cousin a call there and we'll
0:44:08 just take a trip with the Salem uh not
0:44:10 to sound like a paranoid psychotic but
0:44:11 just a couple of couple other real quick
0:44:13 things
0:44:14 one do I I did it before I did it when
0:44:16 we were gonna go after Sentosa um Johnny
0:44:19 I know you're uncomfortable with the the
0:44:21 Rocky and everything but I I could try
0:44:24 and see when is auspicious I would need
0:44:26 a little bit of blood from I can't do it
0:44:28 for everybody but for a couple of us to
0:44:30 sort of bull stroll our will uh going in
0:44:32 and then the second thing is she didn't
0:44:34 tell you what kind of uh Arcane defenses
0:44:36 and Wards might be there specifically
0:44:38 Miles because if that's what she did no
0:44:42 no no okay because I could Ward us stuff
0:44:46 yeah but there's a lot of Paths of magic
0:44:48 I can only Ward us against one thing and
0:44:50 I don't know what that would be we'll
0:44:52 tell you what you give her a call get
0:44:54 her on the horn ask her what she's what
0:44:56 she's done to make sure we can get to
0:44:58 Salem without Pendragon finding out and
0:45:00 after she's giving you a suitable
0:45:02 explanation let her know that uh that
0:45:05 your friend wants to ask her about a few
0:45:09 of the warding uh what do you would you
0:45:11 call it again Neil just whatever Wars
0:45:13 whatever path yeah just pass the phone
0:45:15 over to Neil and now I really don't want
0:45:17 to talk to her about thamaturgy I'm very
0:45:19 uncomfortable with the idea of her
0:45:20 finding out that I am the thumb of
0:45:22 church well it sounded like the last
0:45:24 time we talked she kind of uh got tipped
0:45:27 off to that anyways yeah I'm trying not
0:45:28 to have a complete freak out about that
0:45:30 right now well does anyone really have
0:45:32 any reason to believe her I mean she's
0:45:35 in total Exile just asking the question
0:45:37 is is enough to look guys we're burning
0:45:40 Moonlight here we need to stop going
0:45:42 over every possible outcome and ask
0:45:45 miles if he has armor in that kid of his
0:45:47 you provided armor before did you not
0:45:49 bring it with you no I assume we would
0:45:51 get equipment here all right we'll take
0:45:53 a look all right uh okay I need it less
0:45:57 but it would be good to have extra I
0:45:59 mean I brought my I don't know but I
0:46:01 don't know if she provided any other
0:46:02 just weird miscellaneous items not by
0:46:04 weird but just regular she did not
0:46:06 provide weird miscellaneous items it was
0:46:08 it was basically specifically to
0:46:10 whatever you felt was needed right did
0:46:11 anybody else not bring that right but I
0:46:14 asked for armor I have I have mine but
0:46:16 you I do because I didn't want to leave
0:46:17 it behind because I was afraid you'd
0:46:19 yelled at me ditto did win bring body
0:46:21 armor up to Massachusetts with her in
0:46:24 her in her original kit no no that
0:46:26 everybody else yes it's in my Johnny I
0:46:28 mean she's got her leather jacket I feel
0:46:29 like all right if the answer is no the
0:46:31 answer is no that's fine I just wanted
0:46:32 to know do you want mine win no I want
0:46:35 you to have yours okay I can take care
0:46:38 of myself in that regard I was more
0:46:40 worried about the rest of you I'm I'm
0:46:42 hoping nothing ever touches me so am I
0:46:44 buddy Jenny cracks a smile of winning ah
0:46:46 it's sweet of you let's get in yeah can
0:46:49 you do your thing there or do you need
0:46:50 to do it here I can do it on the way
0:46:52 okay I'll just need some blood from two
0:46:54 of you whoever wants to do it I'm fine
0:46:57 with that it was really helpful last
0:46:59 time but
0:47:00 I mean it would be helpful to either one
0:47:03 of you but we you can decide on the way
0:47:05 I just I want to make sure that we can
0:47:06 go call Arabella yep everybody load your
0:47:09 stuff in good I'll call the number that
0:47:11 she gave me
0:47:12 miles call him already we're ready to go
0:47:16 thank you for the update are you ready
0:47:18 on your side of things yes of course all
0:47:21 right just checking on what are you
0:47:22 doing exactly to prevent Pendragon from
0:47:26 I am having a colleague of mine perform
0:47:29 a ritual called night of the red heart
0:47:31 the ritual is very simple either the
0:47:33 ritual is obstructed by midnight or the
0:47:37 target of the ritual dies now normally I
0:47:41 like to have this performed upon a
0:47:42 torped kindred because when the ritual
0:47:44 is cast the moment it begins the
0:47:47 recipient the subject the target of this
0:47:49 weapon is made aware of its casting and
0:47:52 where it is being cast from so it
0:47:54 becomes quite dangerous for the Caster
0:47:56 in the case of
0:47:57 Pendragon we simply need him to be
0:48:00 angered and offended that someone would
0:48:02 do some certain thing and
0:48:04 should I lose my companion to the wrath
0:48:08 of Mr Pendragon I trust that you will
0:48:12 ensure that the sacrifice was worth my
0:48:14 time
0:48:15 we'll get it done
0:48:16 are you meeting us there
0:48:18 if I can
0:48:19 it depends on what's required on this
0:48:21 end
0:48:22 keeping Mr Pendragon busy is quite a
0:48:25 task I'm sure you understand correct
0:48:28 this is my impression that you had had
0:48:29 some knowledge about what's going on
0:48:31 inside this chantrain that you are going
0:48:33 with us but it is my intention to go all
0:48:36 right but as I said I don't know how
0:48:39 much I don't know how much time the
0:48:41 night of the red hot will keep Mr
0:48:43 Pendragon for all well we're about to
0:48:45 move out good oh well hopefully we'll
0:48:47 see you there I look forward to it
0:48:48 thanks hey we can't see out these
0:48:51 windows should someone be upfront with
0:48:53 Johnny to keep an eye out in case
0:48:55 anything like
0:48:57 um New York happens I assumed miles was
0:49:01 riding shotgun I mean if you want to be
0:49:03 conspicuous about it that would be great
0:49:04 I'm not exactly low profile
0:49:07 all right do you want someone else to
0:49:09 ride shotgun in this case I think we'll
0:49:10 be fine look New York was all kinds of
0:49:12 sideways
0:49:14 I got I planned out a route to Salem
0:49:16 already I don't think we're getting any
0:49:17 trouble going there New York we had a
0:49:20 awesome assassin on our tail and I'd
0:49:22 lose them by driving through Sabbat
0:49:24 territory this is nothing like that I'm
0:49:27 worried it might be like that
0:49:28 wow I have a little I have a little
0:49:30 trust kid okay
0:49:32 she's got some sort of ritual to
0:49:34 essentially make Pendragon mad and
0:49:37 distracted right then we should probably
0:49:39 get going all right I guess we should
0:49:41 pull out now then huh yeah she's aware
0:49:43 she'll probably start it relatively soon

0:50:50 see you next time
0:50:52 [Music]
0:50:59 I need to amend my previous statement I
0:51:01 did bring my armor I am not a complete
0:51:04 [ __ ] win says as the van pulls away
0:51:06 like pulling it out of a bag
0:51:08 oh it was under my third flannel I feel
0:51:11 like one of the codery is like yeah no
0:51:13 wait final we know you forgot when
0:51:16 that's why we already packed it for you
0:51:18 oh you guys are the best that was Neil
0:51:20 yeah I was gonna say thanks Neil
0:51:23 I saw stuff laying around so I packed it
0:51:25 away
0:51:26 I just I put it in a bag and don't worry
0:51:28 and all the pockets are filled
0:51:33 with my Turkish Delights
0:51:37 I love Turkish delight but the idea of
0:51:40 just like them sitting in like just like
0:51:43 in ballistic Pockets without any like
0:51:45 rapper or anything is so [ __ ] crazy
0:51:48 it's only one of the pockets the other
0:51:50 one is filled with big league chews I
0:51:52 was thinking just tax for no reason if
0:51:55 it's not big red then [ __ ] you one of
0:51:58 them is just completely filled with like
0:52:00 Tops baseball cards
0:52:01 that's important so I don't lose those
