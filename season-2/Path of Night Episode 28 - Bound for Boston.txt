0:00:35 outside New Haven Kabir walked wind to
0:00:38 the bizarre steps to Rouse Neil from his
0:00:40 tortoise
0:00:41 blood bound the markavian in the process
0:00:43 arriving at court the cautery was shot
0:00:46 to find one of the leaders of operation
0:00:48 Longboat the infamous Roman pendrite had
0:00:51 arrived to give an ultimatum to the
0:00:53 city's residents submit and join his
0:00:56 Crusade against the Sabbath will be
0:00:58 conquered
0:00:59 also the new nosferatsu primigen arrived
0:01:02 to court investigating Johnny's
0:01:04 involvement in Shaw's death
0:01:12 Johnny as the Elysium Gathering starts
0:01:16 to wind down a bit the guests are filing
0:01:19 out and the various Kindred start
0:01:22 forming up with their closest allies and
0:01:25 start quietly making their way out you
0:01:28 find a win kind of
0:01:31 shoulder by some of the local Tori and
0:01:35 and a bit of a hurry she makes her way
0:01:37 to you uh Johnny we we gotta go and you
0:01:41 seem like you're on the war path yeah
0:01:42 I'm not on the war path I am on the
0:01:44 trying to prevent Warpath
0:01:46 um all right all right I think I [ __ ]
0:01:49 up but we we need to get the others and
0:01:51 we need to go all right well I think I

0:01:56 to check with Fester I'll grab him uh
0:01:59 last I heard miles and Brita were
0:02:01 looking for Knicks I don't know where
0:02:02 the heck you're gonna find them I can
0:02:05 look around for them it won't be hard to
0:02:06 find them they're not exactly a subtle
0:02:08 presence meet you out front yeah all
0:02:10 right stay uh stay sharp win will do
0:02:12 Johnny heads over to where he last
0:02:15 spotted Neil and it's kind of just a
0:02:18 quick scan around to see if you can spot
0:02:19 him with Fester uh Neil you do finally
0:02:22 find Fester kind of slinking along in
0:02:25 the watching the Tori or social click
0:02:29 from afar he's got like a little bit of
0:02:31 like a a very creepy longing look as he
0:02:35 watches them Neil sort of having already
0:02:38 been ousted by the torridor social click
0:02:41 skulks along the wall beside him until
0:02:44 he's standing right next to fastener
0:02:46 hey uh hey buddy what's um hey Neil
0:02:50 how exactly do you think it is that they
0:02:52 do that do what now the all the makeup
0:02:56 in there

0:03:01 no idea like we think they got like
0:03:04 minions or something that do the makeup
0:03:05 for them because it seems like it would
0:03:07 take so long
0:03:08 I know I'm pretty oh [ __ ] that [ __ ] I'm
0:03:11 pretty sure Brita does her own makeup

0:04:39 later don't all right
0:04:41 I you let me know when you need that
0:04:43 thing Fester Johnny starts walking off
0:04:45 hey yeah I'll talk to you later I guess
0:04:47 I'll I'll [ __ ] wind needs it Neil not
0:04:51 knowing how to end a conversation ever
0:04:53 just turns and walks away and Falls
0:04:55 Johnny he kind of like looks weirded out
0:04:58 as you guys head off and he just kind of
0:05:01 turns resting his chin on his hand and
0:05:03 like sitting at a table turns to watch
0:05:05 the Toyota or be pretty
0:05:11 please
0:05:13 wind kind of takes a minute after she
0:05:15 and Johnny part to not take a breath so
0:05:18 much but take a moment to kind of Center
0:05:20 herself so she's less of a bull in a
0:05:22 china shop
0:05:23 and she looks around to try and find
0:05:26 either miles or Brita or both ideally
0:05:29 she spots miles first and kind of makes
0:05:33 her way over to him after having a brief
0:05:36 discussion with the prince and such
0:05:38 after pen dragon and left he uh had
0:05:41 moved off to call Marcos to come bring
0:05:44 him a suitable car to leave Elysium from
0:05:47 because he is tired of the vehicle that
0:05:49 he came in and tired of all those
0:05:51 vehicles and needs the comfort of his
0:05:55 own he sees uh Wind come over and uh
0:05:58 moves to uh intercept what's going on
0:06:02 um this shouldn't come as a surprise but
0:06:04 I think I [ __ ] up politically
0:06:06 and I think we need to go nothing we
0:06:08 can't fix but sure all right I don't
0:06:10 know all right do you know where Britta
0:06:11 is uh check around the Toyota's usually
0:06:14 all right got it and she heads back
0:06:16 inside to look for Brita Brita wouldn't
0:06:18 be too far off from where assumably
0:06:20 Miles had walked away to have his phone
0:06:22 call she might be readying to gravitate
0:06:25 back out to look out for maybe maybe
0:06:28 she's looking to go speak to a Toreador
0:06:30 maybe she's looking to go speak to Nyx
0:06:32 it's not clear but she's still on the
0:06:36 Move wind kind of catches up with her
0:06:38 and puts a hand on her shoulder hey we
0:06:41 gotta go why I I did about as well as
0:06:45 politicking as I thought I would and I
0:06:47 really need to regroup then we should
0:06:49 say and fix it yeah I don't think this
0:06:51 is a stay and fix thing I think this is
0:06:53 we need to talk privately and we're not
0:06:55 going to get that here which group was
0:06:56 this during a premium meeting yeah kind
0:06:59 of after the primigen meeting the new
0:07:01 NOS kind of cornered me okay
0:07:05 um so we can do that after we talk to
0:07:07 Nyx talk to everyone no we I think we
0:07:10 need to go now women I haven't even seen
0:07:12 Nick's so I don't even know if she came
0:07:14 back to Elysium after that I don't know
0:07:16 where she went after the primigen
0:07:18 meeting
0:07:19 are you sure that we need to leave right
0:07:21 now
0:07:22 Britta I know this is important to you
0:07:24 but the one thing we Kindred have is
0:07:26 time
0:07:27 we'll find her again I promise
0:07:29 and I don't make promises I can't keep
0:07:31 Brett it looks down and the frustration
0:07:33 shows through on her face but she kind
0:07:35 of
0:07:37 non-stiffly and looks back up to you and
0:07:39 says
0:07:40 all right next time please next time
0:07:43 definitely we'll set up something
0:07:45 official thank you I'm sorry I it's it's
0:07:49 it's okay I just
0:07:52 next time please next time I'm also
0:07:55 interested to know what Nick's knows but
0:07:57 many things happening at the same time
0:07:59 do you know where Johnny and Neil are uh
0:08:02 Johnny was rallying Neil I think Johnny
0:08:04 said he saw him talking to Fester I hope
0:08:07 Johnny said good things to festo no clue
0:08:09 very good hopefully no all right so if
0:08:12 we have to go then let's just go okay
0:08:15 yes Marco should be coming so we
0:08:17 shouldn't have to wait too long I mean
0:08:19 if you guys want to go off in the Honda
0:08:23 I'm fine with waiting for something else
0:08:27 you live like 15 minutes away maybe
0:08:29 right I was thinking that uh Johnny
0:08:31 could keep that car for now I'm sure he
0:08:33 could do fun things with it like I don't
0:08:35 know destruction Derby
0:08:38 I imagine we're walking out towards the
0:08:40 front at this point as the group of you
0:08:43 gather up uh you do find Marcos is there
0:08:46 miles I am I gathered a vehicle as
0:08:50 quickly as I could on short notice
0:08:52 um I hope everyone is comfortable he
0:08:54 kind of like leads you outside and takes
0:08:57 you to this kind of older luxury like
0:09:00 Mercury Cougar
0:09:02 it's got a nice color to it and it's
0:09:04 like a simple magenta they're probably
0:09:06 not like as distinguishing as you prefer
0:09:09 but it's a nice car
0:09:11 after tonight this is excellent
0:09:14 as long as it does not smell like
0:09:16 narcotics
0:09:17 I do not believe it does no good very
0:09:19 good this is your personal car Marcos
0:09:21 yes so I take it you uh don't want any
0:09:24 smoking in it uh whatever makes you
0:09:26 comfortable
0:09:27 it seems like we should be nice and wait
0:09:31 um I can wait uh can I ask you a
0:09:34 question
0:09:35 yeah um
0:09:37 if this is inappropriate please stop me
0:09:40 you look upset right now
0:09:42 what's the question
0:09:44 do you do do you do your own makeup or
0:09:46 do you have like somebody help you Freda
0:09:48 kind of like closes her eyes like slow
0:09:50 blinks looks Neil
0:09:53 um all right I do my makeup why no all
0:09:56 right I was in the car he starts pushing
0:09:58 Neil down into the cougar hi when you
0:10:01 like push him down into the cougar uh
0:10:04 there's actually like a hunk of plastic
0:10:07 kind of in the way and you realize there
0:10:10 is a car seat in the back
0:10:13 and you have to actually take the car
0:10:15 seat out in order to properly shove Neil
0:10:18 into the car
0:10:20 what's that for
0:10:21 that's a good question it's nothing uh
0:10:23 Marcos kind of very quickly moves to
0:10:25 collect the car seat Retta looks at
0:10:28 Miles yeah so does Johnny yeah so does
0:10:30 win
0:10:31 Marcus is allowed to have a personal
0:10:32 life I I don't all right I don't fully
0:10:36 you know like apologies uh no no worries
0:10:40 it's perfectly appropriate it are you
0:10:43 sure puts it away how about I mean we
0:10:45 could this is your car we could take
0:10:47 another car as can I don't worry I
0:10:50 assumed he was coming with us as he's
0:10:52 talking uh and looking at Marcos Neil
0:10:54 pulls out his phone and just shoots off
0:10:56 a text message
0:10:58 to Fester
0:11:00 just answer his question okay nice yeah
0:11:02 Marcus is coming with us don't worry
0:11:03 this is just a quick ride
0:11:05 I assume Lex that that falls under
0:11:07 crafts makeup yeah yeah or expression
0:11:11 three dots so that's probably
0:11:13 [Laughter]
0:11:13 um
0:11:15 pretty well done makeup
0:11:18 very important question I appreciate you
0:11:20 coming out on short notice but it seems
0:11:22 like you were actually up to something
0:11:23 tonight uh Johnny fits the uh car seat
0:11:26 back into the back of his back seat
0:11:29 I insist Johnny
0:11:32 it's like very like kind of indignant
0:11:35 when you interrupt his service to miles
0:11:38 I mean there is the Honda if you want to
0:11:40 take it let's just get in a car and go
0:11:42 Marco seems willing so let's let's just
0:11:45 do what miles wants to do
0:11:47 since when have we ever done that
0:11:49 oh whenever it comes to cars and Neil
0:11:52 just kind of looks miles is really
0:11:55 trying to contain himself on this one
0:11:57 all right just trying to car seat in the
0:12:00 back Neil back seat middle feet on the
0:12:03 hump oh yeah of course when where are
0:12:05 the keys to the Honda who have it moved
0:12:07 if that's what you want I'll I'll take
0:12:09 care of the Honda and meet you at your
0:12:10 Haven sounds good [ __ ] and after being
0:12:13 told where to sit by win Neil happily
0:12:15 gets into the middle and puts a seat on
0:12:16 the uh puts his feet on the hump don't
0:12:18 worry when I won't get I won't get any
0:12:19 trouble I'll meet you guys that at the
0:12:21 Haven sounds good all right
0:12:23 sit with your feet on the hump if
0:12:25 there's only two of us in the back no
0:12:26 you said this it's fine don't worry
0:12:28 about it Neil sit next to the window man
0:12:29 oh yeah okay and he scoots over next to
0:12:32 the window oh my God
0:12:33 nothing go what nothing okay let's get
0:12:37 going the group of you head off leaving
0:12:40 Elysium
0:12:44 [Music]
0:12:48 uh you guys head to Miles this Haven
0:12:50 Johnny were you stopping off uh Johnny's
0:12:51 just gonna ditch the uh Honda somewhere
0:12:54 close to like the impound yard basically
0:12:56 uh do a once over clean it out to make
0:12:59 sure there's nothing incriminating Left
0:13:00 Behind then he's gonna walk a block off
0:13:02 find a pay phone and call for a cab to
0:13:05 bring him over to you like find a bowl
0:13:07 underneath the seat and like that's
0:13:09 about it I'll ditch that for the sake of
0:13:11 the uh of the Stoners we took this from
0:13:13 okay I mean we painted them yeah but if
0:13:16 if this car is going to be impounded by
0:13:19 local New Haven and like contact the
0:13:20 owners I don't want them finding a bowl
0:13:22 and being and charging them with other
0:13:24 stuff I'm just defending myself by
0:13:25 saying that we did paint them
0:13:28 right right right right right I forgot
0:13:30 no I forgot to think about you in this
0:13:32 scenario exactly sorry about that
0:13:35 um as always think about me but he does
0:13:38 all I mean to be fair Johnny is also
0:13:40 searching the car for anything
0:13:41 incriminating about the Kindred that
0:13:43 wrote in it right right now um I'm not
0:13:45 gonna seem to have cleaned up pretty
0:13:46 well and uh yeah and then basically we
0:13:48 just
0:13:50 leaves that car behind somewhere where
0:13:52 it can get picked up by authorities
0:13:54 heads to a pay phone calls for a cab and
0:13:58 then just takes a cab over to uh miles
0:14:00 Haven you catch a cab back to miles's
0:14:03 Haven uh by then uh those who needed a
0:14:06 change of clothes are able to kind of
0:14:07 get adjusted and the five of you meet
0:14:12 together
0:14:13 I feel refreshed Bretta had pretty
0:14:16 immediately walked away assumably to
0:14:18 change but probably also to have her own
0:14:21 moment so when she comes back she's so
0:14:23 quiet
0:14:24 wind just kind of comes in and plops on
0:14:26 the couch and kind of holds her head in
0:14:28 her hands contemplates her life choices
0:14:30 recently
0:14:31 Neil comes in and plops on the couch
0:14:35 that just waits for the talking to start
0:14:37 Freda also seems not to look at the
0:14:39 couch very much and miles is Haven
0:14:43 I um I take Marcos aside real quick and
0:14:46 was like I If we were into if you need
0:14:48 to go back to something please do we
0:14:50 should be fine for the rest of the night
0:14:51 please do not hesitate to contact me if
0:14:53 you need anything and he uh oh well my
0:14:56 friend he kind of gives a nod and turns
0:14:58 and heads off think Johnny actually
0:15:00 arrives just as he sees Marco's taking
0:15:03 off comes in through the uh the usual
0:15:06 entrance Johnny uh comes into I think
0:15:08 probably you prefer making it through
0:15:09 the side rather than the front has door
0:15:11 been fixed yet yes we had extra doors
0:15:17 the Johnny closet
0:15:20 I mean
0:15:21 I feel like if you're not a venture
0:15:23 prepared for uh you know Haven to be
0:15:25 breached a few times then what kind of
0:15:27 venture are you
0:15:28 Dead one that's exactly correct when
0:15:31 what happened
0:15:33 I
0:15:36 the new NOS primogen cornered me
0:15:40 and asked me what happened to Shaw
0:15:43 and I told him
0:15:45 and why is this a
0:15:47 careful because it makes Johnny look
0:15:49 really really bad what did happen to
0:15:51 Shaw he staked miles I vaguely recall
0:15:56 that part
0:15:58 all right maybe we should reiterate what
0:16:01 happened after we lost sight of Neil
0:16:03 since he's actually not been around yeah
0:16:06 I sort of got caught up
0:16:08 with dead Lupine and Shaw is not around
0:16:13 and there's a new NOS primogen the
0:16:15 slightly fuzzy on the details the flight
0:16:17 with the Lupine uh drained both myself
0:16:20 and miles
0:16:22 of
0:16:23 pretty much everything we had it wasn't
0:16:25 the fight it was
0:16:28 re-straining you well that that's why I
0:16:31 was saying the fight drained us of what
0:16:33 we had which let Rhys tip us over the
0:16:36 edge into frenzy
0:16:37 um and Shaw managed to Ambush miles with
0:16:41 a stake and right after we took down the
0:16:44 Lupine and just as about as about as I
0:16:47 was about to fight him I was thrown into
0:16:49 hunger frenzy and I pretty much drank
0:16:52 him to final death how
0:16:55 I didn't diablerize him if that's what
0:16:57 you're asking that's not what I'm asking
0:16:58 although good to know
0:17:00 I hope you don't the Vitae if I verify
0:17:03 that but how the Vitae just pulled out
0:17:05 of my body I I don't know how how to
0:17:08 describe that no IReiss reached out and
0:17:11 pulled it out it felt at leastReiss
0:17:15 dominated me to help Johnny kill Shaw
0:17:18 sounds like you need a clarifying
0:17:19 question here no I I actually don't need
0:17:21 it it felt like my blood animated and
0:17:24 became
0:17:25 snakes or worms and it just if you
0:17:29 pulled it forced its way out of me ice
0:17:31 Rhys is a tremair he would be expert in
0:17:34 the path of life's water I hate this
0:17:36 magic [ __ ] I know he was also flying
0:17:38 around too though yeah that's yeah I
0:17:41 just figured you might want to know but
0:17:42 so is this Nuss going to try to accuse
0:17:44 Johnny of
0:17:46 diabolarizing or that's my concern
0:17:49 unfortunately even thoughReiss had
0:17:52 quite a bit of a hand in it at the end
0:17:54 of the day I did Kill Shaw
0:17:58 so what's that then a life spoon or
0:18:02 what they want to play for
0:18:04 this uh NOS
0:18:06 he's working for operation Longbow isn't
0:18:09 it
0:18:09 seems like most of the court is
0:18:11 no that's what I heard from Jane
0:18:14 that the Nosferatu are working for
0:18:16 operation Longbow yeah we thought he
0:18:18 might be stepping in for Shaw right
0:18:21 I mean
0:18:23 you show us kid isn't he
0:18:26 yeah yeah okay and he's also the uh the
0:18:30 grandchild of the prince out in Rhode
0:18:33 Island right Warwick I think so yeah
0:18:35 Rick that sounds about right
0:18:37 unfortunately I don't know much about
0:18:39 his political affiliations besides those
0:18:41 that he's associated with at this point
0:18:43 I mean well Jane was telling me that
0:18:45 Warwick is pretty buddy buddy with
0:18:48 Pendragon right that this goes back to
0:18:51 only knowing those he's associated with
0:18:53 not his own work is the one who um work
0:18:57 do you know you know how the NOS know a
0:19:00 lot yes okay what Warwick if I
0:19:04 understand correctly
0:19:06 uh and I think I do warrick's the one
0:19:09 who's who's really helping set up the
0:19:10 web
0:19:11 he um
0:19:13 yeah he's the one setting all that up
0:19:15 the thing zantosa was talking about yeah
0:19:19 has anyone explained what the web is to
0:19:21 you guys no I just assumed some sort of
0:19:23 Information Network
0:19:24 yeah that's about what I said it's it's
0:19:26 exactly that
0:19:28 um so I did wonder if I'd use the
0:19:31 internet or not xantosa being part of
0:19:33 the web means that he was feeding
0:19:37 information to the Nosferatu right I
0:19:41 mean it's part of the reason why the
0:19:42 nosferato like me so much but Neil you
0:19:43 said that you could verify that Johnny
0:19:45 hadn't Diablo rice right he's yeah you
0:19:49 know for a fact John I mean if you
0:19:51 hadn't that goes a long way to you know
0:19:53 negotiating down to nosferonto you
0:19:56 you're sure I mean if you were in hunger
0:19:59 Frenzy do you want me to change I've
0:20:01 never diaborized before
0:20:03 and I don't think that's what happened
0:20:05 would you like me to check
0:20:08 what does that involve exactly that kind
0:20:11 of a sin leaves a stain on someone's
0:20:15 soul
0:20:17 on their Aura and if you know how to
0:20:20 look
0:20:21 you can see it if you're looking for it
0:20:23 Johnny gets this really like nasty
0:20:26 disdainful look in his face
0:20:28 doesn't that looking involve your blood
0:20:31 magic no it doesn't as a matter of fact
0:20:33 it it has nothing to do with it and has
0:20:35 everything to do with the perceptions of
0:20:37 a mulcavian or not just the mulcavian I
0:20:39 mean rid of my people that do it too
0:20:40 then drink it in I have all you have all
0:20:42 the look you want this seems rather
0:20:44 non-invasive just tip well I know but if
0:20:46 we're gonna do stuff to each other I
0:20:48 figure oh yes I'm just asked promoting
0:20:51 well let's just look so that we know how
0:20:53 to move forward next time we're back at
0:20:54 court Berna has anyone explained what
0:20:57 Diablo re is to you it sounds like when
0:21:00 you
0:21:01 eat someone
0:21:03 you're close but there's an important
0:21:06 distinction it's not when you eat
0:21:08 someone's body it's when you eat
0:21:09 someone's soul
0:21:11 like literally unless specifically a
0:21:14 kindred soul you can't just go well most
0:21:17 people probably can't just go around
0:21:19 eating other people's Souls but yeah you
0:21:22 um you physically pull someone's soul
0:21:25 out of their body and consume it it's a
0:21:28 horrific act and verboten in the in the
0:21:32 eyes of the the camarilla so that leaves
0:21:34 a cyan on your aura forever you said yes
0:21:38 uh and an indelible Mark of of
0:21:42 corruption can you
0:21:45 um
0:21:46 can you check me too
0:21:49 Neil gives her a really weird look like
0:21:52 why are you asking that question
0:21:55 well you said it was a terrible sin and
0:21:58 like I don't remember what I've
0:22:00 done Johnny knows he's never done it
0:22:04 apart from well she kind of trails off
0:22:07 maybe this but kid I don't think you
0:22:10 have to worry about that I know that
0:22:11 those those first nights when we brought
0:22:14 you in after the New Year are a blur
0:22:17 well the court already went through some
0:22:19 of those things with you okay I can
0:22:21 still look it will make you feel better
0:22:24 if that's the sort of thing you want
0:22:27 um and as we're talking I guess Neil
0:22:28 will activate or perception
0:22:31 uh and take a look around looking for
0:22:35 The Telltale black veins
0:22:37 of diablary
0:22:39 okay go ahead and give me a roll uh
0:22:42 that's
0:22:43 five successes Neil uh opens his eyes
0:22:47 and just stares at Johnny on blinking
0:22:51 for a little while
0:22:52 in that really uncomfortably perceptive
0:22:55 way that he does sometimes
0:22:57 Johnny's Aura is pale striped between
0:23:01 purple and red with sections
0:23:05 desaturating out to almost brown with a
0:23:10 weird undercurrent of a very deep red on
0:23:14 the tips of that no of the um black
0:23:17 strands of diablary
0:23:20 Johnny
0:23:21 um
0:23:22 I'm sorry man
0:23:25 not not oh that that came out wrong it's
0:23:28 not Diablo you didn't there's nothing
0:23:29 there you got you just
0:23:32 you don't seem okay right now but not in
0:23:34 a diablary way in a diablary way you
0:23:36 seem okay I just Jenny kind of rolls his
0:23:38 eyes a little bit grabs out his moralese
0:23:41 pops one in his mouth lights up and just
0:23:45 kind of crumbles down on the couch
0:23:47 people wanna you wanna talk about it you
0:23:49 know do I look like I want to talk about
0:23:51 it no that's why I'm offering because
0:23:53 sometimes people don't uh anyway uh
0:23:56 Brittany you wanted me to look or is
0:23:58 that he just like gets really
0:23:59 uncomfortable under Johnny's like gaze
0:24:03 I mean yeah if I I don't you said they
0:24:06 would check I don't know
0:24:08 Theory they would but in theory uh Rhys
0:24:12 could have told us exactly who your sire
0:24:13 is and didn't so I don't know how much
0:24:15 trust we're putting there
0:24:16 the fair point um
0:24:18 so is that
0:24:20 is that a yes or a I don't sure if it
0:24:23 doesn't cost anything just costs letting
0:24:26 Neil gaze at your base emotions and how
0:24:29 they fluctuate he gives another kind of
0:24:32 look over it Neil you know your senses
0:24:35 are heightened you could probably do it
0:24:36 too at some point if you're interested
0:24:38 I've I've never seen anything like that
0:24:41 while you're saying my senses well if
0:24:43 you ever start to it's it's kind of like
0:24:46 um you know when you're driving at night
0:24:47 sometimes and you see like a halo around
0:24:49 the around the Street Lamp if you have
0:24:51 like an astigmatism you know kind of
0:24:53 anyway you want me to roll again to look
0:24:56 at Brita
0:24:57 lastly now that I think about it
0:24:58 Johnny's [ __ ] Aura looks like a
0:25:00 bruise
0:25:02 yeah
0:25:04 ooh not as good who's only one she will
0:25:06 tell you that she has a paleor he did
0:25:08 not score enough oh interesting okay
0:25:09 when Neil tries to look all he sees is a
0:25:13 paleness in her Aura it almost sounds
0:25:15 like looking at Johnny Zorro was so
0:25:17 intense it left like a sun spot yeah on
0:25:20 like you know like in like you're like
0:25:22 third third eye vision there's the sun
0:25:25 spot of the colors that he had and
0:25:27 you're just it's interfering with
0:25:29 looking at what what her Aura is because
0:25:31 it's so hers is like much more subtle
0:25:33 and refined versus Johnny's just kind of
0:25:35 like brute [ __ ] nasty Brews
0:25:39 Neil Neil stares at Brita for a lot
0:25:43 longer than he was walking in Johnny
0:25:45 almost the point of like frustration
0:25:47 like like he's looking at a magic guy
0:25:50 and he can't make the picture resolve
0:25:52 she's staring back almost like
0:25:53 confrontationally uh it's as this is
0:25:57 going on it's it's relatively clear that
0:25:59 she actually really wants this answer
0:26:02 um
0:26:03 well so so good news and I mean also
0:26:06 maybe good news depending on how you
0:26:08 look at it uh as far as I can tell you
0:26:10 you didn't you've never eaten anyone as
0:26:13 far as you can tell is that certain or
0:26:14 well I mean there's there's literally no
0:26:17 certainties but I uh you know about
0:26:19 anything but I you know I'm reasonably
0:26:22 good at this kind of thing and and
0:26:23 there's nothing there okay so as far as
0:26:26 I can tell you if you have never
0:26:28 consumed the soul of another kindred uh
0:26:32 which is good that's good news
0:26:33 um also possibly good news you are uh I
0:26:37 mean you're hard to read Bretta you got
0:26:40 your emotions stamped down
0:26:41 to the point where I can't see him or or
0:26:45 maybe just you know I mean Johnny does
0:26:48 not have them tamped down at all maybe
0:26:50 it was just like it's like Whiplash
0:26:51 looking between the two of you Britta
0:26:53 kind of sneaks a glance at Johnny and
0:26:55 looks to Neon says thank you
0:26:58 um yeah
0:26:59 um I mean you're a candidate I can tell
0:27:01 that much but
0:27:03 I just um yeah I just wanted to know all
0:27:06 right yeah but so we know for Johnny
0:27:08 right so that we we can use that moving
0:27:10 forward in court we can use that as
0:27:11 proof and then we can use it as proof of
0:27:15 what Neil saw but any Kindred who can
0:27:17 look can look and claim they see
0:27:19 something different well that's a lot
0:27:21 yeah but you can also if people are
0:27:23 doing that you can also see when people
0:27:24 are lying if you're looking close enough
0:27:26 and watching for it so it's you know
0:27:29 plus worse comes to worse I can just
0:27:31 take their thoughts out of their heads
0:27:32 so they can check us they can see that
0:27:34 when we're telling the truth about what
0:27:36 went down and we can make sure to say
0:27:39 exactly how it happened the truth of
0:27:41 what went down is that
0:27:43 Greece was trying to incapacitate me and
0:27:47 in doing so
0:27:49 accidentally lost his good friend Shaw
0:27:53 and I drank him to final death the fact
0:27:57 that idea I didn't diablerize him is
0:28:00 barely a footnote in my innocence and
0:28:04 you didn't have the right of Destruction
0:28:07 no
0:28:09 so and if I'm being honest my Beast
0:28:13 wanted to de-operize him but you didn't
0:28:16 that's the important part you held
0:28:18 yourself back on top of that we were
0:28:19 dealing with a Praxis
0:28:21 yeah so we I mean all that happened in
0:28:24 defense of of the prince's realm so so
0:28:26 long as Roland's is still in charge
0:28:27 around here I'm I'm just trying to be as
0:28:29 practical as I can guys right if you if
0:28:32 when when they come for me and they're
0:28:33 going to they're going to because I
0:28:35 [ __ ] up hard but no no no no no it's
0:28:38 there's a difference between
0:28:40 um pragmatism and fatalism and and you
0:28:44 know it's not
0:28:45 let's not get ahead of ourselves here
0:28:47 nothing nothing's done done deals right
0:28:50 but what I'm what I'm saying and I want
0:28:52 you to hear what I'm saying here
0:28:54 there is a very strong case against me
0:28:57 and when none of this is your fault so
0:29:00 don't beat yourself up I should have
0:29:02 been better at politicking before I took
0:29:03 a political position that's just the
0:29:05 long and short of it I don't and I
0:29:07 shouldn't and I shouldn't have drank
0:29:08 shot a final death the point is I am not
0:29:12 a popular brouha
0:29:15 the clan does not like me
0:29:17 I
0:29:19 was created by the Sabbat
0:29:21 that's a fact
0:29:23 it is a well-known fact unfortunately
0:29:30 of the city without right of Destruction
0:29:33 all the mitigating circumstances aside
0:29:36 those facts are pretty damning and when
0:29:39 they come for me those are going to be
0:29:41 at the Forefront so if we want to get
0:29:44 ahead of them we gotta think about how
0:29:46 we're going to be cutting those off now
0:29:49 I mean this is the camarilla it's all
0:29:51 mitigating circumstances all the time
0:29:53 you know and and really I mean you're
0:29:57 right this is the you need eitherReiss
0:30:00 or Rollins right probably both to speak
0:30:03 for you or just to be on your side or
0:30:06 the word of someone important in the
0:30:08 court that could really help right and
0:30:11 that's part of the thing that we've been
0:30:12 working on we also don't know what the
0:30:15 NOS wants so let's not get ahead of
0:30:17 ourselves he may have hated Shaw for all
0:30:19 that we know and is glad and it will get
0:30:22 something out of us but at the same end
0:30:24 of the day might thank us who knows we
0:30:27 don't know this nosferato at all I mean
0:30:30 I can you know meet him where they are
0:30:32 at some point maybe somebody can come
0:30:34 with me we can we can have a little talk
0:30:36 um when we have an opportunity to do
0:30:39 that
0:30:40 sure you know I've got I've Got Friends
0:30:42 in the Nosferatu it's and on top of that
0:30:44 it was a during a Praxis defense so if
0:30:49 that's the angle we want to play then
0:30:51 fine but what that means is we have to
0:30:53 play that angle before they play they
0:30:56 play asking for Retribution right so
0:30:58 because whoever whoever claims that
0:31:01 first is going to look the better so we
0:31:04 need to talk to Roland's orReiss now if
0:31:06 I if I claim that killing Shaw was the
0:31:08 right and just thing to do or somebody
0:31:10 else claims that it was the right and
0:31:11 just thing to do for me I would be much
0:31:14 better off than having the Nosferatu say
0:31:16 we want Vengeance for this dirty deed
0:31:18 that happened which to me says um when
0:31:22 when we have to make those kind of moves
0:31:24 when you're a primagen you have you have
0:31:26 some ends of miles to the sheriff now
0:31:29 right correct so uh you guys talk to to
0:31:33 Roland's talked to race they respond
0:31:35 better with with Johnny they respond
0:31:38 better to
0:31:40 um
0:31:40 privilege and Status though it also
0:31:44 might make sense being that this didn't
0:31:46 get brought up at the court that it's
0:31:49 just going to be a a move they play
0:31:51 later on yeah but that's why so you have
0:31:56 those conversations and if those
0:31:57 conversations happen then it should be
0:31:58 you uh and I know with an esferatu
0:32:02 um
0:32:02 they they like me and at least some of
0:32:05 them would love to talk to Britta when
0:32:06 you said you told them this information
0:32:08 about what went down was there anything
0:32:10 else that he wanted from you he just
0:32:12 wanted the story that's it yeah he just
0:32:15 wanted the facts did you get a sense of
0:32:17 what he thought about that he had a much
0:32:18 better Poker Face than I do
0:32:21 he didn't bring it out he didn't look
0:32:23 for demands right away no he's
0:32:25 he didn't even really
0:32:28 I had to make a call whether I was going
0:32:30 to lie about it or whether I was going
0:32:31 to be honest about it it's good that you
0:32:33 didn't yeah I mean there is a third
0:32:35 option but I don't think you had that
0:32:37 option which one is that you can tell
0:32:39 the truth in a way that suits you
0:32:41 obvious kid I have truths yeah don't lie
0:32:45 to the NOS they'll find stuff out that's
0:32:47 kind of what I figured was lying to a
0:32:49 Nas is sort of like a fart in church
0:32:50 same what
0:32:52 it's not gonna go over well okay
0:32:55 okay same goes for talking mulcavians by
0:32:57 the way yeah that's kind of what I think
0:32:58 or so in some ways anyways so we can
0:33:01 talk to people in court try to get their
0:33:04 favor I feel like Johnny you know you're
0:33:08 not very popular with the bruja right
0:33:10 now but you've got a bit more of a
0:33:12 chance with Shogun
0:33:14 she has a point depends on how this
0:33:16 Pendragon thing shakes out that's our
0:33:18 next Point what we need to do is make
0:33:20 sure to keep Pendragon at Bay for now
0:33:23 um and it also means we're going within
0:33:25 a week to Boston right so what's there
0:33:29 there are Boston's come up a couple of
0:33:31 times in conversation recently um what's
0:33:33 the what are what are the things that we
0:33:36 have to do in Boston
0:33:37 Arabella Rollins okay find her what else
0:33:39 do we have to do we have to bring her
0:33:41 back alive when you said you also had
0:33:43 business there yeah there's something
0:33:45 happening with the undead and it's
0:33:47 centered in Boston spirit's realm the
0:33:49 spirit Realms you were saying right yeah
0:33:51 it's it's in both the spirit realm and
0:33:53 in the realm of the dead but it's it's
0:33:56 centered in the realm of the Dead to
0:33:58 catch you up win fought a bunch of
0:34:00 zombies somewhere weird
0:34:02 in the Holy Land what the old embossman
0:34:06 park oh different Holy Land yep the
0:34:08 defunct Holy Land if you will more of
0:34:11 the uh the place that Jesus would whip
0:34:13 people out of
0:34:14 oh no yeah done like Waterbury yeah
0:34:18 um yes you would whip them all out of a
0:34:19 water bearing the place is creepy
0:34:21 Waterbury is a good whipping
0:34:24 there's the Lee family and they have a
0:34:27 whole bunch of place you know the old
0:34:28 layland
0:34:32 what never mind he's making a joke it's
0:34:34 a pun I appreciate it he's a dad we have
0:34:38 to give it to him so if we go to Boston
0:34:40 and we get some of this stuff done we
0:34:43 can get some you know
0:34:45 doing well for Johnny Yes doing well in
0:34:48 the eyes of the court maybe even get a
0:34:50 couple Boons that we might be able to
0:34:51 use
0:34:52 I like the way you're thinking Brita
0:34:54 anything else we have to do up and in
0:34:56 the Boston that's coming come up at
0:34:59 least
0:35:00 um so I mean you all know who who is in
0:35:03 charge of Boston right

0:35:11 of my my clan they were talking a bit
0:35:13 about him yeah
0:35:17 I only know him from reputation
0:35:20 very sort of
0:35:22 old old world old-school chivalry
0:35:25 kind of thing like Brita and I shouldn't
0:35:28 talk no no no no no no not what I'm
0:35:30 saying um

0:36:06 got a contact for us too we can get us
0:36:08 settled up there okay uh
0:36:11 non-loaded question uh are any of those
0:36:14 contacts and help uh in the camarilla or
0:36:18 are they anarchs or wins decided or
0:36:20 Ravens decidedly not in the camaria
0:36:22 that's why I'm asking because if we're
0:36:24 gonna go and and Trump around in the
0:36:26 territory of uh Prince Quentin King I
0:36:29 think we really need to rely on I would
0:36:32 trust any contact that Jane gives me
0:36:34 okay even if they're outside of the sect
0:36:36 I would trust that it's somebody that
0:36:38 can actually tell us who we should be
0:36:40 talking to within this act okay
0:36:42 um
0:36:44 Quinn king is not somebody you play
0:36:47 social Hardball with
0:36:49 just just period and he's not the same
0:36:53 kind of Prince that Upton Rollins is
0:36:55 he's competent he is
0:36:59 um
0:37:00 acting is not the word that's a
0:37:01 pregnancy thing what he's a pregnancy he
0:37:03 has expectations he has um
0:37:05 he believes roles need to be fulfilled
0:37:08 that sounds like yes
0:37:10 etiquette and all that good yeah yeah
0:37:11 and and any attempt to like Stonewall or
0:37:15 Hardball him he's it's just so we'd be
0:37:17 polite we follow etiquette and we just
0:37:19 need Hospitality from him right and we
0:37:21 don't try to pull anything over on him
0:37:23 he's going to want to know what we're
0:37:24 doing in a city very good all right
0:37:26 we'll tell him but I will check on the
0:37:28 status of any other Venture before we go
0:37:30 up there there might be some other
0:37:31 information I might have especially with
0:37:34 Arabella in the region absolutely it
0:37:36 sounds like really what the what the
0:37:37 play here is that we're gonna try and
0:37:39 back a lot of the locals and even though
0:37:43 we're working with
0:37:44 some of these individuals from uh the
0:37:48 Pendragon Camp we're gonna make sure
0:37:50 we're not uh selling ourselves over to
0:37:53 them right but not playing nice for the
0:37:56 most part yeah easy enough generally
0:38:00 what do you mean generally
0:38:02 generally I don't I don't pledge this
0:38:05 kind of stuff things happen and
0:38:06 sometimes it doesn't work out that way
0:38:07 so but generally yes looking to play
0:38:09 nice he's reserving his right to take an
0:38:11 arm if he needs to no but that's what
0:38:13 I'm saying if we're in Boston you don't
0:38:14 have that right miles to expect Arabella
0:38:17 to what do you expect her reaction to be
0:38:19 at this point I think she's going to
0:38:21 want to talk
0:38:22 should we listen to her I don't know I
0:38:24 also don't know what kind of it sounds
0:38:26 like she's making a fuss up in Boston so
0:38:29 I don't know what kind of friend she has
0:38:30 up there I mean so at the end I'm going
0:38:33 to have to talk to her last time I saw
0:38:35 her she got marched out into the balcony
0:38:37 by what it looked like was recent Shaw
0:38:40 to Claire Praxis marched out she came
0:38:43 out
0:38:44 yes because we are making a lot of noise
0:38:46 and she decided that this was the time
0:38:48 to play that
0:38:49 Arabella is competent and generally well
0:38:53 connected even among the ventru it's
0:38:55 just she picked uh other individuals to
0:38:59 backfill play here that didn't
0:39:01 quite worked to her favor she forgot to
0:39:04 check in with the vent true and what
0:39:06 they wanted so are we bringing her back
0:39:10 that's the objective yes all right yeah
0:39:12 we're just gonna
0:39:13 I mean we're just gonna like box her and
0:39:16 throw to the prince right that's the
0:39:18 Roland seems to want to talk to her I
0:39:20 think he's hoping that he could convince
0:39:22 her to come back you can unbox someone
0:39:25 all right I just okay I'm gonna play it
0:39:28 by ear my intention isn't to go up there
0:39:30 and start a fight with her let's make
0:39:31 that clear oh yeah no because that's I
0:39:33 mean not without the permission of the
0:39:36 Court Boston what if she's under
0:39:38 protection there then we have to
0:39:40 maneuver in the court of Boston we'll
0:39:41 need to figure out what's going on
0:39:43 unfortunately we don't know the
0:39:44 landscape much yeah yeah what we'll have
0:39:46 to do is we'll have to go ask permission
0:39:48 to to hunt her down to return her to New
0:39:50 Haven you're right or at least or just
0:39:54 ask her politely to do I mean right
0:39:56 something like that there might be a
0:39:57 conversation before we you know have to
0:39:59 stake it on a throw into a bag here's a
0:40:02 question
0:40:03 um and I think I know the answer but I
0:40:04 may have missed it did Roland's declare
0:40:06 a bloodhound no okay in fact I don't
0:40:09 think any any there there weren't any
0:40:11 blood hunts declared whatsoever there
0:40:13 was only one major repercussion for the
0:40:15 whole event
0:40:17 yeah which was what was it the change of
0:40:20 shaft position yeah
0:40:23 yeah okay so it's sounding like we need
0:40:25 to go to Boston sooner rather than later
0:40:27 to get ahead of all of these problems to
0:40:30 be clear partially because they've
0:40:31 placed most the blame on Shaw and since
0:40:34 he's died and not able to defend himself
0:40:36 right so and the the harpy spot has been
0:40:39 left vacant as well I believe that'll be
0:40:41 filled soon right but that is the other
0:40:43 repercussion that's gonna be filming
0:40:44 because Arabella was Harpy correct she
0:40:47 was yeah she was no we voted on it
0:40:49 tonight oh yeah what's the where's the
0:40:51 vote Elsa interesting that tracks so if
0:40:54 we can get Arabella back to Roland's
0:40:56 then he'll be more likely to help us
0:40:59 with the Johnny thing correct
0:41:01 I prefer for her to come back in the
0:41:04 fold
0:41:05 and I would like to know what the
0:41:06 Venture want to do with it because her
0:41:08 helping in the defense of New Haven
0:41:10 would be
0:41:12 excellent it would be great really well
0:41:15 she's assuming that our our old I mean
0:41:20 you remember when we all kind of thought
0:41:21 that maybe she and Sean Rhys were
0:41:24 working alongside this about
0:41:25 assuming that's not true then yeah
0:41:27 assuming that's not true correct
0:41:29 but she went to another Camarillo domain
0:41:31 instead
0:41:33 yeah kinda
0:41:34 draws a line there
0:41:36 if she'd really fled to somewhere else
0:41:38 if she was working Sabbat I feel like
0:41:39 she may have gone there but you're right
0:41:41 we should make sure to depends on how
0:41:43 good she is at lying
0:41:46 all right so when do we want to try and
0:41:48 get to Boston
0:41:49 how long do we need to make prep
0:41:51 I mean we could go tomorrow night a
0:41:53 couple days I think might be best to get
0:41:55 everything in order we might also before
0:41:57 we go there don't you have a friend who
0:42:00 is shipped here that we won't might want
0:42:01 to check in on yeah that's why I kind of
0:42:03 want to go uh back to my
0:42:06 place
0:42:07 um it's still there chicken oh have you
0:42:09 been okay good I mean I haven't met
0:42:12 there personally
0:42:13 it's not really my type of town part of
0:42:15 town that I like to go to yeah that
0:42:17 makes sense but it exists okay it hasn't
0:42:20 been broken in that's yeah that is
0:42:22 something I would like to check up on
0:42:23 before we go if possible but I don't
0:42:25 even know if she got here yet and
0:42:26 jubayer's not around for me to ask him
0:42:27 I'll tell you what I uh
0:42:31 why don't this why don't the three of
0:42:33 you
0:42:34 go check in on your friend to see if you
0:42:36 can find them and make sure they're all
0:42:37 right when and I uh I'm gonna borrow her
0:42:41 to take care of something that Jane
0:42:42 asked me to look in on
0:42:44 all right sure sounds good to me do we
0:42:47 want to meet back here for tonight and
0:42:49 I'll bed down at your Haven or does that
0:42:52 it's probably good to stick together
0:42:54 still through this I think the sooner
0:42:57 that we get to
0:42:58 um the sooner we start going to Boston
0:42:59 the sooner we can start making good with
0:43:01 the court and getting people on Johnny's
0:43:02 side so let's take care of a few things
0:43:04 tonight and then tomorrow night we'll
0:43:07 get all our preparations and all or
0:43:09 we'll get uh we'll get vehicles and
0:43:11 things like that
0:43:12 maybe we'll be sleeping in Boston
0:43:14 tomorrow night get some rest get fed get
0:43:17 ready concise I like it okay
0:43:21 let's
0:43:22 let's do it
0:43:23 team on three Johnny kind of just Taps
0:43:26 went on the shoulder and heads out Neil
0:43:28 alone puts his hand out goes one two
0:43:30 three team and then like go team
0:43:33 [Music]
0:43:39 after they left he's like
0:43:41 just a quick question Neil and I know
0:43:44 it's been a whirlwind since you came
0:43:45 back with was to be or your friend was
0:43:48 he or a captor or it seemed like he was
0:43:51 a friend
0:43:52 all right
0:43:54 he was a friend of mine he I don't think
0:43:55 I would have made it out of Baghdad
0:43:56 without him I just met him
0:43:59 um but yeah he was
0:44:01 I'm sorry we could not keep him alive
0:44:04 yeah me too because we owe him
0:44:07 a great deal for that he um he was a
0:44:10 good guy and he was running just as much
0:44:13 as I was if you find out a way we can
0:44:16 help him out even after this then I
0:44:19 guess that's gonna depend on what Nara
0:44:20 has to say right I'm just letting you
0:44:22 know that I wish to help also
0:44:25 better smells I'm glad that you're back
0:44:27 I had hoped but
0:44:29 it did not seem no I am I gave myself up
0:44:33 for that I I was pretty sure
0:44:35 I it would have happened if it wasn't
0:44:37 for Nora so we're all just really glad
0:44:40 to be wrong
0:44:42 yeah me too
0:44:44 so I did tell you about the Elsa thing
0:44:46 right
0:44:47 all right
0:44:48 probably she's oh a Lifeboat no okay

0:44:54 I'd let you know okay yeah okay
0:44:57 now that Nosferatu want to talk to me
0:45:00 why
0:45:02 I know Fester would like to
0:45:06 [Music]
0:45:09 the group of you get rest for uh the
0:45:14 daylight hours
0:45:16 however Neil finds his sleep Restless
0:45:22 and there are moments where he swears he
0:45:25 even woke up during the day
0:45:27 but every time he closed his eyes he
0:45:29 dreamed of the same thing
0:45:31 a small
0:45:34 child's black hand
0:45:36 Rising gripping him by the throat and
0:45:40 choking all who opposed it
0:45:44 over and over and over again
0:45:48 by the time he wakes up his body is
0:45:51 shivering from what he felt and still
0:45:54 feels in the room with him
0:45:57 Neil um gets up pokes around the
0:46:01 familiar garbage strewn room underneath
0:46:04 his pawn shop
0:46:06 um trying to calm down and going over
0:46:09 and over and over and over again in his
0:46:13 head his packing list
0:46:15 for a trip up to Boston disappointed
0:46:19 and also a little relieved not to have
0:46:24 found Nara or any sort of like big
0:46:27 human-shaped box delivered to his Haven
0:46:31 yet and a little worried a little
0:46:33 concerned because he doesn't have like a
0:46:35 packing slip or anything he has no idea
0:46:37 where to find her and he's just scared
0:46:39 of that
0:46:41 um he grabs a bag like a like a JanSport
0:46:44 backpack
0:46:45 uh and starts filling it with stuff
0:46:48 underneath his bed it goes over and
0:46:51 pulls out just this little tin bowl like
0:46:53 one of those Camp bowls with a bunch of
0:46:55 holes
0:46:56 punched into the side of it and hanging
0:46:59 from it or just various Keys like house
0:47:01 keys car keys skeleton keys just all
0:47:05 around the edges of it
0:47:06 um puts on a tie-dye T-shirt it's all
0:47:09 kind of a stained tie-dye T-shirt and
0:47:12 then dresses over it with like his white
0:47:14 mandarin collar shirt and sort of maroon
0:47:17 sweater into the bag goes a plastic
0:47:20 Ghostbusters thermos a little Altoids
0:47:23 tin filled with like wooden splinters
0:47:26 some pepper spray some hand sanitizer a
0:47:29 little baggie full of Ashes a spool of
0:47:33 white ribbon like you tie off presents
0:47:36 with you know broken shards of a mirror
0:47:38 that he if he was alive he probably
0:47:40 would cut his hand on you know a notepad
0:47:42 a bunch of pens uh a little coin purse
0:47:45 with just various coins that he actually
0:47:47 puts into his pocket rather than the
0:47:49 backpack a little baggy full of
0:47:51 thumbtacks a little tiny knife and then
0:47:55 he puts his opponent phone in his pocket
0:47:56 and in the front pocket of the backpack
0:47:58 puts like six half full Bic lighters
0:48:02 zips up the backpack and looks down at
0:48:04 it
0:48:05 nods his head like good yeah this is
0:48:08 something that I'm definitely going to
0:48:09 need for a trip to Boston for a couple
0:48:11 of days
0:48:12 walks out past all the you know guitars
0:48:16 and shelves full of Beanie Babies and
0:48:18 old clothes and records and
0:48:21 closes up the shop to head his way over
0:48:22 to miles
0:48:23 you arrive to miles's Haven where
0:48:27 members of the quarter are gathered up
0:48:29 in a circle laying out backpacks and
0:48:33 gear and stacking everything up at the
0:48:34 table as they make final preparations to
0:48:37 head for uh Boston uh what I'm gonna do
0:48:40 is guys I'm gonna go around the table
0:48:42 we're going to be tracking gear because
0:48:44 of some of the things that can happen
0:48:46 during the course of uh your trip and
0:48:49 I'm gonna go around the table and get
0:48:51 the rest of you to also list out what
0:48:53 gear you were bringing with you and what
0:48:55 your fellow quarter inmates can see you
0:48:58 like laying out on the table as you make
0:48:59 those final preparations Johnny we're
0:49:02 going to go ahead and start with you
0:49:03 Johnny
0:49:05 in addition to his leather jacket
0:49:07 unusual thick red flannel shirt has laid
0:49:11 out in front of him next to an old
0:49:13 canvas like Surplus duffel bag
0:49:16 three packs of morally cigarettes a
0:49:19 Zippo lighter his beeper
0:49:21 50 feet of rope his Wayfarer sunglasses
0:49:25 a collection of mixtapes for the road
0:49:28 this set of body armor given to him by
0:49:31 Miles
0:49:33 a shotgun with a bandolier of six
0:49:36 shotgun shells a boot knife a matte
0:49:40 black ax
0:49:41 Three Wooden Stakes a hundred dollars
0:49:44 cash coins for tolls
0:49:47 and a three pack of clean white t-shirts
0:49:51 so you guys can see Johnny kind of lying
0:49:53 all of that out including the sunglasses
0:49:56 uh when why don't we uh get what they
0:49:59 see from you uh so win has a small
0:50:02 messenger bag that she seems to be
0:50:04 loading most of her stuff in she has the
0:50:06 body armor from Miles
0:50:08 um her leather jacket which she just
0:50:10 wears she doesn't bother packing that
0:50:11 three lighters uh because those seem to
0:50:14 come in handy her dad's uh heavy pistol
0:50:17 uh a notebook plus pencils and pens
0:50:20 miscellaneous reading materials three
0:50:23 joints a set of brass knuckles
0:50:26 some extra clothes mostly flannel and
0:50:28 hoodies and jeans she took the extra
0:50:32 precaution of ensuring that she has
0:50:34 showered and is wearing clothes without
0:50:35 holes in them but still wearing flannel
0:50:38 I feel like Johnny is like and winter
0:50:40 standing next to each other like kind of
0:50:42 like confidently nodding at their
0:50:44 selection of stuff in front of them
0:50:46 miles what about you well I have a
0:50:50 hardback suitcase with uh
0:50:55 with my various items laid out and
0:50:58 folded properly for uh at least my at
0:51:01 least one good suit a more casual suit
0:51:05 yeah a more just a set of casual
0:51:09 clothing in case I have to blend in
0:51:11 somewhere
0:51:12 um are you sure he doesn't have a
0:51:14 garment bag
0:51:15 I would imagine that for the suits
0:51:18 probably maybe it's tough to say like
0:51:21 I've never been sure which let's lean
0:51:23 hard into it bro yeah lean hard into it
0:51:25 just doesn't matter [ __ ] get that
0:51:27 garment bag or just a gigantic suitcase
0:51:30 with like it's just huge flat suitcase
0:51:33 Jesus
0:51:35 I like it your casual clothes can go in
0:51:38 there but your suits yeah well to tell
0:51:41 them the casual clothes go with the
0:51:43 shoes that go in the hard case you know
0:51:45 they all have to they all have their own
0:51:47 shoes that go along with them so how
0:51:49 many shoots are we talking three and
0:51:51 well technically four because I also
0:51:52 have my War attire I'm sorry back that
0:51:55 up what my War attire
0:51:57 for the for the sake of the audience can
0:52:00 you explain what you're my report is my
0:52:02 long black leather trench coat the uh
0:52:06 pristine body armor the sunglasses that
0:52:09 go along with it the belt with
0:52:11 everything else that holds the katana uh
0:52:13 the holster rig and all that that goes
0:52:16 along with it my tactical pants with the
0:52:18 Tactical pleats yes okay uh along with
0:52:22 my I haven't figured out the shirt it's
0:52:24 probably a black turtleneck so what
0:52:25 you're saying is Marcos is definitely
0:52:27 here helping you arrange all of your
0:52:28 clothes into various bags oh yes
0:52:31 I mean he's the one arranging them I'm
0:52:33 just overseeing he's definitely steaming
0:52:35 these garments as he's putting them into
0:52:37 and then a bankroll of cash uh and a
0:52:41 guitar case which holds and uh
0:52:44 basically hides both the katana and the
0:52:46 pistols the pistol in it for General
0:52:49 transport
0:52:50 and Brita what do you have spread has
0:52:54 taken the Box uh for the back of the car
0:52:57 out to preemptively place
0:53:00 the assault rifle with
0:53:03 um some collapsible stock that Miles
0:53:05 gave to her to remain in the back of the
0:53:08 car
0:53:09 four other items she's got a Sleek uh
0:53:14 purple duffel bag like a dark purple
0:53:17 uh it's got the body armor that Miles
0:53:20 gave to her the red leather jacket as
0:53:23 well that Johnny gave to her
0:53:25 um a heavy pestle
0:53:27 what looks to be a combat knife her cell
0:53:30 phone there's a silencer as well
0:53:33 there's a notebook with some colored
0:53:36 pencils and oh her clothing she is
0:53:41 dressed very nicely it's the kind of
0:53:43 clothing that you can make different
0:53:44 outfits out of so a lot of layering
0:53:47 going on uh probably a thin white
0:53:50 turtleneck beneath like a black silken
0:53:53 dress she's got her gloves with her a
0:53:56 couple options that she can like
0:53:58 switch out in order to make a different
0:54:00 outfit and she's also got her makeup kit
0:54:04 she starts to put 200 in with everything
0:54:07 miles sees this slips a couple more
0:54:10 hundreds in there shakes his head and
0:54:12 like this is appropriate
0:54:14 she uh kind of looks down at the money
0:54:17 uh knots murmurs thank you and the total
0:54:21 goes up to 500.
0:54:23 Wynn also does bring her cell phone in
0:54:25 case I forgot to mention it and I think
0:54:27 I did so the group of you are gathered
0:54:29 up uh what car are you guys taking I
0:54:31 don't know miles what car are we
0:54:32 thinking probably the Blazers should
0:54:35 still be in good working condition and
0:54:38 that one's nice in case weather doesn't
0:54:41 go the way we want it to and
0:54:44 you know if you get destroyed it won't
0:54:46 be super distraught
0:54:49 it's got plenty of room in the back for
0:54:51 your wardrobe correct
0:54:58 so the group review pile into the blazer
0:55:00 with Johnny behind the wheel and Miles
0:55:02 up front as well correct Johnny Pops in
0:55:05 one of his awesome mixed mixtapes the
0:55:07 music starts blaring the Blazer pulls
0:55:10 out in the group of you uh start your
0:55:12 trip to Boston
0:55:13 your appreciation for leather metal is
0:55:15 always very much appreciated Jenny kind
0:55:18 of nods at you hey um
0:55:20 I'm still a little um
0:55:23 crispy
0:55:25 Define crispy Jenny grabs the uh the
0:55:27 rear view and kind of like tilts it so
0:55:29 he can look at her with a confused look
0:55:31 we're fighting um they're still damaged
0:55:34 there and I I've been trying to heal it
0:55:38 um but I haven't been able to I feel a
0:55:41 bit of it but I haven't it's a lot of
0:55:44 feeding I think so we need to get you
0:55:46 some more food was it a supernatural
0:55:48 damage or
0:55:50 I didn't really understand it's magic
0:55:53 fire fire right I don't know why it's
0:55:57 got you good huh I don't know if we ever
0:55:59 went through it but yeah those some
0:56:01 types of wounds are harder for our body
0:56:03 to come back from and that might be some
0:56:05 of the trouble that you're dealing with
0:56:07 now the children of Hakeem are are
0:56:09 really good at dishing out that kind of
0:56:12 punishment yeah well I don't know if I
0:56:15 can necessarily do anything to heal that
0:56:19 but I can make sure that you're at least
0:56:21 fed properly all right there's a couple
0:56:24 of uh rest stops on the way up to Boston
0:56:27 we might be able to find somebody
0:56:29 sleeping in their truck or maybe a group
0:56:32 of uh stoned uh kids like we uh like we
0:56:36 met on the way up from New York I'm sure
0:56:38 push comes to Shelby Easy Pickins sounds
0:56:40 good thank you make something happen
0:56:42 Johnny will then uh keep an eye out for
0:56:45 rest stops and he probably won't
0:56:48 necessarily like I think what he would
0:56:50 probably do is as there are multiple
0:56:52 restaurants on the way up to Boston
0:56:53 it'll kind of stop at each one and kind
0:56:56 of just do a quick prowl through to see
0:56:58 if there's any easy targets convenience
0:57:00 if not he won't sweat it he'll just hit
0:57:02 the next one so the closer rest stops
0:57:05 kind of give you that bad feeling and
0:57:08 your your experience at the road lets
0:57:10 you know that there might be enemies
0:57:13 lurking kind of watching over these
0:57:14 areas but the further north you get the
0:57:17 better it becomes you end up coming to a
0:57:19 place where it looks like there is these
0:57:24 two buses that have been like full of
0:57:27 people and they're just kind of going
0:57:29 you know getting some quick fast food
0:57:31 and then sort of lounging around and
0:57:34 passing out in the bus it kind of
0:57:36 creates uh this opportunity where
0:57:38 there's a lot of like people kind of
0:57:40 slipping off stepping off to the side to
0:57:42 like make phone call calls people just
0:57:45 kind of Milling around here
0:57:47 oh man is it the Fung wall Bus Let's
0:57:49 always go back and forth between Boston
0:57:50 New York and yeah so you find yourself
0:57:53 you know pulling around the side and
0:57:55 this looks like it's pretty populated
0:57:57 right now or everybody just be casual
0:57:59 about it let's not start anything but I
0:58:01 think we're safe to maybe uh mingle a
0:58:04 little bit and get fed sounds good I'm
0:58:07 in looking the least casual I will stay
0:58:09 by the car okay again it's it's mostly
0:58:13 people just relaxing and chit-chatting
0:58:15 with each other when you get close it
0:58:18 becomes clear that they're not really
0:58:20 paying a ton of attention as to what
0:58:23 people kind of like when you're close to
0:58:25 their big circle of friends what kind of
0:58:27 role would you like for feeding uh
0:58:29 depends on what you're doing to hunt uh
0:58:33 so brother what's your strategy
0:58:35 is going to try to angle for a guy who
0:58:40 would walk away with her okay uh you do
0:58:42 find uh there's a good chunk of the guys
0:58:44 that are there that don't seem to be
0:58:46 there specifically with someone and
0:58:49 they're just sort of you know road
0:58:51 tripping this let's talk to someone and
0:58:54 say hey uh smile
0:58:56 see if she can get someone who might
0:58:58 want to walk away and you know disappear
0:59:01 maybe around the other side of the
0:59:03 building okay uh once you give me a
0:59:05 manipulation subterfuge I'm sure you're
0:59:07 looking at a difficulty of four
0:59:11 but remember your win penalties
0:59:21 only a one I have oh wait no no no sorry
0:59:24 that I didn't realize that was huh I
0:59:27 have one success I I thought that eight
0:59:30 was not an eight I thought that was
0:59:32 something else it should be anything for
0:59:34 for above
0:59:36 did you roll oh I'm really dumb never
0:59:38 okay I have three successes there we go
0:59:42 okay I can't count uh so you casually
0:59:45 lure him off yeah uh how much are you
0:59:47 taking though I will take
0:59:50 three you drink three he passes out all
0:59:53 right if you pass this out kind of prop
0:59:55 him up was he with anyone no he was not
0:59:58 all right
0:59:59 like help him back over
1:00:01 say to someone that he might have been
1:00:03 sitting next to and say like hey I
1:00:05 see all right oh and they kind of like
1:00:07 hurry over to check on him in a bit of a
1:00:10 panic you do you like the wound yes okay
1:00:12 yes I do
1:00:13 otherwise I'd be like oh it appears a
1:00:15 vampire drink
1:00:18 sound weird but he's got some Fang marks
1:00:22 kind of like make some suggestions about
1:00:25 low blood sugar or something and just
1:00:26 you know make sure you settled with this
1:00:28 new person walk away okay I think Johnny
1:00:32 will also take this opportunity to try
1:00:34 and uh feed a little bit what you doing
1:00:36 I I think ideal he doesn't really want
1:00:38 to necessarily waylay somebody at a rest
1:00:41 station who's not already weight laying
1:00:44 so I think he's gonna kind of uh being
1:00:46 that he knows kind of where the where
1:00:48 the some of the the long-haul trucks
1:00:50 hang out he's gonna see if he can spot
1:00:52 somebody who's maybe like betting down
1:00:54 for the night and maybe just kind of
1:00:56 like expediate that along you know
1:00:59 hopefully maybe he'll catch somebody
1:01:00 heading back to their rig see if he can
1:01:02 you know interrupt them ask them a few
1:01:04 questions and then once he gets them out
1:01:07 of sight in between some trucks he'll
1:01:09 feed then bring them inside their
1:01:11 vehicle and just kind of lay them down
1:01:13 and you know make sure make sure that
1:01:15 they don't uh you know the the wound is
1:01:17 all closed and everything like that okay
1:01:18 why don't you give me a uh Charisma and
1:01:22 Leadership would you take maybe Street
1:01:23 wise I would definitely texture you guys
1:01:26 [Music]
1:01:27 two successes okay uh how much are you
1:01:31 taking it's like three blood
1:01:32 oh okay as long as I find somebody who
1:01:35 who I think is healthy enough for it
1:01:36 yeah yeah usually win's also gonna take
1:01:40 the time to hunt uh what's your strategy
1:01:42 she looks to see if anyone has pitched a
1:01:44 tent at this truck stop like maybe they
1:01:47 weren't driving a car maybe they were
1:01:49 walking along the highway you're not
1:01:52 gonna see very much in the way of uh
1:01:55 pitched tents in that way barring that
1:01:58 she'll look for someone sleeping in
1:01:59 their car there are definitely people
1:02:01 sleeping in their car and she will try
1:02:04 and just quietly take some from someone
1:02:06 who's already asleep
1:02:07 okay uh so while you're hunting uh why
1:02:09 don't you give me perception and stuff
1:02:11 okay
1:02:13 three successes
1:02:14 okay how much are you taking two all
1:02:16 right done uh Neil miles are either of
1:02:19 you hunting yeah I spent a couple to uh
1:02:21 wake up the past couple of nights so
1:02:24 Neil will actually go lurk in the men's
1:02:27 room until there's just one person in
1:02:30 there with him under obfuscate and just
1:02:34 grab them while their back is turned I
1:02:37 just thought it was gonna lurk in there
1:02:38 as normal instead of just a weird
1:02:40 creeper yeah and I've been I've been in
1:02:43 some restaurants with that to get that
1:02:45 guy in the bathroom literally Neil goes
1:02:47 to be that guy in the bathroom give me
1:02:49 the perception and stuff
1:02:51 just they're offering like the hand
1:02:52 people paper towels want some lotion
1:02:56 I mean Neil hunts like a creep I don't
1:02:59 know what to tell you
1:03:00 does my lurking stealth spec
1:03:06 if it doesn't now I don't know when it
1:03:08 was oh my God
1:03:11 it could only have been better if it was
1:03:13 a creeping smoke
1:03:19 all right so that's
1:03:22 that's that's four successes straight
1:03:24 creeping the only thing I can imagine
1:03:26 that would be worse if he's like propped
1:03:28 up above a stall like a spider waiting
1:03:31 for like an individual to come there and
1:03:32 just like
1:03:34 no dude it is definitely when somebody
1:03:36 walks up to a urinal and is not looking
1:03:38 so looks like the uh group of you end up
1:03:41 finishing off your hunting and continue
1:03:44 your journey up north
