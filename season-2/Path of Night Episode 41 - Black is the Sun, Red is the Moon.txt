0:00:40 terrifying vision the quarterly rushes
0:00:42 to his aid but has little time to calm
0:00:44 the mulcaving before prince Rowlands
0:00:46 declares the start of the night the
0:00:47 prince demands a second blood bond over

0:00:59 his case miles puts forth his defense

0:01:08 ordeal of kneel to kill amara and to
0:01:10 present the anarch bura's head to the
0:01:12 settites miles is promoted to cena shaw

0:01:19 end of british bargain to save neil
0:01:21 johnny you head outside alone in pursuit
0:01:24 of weathers the elysium is still going
0:01:27 behind you can kind of hear the faint
0:01:28 sounds of conversation and gossip in the
0:01:31 backdrop the parking lot is largely
0:01:33 clear
0:01:34 which means
0:01:35 that from across the way you can pretty
0:01:37 clearly see weather's just approaching
0:01:41 one of those huge black suvs with tinted
0:01:44 windows
0:01:45 he makes his way to the trunk pops it
0:01:47 and you approach

0:01:57 me some direction
0:01:59 you see him in the back
0:02:01 he takes off his jacket and starts
0:02:03 putting on

0:02:40 this domain is full of stupid decisions
0:02:43 and you know it
0:02:45 yeah you're not wrong
0:02:48 look
0:02:50 i don't know
0:02:52 what's going on with jane but i know
0:02:54 there's something going on with suarez

0:02:59 the detective
0:03:00 the once detective yeah
0:03:02 what who is he to jane she asked me to
0:03:05 protect him
0:03:06 they know each other somehow somehow you
0:03:08 can't do any better than that
0:03:11 you can hear like
0:03:13 this frustrated growl come from the
0:03:15 [ __ ] bruja
0:03:17 suarez was someone who helped jane a lot
0:03:21 before her embrace
0:03:23 he was a good guy
0:03:25 but recently he's been just
0:03:28 spinning
0:03:29 she keeps tabs on him and tried to help
0:03:30 in the past whenever he's run into
0:03:32 issues but
0:03:33 there's something going on with the guy
0:03:35 she thinks it's big
0:03:37 and
0:03:38 last like last i heard i think miles had
0:03:40 put a whammy on him
0:03:43 but you know how The Ventrue can be
0:03:45 right get into your head
0:03:47 do some sloppy work about trying to keep
0:03:49 you off off their trail jane thinks he
0:03:51 might be a threat to masquerade
0:03:54 the um
0:03:56 some of the mortal police
0:03:57 at the scene of uh niels haven
0:04:01 had apologized to me
0:04:03 on behalf of suarez
0:04:05 i think he's been booted off the force
0:04:07 or i don't know
0:04:09 he brought some kind of a story put
0:04:11 together a report on the old santosa
0:04:15 house
0:04:16 so ours has been watching it and
0:04:18 learning about it for i don't know it's
0:04:19 got to be a year at least
0:04:21 apparently there have been some deaths
0:04:23 tied to it
0:04:25 and he's been following it ever since
0:04:28 for all i know
0:04:29 he's obsessed
0:04:31 lost to him are you going after jane and
0:04:34 this guy
0:04:35 are you going to seek out amaya
0:04:37 johnny don't worry about that
0:04:39 you need to worry about where you're
0:04:40 headed next not me
0:04:43 weather's that's exactly why i'm asking
0:04:45 you
0:04:46 because i have no idea what's gonna
0:04:48 happen with this amaya situation
0:04:50 my codery just got told that we gotta
0:04:52 put a hit out on her
0:04:54 i'm not doing that
0:04:56 i don't know that's going to leave me in
0:04:58 the city or by coterie i
0:05:01 but you are one of my few allies left in
0:05:03 this city
0:05:04 and i need to know what you're doing
0:05:07 what you intend to do
0:05:09 so that way we're not stepping on each
0:05:10 other's feet
0:05:12 i'm gonna do what i think is right
0:05:14 that's all i can do anymore
0:05:16 trying to play the game you just forget
0:05:18 yourself and in the end it doesn't pay
0:05:20 off for you anyways
0:05:21 so
0:05:24 i'm just gonna
0:05:26 i'm just gonna try to remember what it's
0:05:28 like to be me
0:05:30 and be that
0:05:32 the [ __ ] does that mean
0:05:34 you'll figure it out sometime
0:05:35 he takes a shotgun on a battle axe out
0:05:37 of the trunk
0:05:39 takes it over to the front seat and sets
0:05:41 it down in the passenger seat
0:05:43 if i call a rant will you show up
0:05:46 i don't know
0:05:48 he gets in the truck and starts it
0:05:50 moments later the suv is pulling out
0:05:54 johnny
0:05:55 leans up against the car in the parking
0:05:57 lot pulls out a morley
0:05:59 stuffs it in his mouth and lights up
0:06:02 kind of just
0:06:04 stares at the ground and
0:06:07 just kind of shakes his head a little
0:06:08 bit trying to figure out what the [ __ ]
0:06:10 he's gonna do
0:06:12 what sounds are going on in the night
0:06:14 right now
0:06:15 what does the city sound like what does
0:06:16 it feel like
0:06:18 cold
0:06:19 wet kind of hear the sounds of cars
0:06:21 driving
0:06:22 people milling about bums trying to get
0:06:25 cash
0:06:26 it's the kind of
0:06:28 sound the city always has just this
0:06:32 callous
0:06:33 zombie-like hustle
0:06:36 sounds kind of tragic
0:06:39 after what seems like a couple of
0:06:40 seconds
0:06:41 johnny notices that his cigarette butt
0:06:43 has
0:06:44 just burned down to his fingers and he
0:06:47 looks down and sees that like just this
0:06:49 huge ash is sitting there and he's
0:06:50 probably been sitting there thinking and
0:06:52 contemplation for much longer than he
0:06:54 thought he flicks the cigarette
0:06:56 and he goes for a walk
0:07:00 he just walks away from elysium and just
0:07:02 kind of starts walking through the
0:07:03 downtown area
0:07:05 aimlessly kind of just looking for
0:07:07 answers
0:07:08 you head down the street and
0:07:11 you kind of find that
0:07:13 your presence has become so imposing
0:07:16 over the course of the past few months
0:07:18 that
0:07:18 the homeless folk who usually ask for
0:07:21 money even they can't seem to work up
0:07:23 the courage to
0:07:25 stay on your path and everyone just kind
0:07:27 of moves out of your way afraid of you
0:07:30 [Music]
0:07:36 something i gotta check on
0:07:38 with everything that happened earlier
0:07:40 and sure what do you need to check on
0:07:41 yeah why don't we take a walk no hold on
0:07:43 wait
0:07:44 next okay yeah that's fine dude
0:07:48 but you i i can keep it together do you
0:07:50 want me to

0:07:54 okay
0:07:55 yeah of course no rest for the wicked as
0:07:57 i say
0:07:59 can you give me 10 seconds yeah and he
0:08:01 sort of extricates himself from british
0:08:03 hug and then turns and gives win a huge
0:08:05 hug
0:08:05 when bear hugs him um she grows bare
0:08:08 arms hey uh i don't think i could have
0:08:10 kept it together if it wasn't for you so
0:08:12 i you know thanks i
0:08:15 any time buddy and then he does like a
0:08:17 couple of bro hug thumps on her back
0:08:20 that's cool that's how miles and johnny
0:08:21 hug and then
0:08:24 he's 100 correct
0:08:26 he
0:08:27 steps back um you good yeah i'll uh
0:08:30 i'm gonna freak out later uh but right
0:08:33 now um you know gotta pay it forward um
0:08:36 you can have the freak out now if you
0:08:37 want i just no no no no i'm gonna have
0:08:39 to have a freak out after i talk to nix
0:08:41 anyways she freaks me out so uh
0:08:44 i'll just have a bigger one later though
0:08:47 i think that dumpster's still there him
0:08:49 i might go scream into a dumpster but
0:08:51 i'm not good at hitting let's find her
0:08:53 she's um and i'm gonna kind of look
0:08:55 around for nick's but also the sense of
0:08:57 horrible icky feelings that i get
0:09:00 anytime she's around
0:09:01 nyx is quietly headed for the roof neil
0:09:05 just points his finger up all right do
0:09:07 you know if we can follow her it's a
0:09:09 public space um and she will probably
0:09:12 make herself very known if she doesn't
0:09:14 want to talk right now
0:09:16 i don't know what her deal is
0:09:18 and she's been my primogen for like
0:09:20 decades i still don't know what our deal
0:09:22 is so but
0:09:24 quick question what did what do what i'm
0:09:26 sorry my head's been kind of not on
0:09:28 straight for you know
0:09:30 reasons
0:09:31 what do you need to talk to next about
0:09:32 again earlier and i'm saying this
0:09:34 because i still have my [ __ ] together
0:09:36 okay earlier there was a confrontation
0:09:39 with she goes to not her head towards
0:09:42 johnny and she realizes that he is not
0:09:44 there because of his successful self
0:09:45 role uh
0:09:47 oh um
0:09:48 i don't know where johnny went i
0:09:50 okay um wynn kind of looks around
0:09:53 realizing that yeah johnny's not here
0:09:55 johnny and permijn renwick they
0:09:59 had an argument and
0:10:01 it was
0:10:01 kind of publicly declared that
0:10:05 people think that i have a sabbat
0:10:06 connection and
0:10:09 primogenics she knew something about
0:10:11 romeo and i think she knows something
0:10:13 about me okay so
0:10:16 i want to get a handle on that
0:10:17 especially if there's doubts of whether
0:10:20 or not i'm loyal to the domain and i i
0:10:22 don't want the prince to think that i'm
0:10:24 will not disloyal to the domain name
0:10:27 doesn't think your disloyal
0:10:28 he doesn't
0:10:29 and we'll deal with that we'll deal with
0:10:32 that but he doesn't think you're
0:10:33 disloyal uh actually he made a big
0:10:35 proclamation that
0:10:37 you should not be considered disloyal so
0:10:40 that if that helps get your head on
0:10:42 straight right now and neil looks there
0:10:45 i mean he spends a lot of time with
0:10:46 Assamites who eat people like
0:10:48 he looks very sympathetic right now i
0:10:51 just don't want him to be mad at me he
0:10:54 doesn't and he's not i promise you're
0:10:56 unusual i'm good at reading people more
0:10:58 math than usual he's not he's usually
0:11:01 miles oh my god
0:11:03 don't help myself sorry um
0:11:05 he's not mad at you bretta you're not
0:11:07 that kind of mad i i what kind of man

0:11:12 of you stop helping oh my god i can't
0:11:16 he's not mad
0:11:17 he is not mad period end of statement
0:11:20 and sentence he's not let's go talk to
0:11:22 nix now before you spiral i'm familiar
0:11:25 with spiraling we're not going to spiral
0:11:26 right now we're going to go talk to next
0:11:28 and neil gives wynn and miles who he is
0:11:32 blind bonded to
0:11:34 both looks of like i'm sorry i snapped
0:11:38 but
0:11:38 you know apology not accepted she's
0:11:40 blood bonded she's spiraling like crazy
0:11:43 this is kind of my wheelhouse
0:11:46 like don't
0:11:48 get up
0:11:49 [ __ ] i have claws
0:11:51 i'm sorry i just you know
0:11:53 i'm familiar when someone was having a
0:11:55 complete mental breakdown about emotions
0:11:57 he's explaining a lot with his eyes
0:11:59 right he does do that
0:12:00 that's what his eyes do i could project
0:12:02 it into your brain but after giving a
0:12:05 way too complex look to miles and
0:12:08 when neil looks over it britain is like
0:12:10 okay let's just let's let's go upstairs
0:12:11 we can okay so um can you guys find
0:12:14 johnny what yeah yeah i'm a little
0:12:15 surprised that he's not here i'm not to
0:12:18 celebrate the good news or whatever i
0:12:20 know we're gonna have to think about
0:12:22 that we're gonna have to deal with it
0:12:24 and probably not in a way that johnny's
0:12:26 gonna be happy with you guys go see nyx
0:12:28 win see if we can locate johnny i'm
0:12:30 gonna go to my former office and sit
0:12:32 there for a bit
0:12:36 [Music]
0:12:40 brother what are you doing i intend to
0:12:42 walk upstairs to the roof as soon as
0:12:45 neil is done and if he keeps talking for
0:12:47 too long bretta will just start edging
0:12:49 away from the conversation which seems
0:12:51 to be that's what happened definitely
0:12:52 what happens that i hurry to catch up
0:12:54 on the way up the stairs previously nix
0:12:56 has been someone i've been nervous and
0:12:59 uncomfortable around for like 30 years
0:13:02 is there anything i can prep brita for
0:13:03 about how to talk to her the right way
0:13:05 or i might talk to you yeah that's what
0:13:07 i was afraid of you can spy bretta by
0:13:09 your perspective she's already making a
0:13:11 mistake
0:13:12 that's fair
0:13:13 you can spy bretta using the very tip of
0:13:16 her sleeve to just dab at the corner of
0:13:17 her eye uh you know in case there was
0:13:20 any hint of a tear at the idea of
0:13:22 Rowlands being mad at her make sure to
0:13:24 preserve her makeup before the meeting
0:13:26 she's going up to the roof neil sort of
0:13:29 walks behind her three steps behind him
0:13:31 to the left just kind of like i don't
0:13:32 really want to be here but i
0:13:34 i am the mole cavian i guess i should be
0:13:36 here
0:13:37 she turns still kill you she herself's
0:13:40 kind dressed in like a shawl and a long
0:13:42 skirt very much kind of like covered up
0:13:45 under the stars she kind of pulls up
0:13:47 this hood over and you can kind of see
0:13:49 this one very long braid that kind of
0:13:51 comes down the side of her neck hi um
0:13:55 you have been looking for me for a long
0:13:56 time yes yes i have i've really been
0:14:00 hoping that we could speak and with
0:14:02 everything that went on in court the
0:14:04 past couple nights i well i really
0:14:06 thought you might be able to tell me
0:14:09 more about me
0:14:11 the conflict in court is
0:14:14 trivia
0:14:15 it is one of the few things that still
0:14:16 gives a sense of normalcy here in the
0:14:18 final nights
0:14:20 struggling
0:14:22 men
0:14:23 women in pursuit of their own temporal
0:14:25 power is
0:14:27 commonplace among the kindred it is only
0:14:30 when
0:14:31 such
0:14:32 pursuits are abandoned
0:14:35 that there is any real concern
0:14:37 because it is when they step away from
0:14:39 those pursuits
0:14:40 that they begin to see the world
0:14:43 and realize
0:14:45 what is to come next
0:14:47 you have approached me out of some
0:14:50 morbid desire to step away from those
0:14:53 temporal conflicts
0:14:55 i've been told that you knew something
0:14:58 about romeo
0:15:00 something that would connect into
0:15:03 me
0:15:04 and were you warned
0:15:06 that knowledge
0:15:07 carries with it consequences that are
0:15:09 not easily undone
0:15:11 yes
0:15:13 i knew romeo well
0:15:15 and became privy to his secrets
0:15:18 it is a responsibility of mine to know
0:15:20 all of the secrets of all of the kindred
0:15:23 through all of their histories through
0:15:25 this domain
0:15:28 even you
0:15:29 britta kind of dips her head taking a
0:15:32 moment to like focus on the tips of her
0:15:35 heels and like recollect before she
0:15:37 looks back up
0:15:39 and she says
0:15:40 i hope that knowing more about myself
0:15:44 would help me control who i am
0:15:46 make it
0:15:48 who i want to be
0:15:50 and others seem to know my secret or to
0:15:53 know some part of it
0:15:54 and i don't think it'll ever go away
0:15:57 whatever it is
0:15:59 so
0:16:00 i'm hoping i can make a choice about
0:16:02 that
0:16:02 i should warn you and then
0:16:04 the truth is very nearly the opposite
0:16:07 the opposite by coming to know your past
0:16:10 you will find yourself defined by it
0:16:12 defined by the will of others
0:16:15 into your ignorance
0:16:17 you have an opportunity to define your
0:16:19 own truths
0:16:21 i shall warn you that these two things
0:16:22 will not coexist
0:16:24 brita
0:16:25 looks over nyx for a moment
0:16:27 over to the sky
0:16:29 taking in sort of the stars and
0:16:32 the roof the city around them looks back
0:16:35 and says
0:16:36 did romeo
0:16:38 have that choice
0:16:40 romeo
0:16:41 had the appearance of choice
0:16:44 but he had no quartering no
0:16:46 opportunity to define his own purpose he
0:16:50 was
0:16:51 a pawn
0:16:53 and unlike you
0:16:55 you remained upon
0:16:57 unlike me
0:16:59 would mean that i've
0:17:01 gotten my own
0:17:02 will along the way from whatever this is
0:17:07 in a matter of speaking unfortunately
0:17:10 choices you've made along the way have
0:17:12 carried a price regarding that free will
0:17:16 but ultimately i believe you will find
0:17:17 upton Rowlands to be
0:17:20 a temporary presence in the grand scheme
0:17:22 of things
0:17:23 upon himself you see upton Rowlands as a
0:17:26 man who believes that he usurped power
0:17:29 he believes that he
0:17:30 took it by right because cesia was such
0:17:33 an evil woman
0:17:35 but the truth is he remembers
0:17:37 what she has decided he remembers
0:17:40 and just as
0:17:42 the
0:17:43 young arrogant roman pen dragon believes
0:17:46 himself
0:17:47 a king
0:17:49 upton two
0:17:50 is but a pawn of a greater power how
0:17:53 does his sire play into this
0:17:56 georgia Rowlands
0:17:58 was
0:17:59 uh is
0:18:01 may yet be
0:18:03 much like upton
0:18:04 in terms of ambition
0:18:07 but unlike him she was clever enough to
0:18:09 complete the objective she had given
0:18:11 herself
0:18:12 and drangle heart's blood of her sire
0:18:14 balthazar
0:18:16 an ancient among The Ventrue
0:18:19 but in her ambition
0:18:21 she did not understand the power that
0:18:23 she claimed
0:18:25 and much of george Rowlands consciousness
0:18:29 is co-opted
0:18:30 by the sire she betrayed
0:18:34 and so
0:18:35 often
0:18:37 is unreliable confused
0:18:40 daily dailies and gets himself into all
0:18:42 manner of trouble because
0:18:45 he wrestles with his own desires
0:18:47 and the whims
0:18:49 of a sire that he thinks he diablorized
0:18:53 they will come a night
0:18:54 when their story comes to fruition
0:18:58 and you will be free of your bonds
0:19:01 brita swallows and uh
0:19:04 runs her fingers over her wrist for a
0:19:06 moment before quietly admitting
0:19:09 right now it's um
0:19:12 it's hard to make myself
0:19:15 want that i
0:19:17 i
0:19:18 know what i would have wanted before and
0:19:20 um
0:19:22 it's hard to feel it now
0:19:24 i wish it wasn't hard to feel it now
0:19:27 but it is a distraction
0:19:30 nothing more
0:19:32 these are the final nights
0:19:34 imagine
0:19:36 wasting evenings worried about whether
0:19:39 or not upton Rowlands likes you
0:19:41 when the very cosmos
0:19:44 deteriorates and tears itself asunder
0:19:48 how trivial these politics are
0:19:51 how worthless
0:19:52 they become
0:19:54 how much have you been taught
0:19:56 about your discipline aspects
0:19:59 i've mostly been learning it from my
0:20:02 codery from
0:20:03 my own
0:20:04 observations did they show you the red
0:20:06 star
0:20:08 the red star i
0:20:11 no
0:20:12 come to the edge of the roof
0:20:14 she kind of beckons you bretta will do
0:20:16 so what's neil doing neil's a
0:20:19 star-obsessed bulkavian
0:20:22 us x5 boy has he
0:20:24 experienced the red star i don't think
0:20:26 he's seen it yet
0:20:28 do you see that celestial body up there
0:20:30 she kind of points at this
0:20:31 it looks like it could be mars brita
0:20:33 follows the line that her finger draws
0:20:36 nowhere near mars it is definitely kind
0:20:38 of a new addition
0:20:40 i think so that bright one there
0:20:42 yes
0:20:43 five years ago
0:20:46 kindred would need to use
0:20:49 mystic rights
0:20:51 or great power in order to be able to
0:20:53 see it and yet here we are
0:20:55 capable of casually glancing at it so
0:20:57 long as we know exactly where to look i
0:20:59 will look at it with heightened senses
0:21:01 vision and see if that changes anything
0:21:03 yeah it's uh this bright [ __ ] red
0:21:06 star now that neil knows where to look
0:21:08 is also in that very familiar way
0:21:10 looking up at the stars in the sky but
0:21:12 he has this very
0:21:14 concerned
0:21:15 curious
0:21:16 like anxiety on his face
0:21:18 it is considered a sign of the end times
0:21:21 and not just for us
0:21:23 but for all denizens of this world
0:21:26 even the lupines look upon it with fear
0:21:30 they call it the eye of their anti-sun
0:21:33 anti-sun the star of doom
0:21:36 in truth
0:21:38 one in a sea of omens
0:21:40 kneel nods in agreement like yes that's
0:21:42 accurate and yet that star shines
0:21:45 and that sar has something
0:21:47 to do with
0:21:48 my past
0:21:49 yes
0:21:51 where you come from
0:21:52 that star
0:21:54 that star would prove as
0:21:57 evidence
0:21:58 of all that they have built on
0:22:01 the end
0:22:02 of all kindred
0:22:05 i don't want to be a pawn but i feel
0:22:07 like
0:22:08 i don't know how not to be a pawn
0:22:10 without knowing what i am there's so
0:22:12 much that i do that i have no control
0:22:14 over so many
0:22:15 things about myself that only pop up
0:22:18 when
0:22:18 i have no control over them
0:22:21 and you would know the truth
0:22:23 britta looks to neil to see how he feels
0:22:25 about that
0:22:26 neil tears his eyes away from the sky
0:22:29 and looks over at britta
0:22:31 um
0:22:32 we talked
0:22:34 a long while ago it feels like now about
0:22:36 how sometimes
0:22:38 once you know things you can't unknow
0:22:40 them
0:22:41 and once you see things you can't unsee
0:22:44 them and that
0:22:45 sometimes just choosing to be someone is
0:22:48 good enough but
0:22:50 i know how much this drives you
0:22:55 no matter what
0:22:57 i will stand by you and i will support
0:23:00 you and i know everybody down there will
0:23:01 do the same
0:23:03 everybody mean miles and wayne johnny
0:23:05 not not everybody
0:23:07 i'm gonna okay
0:23:08 and he sort of takes a step back giving
0:23:11 her a quietly supportive look like
0:23:13 whatever you decide
0:23:15 it's okay
0:23:16 it's the space of time if britta were
0:23:18 mortal where she would be
0:23:21 taking in deep breaths
0:23:23 but her being a vampire it's
0:23:26 so sill
0:23:28 just picking out details with her
0:23:29 heightened uh vision and
0:23:32 processing around them in a visual sense
0:23:36 it seems like her answer in some ways is
0:23:39 inevitable
0:23:41 and she looks back to nyx and she says
0:23:46 i think i have to
0:23:48 know you are a part
0:23:52 of a circle that has existed for
0:23:54 millennia
0:23:55 worshipers of death
0:23:58 those who bend near
0:24:00 to ancient canites
0:24:02 of unspeakable power
0:24:04 guided by the sacred arulu
0:24:07 from the shadow of enoch
0:24:11 but for your sake
0:24:13 i will be brief
0:24:16 you're a chatteling
0:24:18 handpicked
0:24:20 taken from your life at young age
0:24:23 and trained
0:24:25 a consummate pawn
0:24:27 a weapon to be leveraged against their
0:24:29 enemies and in this case this enemy is
0:24:33 an old one
0:24:35 i am the monitor for a group who calls
0:24:37 themselves the incarnu
0:24:39 it is our purpose to watch
0:24:41 and understand the deeper
0:24:44 unseen currents
0:24:46 that flow beneath the politics of
0:24:48 kindred
0:24:50 we must forever sit outside
0:24:52 for in
0:24:54 acting directly
0:24:55 we would disrupt the flow of destiny
0:24:58 your destiny
0:25:00 yours was to aid in the shadow crusade
0:25:05 to make war
0:25:07 upon a plague that twists the flesh
0:25:10 you have seen the discipline of the
0:25:12 fiends yes
0:25:14 the
0:25:15 tsumitsu
0:25:16 yes
0:25:17 yes i i've seen it
0:25:19 i
0:25:21 reacted really badly
0:25:23 yes
0:25:24 you're active with your training
0:25:26 this meets you were not always as they
0:25:28 are
0:25:29 everyone's wise men
0:25:31 capable of tapping into
0:25:33 the spirit of domains they walked
0:25:36 over wise kings
0:25:39 but then
0:25:40 your circle performed a sin that i could
0:25:43 never walk away from
0:25:45 in exploring
0:25:47 reality
0:25:48 the realms
0:25:50 an elder of the zemitsi the old clan
0:25:53 found
0:25:54 something and it twisted them forever
0:25:58 warping the very curse of cain
0:26:01 until they were in turn capable of
0:26:03 warping the flesh it will
0:26:05 but this discipline this alteration
0:26:08 it has a consciousness to it
0:26:10 it corrupts
0:26:12 and twists the souls of everything it
0:26:14 touches
0:26:16 and so deep does its power run
0:26:18 that even the antediluvian of the zimizi
0:26:21 was not as
0:26:22 immune in rebellion
0:26:25 this means he hoped
0:26:27 to destroy their ancient sire
0:26:30 this warped monster of the flesh
0:26:33 but its mastery of evolution and brought
0:26:35 it beyond even death
0:26:37 its corpse
0:26:39 is here on this continent
0:26:41 shipped far by the star of each family
0:26:44 those who now call themselves zantosa
0:26:47 that was
0:26:48 that presence
0:26:50 but a piece of it there's more you
0:26:54 your purpose
0:26:56 was to destroy these things
0:26:59 but mr santosa was prepared
0:27:02 and you did not survive
0:27:04 you were spared the worst of it by your
0:27:06 comrades
0:27:07 but they are long gone now
0:27:09 preparing for how
0:27:11 they will put this creature to rest even
0:27:13 still
0:27:14 and still they are without answers
0:27:17 was i meant to be
0:27:19 alive as a chatterlink yes
0:27:21 all chatter things are
0:27:24 and there's more like me they lived
0:27:27 through that battle
0:27:29 yes
0:27:30 and they're still fighting it
0:27:32 i do not know
0:27:33 they have now returned to this domain
0:27:35 for a long time
0:27:36 not since you were embraced
0:27:38 i wonder if they wait for you to find
0:27:40 them
0:27:41 i wonder if they have given up all
0:27:43 together
0:27:45 your crescent room
0:27:46 but one tattoo to your hand it
0:27:48 represents that you are part of the hand
0:27:50 without sun
0:27:52 mahera
0:27:53 brita subconsciously looks at her hand
0:27:56 even though it's gloved
0:27:58 sort of tracing the outline of where the
0:28:00 crescent moon would be i should warn you
0:28:02 that our respective circles do not often
0:28:04 get along
0:28:05 you're not a part of my
0:28:08 of what used to be my
0:28:11 i am in connor you don't work with the
0:28:14 tamahera
0:28:16 well that depends on the relationship
0:28:17 between you and i doesn't it
0:28:20 you're helping me now
0:28:22 am i
0:28:23 i hope so
0:28:25 i am not convinced that anything i have
0:28:27 said will be any good for you
0:28:30 that may be so but
0:28:32 i
0:28:33 appreciate that you presented it
0:28:35 honestly
0:28:37 i know
0:28:38 i know it's risky i
0:28:41 know that there's no way to know the
0:28:42 consequence of knowing it and
0:28:45 i know that the people who give me
0:28:47 choice
0:28:49 that that's something that i have to
0:28:50 hold on to
0:28:51 so
0:28:53 no
0:28:54 no
0:28:56 no
0:28:57 why not
0:28:58 because it is in the nature of the till
0:29:00 my era
0:29:01 it will keep you separate from them
0:29:04 always
0:29:05 and if you find your circles again
0:29:08 they will take you away
0:29:10 and i'll lose my will
0:29:12 somehow
0:29:13 yes
0:29:15 even though i'm
0:29:16 dead even though i'm a vampire i'm still
0:29:18 of use to them somehow
0:29:21 of course
0:29:23 you see upton Rowlands
0:29:25 roman pendragon
0:29:27 all men like them fail to understand
0:29:28 their pawns you are upon
0:29:31 you will always be upon
0:29:33 but with the tamahira
0:29:35 you are theirs
0:29:36 a servant of their agenda an agenda that
0:29:39 does not include your courtery
0:29:43 then they shouldn't have left me on my
0:29:44 own
0:29:46 are they
0:29:48 you don't happen to know if they'd be
0:29:50 looking for me
0:29:52 the time ira does not worry itself for
0:29:54 inconsequential things
0:29:56 a failing
0:29:57 from my perspective
0:29:59 you see as i said there are all of these
0:30:02 grand things going on everywhere but the
0:30:04 truth is
0:30:06 much like that star this is very much we
0:30:09 can do to move it to blot it out
0:30:11 to seize control of it it will happen
0:30:15 but you can do as you point out to
0:30:18 johnny kind of heading out into the
0:30:19 parking lot
0:30:20 well you can affect
0:30:23 has a much deeper personal meaning than
0:30:24 any of this cosmic [ __ ]
0:30:27 i hope so
0:30:29 try to make it so
0:30:30 thank you
0:30:32 thank you i
0:30:34 um it really does mean a lot to me
0:30:38 i hope you forget it
0:30:40 and worry about things that matter
0:30:42 you know what
0:30:44 if that's the best way that i can show
0:30:46 you
0:30:47 that i've listened
0:30:49 then i'm gonna go do that
0:30:52 effect what i can
0:30:54 i have no need of pawns
0:30:56 you need not do anything for me she
0:30:58 turns and just walks away
0:31:02 bretta checks she knows her glove is on
0:31:04 but she's double checking she looks at
0:31:07 neil and she
0:31:08 gives a few moments for nyx to make her
0:31:11 way down before just kind of stiffly
0:31:14 going to make her own way down
0:31:16 she's right you know about what
0:31:19 i've been putting a lot of thought
0:31:21 into it ever since i
0:31:24 i don't think i told everybody too much
0:31:26 about the things that i saw when i was
0:31:28 in baghdad the conversations i had with
0:31:29 jubair but
0:31:32 these are the final nights and all
0:31:34 the signs are so small and all around us
0:31:38 and i've been thinking
0:31:39 a lot about what it means for it to be
0:31:42 the end of the world
0:31:43 and
0:31:45 fighting it or not fighting it
0:31:47 i don't think it i don't want to say it
0:31:49 doesn't matter
0:31:51 but i'm not going to fight it to save
0:31:54 the whole world
0:31:55 i'm going to fight it because of you and
0:31:58 miles and wynn and johnny and the people
0:32:01 i care about
0:32:03 i think that's why
0:32:04 raven is
0:32:06 looking for books and
0:32:08 why
0:32:09 there are so many people doing so many
0:32:11 little things that's why all the elders
0:32:13 are playing their elder games
0:32:16 i can't answer for you i can only answer
0:32:18 for me but if it's the end of the world
0:32:21 what are you gonna do
0:32:23 to keep living i know i answer um
0:32:26 but that's why i think she's right
0:32:29 and he kind of nods his head towards the
0:32:31 edge of the roof down towards the
0:32:32 parking lot area where they saw johnny
0:32:34 walk past
0:32:35 all i know is that
0:32:37 you guys found me
0:32:39 you chose me and i chose you back
0:32:43 and i'm gonna keep doing that
0:32:46 so
0:32:48 let's go get johnny
0:32:50 finish out this night and then you and i
0:32:52 can go have our breakdowns
0:32:54 yeah it sounds good i'm a little overdue
0:32:57 yeah
0:32:58 me too
0:33:00 [Music]
0:33:06 rumors are spreading like wildfire some
0:33:08 of which actually speaks rather highly
0:33:11 of the quartery's power
0:33:13 some of it comments on how unusual it
0:33:15 has become for
0:33:17 the prince to be putting out hits on
0:33:19 behalf of the followers of set wynn is
0:33:21 still standing against the back wall
0:33:24 she's kind of
0:33:25 just contemplating clearly the news of
0:33:28 the impending hit against the samaya
0:33:30 person has hit johnny and weather's
0:33:34 winds just already thinking about
0:33:36 all right we have to kill this person to
0:33:38 save neil this is weird
0:33:40 but i guess we'll do it
0:33:42 neil has come back down from the roof
0:33:45 uh with brita and looks
0:33:47 very out of it still whether it's
0:33:50 something he talked about on the roof i
0:33:51 mean he doesn't actually look that
0:33:53 different from when he was told he has
0:33:55 to go kill someone
0:33:57 neil is a reasonably non-violent
0:33:59 individual
0:34:00 he looks like he's wrestling with this a
0:34:02 lot and has this look like he's trying
0:34:05 to harden himself to the idea of like i
0:34:08 have to do this brit is clearly deep in
0:34:10 thought next to him as they reapproach
0:34:12 the gathering she's looking around
0:34:15 trying to spot familiar faces and the
0:34:17 only one of the coteries she's able to
0:34:19 spot since miles i think is still in his
0:34:22 office
0:34:23 would be when so britta leads neil over
0:34:27 and her expression
0:34:29 it's clearly a lot on brita's mind she
0:34:31 seems a bit stuck in her determination
0:34:34 as the two approach britta looks to neil
0:34:36 to try and check in
0:34:39 all right
0:34:41 i
0:34:42 realize it's not the best case scenario
0:34:44 but
0:34:45 i'm glad we have you uh yeah i i don't
0:34:50 after the
0:34:52 and he stops himself from talking annie
0:34:54 fellaini he was very clearly about to
0:34:56 talk about what just happened on the
0:34:57 roof and then looks around the elysium
0:34:59 with all the prying ears and stops
0:35:01 himself uh yeah um i i can't remember
0:35:05 ever the less been on my mind i can't
0:35:06 remember if i said
0:35:07 thank you or if i if i
0:35:10 but
0:35:11 i'm glad
0:35:12 to not be dead
0:35:14 for the moment the feeling's pretty
0:35:16 beautiful man
0:35:18 and i'm worried about
0:35:20 us
0:35:21 and i'm worried about
0:35:23 uh
0:35:24 our
0:35:25 out-of-town guest
0:35:26 uh my my out-of-town guest and i'm i
0:35:30 think there's good news for miles right
0:35:32 the seneschal although
0:35:34 Reiss is going to be pissed
0:35:36 well he was already going to be pissed
0:35:38 when i um
0:35:40 brought the toryador in to help oh no he
0:35:42 was he was actively pissed but like you
0:35:44 know in a way that was more fun for me
0:35:46 to watch yeah
0:35:48 so long as we can keep his grace happy
0:35:50 yeah i think we need well
0:35:53 actually
0:35:54 when you've got neil for a bit right
0:35:57 yeah all right what
0:35:59 all right
0:36:00 i have to go apologize
0:36:02 to who
0:36:03 his grace
0:36:05 why what
0:36:06 for
0:36:07 earlier i
0:36:08 i mean
0:36:09 it wasn't unreasonable what he was
0:36:11 asking and i really should not have like
0:36:14 it was so wrong of me to not want to
0:36:18 just prove my loyalty he deserves that
0:36:21 and with everything going on i need to
0:36:24 i need to apologize especially since
0:36:26 there's there's more to it there's more
0:36:28 to it it's not just
0:36:30 his grace as we know him
0:36:32 there's something
0:36:34 that we can help him with we can help
0:36:35 him become better
0:36:38 i'm gonna tell you this from a place of
0:36:39 love
0:36:40 he will not care
0:36:42 no no no um
0:36:44 if we can break through to him
0:36:46 we can help him
0:36:48 we learned something up there that i you
0:36:50 know maybe is not the topic for right
0:36:52 now
0:36:53 and i need to go and apologize to him
0:36:55 and make it right neil is just pinching
0:36:57 the bridge of his nose and shaking his
0:36:59 head
0:37:00 i think we need to find johnny
0:37:02 and i think we need to find miles
0:37:05 and i think we need to
0:37:07 have a little come to jesus meeting
0:37:09 after i go i don't think you need to be
0:37:12 talking to his grace and i don't think
0:37:14 he'll see you anyway but he seemed
0:37:16 really upset with me earlier and with
0:37:19 all that i i don't think that's fixed
0:37:21 just because why do you think he's upset
0:37:23 with you
0:37:24 well because of the acknowledgement and
0:37:26 he said he couldn't trust me i don't
0:37:28 want him to not be able to trust me he
0:37:30 should be able to trust me he said after
0:37:33 he made you
0:37:35 drink from him
0:37:36 that he trusts you and that anyone who
0:37:39 questions your loyalty
0:37:41 is questioning him therefore
0:37:43 if you're questioning whether he thinks
0:37:46 uh you're he's questioning your loyalty
0:37:50 you're asking if he's questioning
0:37:52 himself
0:37:53 does seem a little stopped by that it's
0:37:56 unclear at first whether she's stopped
0:37:57 by it by trying to figure out what neil
0:37:59 just said
0:38:00 or whether it's appealing to her an
0:38:03 apology would insult him
0:38:05 you really think he would be
0:38:07 more insulted i i just
0:38:09 i want to show him that we can help him
0:38:12 and that we can make him trust his
0:38:14 judgment yes
0:38:15 then trust that he trusts you neil takes
0:38:18 a step back so he's like
0:38:19 a pace or two behind british slightly
0:38:21 out of her sight line and just lifts a
0:38:24 thumbs up and nods to to win
0:38:27 so then i should just go talk to him to
0:38:30 let him know that we're going to help
0:38:31 him through this i don't think we need
0:38:33 to talk to him
0:38:35 brita is just scanning her brain for a
0:38:38 reason at this point it's visual
0:38:41 maybe another time we'll have
0:38:43 a free moment to be able to talk to him
0:38:45 but right now
0:38:47 we all need to come together because
0:38:49 this is big
0:38:50 i'm um
0:38:52 i i understand where your head's at
0:38:55 johnny
0:38:56 didn't stick around for the verdict
0:38:59 like he didn't he didn't stick around to
0:39:00 like come say hi i mean afterwards like
0:39:03 all of you did johnny left
0:39:05 looks around and notes that yeah he's
0:39:07 absolutely missing he did not come up to
0:39:09 hug me like everybody else did and i
0:39:11 know he's
0:39:12 i mean we're we're a you know we're
0:39:14 we're a cotery
0:39:15 we're a family and and but johnny didn't
0:39:19 stick around i i'm more i'm worried
0:39:21 about him right now if i'm worried about
0:39:23 anybody
0:39:24 he says still giving brit aside i like
0:39:26 he's very clearly worried about brita
0:39:27 too but
0:39:28 this is not the place to say that
0:39:31 all right um
0:39:33 yeah i
0:39:35 guess we should find
0:39:36 johnny and
0:39:38 mile so i i will my uh miles went
0:39:42 towards the sheriff's office i'll i'll
0:39:43 go get him when can you we're gonna step
0:39:46 outside
0:39:47 yeah you guys go look for johnny i'll go
0:39:50 get miles and make sure he's doing see
0:39:52 how
0:39:53 yeah i think that's probably maybe for
0:39:54 the
0:39:55 yeah we're going to look for johnny neil
0:39:57 habitually unable to end a sentence just
0:39:59 walks off towards the sheriff's office
0:40:01 and britta will shuffle off with win
0:40:04 seeming a little dejected
0:40:06 come on let's go see if johnny's outside
0:40:09 okay
0:40:13 [Music]
0:40:16 well as they walk outside once there
0:40:18 there's a door between them and the
0:40:20 prying ears wind kind of looks at rita
0:40:24 i understand that you're hurting to be
0:40:26 near him right now
0:40:28 i really think that we can help him
0:40:30 i think that he's more than he seems to
0:40:33 be and that might be so i don't think
0:40:35 tonight is a night where he's going to
0:40:36 be real receptive to much i just don't
0:40:40 i don't want him to hate me he doesn't
0:40:42 britta he wouldn't have had you drink
0:40:44 from him if he hated you okay
0:40:47 yeah
0:40:48 all right
0:40:49 um
0:40:50 if he hated you he might have
0:40:52 had you drink from him but he would have
0:40:54 made you go all the way and he trusts
0:40:56 you enough that this is
0:40:57 enough
0:40:58 i don't think i
0:41:00 wouldn't
0:41:01 there's no
0:41:02 if he wanted me to do that i'd want to
0:41:04 do it too and i i know right now you
0:41:06 would
0:41:07 the blood bond does crazy things i was
0:41:10 mad about my sire for a while
0:41:12 all right it gets better
0:41:14 that's um
0:41:16 let's find johnny yeah wynn kind of
0:41:18 looks out over the parking lot and calls
0:41:21 johnny there's no response looks like he
0:41:24 may have left altogether
0:41:26 well that's not [ __ ] good
0:41:28 wynn takes out her phone and calls
0:41:30 johnny's beeper
0:41:34 [Music]
0:41:37 miles
0:41:38 you're alone in the office
0:41:40 and a lot has just happened
0:41:42 what are you doing
0:41:44 i'm currently sitting in the chair of
0:41:46 the sheriff's office and i'm kind of
0:41:49 going to the drawers and seeing if
0:41:51 there's any notes left any articles that
0:41:54 i should be taking out i'm trying to
0:41:56 keep busy but i'm also
0:41:57 going through the events of the earlier
0:41:59 that night again and it's starting to
0:42:01 come back and now that we're not dealing
0:42:03 with a crisis and the fact that in some
0:42:06 ways i'm
0:42:07 far out of my depths without somebody to
0:42:09 manage
0:42:10 a lot of this stuff that i had to manage
0:42:12 and part of it is the loss of a friend
0:42:15 and a person that i talk to a lot and
0:42:18 i'm just not entirely sure what to do
0:42:22 besides
0:42:23 try to keep busy
0:42:27 yes i can feel your doubt
0:42:31 why do you do this
0:42:34 why do you choose to suffer
0:42:36 or some sort of adage about suffering
0:42:39 equaling humanity
0:42:41 seems appropriate are you human
0:42:45 because i don't think it's appropriate
0:42:48 i think it's something i should aim for
0:42:50 most days perhaps should
0:42:53 but i know your truth
0:42:55 it's easier to give away to it just let
0:42:58 it go
0:42:59 would be way easier
0:43:01 do you not see
0:43:04 you struggled so hard
0:43:06 so hard
0:43:08 and made so many sacrifices of your own
0:43:11 dignity
0:43:12 in order to protect those you love
0:43:16 we hear you
0:43:18 you know
0:43:20 you know you will have to kill johnny
0:43:23 you know that this is coming to that end
0:43:29 and then one
0:43:31 it will be the death of your
0:43:32 consciousness
0:43:34 we don't know that's going to be the
0:43:36 ultimate end yes
0:43:38 yes we do
0:43:40 i know it because i've seen the future
0:43:43 and you know it
0:43:45 because he's already left
0:43:47 he's already gone
0:43:49 so what will it be
0:43:51 will you fail the prince and
0:43:54 kill neal
0:43:56 will you honor the prince's demands
0:43:59 and kill him higher
0:44:01 and charm you when he inevitably moves
0:44:04 to protect her
0:44:06 or will you destroy his grace
0:44:09 reducing all of your efforts
0:44:11 to preserve his position as prince to
0:44:13 pass
0:44:15 in one way
0:44:17 shall you fail
0:44:20 i'll find a way through
0:44:22 i always have
0:44:24 is that what you think my life is
0:44:26 perpetual victory
0:44:29 why did you find a way to save your goal
0:44:32 where it's so easy
0:44:34 he kind of slams his fist into the
0:44:37 the desk and it's like i'm done yes
0:44:41 yes miles be done
0:44:44 this conversation is over for now no
0:44:46 one's
0:44:47 it is not
0:44:50 you will have to choose
0:44:53 i look forward
0:44:55 to seeing what your answer is
0:44:58 even if you want to share it now
0:45:01 knock knock he is visibly closing his
0:45:04 eyes and just trying not to sigh too
0:45:07 heavily neil like pushes the door open a
0:45:10 little bit but doesn't enter until being
0:45:12 acknowledged and again says knock knock
0:45:16 yes okay well i just i wanted an
0:45:18 invitation
0:45:19 okay thank you sheriff's office seems
0:45:22 weird cena shawl hey i'm worried about
0:45:24 johnny uh he he kind of
0:45:27 he got bailed before everything was
0:45:29 really
0:45:30 um
0:45:31 are you doing okay
0:45:33 no
0:45:34 i i know did he know amaya
0:45:36 i don't know
0:45:38 i don't really know amaya
0:45:40 neither do i um but that seems a track i
0:45:43 feel like there's gonna be a lot of
0:45:44 yelling later you gotta i don't wanna do
0:45:47 this
0:45:48 i mean
0:45:48 it has to happen but like
0:45:51 that's not
0:45:52 i just wanna get it out there before all
0:45:54 the yelling starts that this is not
0:45:56 something i'm looking forward to
0:45:58 no i don't prefer to do this in this
0:46:00 particular fashion
0:46:02 but i mean
0:46:05 that's either this or or what
0:46:08 welch on the deal with the zedites and
0:46:10 kill every single one of them like
0:46:11 that's not
0:46:12 feasible i'm not too pleased that the
0:46:15 said i'd seem to have found a workaround
0:46:17 well i mean you had to expect that they
0:46:19 were going to pull some [ __ ]
0:46:20 especially since we've been out of the
0:46:22 domain so much
0:46:23 where's everyone else
0:46:25 uh brit is getting real
0:46:27 yeah i got you yeah so wind took her
0:46:30 outside ostensibly to look for johnny
0:46:32 uh
0:46:33 i don't know where he went so i'm hoping
0:46:35 he's just out in the parking lot but
0:46:38 you know
0:46:39 like i said he disappeared around the
0:46:40 same time weatherstead so miles will
0:46:43 pick up a couple items and then move
0:46:45 around to the landline phone and call
0:46:48 win cell phone
0:46:50 yeah do you have eyes on him
0:46:52 no i called out for him i called his
0:46:54 beeper he hasn't responded yet
0:46:59 i have the feeling i know where he is
0:47:02 it's not safe for us to be walking
0:47:03 around out there
0:47:05 do you guys want to come
0:47:06 yeah i feel like
0:47:08 hi sorry i'm listening i i know i'm not
0:47:10 supposed to but i kind of assume you
0:47:12 always are neil um not always
0:47:15 yeah i think it's better to move in
0:47:16 groups right now um considering
0:47:19 i mean beyond the fact that killing
0:47:20 spree if if i was a maya and i heard
0:47:22 about this i i just run out of nowhere
0:47:25 punch my head off and leave
0:47:26 all right we can come in to meet you
0:47:28 well we'll we'll we'll come we'll come
0:47:30 we'll come out just come outside oh okay
0:47:32 we'll i'll i'll see you i'll see you
0:47:34 soon
0:47:36 don't come in
0:47:37 don't and then he like lowers his voice
0:47:40 don't let
0:47:41 now she knows
0:47:43 do you need help moving your stuff
0:47:44 no do you need a place to put it also a
0:47:47 no okay i'm just
0:47:48 trying to help trying to be a friend i'm
0:47:50 gonna take my car
0:47:52 okay
0:47:53 so i don't know where we're going
0:47:56 but i don't know it doesn't really fit
0:47:58 more than three people tops so we need
0:48:00 to take a cab again
0:48:02 fine fine
0:48:03 i'm pretty sure johnny came here in
0:48:05 something so we need to take that
0:48:06 anyways
0:48:07 go down we'll go what's okay that's fine
0:48:09 let's get out of here and he grabs like
0:48:11 a small set of items and just kind of
0:48:13 pockets a few of them and goes
0:48:15 downstairs kneel
0:48:17 shadows after
0:48:21 [Music]
0:48:24 so the group of you
0:48:26 saddle up and get ready to head out my
0:48:27 houses are getting ready to peel out in
0:48:30 your rear view mirror
0:48:32 you can see a pickup truck
0:48:35 kind of drive by
0:48:37 blaring very very very loud new metal
0:48:41 and
0:48:42 that's when you catch it
0:48:44 the glint of a newly lit flame and the
0:48:48 ark of a molotov cocktail crashing into
0:48:51 the front of the elysium two more
0:48:54 connect
0:48:55 and one of them waves a pistol
0:48:59 blam blam blam starts firing off
0:49:02 and
0:49:03 cackling wild
0:49:05 the group goes speeding off as elysium
0:49:08 has set ablaze
0:49:16 oh um we need to go back [ __ ] as they're
0:49:19 hit and start getting ready to take off
0:49:20 to the road you hear like just this
0:49:22 chanting
0:49:23 freedom freedom freedom we need to go
0:49:27 help yep
0:49:28 um
0:49:29 takes off running for the back door it
0:49:31 is difficulty nine on a courage
0:49:32 challenge to enter a burning building
0:49:34 i'm not going in uh yeah that's why
0:49:35 she's running around to the back she's
0:49:37 not going inside yet the building is on
0:49:39 fire your beast is not rationally at a
0:49:41 point where it realizes that you can
0:49:42 maintain a safe distance i'm not
0:49:44 planning on going into the building
0:49:46 is it just a straight card it is a
0:49:48 straight courage rule
0:49:50 no success i am spending a willpower
0:49:54 one success with one success you can
0:49:56 muster the courage to go in wynn kind of
0:49:58 throws open the back door to the elysium
0:50:00 and yells as loud as she can
0:50:03 everyone come this way now
0:50:05 brita's unable to muster the courage
0:50:07 she's she
0:50:09 assumes the posture to get in the
0:50:11 building but her beast holds her back in
0:50:13 the face of the flames and she watches
0:50:14 win with big grateful eyes miles where
0:50:17 is this stuff from boston at my house
0:50:22 um
0:50:23 okay we're gonna make sure there's not
0:50:25 any kind of people waiting around the
0:50:27 outside for people to flee away from
0:50:28 here
0:50:30 good uh yeah good thought good thought
0:50:32 that uh good uh and neil puts up his
0:50:35 senses to make sure that this is not
0:50:37 like
0:50:37 similar to what the sabbat did with a
0:50:40 throw things there an ambush okay you do
0:50:43 notice
0:50:44 that a lot of the servants who protect
0:50:46 the area
0:50:47 start working to actually fight the fire
0:50:49 it's very dark
0:50:51 and had rained earlier
0:50:52 but the clouds kind of like thicken and
0:50:56 some rain starts to come down over the
0:50:58 fire i don't see anybody like waiting to
0:51:00 pop an ambush no does there seem to be a
0:51:02 fire extinguisher inside the door yes
0:51:05 wind grabs the fire extinguisher and
0:51:07 keeps the path out the back door clear
0:51:10 okay people start rushing out they are
0:51:12 not gathering outside of the elysium
0:51:14 some of them just take off running on
0:51:15 foot into the night
0:51:17 others head for their cars and they just
0:51:19 start peeling out everyone is just
0:51:21 scrambling to get away does his grace
0:51:23 come out the prince is not seen leaving
0:51:26 but it is not uncommon for him to have
0:51:28 his own
0:51:29 means of escape uh have we seen elsa yes
0:51:32 um next nexus scene and then not so seen
0:51:36 renwick renwick has never seen that's
0:51:38 okay
0:51:39 um looking for other members of the
0:51:41 primition council by and large everyone
0:51:43 seems to make it out okay uh no there's
0:51:45 no one there's no one reported that like
0:51:47 was right where the flames really
0:51:49 started kicking up so the warning kind
0:51:51 of gives everyone plenty of time to just
0:51:54 be out of there
0:51:55 already outed and not having the means
0:51:58 to just fix stuff and seeing the cloud
0:52:00 cover already start and knowing that
0:52:02 it's sort of a cumulative effect neil
0:52:04 just looks at miles and goes there's
0:52:05 there's nobody here this was a hit and
0:52:07 run where we're okay and then takes like
0:52:09 a fake breath
0:52:11 and also tries to add to the weather
0:52:13 just to speed the process up okay it
0:52:15 takes a little while but uh by the time
0:52:18 the
0:52:19 uh fire department arrives the fire has
0:52:21 been put out and it's not anything crazy
0:52:24 it does look like some of the wall got
0:52:26 scorched and
0:52:28 it was more of an active like
0:52:30 vandalism
0:52:31 than a full-on like attack certainly not
0:52:33 masquerade breaching no not at all right
0:52:36 but it's putting people on edge it has
0:52:38 definitely caused some panic for the
0:52:40 court brita has been watching each and
0:52:42 every face as they come out helping
0:52:44 people if they need any like assistance
0:52:46 maybe if they trip she'll help them up
0:52:47 but she is watching each exit very
0:52:50 carefully and does not seem willing to
0:52:52 leave quinn kind of gives britta a look
0:52:55 stay here and win disappears into the
0:52:57 building looking for the prince
0:53:00 like neil tries to say something but
0:53:02 she's already gone into the building
0:53:04 when you uh get to the prince's private
0:53:06 quarters uh it looks like he's already
0:53:08 taken off and left probably let out by
0:53:11 the nosferatu when reports back outside

0:53:16 britta who has been hovering by the door
0:53:18 technically saying where wen told her to
0:53:21 say kind of like nods several times and
0:53:23 uh has that human instinct to take like
0:53:26 a breath in thank you
0:53:29 no problem we gotta find johnny well so
0:53:31 i was gonna say we're reaching the point
0:53:33 where we're just lingering around
0:53:35 outside of a fire and uh if we hang out
0:53:37 too much longer there's gonna be moral
0:53:39 questions so we should go either way
0:53:40 yeah all right let's find him

0:53:45 um just follow me
0:53:46 okay sounds good

0:53:57 johnny you sit at the bar the old run
0:53:59 down motules
0:54:01 and
0:54:02 they keep the tequila coming i think
0:54:04 johnny's actually asked for the bottle
0:54:06 at this point yeah yes
0:54:08 you can kind of hear the sounds of
0:54:11 buttons being mashed over at the arcade
0:54:14 as two people kind of enjoy a fighting
0:54:17 game together there's some music playing
0:54:19 a lot of like classic rock
0:54:21 and
0:54:22 again
0:54:23 people seem to
0:54:26 avoid
0:54:27 your
0:54:28 menacing presence
0:54:30 it isn't until you feel a shadow cast
0:54:33 over you
0:54:34 that anyone comes near you at all
0:54:37 as you turn
0:54:38 you recognize the familiar face of win
0:54:42 hey buddy thought i might find you here
0:54:44 hey
0:54:46 you want a drink he uh reaches over the
0:54:48 bar grabs a rocks class
0:54:51 sets it down next to his own and kind of
0:54:53 sloppily pours
0:54:55 a a drink in in both
0:54:57 rocks classes
0:54:58 spilling plenty on the uh on the counter
0:55:00 as well
0:55:01 when
0:55:03 as he's moving the bottle
0:55:04 um takes it from him and kind of sets it
0:55:07 in her lap
0:55:08 and she will spend the blood to be able
0:55:10 to take that drink with him how'd the
0:55:11 rest of the night go
0:55:13 yeah
0:55:14 chuck slugs back the uh tequila and the
0:55:17 glass
0:55:18 wind slugs back her own oh god you have
0:55:21 horrible taste
0:55:22 kind of his head wobbles a little bit
0:55:24 and he cracks a smile after a second
0:55:26 puts his rocks glass over towards her
0:55:28 where the bottle is looking to get a
0:55:30 refill wind kind of takes the plug out
0:55:32 of the uh tequila bottle and takes a
0:55:35 swig from the bottle hands it to him he
0:55:38 pours himself another drink she takes
0:55:40 the drink and
0:55:41 drinks it so he doesn't get an entire
0:55:43 drink
0:55:43 it's not going to be one of those nights
0:55:45 man
0:55:46 is it not
0:55:47 what changed
0:55:49 he uh he puts the bottle down realizing
0:55:51 he's kind of lost that fight and pulls
0:55:53 out a morally lights up you and i are
0:55:56 gonna talk up for a few minutes
0:55:58 we can do that here or we can take a
0:55:59 walk everyone else is outside waiting
0:56:01 for us oh are they
0:56:03 well you didn't come so we'll lose late
0:56:05 now

0:56:11 something we can celebrate another night
0:56:14 that's not what you're doing now i'm
0:56:16 trying to collect my thoughts i imagine

0:56:23 who is she to you
0:56:24 who
0:56:25 amaya
0:56:28 yep a friend
0:56:31 another bruja who's got their heart in
0:56:33 the right place
0:56:34 because i'm going to tell you right now
0:56:35 she's nobody to me
0:56:37 what's that mean
0:56:39 i don't know man
0:56:40 means you're ready to murk her
0:56:43 dirty work of the Setites
0:56:45 through the mouthpiece of Rowlands if
0:56:47 that's what's needed to keep my coterie
0:56:48 alive
0:56:50 there's a lot of options on how to keep
0:56:51 your quarter real life well let's talk
0:56:53 them through because it's not my first
0:56:54 choice
0:56:56 we've always found a way to make it work
0:56:59 and you getting shit-faced in some
0:57:01 bloody stool bar
0:57:03 this is a very fine establishment very
0:57:06 fine establishment
0:57:07 lurking just above the gutter and they
0:57:09 have the very the very best jose carlos
0:57:12 here sir yeah that's not a worm in the
0:57:14 bottom of the bottle by the way that's a
0:57:16 monarch caterpillar
0:57:17 all right
0:57:19 you went after weathers didn't you yeah
0:57:21 the old man's gone
0:57:23 i don't know if he's coming back
0:57:26 he told me i'm premijin
0:57:28 oh [ __ ]
0:57:29 wind kind of clinks the glass against
0:57:30 his cigarette
0:57:33 just change the cigarette right out of
0:57:35 sheep
0:57:36 it's just this crooked ugly thing johnny
0:57:39 shakes his head i don't think i'm
0:57:40 primition just cause weather said said
0:57:42 that's the case
0:57:44 and he's leaving town i don't think any
0:57:46 other bruja in the city would follow me
0:57:48 or believe that i that i was primitive
0:57:50 they followed weathers uh
0:57:53 they did
0:57:54 until uh shaw offered him something
0:57:56 better
0:57:57 ever since then he uh he's been living
0:57:59 on borrowed time
0:58:01 you know what i think johnny
0:58:03 what do you think i think the bruja and
0:58:05 the city have forgotten what it means to
0:58:06 be bruja and i think they need someone
0:58:08 like you to teach them how that's cute
0:58:11 you think so
0:58:13 i was working on it in the in your truck
0:58:15 on the way over i don't think i'm anyone
0:58:17 to teach them how to be brouha
0:58:19 i think they're being just as brujas as
0:58:21 they should be
0:58:23 they see that the city's weak
0:58:25 the prince is weak
0:58:27 and new haven doesn't trust the clan and
0:58:29 constantly shits on the clan
0:58:31 they see that pendragon's actually
0:58:33 offering him a chance to have something
0:58:36 i don't i don't believe that they're
0:58:39 doing anything wrong
0:58:42 i just they're being a bunch of
0:58:44 [ __ ] they're doing everything wrong
0:58:46 they're the reason the city doesn't
0:58:48 trust the bruja anymore because they
0:58:49 sold out they didn't follow their hearts
0:58:51 they weren't like [ __ ] warrior poets
0:58:53 they were [ __ ] sellouts
0:58:56 every single one of them and the only
0:58:58 two who didn't [ __ ] sell out johnny
0:59:00 saxon
0:59:02 is you and weathers
0:59:04 so who of the of anyone else in the city
0:59:07 is better to teach them how to be proper
0:59:08 brouha again his soul shoulders sag
0:59:12 and he kind of looks down at his morally
0:59:14 he puts it out
0:59:16 looks at you in the face you can see
0:59:18 that his eyes are a little bit unfocused
0:59:21 but he's
0:59:23 his vision starts to kind of coalesce
0:59:25 when he finally makes eye contact with
0:59:28 you
0:59:29 my clan
0:59:31 has been surviving
0:59:33 if that's selling out
0:59:36 i'm terrified what it is to be
0:59:38 to know
0:59:40 what it is to be that i've been doing
0:59:43 because right now the prince told me
0:59:44 that i gotta kill another bruja
0:59:47 to appease the settights
0:59:50 or my coderymate dies
0:59:52 and me taking that [ __ ]
0:59:55 and not saying anything about it
0:59:58 that sounds like selling out
1:00:00 do you think i was gonna suggest you
1:00:02 take it lying down
1:00:04 no
1:00:05 how do i take it
1:00:07 i don't know i think up the ass at this
1:00:09 point but
1:00:10 we're kind of in that position a lot and
1:00:12 we always manage to find our way out
1:00:18 if it comes down to it yeah i will i
1:00:20 will kill your friend and i will
1:00:21 probably damage our relationship
1:00:23 irreparably when what the [ __ ] are you
1:00:25 and i doing in the camarilla i really
1:00:27 don't know man i'm here for them what
1:00:29 are any of us doing on the camera right
1:00:31 now surviving
1:00:32 i mean neil's better off with his ass my
1:00:35 friends who knows where the [ __ ] berta
1:00:37 belongs
1:00:39 you and i
1:00:40 wha what are we doing here
1:00:43 i get why miles is doing it
1:00:45 wind takes another slug from the tequila
1:00:48 bottle and shakes her head
1:00:50 buddy i ask myself that same question
1:00:52 all the time
1:00:53 the only thing it comes back to is this
1:00:54 codery
1:00:56 and until now that's been enough but now
1:00:59 now we're facing down the barrel of
1:01:02 splitting us up
1:01:03 because you're not gonna help with this
1:01:05 i can't i know
1:01:08 and i'm not gonna let neil die
1:01:11 but i'm not gonna let you stand by
1:01:13 yourself
1:01:14 the only thing that's killing neil
1:01:17 are the orders of an insane
1:01:19 ventrue prince who doesn't know up from
1:01:22 down or right from wrong
1:01:25 who's been [ __ ]
1:01:26 obliterated by the tremere
1:01:29 and is now a shadow of any
1:01:32 vampire that he used to be
1:01:34 we have so many options other than going
1:01:37 against amaya i could give pendragon a
1:01:39 call and i could probably get a bruja
1:01:41 hit squad in here to take out the prince
1:01:43 tomorrow
1:01:44 i could run away to the anarchs tell
1:01:46 amaya about this maybe
1:01:48 get a group of them to help us take him
1:01:50 out
1:01:51 i don't think this is a talk for you and
1:01:52 me man i think we got to be honest with
1:01:54 our people about this
1:01:56 the cutery yep
1:01:59 because i don't care what we do but we
1:02:01 do it together
1:02:02 i don't know if this is the
1:02:04 me talking to the tequila
1:02:06 but i don't trust miles has our
1:02:08 intentions of heart
1:02:10 i think he's got the ventrue clan
1:02:11 intentions at heart
1:02:13 well maybe this is his coming to jesus
1:02:15 meeting too
1:02:17 maybe at this point he's got to choose
1:02:19 and maybe that makes our decision for us
1:02:21 am i any better if i put him in that in
1:02:24 that position
1:02:25 because i don't want to go against my
1:02:26 clan
1:02:27 i don't think you're going against your
1:02:29 clan i think you're going against a
1:02:30 friend
1:02:31 it sucks
1:02:32 this whole [ __ ] show [ __ ] sucks and
1:02:35 the easiest way out of this is we cut
1:02:38 off the head
1:02:39 but you and i aren't doing that on our
1:02:40 own
1:02:41 yeah
1:02:42 wynn offers the bottle johnny finishes
1:02:45 the bottle off
1:02:46 sets it down
1:02:47 takes a moment kind of staring at it
1:02:50 wobbly kind of reaches into his jacket
1:02:52 pulls out the morleys
1:02:54 sees there's only one left takes it out
1:02:57 drops it on the counter
1:02:59 kind of nods to you like he's ready to
1:03:01 go don't admit defeat yet johnny saxon
1:03:04 his eyebrows kind of arch up like as if
1:03:06 he's kind of impressed with the funny
1:03:07 joke you just said a few crumpled bills
1:03:10 come out dropped on the uh on the
1:03:12 counter
1:03:13 he pops the cigarette in his mouth
1:03:15 lights up gets up and kind of
1:03:17 wobbly stands up to his feet when is
1:03:20 quick on her feet to make sure he
1:03:22 doesn't fall over he uh he puts a hand
1:03:24 out and reaches out and kind of holding

1:05:33 slammeritis
1:05:35 and
1:05:36 they're just done
1:05:38 i feel like the latest part had some
1:05:39 effect on that i realized [ __ ] uh
1:05:43 you could just have like a slammer on a
1:05:45 sick hacky sack bro
1:05:48 that
1:05:48 like flanks hack he said just red dots
1:05:50 people to death
1:05:53 [ __ ] miss hacky sack all right so
1:05:55 please don't undermine hunter the
1:05:56 reckoning's coolness that hard
1:05:58 yeah remember those
1:06:02 i had those
1:06:03 [ __ ] devil sticks baby
1:06:05 that was like the yo-yo where you didn't
1:06:07 have to worry about
1:06:08 pulling it back up and did it on its own
1:06:10 it was just oh there was also yeah the
1:06:12 self-winding yo
1:06:13 automated yoyos yeah the yoyo those
1:06:15 things are [ __ ] and fake the 90s
1:06:17 definitely had the weird yo-yo revival
1:06:20 for a while uh yeah everybody was into
1:06:22 like i learned all of my yo-yo tricks
1:06:24 all the like competition yo-yo [ __ ]
1:06:26 which by the way you could definitely
1:06:27 have a [ __ ] like goddamn avengers
1:06:29 show up with a cleveland
1:06:31 dude honestly that sounds awesome it's
1:06:33 like something like [ __ ] like 12 year
1:06:34 old like avenger with you no [ __ ]
1:06:37 i mean yo yo weapons have been around
1:06:39 walk the dog [ __ ] pretty great
1:06:42 around the [ __ ]
1:06:44 world seriously like i was like [ __ ]
1:06:46 the beginning of turtles right yep
1:06:47 turtles
1:06:50 that's when they stopped being able to
1:06:51 use weapons
1:06:53 honestly
1:06:54 i'm imagining like
1:06:56 any time you
1:06:57 uh in the 90s any time you were like
1:06:59 yo-yos are lame to people who really
1:07:01 like yo-yos they went on like a random
1:07:03 out-of-nowhere history spiel about how
1:07:05 they like originally were weapons
1:07:08 like i jus so many kids randomly had
1:07:11 like weird warrior yo-yo history
1:07:13 knowledge yeah
1:07:16 yeah immediately that happened to me
1:07:17 like three [ __ ] times it might just
1:07:18 be uk
1:07:20 yeah it happened so often i assumed it
1:07:22 was universal
1:07:23 remember when we used to be on a podcast
1:07:26 no yeah it was our yo-yo podcast i
1:07:29 remember that
1:07:31 i thought we were recording another
1:07:32 episode of beast mode
1:07:34 it should not have been set in the 90s
1:07:36 yeah no you made a mistake
1:07:39 look i understand it's a very cool year
1:07:41 at a cool setting but like you [ __ ] us
1:07:42 up sinbad's genie movie it's just gone
1:07:45 wild
