0:00:00 path of night is an actual play vampire
0:00:02 the masquerade podcast set in the
0:00:03 classic world of darkness we're all
0:00:06 friends we're here to have fun but our
0:00:07 story can include graphic violence drug
0:00:10 use sexual content and other mature
0:00:12 themes we talked at our table about
0:00:14 safety comfort and consent both as
0:00:16 players and storytellers we know what to
0:00:18 expect we're all excited to be here we
0:00:20 want you to feel the same
0:00:22 so listener discretion is advised
0:00:25 now
0:00:26 let's walk the path of night
0:00:29 last time on path of night wayne and
0:00:31 miles discussed raven's intention to end
0:00:33 the demon threat
0:00:35 gwen promises to help romeo talk to
0:00:37 brita about their shared pasts
0:00:40 miles calls his sire argon peterson and
0:00:43 is informed of the incoming arrival of
0:00:45 displaced princes to new haven the chief
0:00:47 entry discussed the instability of the
0:00:49 romaine and that of upton Rowlands
0:00:52 miles receives instructions to
0:00:53 strengthen and unite the city even if it
0:00:56 means replacing prince woolens
0:00:58 meanwhile johnny neil and buddha spot
0:01:01 the killing spree wrecking havoc out of
0:01:02 duncan
0:01:03 despite the brawl's readiness to take on
0:01:06 his sub signer the three end up
0:01:08 combining their skills to make a quick
0:01:10 getaway
0:01:11 [Music]
0:01:13 so
0:01:14 i'm gonna read you in on the situation
0:01:16 the sabbath attacks in the south have
0:01:18 been progressing and
0:01:20 currently my sire and some others are
0:01:23 putting the other
0:01:24 team or something
0:01:26 and are moving dispossessed this
0:01:29 displaced
0:01:30 moving displaced princes to
0:01:33 new haven
0:01:35 in the near future great can we tell
0:01:38 them no displaced princes
0:01:40 a dozen a dozen dozen the sabbath are
0:01:43 running rampant on the east coast
0:01:45 there's got to be a bunch of displaced
0:01:46 princes wait are they so princes if they
0:01:49 come here no much like elsa no not
0:01:52 unless they want to run a praxis right
0:01:54 they can't do that
0:01:55 that's the issue can't is a strong word
0:01:58 no they shouldn't so
0:02:00 but will they probably
0:02:02 so the messiah has
0:02:05 doubly charged me to make sure that the
0:02:08 domain is in
0:02:10 strong stable then true hands
0:02:12 johnny lowers his head ventrue hands so
0:02:15 we're good
0:02:16 yes strong
0:02:19 stable and he like his eyes flick over
0:02:22 to brita and then he just looks at miles
0:02:25 and then true hands way possible um
0:02:29 so
0:02:30 gotcha
0:02:31 stop i have two thoughts on this first
0:02:33 thing we need to do is
0:02:35 get the sabbat under control yes yeah uh
0:02:39 that's pretty clear although like i said
0:02:40 um we've got a way at least to track the
0:02:42 big boy
0:02:43 um what about any of the underlings they
0:02:46 move in packs
0:02:48 right right if there is any way if we
0:02:50 can get them separated from
0:02:52 then we might be able to pick off some
0:02:53 of the smaller ones uh that's the whole
0:02:56 problem
0:02:57 we could pull them to us but if i were
0:03:00 them i would try to bring protection
0:03:03 yeah we don't know their names and
0:03:05 anything we can do to divide and conquer
0:03:07 it would be ideal because
0:03:09 currently we can pull in some
0:03:10 reinforcements but essentially one of
0:03:12 the strongest things unless we can call
0:03:14 other people when
0:03:17 when we were at the house with the
0:03:20 mortals
0:03:21 you
0:03:22 got some animals to keep an eye on it
0:03:24 right
0:03:24 yeah could you
0:03:26 i don't know
0:03:27 um i'm sorry i don't know how many
0:03:29 animals you can get to look out for
0:03:31 things but would we be able to kind of
0:03:34 get eyes on the city that way it's worth
0:03:36 a shot there's also i mean any there's a
0:03:39 lot of mortal crime in the city and
0:03:41 anytime a new dangerous gang moves in
0:03:45 everybody knows about it i'm i'm gonna
0:03:47 be i can reach out look for some
0:03:49 dangerous hot spots places people don't
0:03:50 go anymore and now that we've got a
0:03:52 photo of her um you know with a little
0:03:54 bit of help you have a void of her he
0:03:56 looks at johnny again a photo of him
0:03:59 she didn't appear in the photo she just
0:04:00 doesn't like there's actually someone
0:04:02 else we should go after
0:04:04 who's that sabbat packs have an
0:04:06 interesting dynamic
0:04:08 one of their
0:04:09 members is called an abbot
0:04:12 okay the abbot is
0:04:14 the k-9 responsible
0:04:16 for making sure they have a place to
0:04:18 sleep
0:04:20 and that they have ways to feed and stay
0:04:23 active
0:04:24 the rest of the pack prowls and hunts
0:04:27 and goes about conducting all the
0:04:29 horrible things that they call business
0:04:32 but the abbott makes sure that they're
0:04:34 all taken care of who's the habit of the
0:04:36 killing spree carmen has three children
0:04:38 on the pack the youngest of them is
0:04:40 named cynthia she's the one that looks
0:04:42 out for them i remember her face clearly
0:04:44 okay so she
0:04:46 is not a hardened sabbat killing machine
0:04:50 she can still blend in with society she
0:04:53 can go places and make deals
0:04:56 to secure
0:04:58 storage facilities or
0:05:00 garages places where they can haven
0:05:03 has she partaken in that vaultery thing
0:05:06 of course
0:05:07 all right but she doesn't have
0:05:10 the monstrous nature that you would
0:05:12 expect out of a sabbat if we need to
0:05:14 strike at them it will not be easy to
0:05:16 find her and undoubtedly she is being
0:05:19 guarded by some kind of horrible
0:05:21 creation that zamitsi have made like she
0:05:25 what's that like the weeping bear
0:05:26 something like that but she would be
0:05:29 the first point to strike at if we can
0:05:32 take cynthia out suddenly they lose
0:05:35 the one member that actually cares for
0:05:38 their needs they can't go to ground
0:05:40 anymore
0:05:42 they will have a much more difficult
0:05:44 time of uh displacing to a new haven and
0:05:47 they'll have a much more difficult time
0:05:49 of staying low when they
0:05:52 want to
0:05:54 hide after having made a masquerade
0:05:56 breach great hitting those supplies
0:05:58 seems like a good idea
0:05:59 and you said you remember her face
0:06:01 vividly so
0:06:03 that same idea applies then photo or no
0:06:06 photo if we're okay with it yeah
0:06:08 i could try it okay so i guess uh was
0:06:11 there anything else that your sire told
0:06:14 you on the phone call yeah
0:06:16 he no longer needs veto i propose and i
0:06:20 know we're all gonna hate it
0:06:22 getting him to Reiss giving him doris
0:06:24 really
0:06:25 if anyone can make something out of
0:06:28 the horrible things
0:06:29 the zantos i can do i feel like the
0:06:31 premiere would probably be the best
0:06:32 suited
0:06:34 same here but i need him we need him
0:06:37 currently and this city needs him to
0:06:39 stop coming after us
0:06:41 so
0:06:42 this trade
0:06:44 vetoes and tulsa therese as a as a make
0:06:47 good peace offering
0:06:48 right hopefully better do you want to
0:06:51 try and get together the uh gemini
0:06:53 league and talk to them about plans and
0:06:55 making sure this city stays adventure
0:06:57 hands i'm going to have a conversation
0:06:59 with Rowlands at least i think
0:07:02 elsa is on board with that
0:07:04 to one degree another she does not
0:07:06 want a position
0:07:08 maybe we can buy Reiss's
0:07:10 help
0:07:11 that's my hope and make a stronger city
0:07:14 we need them to stop coming after us and
0:07:16 seeing us as a threat and i hate it
0:07:19 i want to make that clear
0:07:21 no i i trust you miles there's an awful
0:07:25 lot of [ __ ] going on and anything we
0:07:27 can do to stop the avalanche sounds
0:07:29 it's a smart play yeah well then i think
0:07:32 what we have to do
0:07:33 is you have to start making some phone
0:07:35 calls and scheduling some meetings for
0:07:37 us to attend speaking of [ __ ]
0:07:40 we want the best chance against them
0:07:41 here
0:07:42 in whatever endeavor we're doing um
0:07:45 when i'm sorry but miles do you think
0:07:47 you could get me another one i could
0:07:49 probably get you one nail i didn't want
0:07:50 to ask because but
0:07:53 i can get you one next one we can make
0:07:55 things yet again even for this stuff no
0:07:58 moving out on their own no they're
0:08:00 getting closer and i don't know if it's
0:08:02 on purpose or by accident and we don't
0:08:04 know what this new
0:08:06 element that has jane is capable of
0:08:08 doing and
0:08:09 currently on this chessboard right
0:08:11 currently they seem to be less
0:08:13 aggressive
0:08:14 should we
0:08:15 warn them
0:08:16 mortals about
0:08:18 the killing spree or anything personally
0:08:20 i'd love to talk to them and convince
0:08:22 them that we're not the worst thing in
0:08:23 the night well
0:08:25 hopefully they'll get back to us
0:08:26 tomorrow
0:08:27 that's what we said right we're going to
0:08:28 give them some time yes
0:08:31 i can check in with the eyes that i have
0:08:33 on them all right please do
0:08:35 by the way bruta romeo's here
0:08:38 you
0:08:39 saw him yeah he was actually teaching
0:08:41 joey how to play piano so he's doing
0:08:44 okay he wasn't a child when he died so i
0:08:47 think he's got a better grip on his self
0:08:51 and that's the role he's in now but he
0:08:53 does want to talk to you when i told him
0:08:55 i would help him i'd want to talk to him
0:08:57 too thank you not a problem is the piano
0:09:00 music still going it is not he may not
0:09:02 be here anymore well whenever we can fit
0:09:04 that in
0:09:05 at some point
0:09:07 um i don't want to do it alone anyways
0:09:10 but i really i've been avoiding it for a
0:09:12 couple of days but i really do need to
0:09:14 go back to my haven especially if we're
0:09:16 gonna go do this
0:09:18 go do this thing i need everything i can
0:09:20 get i'll take you there i can go too if
0:09:22 you want might as well make it too okay
0:09:25 neil you should you should be prepared
0:09:26 they took a lot
0:09:28 i'm um that's why i've been avoiding
0:09:30 going home
0:09:31 who do you want all of us there i think
0:09:34 we need to
0:09:35 stick to the body system
0:09:37 and try and get as much done as we
0:09:38 possibly can oh [ __ ] johnny i'm sorry i
0:09:41 ate your cigarettes i hate to say this
0:09:43 but i think it should
0:09:45 win i think you should probably stay
0:09:46 here with bretta
0:09:48 keep her occupied
0:09:50 and maybe see if you can
0:09:52 channel romeo that way the two of you
0:09:55 can focus on something while miles makes
0:09:58 some phone calls without anybody getting
0:10:00 into his hair he gives you a hard look
0:10:02 about that wind kind of just gives a nod
0:10:04 two of us will go to your haven
0:10:07 see what we can uh collect maybe see
0:10:10 about even getting some of that
0:10:12 ritual started yeah
0:10:14 um
0:10:15 the ritual will be more effective if i
0:10:18 can approach the veil before we do it
0:10:20 but but let's do it i got a few days at
0:10:22 least i'm good at finding whatever you
0:10:24 need sounds like a solid plan i'm
0:10:26 probably going to try to find and pull
0:10:28 extra security to my haven we might be
0:10:31 able to start at least doing rotating
0:10:32 but we should not be having alone if we
0:10:34 can help it yeah i think we can split up
0:10:37 to a certain degree but still body
0:10:38 systems always um we also may want to
0:10:41 find a um a joint haven a new place a
0:10:45 new place that maybe other people don't
0:10:47 know about it's not a bad idea i can
0:10:49 look around i think if we can keep the
0:10:51 paper trail to a minimum that would be
0:10:52 good that's why i was saying i could
0:10:54 look around
0:10:55 how um how gross does it need to not be
0:10:57 pretty not gross you've worked with me
0:11:00 that's going to eliminate some options
0:11:01 but i'll look into it
0:11:06 [Music]
0:11:09 after the glory meets
0:11:10 each retreat unrest for the day after
0:11:14 night falls miles
0:11:16 you find yourself
0:11:18 this time again awakening and being down
0:11:22 the blood you would normally be
0:11:24 now as i understand it you have some
0:11:26 phone calls to make yes i prepare myself
0:11:29 and get dressed for my phone call then
0:11:31 uh reach out to Rowlands okay the basic
0:11:34 callouts Rowlands and
0:11:36 it rings and rings and rings for much
0:11:39 longer than usually mine but then
0:11:41 someone picks up at the end of their end
0:11:44 hello dwight that's right yes hello
0:11:46 hello your grace
0:11:48 just that you miles it is me miles how
0:11:51 are you this evening doing well on
0:11:53 checking in on you and seeing what's
0:11:54 going on
0:11:55 i am well watchful
0:11:57 vigilant and ready
0:11:59 you see
0:12:00 have things
0:12:02 calmed down any since the last night in
0:12:04 elysium for you the storm has even begun
0:12:06 to strike
0:12:08 have you dismissed all your ghouls
0:12:11 yes i can afford no spot how are you
0:12:14 getting around and getting i'm not i'm
0:12:16 simply waiting here
0:12:18 right they would expect you to travel
0:12:20 and that's when they would strike
0:12:22 so you plan on just being in your haven
0:12:24 until the next elysium
0:12:26 next night of court
0:12:28 well until the wolves are dealt with
0:12:30 miles i will not leave myself vulnerable
0:12:33 you and i know how much this domain
0:12:36 cannot function without a strong prince
0:12:39 and should i not be prepared
0:12:42 should i fall
0:12:43 this domain will undoubtedly crumble
0:12:46 of course the domain needs a strong
0:12:48 prince and it needs
0:12:50 somebody to
0:12:52 bring all these pieces together yes this
0:12:54 is otherwise a village of idiots
0:12:57 do you really feel that the best cause
0:12:59 is to isolate yourself then
0:13:02 yes obviously miles what is your
0:13:03 question why are you calling i am
0:13:06 mainly just like calling to keep you
0:13:09 updated on some of the
0:13:11 uh things that i've been handling and
0:13:14 i'm good the enoch is dead we are
0:13:17 doing our research into that and
0:13:19 making
0:13:20 miles what is that research it's a
0:13:22 brewer
0:13:23 that practically grow in trees
0:13:25 cut that one down i'm sure she's
0:13:27 fighting for oppression or whatever
0:13:30 and then let the next take her place
0:13:32 won't be our problem very good i'm
0:13:36 i've got time to handle this on my own
0:13:37 i'm trying to do it
0:13:39 in a clean venture way i like that yes
0:13:43 otherwise we are also on the hunt for
0:13:45 the sabbat as you know i do they fear
0:13:47 you no doubt
0:13:49 if they don't they will soon enough
0:13:52 but
0:13:53 i'm just
0:13:54 hoping that maybe you'll be
0:13:57 attending to matters in a regular normal
0:14:00 fashion again i know that uh while the
0:14:02 domain is
0:14:04 under attack it's it's good to be among
0:14:07 the other kindred
0:14:08 mouse you're very young
0:14:10 but
0:14:11 you must understand
0:14:13 that i am an elder
0:14:15 a month
0:14:17 a year a decade
0:14:19 these are not long periods of time to
0:14:21 the immortal
0:14:22 i can wait it out
0:14:25 and in a century
0:14:27 rise and continue business again
0:14:29 very good to grace
0:14:31 once we have struck a blow against the
0:14:33 sabbath i'm
0:14:35 hoping to meet with you and then we can
0:14:36 present it to the court
0:14:38 present what
0:14:39 oh victory
0:14:40 yes when you destroy them right or just
0:14:43 eradicate this about put them on their
0:14:46 heels

0:14:48 eradicating a whole cult but the ones in
0:14:50 the area yes yes absolutely

0:15:32 interacted with them in the past yes
0:15:34 they're going to get hungry they're very
0:15:36 old yeah and they could experience some
0:15:40 very serious problems if often just sets
0:15:43 them aside for a month i guess i will
0:15:45 reach out to them and see if i could
0:15:48 take care of if they're that would be

0:16:42 okay you reach out to elsa she does
0:16:44 agree to a meeting uh there is a

0:16:56 dress and be prepared to meet her there

0:17:05 appointment then when you arrive
0:17:08 you do so in the midst of something of a
0:17:10 salon that is taking place
0:17:12 there are
0:17:13 uh the toryor of the domain are largely
0:17:16 gathered though it seems britta was not
0:17:18 invited and
0:17:20 when you head in you're directed
0:17:23 to elsa who is
0:17:25 relaxing by the piano and is playing
0:17:29 soft music
0:17:31 most of those gathered are just
0:17:33 entranced and lost in the experience so
0:17:36 it's difficult to make any quick small
0:17:38 talk with them
0:17:39 i will
0:17:40 wait until she
0:17:42 both notices me and danes to talk to me
0:17:44 as i've done previously when you
0:17:46 approach uh she actually shifts over in
0:17:49 her seat giving some room on the bench
0:17:51 that she's on so that you can sit next
0:17:53 to her i will do so
0:17:56 miles
0:17:57 elsa
0:17:58 it's good to see you again it's good to
0:18:00 see you also you play beautifully
0:18:03 thank you
0:18:04 i actually wanted to invite you over
0:18:06 because i was curious
0:18:08 about how you play
0:18:10 possibly
0:18:12 there is no such thing shall i
0:18:14 demonstrate yes there is only those who
0:18:17 are passionate
0:18:18 and those who should perhaps spend their
0:18:20 times doing something else
0:18:24 one ouch
0:18:26 that hurt miles way more than she knows
0:18:29 she just did
0:18:32 some torador [ __ ] oh
0:18:34 that is like his backstory in like a
0:18:36 nutshell
0:18:36 [Laughter]
0:18:40 what she's is there's no such thing as
0:18:42 good and bad ideas only being passionate
0:18:45 yeah okay
0:18:47 performance and
0:18:50 i'm not totally cruel
0:18:51 dexterity
0:18:55 your difficulty is seven you're a little
0:18:57 nervous
0:18:59 eight successes
0:19:01 oh yeah i am dude she listens and the
0:19:05 first time you try to get her attention
0:19:07 in the conversation she doesn't quite
0:19:10 hear you
0:19:11 i will continue to keep playing until
0:19:13 she has uh
0:19:14 had a filler yes
0:19:17 i admit
0:19:18 i did not expect you to be so expressive
0:19:22 these are
0:19:23 trying times and i find
0:19:25 my
0:19:27 need to
0:19:28 put myself out there is greater than it
0:19:30 has ever been
0:19:32 she loosens up a little and kind of like
0:19:34 relaxes while you play does not seem to
0:19:37 give the impression that
0:19:38 uh she's ready to take back over i will
0:19:41 continue to keep playing at a leisure at
0:19:42 this point we toried or can tell a great
0:19:45 deal about
0:19:47 someone's sincerity
0:19:49 their
0:19:51 determination
0:19:53 honor
0:19:54 by the way they play
0:19:57 so continue and tell me why you're here
0:20:00 the domain needs everyone together
0:20:03 and
0:20:04 much strife will be happening in the
0:20:05 near future
0:20:06 and i
0:20:07 made my apologies to you before but
0:20:10 i want to
0:20:12 i want just to be
0:20:14 friends i need you to continue to be
0:20:17 on my side
0:20:18 as we move through
0:20:20 and forward into
0:20:22 this next part into this next
0:20:26 maelstrom
0:20:28 your side
0:20:29 i have a very long history of being on
0:20:32 my side
0:20:33 and i tend to find
0:20:35 i tend to find it to be a comfortable
0:20:37 position
0:20:39 what is your side miles
0:20:42 well
0:20:43 maybe i should explain
0:20:45 the oncoming storm
0:20:47 i concur
0:20:48 as we informed you before of this about
0:20:50 attacks along the east coast
0:20:52 yes
0:20:53 well
0:20:54 there are
0:20:55 princes without domains any longer
0:20:59 what does this mean for new haven
0:21:01 we may play host in the near future
0:21:04 oh
0:21:05 well that sounds delightful
0:21:07 exceptionally as long as
0:21:09 no haven has a
0:21:10 cohesive and strong
0:21:13 front
0:21:14 then it'll be nothing but
0:21:16 hosts and guests
0:21:18 how long is it that these guests intend
0:21:20 to stay miles
0:21:23 i don't have a time frame
0:21:25 the
0:21:27 severity of the situation
0:21:29 starts to express itself along her
0:21:33 sharp
0:21:35 features
0:21:36 and
0:21:37 she looks to you and says ah
0:21:40 and should
0:21:42 an opportunity to stay present itself
0:21:45 you believe that these
0:21:47 princes who are unlikely to ever return
0:21:49 to their domains again
0:21:52 might seize
0:21:53 such an opportunity
0:21:55 i believe they're in the habit of such
0:21:56 things
0:21:57 i see
0:21:58 then what are we to do miles
0:22:01 we are to make sure that
0:22:03 we're
0:22:04 unbreachable
0:22:06 or the objective but i'm asking about
0:22:08 action
0:22:10 what do we do
0:22:12 we make sure that from the top to the
0:22:14 bottom our leadership is unshakable
0:22:18 i see there are a handful of paths to
0:22:19 getting this done but you're approaching
0:22:21 me and not
0:22:22 his grace
0:22:24 i don't think his grace will ever
0:22:27 recover
0:22:30 i'm sure you're aware of his situation
0:22:32 i've gathered all of the torii door here
0:22:34 to keep a watchful eye on them
0:22:36 safe under my umbrella
0:22:38 but i could not bring bretta here
0:22:41 because she threatens the flock
0:22:44 let's compromise do you understand this
0:22:46 extremely
0:22:48 i am
0:22:50 enraged
0:22:52 that any member of your clan
0:22:55 prince or not would have the audacity so
0:22:58 if you are attempting to imply
0:23:01 that honor
0:23:02 and
0:23:04 forthright politics
0:23:06 and
0:23:08 worth
0:23:09 is to be restored to the domain
0:23:12 i am intrigued
0:23:14 i do believe that these mistakes
0:23:17 will need to be rectified
0:23:19 your right to believe such
0:23:22 so it is here that i bring you
0:23:24 this news
0:23:26 and i have learned
0:23:28 some lessons from the last few times
0:23:31 our eyes shift to
0:23:33 your
0:23:35 nimble fingers playing on the keys
0:23:38 so you have
0:23:39 and i will help you
0:23:41 miles
0:23:42 nods his head and he relaxes a little
0:23:45 it's good to know you're one of
0:23:47 the few that i
0:23:49 trust
0:23:50 and these
0:23:52 and ones that i've come to rely on
0:23:55 careful about trust
0:23:57 but you can count on me
0:23:59 very good
0:24:00 when it seems like the conversation is
0:24:02 finished and you're ready to kind of
0:24:04 like get up
0:24:06 she kind of like stops you
0:24:08 and
0:24:09 you find yourself
0:24:12 spending the rest of the salon
0:24:15 playing for the torridor
0:24:17 that's actually kind of nice in the way
0:24:21 it is it's actually specifically
0:24:24 very very nice
0:24:29 [Music]
0:24:33 well miles is off making phone calls and
0:24:36 uh
0:24:37 heading off to some meeting
0:24:39 the two of you win
0:24:40 breto are alone with your opportunity
0:24:44 what do you plan to do my thought is to
0:24:47 just wait for
0:24:49 their to see if the ghosts come back of
0:24:51 their own volition
0:24:53 we can give that some time
0:24:55 not a lot but
0:24:57 what do you plan to do in the meantime
0:24:59 so you talked to nix right yeah
0:25:02 um
0:25:04 she told me
0:25:05 some
0:25:06 words about what i am
0:25:08 i
0:25:09 she said i was a chatterling
0:25:12 that i had been a ghoul
0:25:15 i i don't know for how long i am
0:25:18 that that has something to do with
0:25:20 the crescent on my palm and that
0:25:22 being part of
0:25:24 the tomahera
0:25:26 okay are you thinking romeo can give you
0:25:28 more i mean i guess
0:25:30 what do you want to hear from romeo
0:25:33 i mean
0:25:34 on one level i feel like i want to
0:25:38 know what those words mean and go even
0:25:42 further in but that came with a big
0:25:44 warning
0:25:46 that the more i know the less i might be
0:25:48 able to choose who i am
0:25:50 i want to talk to romeo about it i want
0:25:52 to know more
0:25:54 i just
0:25:55 do you
0:25:56 want to hear from romeo
0:25:58 who you are or what you are
0:26:02 oh
0:26:02 i'm just asking because sometimes
0:26:05 they may cut out i don't know if he's
0:26:06 going to be able to talk to you directly
0:26:08 and i want to know what i can give you
0:26:11 well i'm okay when if it's just me
0:26:13 talking through you i don't
0:26:15 whatever he has to say to you about me
0:26:19 that's just
0:26:21 i mean it's a bit scary that you'll know
0:26:23 it before i do but i trust you
0:26:25 i appreciate that
0:26:27 who i am now
0:26:29 that's something i choose
0:26:31 but
0:26:32 i can't stop it when i just i want to
0:26:34 know
0:26:35 what got me here
0:26:37 and i feel like knowing that
0:26:39 has
0:26:40 just made me decide more and more to be
0:26:42 who i am now
0:26:44 okay
0:26:45 maybe if he disagrees let me know but
0:26:48 him knowing that i spoke to nix and know
0:26:50 those words maybe that'll give us some
0:26:53 more information he said he wanted to
0:26:55 talk to me right
0:26:56 yeah
0:26:57 so maybe he already has an idea
0:26:59 okay
0:27:00 we can give it some more time and see if
0:27:02 they come back
0:27:04 but if you want i can also call them
0:27:07 here does that hurt them
0:27:10 hurt no manipulate yes
0:27:13 do they not have a choice it's
0:27:16 it's like what you can do to veto
0:27:18 i'd like to wait for a while but if this
0:27:20 is the moment when we have the time
0:27:23 do you think that they would
0:27:25 mind
0:27:26 i'm a
0:27:28 fairly friendly medium i know joey
0:27:30 wouldn't mind if they're together then
0:27:32 i kind of look around is joey here or is
0:27:35 he off somewhere
0:27:37 uh jerry's off somewhere okay
0:27:39 all right if this is the moment we have
0:27:42 we might want to call them
0:27:44 okay i trust you you know what you're
0:27:46 talking about here i've never done it
0:27:48 before but i can try is there something
0:27:50 i can do to help
0:27:52 i think just you being here will be
0:27:53 incentive
0:27:54 all right i am going to use uh sepulcher
0:27:57 path i believe it's three
0:27:59 so as when and uh brita are talking she
0:28:03 will kind of lead brita with the
0:28:05 conversation up to the piano
0:28:07 where romeo and joey were playing
0:28:10 and she will
0:28:11 call out romeo
0:28:13 brita's ready to talk to you
0:28:16 go ahead and give me a roll
0:28:20 three successes with three successes uh
0:28:23 is not a particularly long wait until
0:28:27 you sense
0:28:30 romeo's arrival and
0:28:33 kind of like
0:28:34 looking down in the hallway
0:28:36 like this unilluminated corridor
0:28:39 you can kind of see like
0:28:41 the figure of romeo kind of moving in
0:28:43 the dark and heading towards you
0:28:45 thanks for coming
0:28:47 thank you
0:28:48 was joey with you
0:28:50 yeah he's okay
0:28:51 okay i'm just kind of figuring things
0:28:54 out yeah he's
0:28:56 he's still a little boy though britta uh
0:28:59 not being able to see
0:29:00 romeo uh by hearing the greeting
0:29:03 sits uh with her back to the piano at
0:29:06 the piano see kind of trying to look
0:29:08 towards the direction that wynn is
0:29:09 speaking to
0:29:11 before realizing you know that won't
0:29:13 work
0:29:14 but she does offer a smile kind of out
0:29:17 towards that general direction she knows
0:29:19 i'm here she knows i was calling for you
0:29:21 thank you not a problem um
0:29:24 are you able to manifest
0:29:26 it can be difficult but i can if it's a
0:29:29 problem i can interpret
0:29:30 it depends on how many people you want
0:29:32 in this conversation
0:29:34 um it's probably the best choice though
0:29:36 okay not a problem
0:29:39 where is romeo in the room uh she's in
0:29:42 the hallway like right at the drawer
0:29:44 will kind of look to brita and find her
0:29:46 eyes and then kind of gesture with her
0:29:48 head where romeo is so she can kind of
0:29:51 direct her questions toward him
0:29:54 breto looks
0:29:56 and uh
0:29:57 says
0:29:59 hi
0:30:00 um
0:30:02 i heard that you wanted to talk to me
0:30:04 and
0:30:05 i wanted to talk to you too i am i ended
0:30:08 up talking to premijin nix and
0:30:11 i thought i got some answers but i felt
0:30:13 like i got more questions
0:30:16 i did
0:30:17 i was hoping to warn you
0:30:19 about who you are and what's going to
0:30:22 happen if your sire finds you
0:30:25 he was hoping to warn you
0:30:27 about
0:30:28 what will happen if your sire finds you
0:30:32 who is
0:30:33 my sire
0:30:34 i don't want to
0:30:36 i don't want to wake up anything dormant
0:30:39 so i have to approach this carefully
0:30:42 and i hope you understand
0:30:44 he hopes you understand but he doesn't
0:30:46 want to awaken anything
0:30:48 so he's proceeding carefully
0:30:51 what does just naming
0:30:54 who that is wake something
0:30:57 he works for the system
0:31:00 and
0:31:00 it's their responsibility to oversee
0:31:03 the
0:31:04 the functionality and
0:31:07 health and
0:31:09 use
0:31:10 of what you were
0:31:13 a channeling
0:31:15 and usually
0:31:17 they bury commands
0:31:20 modes
0:31:22 into the subconscious of the person that
0:31:24 it is that they're keeping an eye on
0:31:26 so that if something goes wrong they can
0:31:28 still carry out what they were meant to
0:31:30 do
0:31:30 so in this conversation we have to make
0:31:33 sure
0:31:34 that we don't do that
0:31:36 sometimes the people
0:31:39 like your sire
0:31:41 bury commands
0:31:43 in chatterlings
0:31:44 so that they can be
0:31:47 conditioned
0:31:48 to complete certain tasks
0:31:51 even if they're against it the same way
0:31:53 that i shot the santosa
0:31:55 he doesn't seem to know exactly what
0:31:57 she's talking
0:31:58 about can you explain that for him
0:32:02 he doesn't know about that um we were
0:32:04 trying to take um
0:32:07 smitsy revenant in alive
0:32:10 and i shot him in the back of the head
0:32:12 right after everything happened
0:32:15 that sounds alright
0:32:17 that sounds about right you're here to
0:32:19 help with the shadow crusade
0:32:21 you're here to help with the shadow
0:32:22 crusade
0:32:24 he like hesitates when he says that
0:32:27 once
0:32:29 he's certain that brother hasn't stood
0:32:30 off in space or started killing anyone
0:32:33 uh he continues on so
0:32:35 there's a lot of stories about the
0:32:38 origins
0:32:39 of
0:32:40 the various clans
0:32:42 there are a lot of stories about the
0:32:44 origins of the clans
0:32:46 the zumitzi has allah that's buried
0:32:51 and
0:32:54 and there was once
0:32:55 a group that studied death and the
0:32:58 mysteries of the cosmos
0:33:00 does amitsi
0:33:02 have a lot of buried secrets
0:33:05 there was once a group that studied the
0:33:06 mysteries of the cosmos is that right
0:33:08 romeo
0:33:09 yeah it's pretty good the tomahera the
0:33:12 same group that has something to do with
0:33:14 the
0:33:15 red star
0:33:16 yes
0:33:17 yes
0:33:19 in its early years
0:33:21 there were zemetzi members but back then
0:33:25 [Music]
0:33:26 none of the zumitzi had the discipline
0:33:28 visited
0:33:30 it didn't exist yet back in the day
0:33:32 there used to be zamitsi members of the
0:33:35 telma hey raw
0:33:38 but none of them had
0:33:40 vicissitude it wasn't a thing
0:33:42 maybe that infection hadn't spread yet
0:33:44 or
0:33:45 exactly
0:33:47 there came a night
0:33:49 when
0:33:50 the clan started to change
0:33:53 and it all started from uh
0:33:55 like a patient zero the plan started to
0:33:58 change and it all started from a patient
0:34:00 zero sorry go ahead a third journey to
0:34:03 this place
0:34:05 uh not not physical but a realm of
0:34:08 spirit and their deep
0:34:10 one of its denizens
0:34:12 was able to warp
0:34:15 reality as we know it and
0:34:18 it changed that jimmy see
0:34:21 when that zamesa came back
0:34:24 um a lot of people died and
0:34:27 this
0:34:29 discipline that is more a disease
0:34:32 started to spread like wildfire through
0:34:34 the clan
0:34:35 most don't even remember
0:34:37 that
0:34:38 the discipline vicissitude is alien to
0:34:40 them
0:34:41 sorry
0:34:43 that's that's a long bit fill in the
0:34:45 blanks if you can um
0:34:46 there was a member of the zamitsy clan
0:34:49 who journeyed to
0:34:51 a realm shall we call it of spirits
0:34:54 and
0:34:55 made a connection with an entity that
0:34:57 could warp reality and warped this
0:34:59 zumitzi yeah it was attacked the zamitsu
0:35:02 was attacked yes
0:35:04 it means he was attacked by the entity
0:35:06 and was infected
0:35:08 and when he came back he
0:35:10 he i don't know anymore
0:35:12 when it came back
0:35:14 a lot of people died
0:35:16 a fully transmissible disease from
0:35:18 another spirit realm but less of
0:35:23 a disease that could affect reality but
0:35:25 was not based in reality
0:35:28 so now it exists
0:35:29 within the flesh
0:35:31 the shadow crusade is dedicated to
0:35:34 eradicating and finding the source and
0:35:36 stopping it now but
0:35:38 as you can see
0:35:40 it's gone so far out of control
0:35:42 our job was to monitor and work on a
0:35:46 dealing with what is underneath new york
0:35:48 the shadow crusade's
0:35:51 mission
0:35:52 was to eradicate this disease and a
0:35:54 great deal of their effort was supposed
0:35:56 to be
0:35:57 expunging it from under new york
0:36:00 to new york
0:36:01 when kind of gives romeo look like new
0:36:03 york
0:36:04 new york why new york what what's under
0:36:07 new york
0:36:08 what the zentos ahead
0:36:10 it's not in the house
0:36:12 he gets this grim look
0:36:14 what is under the house
0:36:16 is a shard
0:36:18 of that
0:36:19 a piece
0:36:21 a seed from a much greater tree what's
0:36:24 under the house is a seed from a much
0:36:26 greater tree and we had some way to deal
0:36:29 with so much more than just that house
0:36:32 oh
0:36:34 yes and no
0:36:35 yes and no no we have knowledge but we
0:36:38 don't have a great deal of ability to
0:36:40 share what we know
0:36:42 and we don't completely
0:36:45 understand what is underneath new york
0:36:48 we lack the ability to easily share
0:36:50 knowledge i'm sorry romeo repeat the
0:36:52 last part
0:36:53 we would like the ability to share
0:36:55 knowledge
0:36:56 and
0:36:58 anyway all right about this
0:37:00 what's under new york
0:37:02 is
0:37:04 bad on a level that's difficult to
0:37:05 comprehend
0:37:07 what's under new york is bad on a level
0:37:08 that's difficult to comprehend
0:37:11 it is
0:37:12 ancient
0:37:13 vampiric
0:37:15 but not at all human it is ancient
0:37:18 vampiric and not at all human i mean if
0:37:21 the shadow crusade is there to
0:37:24 wipe out this disease and to remove
0:37:27 something extraordinarily unfathomably
0:37:30 dangerous from
0:37:31 beneath new york isn't that
0:37:34 worth trying
0:37:36 or
0:37:38 how do you fight a storm
0:37:40 how do you fight a storm
0:37:41 we try
0:37:43 you know there are
0:37:44 [Music]
0:37:45 there are incidents
0:37:48 uh i think what happened to joey might
0:37:50 have been one
0:37:52 but
0:37:52 we're not
0:37:54 and on that front you know we do our
0:37:56 best
0:37:57 guys like
0:37:58 lizantosa we take them out when we can
0:38:01 because they're loyal to it men like the
0:38:04 zantosa we take out when we can because
0:38:06 they are loyal to it there are incidents
0:38:09 but the zantosa are
0:38:12 accepted by the sabbat
0:38:14 and
0:38:15 the sabbath has no idea
0:38:18 no idea what's out there
0:38:20 the sabot has no idea what's out there
0:38:22 they're the only place i've seen she
0:38:25 holds up her hand the crescent
0:38:28 that's more complicated
0:38:30 that's more complicated but believe me
0:38:33 this about no group of people
0:38:36 is at a point right now where they can
0:38:38 do
0:38:39 they can answer
0:38:40 for what's under new york and it's just
0:38:42 growing
0:38:43 it's eating
0:38:45 it spreads its its fungal spores and
0:38:50 its
0:38:51 mind
0:38:52 warping
0:38:53 presence
0:38:54 i don't
0:38:55 [ __ ]
0:38:56 it's just a matter of time unless
0:38:58 something is figured out what sorry
0:39:01 britta um
0:39:02 the thing under new york
0:39:04 continues to grow and warp and spread
0:39:08 its
0:39:09 fungal spores
0:39:11 same way like your house like
0:39:13 the things growing outside my house
0:39:16 and there's
0:39:17 not really a great way to counter it and
0:39:20 the savater clueless about this romeo
0:39:23 as far as the sabbat no
0:39:25 they killed it centuries ago the sabbat
0:39:28 think it's
0:39:29 dead centuries ago
0:39:31 there's no chance that an errant
0:39:34 revenant of the zantosa family would run
0:39:36 to the sabbat i might
0:39:39 zantos have close ties to the sabbats
0:39:41 but i don't know
0:39:42 what the zantos would do
0:39:44 as far as the sabbat know
0:39:46 they are the they are the sacked the
0:39:49 group
0:39:50 that successfully slew two of their own
0:39:53 ancients vampires so old that they had
0:39:56 thrived
0:39:58 before even the great flood
0:40:00 the sabah thinks they killed two of them
0:40:03 and one of them
0:40:05 one of those
0:40:07 those vampires
0:40:09 is under new york
0:40:11 smuggled here by the zantosa the thing
0:40:14 under new york is an
0:40:16 ancient
0:40:17 and truly ancient
0:40:20 vampire
0:40:21 that the zantosa smuggled here the
0:40:24 zantosa have ties with the sabbat but
0:40:26 the sabbat doesn't know what the zantos
0:40:28 would do
0:40:29 with everything moving
0:40:32 here with the zantosa smuggling it to
0:40:35 new york and
0:40:36 with the sabbat moving to try to take
0:40:38 over the coasts and all does that mean
0:40:41 that what we were the tamahera the black
0:40:44 hand are we
0:40:46 are they
0:40:47 moving to
0:40:48 i don't know i fell out of contact and
0:40:52 i've
0:40:54 spent a while now
0:40:56 living the unlife of a toreador and now
0:41:02 this
0:41:03 he doesn't know
0:41:05 he fell out of contact and he's been
0:41:07 living
0:41:09 as a toreador
0:41:10 and um i'm sorry i know that it's a lot
0:41:13 of questions for a lot of unanswerable
0:41:15 problems and
0:41:16 it's a lot to just put on someone who's
0:41:19 stuck here
0:41:21 i am
0:41:22 do you think that my sire is
0:41:25 looking for me
0:41:27 or the group
0:41:29 or
0:41:29 do you know how i died or am i going to
0:41:32 be able to continue
0:41:35 being a toreador
0:41:36 here
0:41:38 i think that's up to you i haven't seen
0:41:40 our sire in a while
0:41:41 that's up to you i haven't seen our sire
0:41:44 in a while
0:41:46 we were
0:41:47 goals together
0:41:48 i remember the
0:41:50 visions the black and white
0:41:52 and all i just
0:41:54 we knew each other
0:41:56 we knew each other
0:41:57 i'm sorry i don't remember
0:41:59 his face kind of like twists
0:42:03 with like
0:42:04 pain and regret and almost has this like
0:42:08 very subtle shift in his appearance and
0:42:11 it's around then that joey arrives
0:42:13 and kind of like with his itty-bitty
0:42:17 little hand reaches up and
0:42:20 touches romeo's elbow to kind of console
0:42:22 him just a bit and seeing you joey
0:42:25 waves his hand and smiles hey bubbus i
0:42:28 wish i could remember i you've helped me
0:42:31 uh
0:42:32 what sorry joey just got here i'm saying
0:42:34 hi to him oh um hi hi joey i'm sorry i
0:42:39 what you showed me helped me find out a
0:42:41 lot about who i was um romeo and i'm i'm
0:42:44 sorry i'm sorry i can't remember
0:42:47 wynn kind of
0:42:48 seems to waffle with the idea of
0:42:50 mimicking romeo's body language but
0:42:52 isn't quite sure
0:42:54 how disrespectful that might be so she
0:42:56 just turns to romeo
0:42:58 do you want me to try and show her your
0:43:00 body language
0:43:02 no
0:43:03 no no no no no okay
0:43:06 your choice i'm just the interpreter
0:43:08 bretta gives wynn uh odd luck uh she if
0:43:12 there's an okay following that she can
0:43:14 follow the answer tell her
0:43:16 that
0:43:18 tell her that santos probably know about
0:43:21 her
0:43:22 and then
0:43:23 and they're probably watching her um i
0:43:26 need a lore wraith role okay
0:43:30 [ __ ] shadows
0:43:35 four successes okay uh with four
0:43:37 successes what's your question did his
0:43:40 darker side just take over
0:43:42 you probably is is that a thing that
0:43:45 they can be talked
0:43:47 into coming back from it's unclear
0:43:49 sometimes it takes time sometimes
0:43:52 there are certain uh abilities that
0:43:54 wraiths can exert to do it uh there's
0:43:57 actually a ritual that necromancers come
0:44:00 in that can do it romeo this has been a
0:44:02 really hard conversation and you're
0:44:04 doing a great job just stay with us okay
0:44:06 i'm here i know is there something i can
0:44:09 do i'm sorry if i'm asking too many
0:44:11 questions i don't mean to hurt him tell
0:44:14 her that she's hurt me quite enough and
0:44:16 as she remembered
0:44:17 we probably wouldn't have needed to even
0:44:19 be at the elysium that night you've hurt
0:44:21 him quite enough and if you remembered
0:44:24 we probably wouldn't have to be at the
0:44:25 elysium that night and she gives britain
0:44:27 a look like i'm sorry i didn't want it i
0:44:29 probably wouldn't even be [ __ ] dead
0:44:31 i get it bretta automatically blinks in
0:44:34 the way of someone who as a mortal would
0:44:36 have blinked back tears and
0:44:38 looks down uh keeping her hands wrapped
0:44:41 close to herself you need to get it the
0:44:43 [ __ ] together or i'm not having these
0:44:44 conversations anymore i'm not the person
0:44:46 that got anyone killed neither is she
0:44:48 and warner
0:44:50 warner that if any archons see her hand
0:44:52 they'll cut her [ __ ] pieces bruta if
0:44:54 any archons see your hand they'll cut
0:44:56 you to pieces okay but this about are
0:44:59 probably fine they'll welcome her with
0:45:01 open arms all right you're done i'm not
0:45:02 interpreting anymore get it the [ __ ]
0:45:04 together tell her what i said she'll
0:45:06 need it she'll need to know that this
0:45:07 about the only safe place for her it's
0:45:09 not we made it to keep us safe what's
0:45:12 not
0:45:13 brita is safe with us tell it to marcos
0:45:16 none of your friends are safe is marcos
0:45:18 with you when what's he saying he went
0:45:20 to hell
0:45:21 he went to hell and there's no helping
0:45:23 him
0:45:24 and eventually i'll go to hell
0:45:27 and then joey will go to hell won't you
0:45:29 joey and joey like looks wide-eyed and
0:45:31 terrified at you um i'm gonna do a
0:45:33 necromancy thing okay i am also spending
0:45:36 a willpower on this
0:45:37 wynn kind of holds her hand out for joey
0:45:40 and pulls him close to her side he
0:45:43 definitely obliges yep
0:45:45 and she takes a real strong stance and
0:45:47 narrows her eyes at this
0:45:50 this dark side
0:45:52 of romeo says when you are like this you
0:45:55 will not come here you will stay away
0:45:57 from joey and you will stay away from
0:45:59 brita and she's going to attempt to
0:46:00 compel seoul okay
0:46:03 five successes
0:46:05 oh okay
0:46:06 when it's okay i don't
0:46:09 if he's no it's not
0:46:11 it's all our fault
0:46:12 and he is forced to obey and fades away
0:46:18 brita that wasn't
0:46:20 that wasn't the romeo you know at the
0:46:22 end
0:46:23 i
0:46:24 i have a thick skin when dealing with
0:46:26 them i kind of ascribed to the q-tip
0:46:29 mentality quit taking it personally but
0:46:31 the first few times when you hear that
0:46:33 from someone you thought you knew and
0:46:34 cared about it's very hard it feels like
0:46:37 maybe i didn't know him but if i got him
0:46:40 killed if i got other people killed
0:46:42 listen to me what was talking to you at
0:46:44 the end was something called a shadow
0:46:47 and she kind of looks to joey too and
0:46:50 keeps him close the shadow
0:46:53 it's the dark thoughts that we have
0:46:54 about ourselves
0:46:56 it's
0:46:57 all the self-doubt and the self-hatred
0:47:00 and
0:47:00 and it manifests in a way that
0:47:03 tries to
0:47:04 undo everything that the true self wants
0:47:08 he was trying to drive you away because
0:47:10 who he is normally cares about you a lot
0:47:13 but i did that to him i made him have
0:47:17 that shadow no no it's
0:47:19 unfortunately it's
0:47:22 it's not an exact parallel to the the
0:47:25 creature we have inside us
0:47:27 but
0:47:28 but it's
0:47:29 near enough for approximation
0:47:31 will he be able to come back as
0:47:33 you when that command when he's not as
0:47:36 his shadow self but i just come and i
0:47:39 only told him to stay away from you
0:47:42 and joey when he's like that he can find
0:47:43 me anytime i didn't cut him out brita
0:47:46 sucks a bit just kind of pulling her
0:47:48 knees closer to herself on top of the
0:47:51 chair to the bench rather for the piano
0:47:55 and she wraps her arms around her knees
0:47:57 and looks at when and looks towards the
0:47:59 corridor where he had been standing he's
0:48:01 not there anymore he wanted to talk to
0:48:03 me and i'm sorry i rita you did fine you
0:48:07 didn't do anything wrong don't make him
0:48:08 let you feel that way is joey okay
0:48:12 joey's learning a lot today and some
0:48:13 lessons are hard and she kind of
0:48:16 instinctively pulls joey closer
0:48:18 [Music]
0:48:23 i think johnny has actually gone ahead
0:48:26 and picked up a black chevy suburban for
0:48:29 uh miles because he knows that we're
0:48:31 going to need a vehicle to conduct some
0:48:34 business in the following nights he
0:48:35 tries to make sure that it's
0:48:37 acceptable for miles to ride around in
0:48:39 tim is making a face
0:48:43 having uh disappointed him multiple
0:48:45 times with johnny's choice of vehicle is
0:48:47 it matte black you know uh just primer
0:48:50 black
0:48:51 the uh
0:48:52 the nuances of the kind of black are
0:48:54 probably have avoid avoided johnny but
0:48:57 i'm sure miles will have a
0:48:59 explanation of you chose that black
0:49:01 we'll see it's not matte black it's that
0:49:04 black oh in addition to the other into
0:49:06 the vehicle he's also picked up a few
0:49:08 other uh things that we commonly need
0:49:11 during our more active
0:49:14 situations that we get involved in some
0:49:17 ammunition weapons and body armor that
0:49:20 he requested
0:49:22 takes a look at it all kind of zips it
0:49:23 up in the bags and shuts the uh the
0:49:26 trunk and then comes walking around to
0:49:28 the driver's side jumps in and takes a
0:49:30 look at neil who's sitting in the
0:49:32 passenger side when neil first got in
0:49:34 the car he definitely started moving
0:49:36 into the back before realizing it was
0:49:38 just him and johnny so has buckled
0:49:39 himself into the front seat otherwise
0:49:42 it's just kind of like staring off into
0:49:44 the middle distance like is he's just
0:49:46 thinking about too many things right now
0:49:48 he looks nervous and kind of upset um
0:49:52 you uh is everything packed up you sure
0:49:54 you didn't want to help like put stuff
0:49:56 on the back
0:49:57 no we're all good
0:49:58 so you said you were taking care of this
0:50:01 business you had out in wallingford
0:50:03 so like i sort of said when in the car
0:50:05 boston right like i don't technically
0:50:07 need a bull but the level of
0:50:09 enlightenment will help me find this um
0:50:11 this is a ritual right and and it'll
0:50:14 help to uh cynthia was that her name
0:50:16 that have it abbess i i don't know what
0:50:19 the habit okay and yeah
0:50:21 um
0:50:22 yeah so when approaching the veil it's
0:50:25 it's a whole thing i'm gonna have to get
0:50:26 into it um but that's where the bulls
0:50:28 are they don't have a whole lot of you
0:50:30 notice that johnny is
0:50:32 half of paying attention to you but is
0:50:34 really focused on uh a revolver that
0:50:38 he's checking and undoes the cylinder to
0:50:41 kind of inspect the six silver bullets
0:50:44 in that cylinder isn't that gun from
0:50:46 arabella yeah
0:50:49 he closes it puts it back in the holster
0:50:52 and sits it down in the middle between
0:50:53 the two seats
0:50:55 anything on your mind there johnny
0:50:56 there's a lot of woods out towards
0:50:58 wallingford oh and uh but you can get us
0:51:01 they're safe right you did before
0:51:03 i mean win
0:51:06 he uh takes a moment
0:51:08 you can see he kind of licks his fangs
0:51:11 yeah yeah i can get us there safe
0:51:14 trying to be honest is this like a bad
0:51:16 idea because i think this gives our best
0:51:17 shot of fighting this woman uh but
0:51:19 nothing we choose to do in these nights
0:51:21 is a good idea
0:51:22 well he pops some morally out of his
0:51:24 pack
0:51:24 in his mouth if i'm gonna be completely
0:51:26 zoned out of it and projecting my
0:51:28 consciousness into another plane of
0:51:29 existence for you know like eight hours
0:51:33 you gonna be okay he finally turns and
0:51:35 gives you a hard look
0:51:37 nods his head
0:51:38 yeah okay i'm gonna be all right i don't
0:51:41 want the ritual to be interrupted but if
0:51:42 [ __ ] goes real bad like you just grab me
0:51:44 out of the tub and run it's
0:51:46 or just leave me if you have to let's
0:51:48 hope it doesn't come to that i can ask
0:51:50 you a favor of course um
0:51:52 i need uh
0:51:54 i need to get a couple of things i got a
0:51:56 tupperware and like a knife and a bowl
0:51:58 and i i need uh from my haven and i've
0:52:00 been
0:52:01 it's been a while i've been avoiding
0:52:03 going back
0:52:04 i'm
0:52:05 you'd be all right if we stop there on
0:52:06 the way i need to get these things uh
0:52:09 you know face your demons right and i
0:52:11 i'm not gonna pretend i'm
0:52:13 nervous i i don't know how to explain
0:52:15 how much
0:52:17 i know everybody looks at me like i'm
0:52:19 crazy whenever i talk about how much
0:52:22 everything means to me but i i just but
0:52:24 you gotta face it sometimes right
0:52:26 yeah
0:52:27 you do
0:52:31 if i um
0:52:32 if i freak out
0:52:34 just
0:52:35 i don't know you've been present for
0:52:37 plenty of my freak outs i think i owe
0:52:39 you
0:52:40 the courtesy of having your back during
0:52:42 a couple of years i'm gonna try and keep
0:52:44 my [ __ ] together i just yeah if you
0:52:46 can't i understand
0:52:49 don't let me
0:52:51 and neil has this like weird look on his
0:52:52 face he's got sort of a moment of
0:52:54 self-awareness
0:52:56 cracking through i'm not gonna want to
0:52:58 leave once we get in there even if i
0:53:00 don't miss my [ __ ] but we're kind of on
0:53:01 a timetable is there anything i can do
0:53:03 to help you uh
0:53:04 remain focused um
0:53:08 i won't take it personal if you gotta
0:53:10 get physical because we got stuff we
0:53:13 have to do
0:53:14 and i could spend the next six weeks in
0:53:16 there
0:53:16 all right you uh
0:53:19 you're always mumbling on about this
0:53:20 ladder
0:53:21 there's a whole lot of trials with that
0:53:23 too isn't there yeah just consider this
0:53:26 another trial this is getting you to a
0:53:28 better place it's funny last time
0:53:31 last time it showed me rhys
0:53:33 finding me
0:53:35 um
0:53:36 and then it showed me nara finding me
0:53:38 and both of those things have happened
0:53:40 so
0:53:41 i'm not really looking forward to this
0:53:42 one uh just going around the the pain
0:53:45 and the fear is one thing but the
0:53:47 temptation that's the other one it'll be
0:53:49 fine uh here's our exit
0:53:51 johnny uh who's been kind of just
0:53:53 driving around slowly through town
0:53:56 during the conversation pulls over and
0:53:58 uh heads over off onto the road where
0:54:01 neil's haven is you guys pull up to
0:54:03 neil's haven and
0:54:06 even now there is police tape windows
0:54:09 are smashed
0:54:10 uh even at a quick glance it looks very
0:54:13 very bad neil can't quite bring himself
0:54:15 to
0:54:17 look but johnny knows neil well enough
0:54:18 to know how good his senses are he's
0:54:21 definitely very aware in his periphery
0:54:24 of just that cursory level of damage
0:54:27 and they haven't even gone in yet and he
0:54:28 gets
0:54:29 extremely still
0:54:31 like only a dead thing can
0:54:34 has not yet freaked out but is just
0:54:36 sitting perfectly still not quite able
0:54:39 to get out of the car neil you a pawn
0:54:41 shop owner or are you an astonished
0:54:43 sorcerer
0:54:44 you can be both things how about right
0:54:46 now i'm okay then johnny the duron key
0:54:49 sorcerer which are you you can be both
0:54:52 right now
0:54:54 i need my i need
0:54:56 there are things under my bed that i
0:54:58 need and look me in the eye and tell me
0:55:00 that you're gonna go inside and get
0:55:01 those things and nothing's gonna stop
0:55:03 you
0:55:04 i'm gonna go get him
0:55:05 but he does not look johnny in the eye
0:55:07 when he says it
0:55:08 johnny uh reaches out and grabs him by
0:55:10 the scruff of the shirt and pulls him
0:55:12 close in the eye
0:55:14 i'm gonna go get him
0:55:16 and he doesn't really have much choice
0:55:18 but to look at nighty in the eye those
0:55:20 who wants to get like real childish
0:55:21 about it and he doesn't johnny blows
0:55:23 smoke out of his nostrils nods
0:55:26 okay what's um and neil gets out of the
0:55:29 car and starts just unstealthily walking
0:55:32 up towards his haven you hear the sounds
0:55:34 of glass
0:55:36 kind of crunching under your shoes as
0:55:38 you make your way in despite the police
0:55:40 tape it looks like
0:55:42 people must have pilfered through this
0:55:45 kind of stealing all sorts of
0:55:47 doodads and collectors items and a lot
0:55:51 of what was here has been cleaned out i
0:55:54 need a frenzy check okay relatively this
0:55:57 is self-control
0:55:59 self-control
0:56:03 diff 8
0:56:04 no successes i actually have really good
0:56:06 self-control but nope okay i neil flies
0:56:10 into a frenzy neil steps inside looks
0:56:13 around looks at like the destruction
0:56:17 looks at the missing things and just
0:56:20 completely loses control
0:56:23 his fangs bare
0:56:24 he hisses and then just starts
0:56:27 destroying things with the energy of
0:56:29 like someone who's panicked and looking
0:56:31 for something but with the destructive
0:56:33 energy of a frenzying vampire johnny
0:56:36 hearing this commotion
0:56:38 inside will remain out on the street and
0:56:42 keep an eye out for anybody walking
0:56:43 towards this way and try to stay out of
0:56:46 the view site from the inside and he's
0:56:49 going to let neil kind of tire himself
0:56:52 out a little bit indoors under these
0:56:54 circumstances i actually don't know when
0:56:56 i stop
0:56:57 you're essentially gonna friends until
0:56:58 you burn out
0:56:59 so just like
0:57:01 burn through all my blood or yep okay so
0:57:04 you burn through blood you smash things
0:57:07 uh you rip up the few things that remain
0:57:09 intact with fangs bared and uh panicking
0:57:13 when it's done you feel no satisfaction
0:57:16 at all wait that runs him through his
0:57:17 entire blood pool yeah he's he's gonna
0:57:20 burn blood to buff his and like try to
0:57:22 smash stuff
0:57:25 i rolled one eight but there was also a
0:57:26 one in there
0:57:29 good thing you rolled an eight
0:57:31 hearing no sign of it stopping after
0:57:34 about a minute of letting him tire
0:57:35 himself out johnny decides that he needs
0:57:37 to intervene because he can't let him
0:57:40 just
0:57:40 ruin himself at the expense of his place
0:57:44 so he'll uh make sure that no one's
0:57:46 coming and
0:57:48 step inside the uh pawn shop
0:57:51 outside the coast seems clear should we
0:57:53 able to go in neil neil uh does not heed
0:57:57 and is the process of with buffed
0:58:00 strength tearing pages out of probably
0:58:03 collector's books johnny will spend some
0:58:07 of his blood to speed across the room
0:58:09 with celerity and push him against a
0:58:11 wall so they can be face to face again
0:58:14 that's enough neil tries to break out of
0:58:16 the grapple and just continue smashing
0:58:18 and tearing things apart hey go for it
0:58:20 apparently burned enough blood to say
0:58:22 strength to six also i have a point of
0:58:24 brawl now thanks johnny
0:58:28 i'm still neal uh
0:58:30 three successes okay
0:58:34 uh eight successes to hold them in place
0:58:36 okay i think it's uh suffice to say he's
0:58:39 gonna be holding you down pretty
0:58:40 effectively yeah there's not really a
0:58:41 whole lot i can do about that i need
0:58:43 that duran key sorcerer here stop raging
0:58:46 about a pawn shop and look at me did i
0:58:48 we're gonna spend the willpower to try
0:58:49 and i haven't really frenzied so real
0:58:51 self-control
0:58:54 not a thing i usually do
0:58:57 two successes this time okay uh this
0:58:59 round you can control yourself next
0:59:01 round spend a little
0:59:06 okay then uh one more success three
0:59:08 total two to go next will power
0:59:11 in the meantime johnny's just got you in
0:59:13 a one arm bar
0:59:15 no he's just pinning his shoulders
0:59:17 against the wall and talking about his
0:59:18 claws on that one okay
0:59:23 two tenths that's the okay so for a
0:59:25 moment it looks like
0:59:26 neil may just lose himself in the moment
0:59:29 but
0:59:29 he stops he sends him his nostrils
0:59:32 flaring
0:59:34 and neil manages to calm
0:59:39 his fangs sort of retract back
0:59:41 get it out of your system
0:59:43 they took them johnny i know they
0:59:45 destroyed it to hurt me
0:59:48 but then people in the neighborhood
0:59:50 other people took my things
0:59:52 i'm part of this neighborhood johnny and
0:59:54 they took them
0:59:55 i'm gonna find him
0:59:57 and i'm gonna get him back
1:00:00 but not tonight it's not the
1:00:02 neighborhood
1:00:03 oh some of it's the neighborhood but
1:00:05 they don't know i've got keys it's all
1:00:07 vampires neal these people are
1:00:09 manipulated they took your stuff but it
1:00:12 was vampires setting them against you
1:00:15 don't forget that i'm not gonna i didn't
1:00:16 say i was gonna hurt anybody i said i
1:00:18 was gonna get my things back
1:00:20 i've been in all their houses i can do
1:00:22 it again and find my things
1:00:25 but today
1:00:26 you're right we have things we have to
1:00:29 do
1:00:30 if everything is as trash downstairs as
1:00:32 it is up here i might need your help
1:00:33 opening
1:00:36 opening the way into my
1:00:38 real haven
1:00:40 john gives a slow nod as he lets lets go
1:00:42 of you and lets you lead the way when
1:00:44 his feet touch the floor again neil kind
1:00:46 of sadly kicks like a pile of torn [ __ ]
1:00:49 and broken glass and then leads johnny
1:00:52 downstairs to
1:00:54 the newspaper hell hole that he sleeps
1:00:57 in over towards the bed which i mean
1:01:00 they were taking some of my stuff out so
1:01:02 i it may even just be open still and
1:01:04 goes down to look for like a curved
1:01:06 knife and some tupperware and a couple
1:01:09 of sort of like ritual bowls that aren't
1:01:11 inherently magic on their own but are
1:01:14 just sort of [ __ ] that he uses for this
1:01:16 kind of thing okay um
1:01:19 hey thanks for being here i wish you
1:01:21 could be a better help
1:01:22 i'm not really the one that usually
1:01:24 calms down the frenzy if you weren't
1:01:26 here
1:01:27 i probably would have been doing this
1:01:28 until sunup i got that feeling
1:01:31 and i um
1:01:33 this is kind of why i've been avoiding
1:01:34 coming back i'm gonna fix it i'm gonna
1:01:36 fix it up i'm gonna put everything in
1:01:39 its place again everything has its place
1:01:41 but you're right tonight we gotta go um
1:01:44 i gotta get focused neil looks just
1:01:46 absolutely drained and he hasn't even
1:01:48 done any magic yet but
1:01:50 all right let's we can do this let's go
1:01:52 do this
1:01:53 thank you i'm sorry
1:01:56 somebody's gonna hurt for this but it's
1:01:59 it's not tonight johnny halls open the
1:02:01 uh the door under his bed and they head
1:02:03 down into the inner sanctum
1:02:05 the some levels are even actually aren't
1:02:07 completely empty
1:02:09 uh there is still some tupperware
1:02:11 containers
1:02:13 uh there are the things that hadn't the
1:02:16 plants are dead that's gonna be a
1:02:19 problem
1:02:22 [ __ ]
1:02:25 can i pull some dried leaves to pull one
1:02:28 last thing or they just you can probably
1:02:30 pull some dried leaves so i haven't
1:02:32 basically i have enough to like hop up a
1:02:34 bowl and then we're then it's just
1:02:37 what's in the coins and i'm [ __ ] done
1:02:39 right
1:02:39 hey johnny um how many of those plants
1:02:42 did you get into nara's hands i don't
1:02:44 think i was really keeping count uh
1:02:46 a few it took me
1:02:49 two decades to cultivate this they don't
1:02:51 grow this [ __ ] outside of all the moon
1:02:55 well they wanted to handicap me and here
1:02:57 we are
1:02:58 okay okay i can make this work the tub
1:03:01 that i had been like working on for a
1:03:03 long time like my star charts and things
1:03:04 like that are those still around or were
1:03:06 they destroyed star charts are gone this
1:03:09 is they ruined my life's work
1:03:13 now tonight we have things to do tonight
1:03:16 okay
1:03:17 the neil's expended right like he's
1:03:18 emotionally spent for a minute as he
1:03:21 sort of puzzles the ramifications of
1:03:23 just the utter destruction that has laid
1:03:25 upon his
1:03:27 you know hoarding but ordered life at
1:03:29 least in his brain
1:03:31 there's that feeling like he might lose
1:03:33 his [ __ ] again but he's too tired to do
1:03:35 it and
1:03:37 so it slowly passes up like a tupperware
1:03:39 like one of those tupperware bins full
1:03:41 of just random assorted knickknacks that
1:03:43 he thinks he might need like a brazier
1:03:45 or just just
1:03:47 random crap and passes it up to johnny
1:03:49 uh hey help me out with this get this
1:03:51 into the car and then you've got it
1:03:53 johnny basically helps him move
1:03:55 everything they can out of the uh the
1:03:57 remains of the sanctum uh it's not very
1:04:00 many trips
1:04:01 with honestly not very much in the way
1:04:03 of effort you end up being able to pack
1:04:04 up uh the vast majority of what remains
1:04:06 of neil's belongings
1:04:08 with that said there are seeds that are
1:04:11 are theoretically able to restart but
1:04:13 it's going to take time yeah
1:04:16 neil just starts collecting the few
1:04:18 things that were left untouched mostly
1:04:21 because they weren't like they weren't
1:04:22 really evidence so much as just things
1:04:25 to use
1:04:26 the last thing that i look for because
1:04:28 i'm a man of my word is if there are any
1:04:31 remain like the area where neil's like
1:04:34 comics collection was kept is that issue
1:04:37 of wolverine still there uh we'll meet a
1:04:39 die
1:04:41 on a seven and up it's still there
1:04:43 nope
1:04:47 ah
1:04:48 [ __ ]
1:04:49 well at least i don't have to do it
1:04:51 myself
1:04:52 all right johnny let's get the hell out
1:04:54 of here
1:04:54 i can't be here anymore johnny solemnly
1:04:58 nods heads up to the car
1:05:00 now i wish it wasn't the end of the
1:05:01 world it's going to take me way longer
1:05:03 than that to fix everything
1:05:05 giant that
1:05:07 and we have we can use that and then
1:05:10 uh later tonight speaking of keeping
1:05:12 your [ __ ] together after
1:05:14 after i do the thing after the ritual
1:05:16 after i send the ladder um
1:05:18 i'm gonna need your help with a ritual
1:05:20 are you gonna be okay with that it's
1:05:22 gonna be um
1:05:23 hard i've seen what you've gone through
1:05:25 tonight the least i can do is make sure
1:05:27 that you have the backup you need i'm
1:05:29 gonna need you to cut me open are you
1:05:31 okay with that
1:05:32 you could see the hesitation in his face
1:05:34 but he nods i'm rock steady i got your
1:05:37 back okay let's find out some sabbat

1:06:45 [Music]
1:06:52 i'm just picturing her listening to the
1:06:54 mixtape and
1:06:55 starts with push it by salt and pepper
1:06:58 i take back everything i said
1:07:01 just kidding i love salt and pepper
1:07:04 push it real good i mean who doesn't
1:07:06 it's anthem of their ages
1:07:09 i find it very funny that elsa would use
1:07:10 miles as like a modern music like hook
1:07:13 up like
1:07:15 you can't tell any of the other toriador
1:07:17 about this now please
1:07:19 give to me that
1:07:20 new metal
1:07:22 but
1:07:23 have you miles have you heard there's
1:07:25 this band it's called corn but they
1:07:27 spell it with a k
1:07:29 so the specific thing about the insult
1:07:31 with the elsa is the very fact that he
1:07:32 became a music producer because he
1:07:34 wasn't very good at music yeah
1:07:37 that's dope and that marshall is like
1:07:39 poser suck
1:07:41 and marcos quite literally was better
1:07:44 yeah
1:07:45 not today though
1:07:46 [ __ ] eight successes baby okay i mean
1:07:48 that can be interpreted multiple ways
1:07:52 not marcos he's dead yeah that's the
1:07:54 that's the one oh you're right
1:07:56 it actually makes them better
1:07:58 that's how music goes
1:08:01 hey when i thought we were here to talk
1:08:03 to romeo why is uh what
1:08:05 marcos
1:08:07 oh hey bro come sit at the piano with us

1:08:21 good ones
1:08:22 damn
1:08:24 yeah no marcos doesn't have a ghost no
1:08:29 i don't know why that is but i don't
1:08:31 necessarily know if i want to know let
1:08:32 me tell you what your boy told you
1:08:35 do people going to like no sofia
1:08:38 specifically in the last episode was
1:08:39 like he's burning in hell like it was

1:08:47 [Laughter]
1:08:50 no i'm inhabited by something that says

1:08:56 he's not wrong
1:08:58 miles the wolves are at the door let's
1:09:00 yeah let's get folks
