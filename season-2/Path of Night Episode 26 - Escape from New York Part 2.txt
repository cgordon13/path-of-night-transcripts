0:00:07 story can include graphic violence drug
0:00:09 use sexual content and other mature
0:00:11 themes we've talked at our table about
0:00:13 safety comfort and consent both as
0:00:15 players and storytellers we know what to
0:00:17 expect we're all excited to be here and
0:00:20 we want you to feel the same so listener
0:00:22 discretion is advice
0:00:23 now let's walk the path of night
0:00:29 [Music]
0:00:36 scrawled along a wall red is the moon
0:00:38 red is the moon over and over again
0:00:41 black is the sun sorry guys we're taking
0:00:44 a detour I'm not liking this section of
0:00:46 town at all do what you got to do man I
0:00:49 guess I will based on you guys think I
0:00:53 should give him blood to get him back
0:00:54 out yeah we just lost some and we just
0:00:56 got him back I think it's worth a try uh
0:01:00 who knows what's actually causing this
0:01:02 torper but the only way I know to get
0:01:04 somebody out of torper early is by
0:01:06 feeding them blood it's
0:01:09 it's an Assamite poison it can last
0:01:11 months or years I mean is it going to
0:01:14 counteract the poison I don't know okay
0:01:16 so we're pretty much in the dark here
0:01:18 it's a supernatural poison so there's no
0:01:21 guarantee but it's got to be better than
0:01:23 trying nothing you do know what this
0:01:25 will do to him right is there anything
0:01:26 is there anything in that bag you've got
0:01:28 the bag of stuff that that he that he
0:01:30 was with
0:01:31 that Jew by air gave him yeah it's just
0:01:35 copies of
0:01:36 ancient text is
0:01:39 I'll look again so she kind of paused
0:01:41 through no weird ass in my antidote does
0:01:43 there happen to be a weird assomite
0:01:45 antidote in the bag no weird ass to my
0:01:47 incident man what was it recently with
0:01:48 us receiving old texts from people and
0:01:51 there's a lot of reasons for it man but
0:01:53 none of them we really need to get into
0:01:54 right now look I'm just gonna put it out
0:01:57 there so you all taking a vote who else
0:01:59 gave us a old text Reiss gave me some
0:02:02 sort of book to read of course like
0:02:04 homework look I think I threw it under a
0:02:07 table somewhere he would have to be
0:02:09 woken up by someone no he has to be
0:02:11 woken up by someone I think anyone here
0:02:14 can do it so it doesn't have to be miles
0:02:17 if he doesn't want to do it but I think
0:02:19 one of us should try if it's anybody if
0:02:21 if anybody's here I trust miles to do it
0:02:24 if not miles I say when you wake him up
0:02:26 I can do it I just wanted to check we
0:02:28 know what I would rather it be one of us
0:02:31 than anyone else all right play rocker
0:02:33 scissors for it wind holds up her hand
0:02:35 to Miles Kind of a Funny thought
0:02:36 vampires playing rock paper scissors
0:02:40 one two three shoot

0:02:47 that is three times if you guys are not

0:03:12 been Supernatural oh yeah okay cool
0:03:15 thanks guys well everyone comes from the
0:03:16 taste of blood not from you actually
0:03:18 ingesting a full portrait of it so he
0:03:21 tries to dribble into my mouth it
0:03:23 doesn't really go in but it's too late
0:03:25 but it's enough for you awesome we push
0:03:28 it in there
0:03:29 shoves it in use your fingers like push
0:03:32 it against my gums
0:03:33 rub his throat to try and get it to go
0:03:36 down yeah it's like A-Dog trying to
0:03:37 swallow a pillow on his nose come on no
0:03:40 I don't know if it might take some time
0:03:42 I don't know
0:03:46 [Laughter]
0:03:51 we're driving straight to New Haven no
0:03:54 well actually no I'm still trying to get
0:03:56 out of Manhattan get out of this area by
0:04:00 the way guys I um
0:04:03 I don't think I impressed upon you how
0:04:05 dangerous Manhattan is uh New York in
0:04:08 general I think it's been fairly
0:04:09 impressed upon us at this point Johnny
0:04:10 oh it's um
0:04:13 I think he means naturally New York not
0:04:15 just aside from crazy uh Middle Eastern
0:04:18 assassins from some web of whatever uh
0:04:21 there are lots of Sabbat
0:04:24 see those crowns painted on there yeah
0:04:27 that's the symbol of Clan Lasombra
0:04:28 they're kind of the uh de facto Kings of
0:04:31 the Sabbat yeah that woman really beat
0:04:34 up my Katana tune very very upset about
0:04:36 them all right well damage to our
0:04:38 possessions aside there's also plenty of
0:04:40 other things we gotta worry about the
0:04:42 sewers here are filled with all kinds of
0:04:44 horrible things and you just wanted me
0:04:46 to throw a knife down there it wouldn't
0:04:48 be any worse I think is what he's saying
0:04:49 honestly poisoning the things down there
0:04:51 would not be a bad thing or we're
0:04:53 inoculating them ah yeah okay however it
0:04:57 works that's fine
0:04:58 all right so the focus now is getting a
0:05:01 beep of a horn next to the van and when
0:05:04 you look there is a very pretty young
0:05:09 woman in a convertible with a top down
0:05:12 despite how cold it is at night and
0:05:14 she's wearing like white fur sunglasses
0:05:19 at night and she blows uh like bubble
0:05:23 gum when it pops and she returns to
0:05:26 chewing it there are definitely fangs in
0:05:29 her mouth and she gives you this look
0:05:31 Johnny and points for you to lower your
0:05:33 window Johnny starts cranking his window
0:05:37 down
0:05:38 can I help you black is the sun sweetie
0:05:41 I need a Sabbat Laura roll right oh yeah
0:05:43 I know Garrett knows exactly what to say
0:05:45 here
0:05:47 um and I think Johnny does too but I
0:05:50 mean you saw stuff on the graffiti what
0:05:52 is this intelligence uh it is
0:05:53 intelligence uh plus about more don't
0:05:56 have any Sabbat lore I'm a Sabbat
0:05:58 Survivor though so that it lowers the
0:06:00 difficulty on this right you're gonna
0:06:01 then you're gonna make an intelligence
0:06:03 rule at difficulty five
0:06:05 uh no successes you know that you so you
0:06:09 look at her and you're like [ __ ] what's
0:06:10 the code what's the code you know that
0:06:12 she is absolutely checking to see
0:06:14 whether or not you're a Sabbath vampire
0:06:15 ah
0:06:17 Johnny just kind of looks her Square in
0:06:19 the eyes
0:06:21 dips his head down
0:06:23 get [ __ ] Zealot pretty sure that's not
0:06:26 what you're supposed to say
0:06:28 she blows you a kiss and I have to rule
0:06:30 something I really want her to have like
0:06:32 some candy sweet voice too I can't do it
0:06:35 but yeah she's got like a very young
0:06:38 sounds
0:06:45 black is the song
0:06:47 bro we'll power points my friend current
0:06:49 willpower is four
0:06:50 point of willpower you said mean things
0:06:53 to her
0:06:55 that is just 10 successes on
0:06:59 entrancement
0:07:02 presence you can resist the effects of
0:07:04 presence for uh temporary amounts of
0:07:06 time so you're gonna think about her a
0:07:08 lot in the future but for the next year
0:07:11 time yeah so she looks at you she blows
0:07:16 a kiss and you find yourself wanting to
0:07:19 just you know hop in the convertible and
0:07:21 chat for a little while she's not a
0:07:22 panda issue and uh you judging by the
0:07:24 marks on her she's a hundred percent
0:07:26 Tory oriented tribute which means that
0:07:29 if she gets you alone she's going to do
0:07:31 awful things to you and that's not quite
0:07:35 a deal breaker right now so I need you
0:07:37 to make that willpower roll that
0:07:38 difficulty eight when I get to roll my
0:07:40 full whip our remaining willpower
0:07:42 remaining will power your current will
0:07:43 power defeat
0:07:45 oh yeah
0:07:48 it's no successes in a once that's a
0:07:50 botch oh Jesus
0:07:52 Johnny gives you guys a very serious
0:07:54 look it's like gives you like that I got
0:07:56 this look and pulls over Johnny what are
0:07:59 you doing I'm gonna have a conversation
0:08:00 with her no
0:08:02 no I don't think that's a good idea come
0:08:04 on look at look at her she's harmless uh
0:08:06 she starts trying to like kind of
0:08:08 parallel Parks so she can hang out and
0:08:09 talk to you for a while but is like
0:08:11 having a really hard go at it buying you
0:08:13 a few moments to talk to each other you
0:08:15 are the one who just said you didn't
0:08:16 like this neighborhood and we needed to
0:08:18 get out of here yeah but did you see the
0:08:20 way she looked at me Johnny what what
0:08:21 Clan is she I'm guessing she's probably
0:08:23 Tori oriented tribute so we gotta go no
0:08:27 she's she's pulling over right now come
0:08:29 on no we gotta go step on it please uh
0:08:32 Johnny opens the door and steps out I
0:08:34 give you a meaningful look and we're
0:08:36 like when grabs reaches up from behind
0:08:39 and grabs Johnny not the meaningful look
0:08:41 I want
0:08:45 to wrestle Johnny
0:08:47 then don't give me meaningful looks I
0:08:49 was meaning to attack the [ __ ]
0:08:54 I can't overpower that long enough
0:08:58 what we can do is deal with her all
0:09:01 right well you guys negotiate and like
0:09:03 figure out what you're gonna do uh she
0:09:05 actually takes out a cigarette and she
0:09:08 offers it to Johnny uh she likes to
0:09:10 declared action was that no I'm
0:09:13 declaring the action that Johnny's not
0:09:14 getting out of the car I'm contesting
0:09:16 Johnny getting out of the car door opens
0:09:17 she goes hey and offers you a cigarette
0:09:20 and then as she's offering you a
0:09:22 cigarette you both roll initiative and
0:09:24 oh I'm rolling in here too good Lord
0:09:29 this is the season two Johnny boss fight
0:09:40 as a reminder yeah uh before you guys
0:09:43 you know go crazy there's a crowd
0:09:45 there's a lot of people out here that's
0:09:47 why I'm not attacking the [ __ ] we start
0:09:49 things off with Britta going on a 19. I'm
0:09:52 gonna try and distract Johnny from uh
0:09:55 getting out of the van by using all on
0:09:57 him so that someone else might have some
0:09:59 more chances to handle him uh yeah go
0:10:02 ahead and roll uh you just need one
0:10:04 success he's one person by the way
0:10:05 there's like obnoxious techno coming
0:10:07 from her car
0:10:09 two successes am I rolling anything
0:10:12 against that each of you hold your hand
0:10:14 up with your current willpower rating
0:10:15 okay so win and Johnny are going to give
0:10:19 you their attention uh in order to try
0:10:21 and get Johnny's attention she's been
0:10:24 kind of lurching forward trying to beg
0:10:25 him not to get out of the car so her
0:10:27 hand goes over the shoulder of his seat
0:10:29 and she's like Johnny please don't we
0:10:33 need to be driving away you said that
0:10:34 yourself I'm looking at you for cues but
0:10:37 I don't know what the [ __ ] going on
0:10:38 with my guy right now
0:10:42 from one side and then I just got them
0:10:45 [ __ ] obliterated from the other side
0:10:47 so so here's here's I think I'm giving
0:10:50 you my sheet at this point I don't know
0:10:53 uh so you very very much like uh this
0:10:58 this NPC whose name has not been given
0:11:00 yet but
0:11:01 uh she currently has your attention so
0:11:04 you can try to talk her down you can be
0:11:06 like hey look I've been through this
0:11:08 stuff I know how to handle myself kind
0:11:10 of that kind of thing but uh you do she
0:11:13 does capture your attention
0:11:15 yeah no look I I know I said this place
0:11:17 is not the best neighborhood for us we
0:11:20 got to get the hell out of here we do
0:11:22 but I mean can we at least at least no I
0:11:25 can at least talk to her okay Johnny
0:11:27 she's pretty let's go well I know that's
0:11:29 and she wants to talk to me and I'm
0:11:31 trying to be respectful here I don't
0:11:33 feel like that's really you have a wife
0:11:36 come on
0:11:38 look that that will allow you to spend a
0:11:40 point of upon royal power
0:11:44 so I spend the wind power and then I
0:11:46 roll my new value or yeah
0:11:48 laughs
0:11:50 again what do you want I wrote I'm
0:11:54 rolling two dice and the chances of one
0:11:56 of them coming up oh man
0:11:58 it's not supposed to be that good you're
0:12:00 asking me to roll dice
0:12:02 by the way every time you ask me to roll
0:12:04 dice I'm rolling less dice next time I
0:12:07 know which makes it even worse I keep
0:12:08 thinking that's going to help you
0:12:10 this is what taking away from my dice
0:12:13 pool is gonna help me yes with the way
0:12:15 your luck works yes absolutely 100 I
0:12:17 mean you did that kind of tracks did
0:12:19 start rolling really well at the end of
0:12:20 the thing last night this was just a
0:12:22 Holy Grail Galahad scene you know that
0:12:24 right is it cool keep draining my
0:12:25 willpower until he dominates the [ __ ]
0:12:27 out of me let's go so after Roberta goes
0:12:31 miles goes I'm going to look around him
0:12:35 at her and go bug off [ __ ] and do dread
0:12:38 gaze dread gaze yes okay let's see if it
0:12:41 works yeah
0:12:43 so that'll be four successes okay three
0:12:46 causes her to run if it works
0:12:50 enter ground miles dread gazes win all
0:12:53 right so now I'm I'm giving Britta my
0:12:56 attention does that mean I can't look
0:12:57 away uh means that whatever action
0:13:00 you're taking uh brother must be the
0:13:02 focus of it all right I've got to keep
0:13:04 Britta safe yep win throws herself over
0:13:07 the seat and pushes on the gas pedal
0:13:09 Johnny has stepped out of the van yeah
0:13:11 but I have to keep Britta safe okay uh

0:13:16 of hard you're basically climbing over
0:13:18 miles who like who's also in the way you
0:13:21 know two successes okay the gases hit uh
0:13:24 and the van larches Ford it goes about
0:13:26 10 feet the van kind of like lurches
0:13:29 Ford for a moment and starts kind of
0:13:31 like slowly drifting forward uh you can
0:13:34 hear a bunch of horns honking the person
0:13:37 who is trying to get Johnny's attention
0:13:39 kind of gets this like irritated
0:13:42 expression as uh things start devolving
0:13:45 um I'm so bad at helping

0:16:23 unpredictable because they remain they
0:16:26 retain individuality and creativity so
0:16:28 this is how Johnny FL you know who were
0:16:29 you joking the other day about how we

0:16:38 we're gonna go into the talking ban
0:16:42 down by the river I don't know how to
0:16:43 make these emotional decisions so we're
0:16:45 gonna get into a van with my friends and

0:17:16 the dread case
0:17:19 God just
0:17:23 I'm just afraid Johnny's gonna get real
0:17:25 mad because I'm pretty sure he's been
0:17:26 hit with a whammy but I'm not entirely
0:17:28 sure no he is Def no there's no way you
0:17:30 have any doubt in your mind that that

0:17:50 Johnny's type she looks like she was
0:17:52 like 19.
0:17:54 I'm just gonna tell Johnny to be still
0:17:57 so that he just let run away I do not

0:19:49 long is she stuck driving at least five
0:19:51 turns all right Johnny hopefully that's
0:19:53 enough between the two of them you have
0:19:55 to drive all right Johnny gets in and he
0:19:58 starts driving you see this like
0:20:00 obnoxious toroid oriented tribute in
0:20:03 your rear view mirror look so pleased
0:20:06 with herself by the immense amount of
0:20:08 cash she caused in such a short period
0:20:10 of time and she looks at you and raises
0:20:12 her fist and pokes out her Pinky and her
0:20:16 thumb and makes a call me sign at you as
0:20:20 you race off away

0:20:34 Johnny once you've hit the road your
0:20:36 Merit triggers and you guys have a safe
0:20:38 ride back to New Haven so when are we
0:20:41 going to Boston uh if Boston's like New
0:20:43 York
0:20:45 [Laughter]
0:20:49 when smirk's kind of pleased with
0:20:50 herself
0:20:51 made this [ __ ] trip to New York a
0:20:55 dozen times in the past month
0:20:57 because I don't have anybody else in my
0:21:00 car messing things up I mean if we
0:21:03 weren't here that would have sucked
0:21:04 friends in check um
0:21:08 is that willpower uh you may spend a
0:21:11 point of willpower if you would like but
0:21:12 this is a self-control check difficulty
0:21:14 okay I get to roll self-control okay you
0:21:16 may make this one nah this is gonna go
0:21:19 bad oh my God
0:21:21 [Laughter]
0:21:23 really what you wanted
0:21:31 well you were already having a bad night
0:21:33 all right so uh you guys get do we even
0:21:38 make it out of the state you guys get
0:21:41 right about to the New York Connecticut
0:21:44 border White Plains and as you come up
0:21:47 on I don't know like uh like a truck
0:21:50 stop
0:21:51 um as you're getting close to it miles
0:21:53 uh says his quip Johnny's eyes narrow
0:21:57 and the group of you can hear the loud
0:22:00 crunch of a destroyed steering column
0:22:03 and shortly thereafter there's a loud
0:22:05 crash
0:22:13 the van has crashed
0:22:16 after being savagely destroyed by a
0:22:21 raging Johnny and the group of you find
0:22:25 yourselves lined up by the curb sitting
0:22:29 together as every now and again
0:22:32 a car goes by and it's eerily quiet
0:22:35 between the Coterie
0:22:37 and finally
0:22:38 you know slowly breaking the silence
0:22:40 Johnny Pat's his pockets and finds that
0:22:44 cigarettes were crushed during the
0:22:46 Rampage
0:22:52 if this Knight gets any worse
0:22:56 I have no idea what I'm going to do
0:22:59 please tell me
0:23:01 one of you has an extra pack of
0:23:03 cigarettes wind starts patting down
0:23:07 her pockets and her jeans and her jacket
0:23:11 normally it's Neil that has those but
0:23:14 he's been away for a bit so I don't
0:23:16 think he's carrying your cigarettes on
0:23:17 right now Johnny gets a withering stare
0:23:21 over it Neil who's kind of a mummified
0:23:23 corpse Neil is still in the van there is
0:23:27 nowhere safe to keep him
0:23:31 I guess we're walking
0:23:34 how are we gonna be walking we have to
0:23:36 bring Neil with us I guess we gotta wrap
0:23:38 him in something yep what do we got
0:23:42 miles could you have someone bring us a
0:23:46 car Maybe
0:23:49 rather late at night I think this is a
0:23:52 little bit far out of New Haven
0:23:57 and
0:23:58 getting down here
0:24:01 in a timely and safe faction fashion
0:24:04 might bring up more complications than
0:24:07 we need
0:24:08 I said we make sure we scrub the car of
0:24:10 anything incriminating
0:24:12 throw Neal's body in a tarp
0:24:15 and we hustled double times in the next
0:24:17 uh gas station or weigh station on the
0:24:21 Merit and steal ourselves some transport
0:24:24 fair enough
0:24:26 it's me
0:24:27 that should work that's mostly what I
0:24:29 was thinking at this point is that we
0:24:30 could
0:24:31 secure a vehicle at a rest stop or some
0:24:33 such
0:24:34 shouldn't be hard for us to procure some
0:24:37 keys or otherwise I mean most people
0:24:39 will just hand me keys if I ask them
0:24:41 very nicely that is true I think maybe
0:24:43 the biggest thing is keeping people's
0:24:45 eyes off Neil well I the tarp really
0:24:49 I wish we had a rug
0:24:51 it's pretty opportune for this but
0:24:52 otherwise yeah it's gonna look like
0:24:54 we're carrying a body
0:24:55 not much we can do about that though so
0:24:58 hey Lex when a kindred is torped how
0:25:03 mobile are they could they be like bent
0:25:05 in half uh yes okay so we just bend him
0:25:10 forward so his face is touching his
0:25:11 knees and he looks like a box instead of
0:25:14 a body
0:25:15 is that gonna like break him
0:25:18 like you can get more broken at this
0:25:20 point I think there's still a couple
0:25:22 options left yeah I mean he's he's part
0:25:25 rated dead I feel like that might make
0:25:27 him more dead well it's not an unnatural
0:25:30 position for the body to assume I could
0:25:31 do it right now yeah but you're not
0:25:33 lacking a blood that animates your body
0:25:36 yeah you know what I I hate that I'm the
0:25:39 one
0:25:40 that's going to be recommending this or
0:25:42 even bringing this up but isn't Neil
0:25:44 pretty thin blood can't you just give
0:25:46 him some of your like older generation
0:25:48 and wake him up we did that just before
0:25:52 the lady in the car came by did you yes
0:25:56 and it didn't work I look over to the
0:25:59 car no not so yet he's got some kind of
0:26:01 poison in him from the knife
0:26:04 all right
0:26:06 I guess we'll just wrap them up and
0:26:08 anything small I can handle with not too
0:26:11 much difficulty as long as we don't draw
0:26:13 a lot of attention we should be fine if
0:26:15 Johnny and I walk like we're just
0:26:17 carrying a drunk buddy well you want a
0:26:19 Weekend at Bernie's him which I would
0:26:22 normally be on board with but he is very
0:26:25 stiff you can't he's not he doesn't have
0:26:27 the like to be fair people are passing
0:26:30 us at like 70 miles an hour so that the
0:26:32 fact that he's a little bit stiff might
0:26:34 not look that weird I mean give it a
0:26:36 shot if you like and if people really
0:26:37 keep looking over maybe I could distract
0:26:40 them get them to look at me sounds like
0:26:42 a plan and if somebody decides to stop
0:26:44 and question us hey we just found
0:26:45 transport that is one way use a dead
0:26:48 body to flag down transport
0:26:50 I was not in the Playbook before we're
0:26:52 rewriting The Playbook as we go I think
0:26:54 man all right let's grab the body there
0:26:57 is no playbook for how this trip is
0:26:59 going and uh say goodbye to the worst
0:27:02 fan I've ever seen goodbye West fan who
0:27:04 is grabbing your boy Neil I think Johnny
0:27:07 is being that he has such high levels of
0:27:11 potence kind of just putting Neil's arm
0:27:13 around him and kind of walking him
0:27:16 alongside like he's a drunk friend
0:27:18 looking for support probably he'd have
0:27:21 the easiest time wins strong but
0:27:24 Johnny's definitely stronger
0:27:26 you guys get him out uh Johnny uh he is
0:27:29 uh he has a pack of cigarettes on him oh
0:27:33 it's like a little bit of a weird
0:27:34 container when you pull it out it is a
0:27:36 little pack of dijarum blacks since what
0:27:39 has Neil been carrying cloves maybe
0:27:42 they're from wherever he was oh Beggars
0:27:44 can't be choosers Johnny slides out one
0:27:47 of the cloves didn't he say something
0:27:49 about a weird leaf that he smokes
0:27:52 just smell those first weird leafing is
0:27:55 they smell like cloves all right he
0:27:58 smells to emphasize his point they do
0:28:00 smell like clothes they smell like
0:28:01 Cliffs Johnny uh pops out one of the
0:28:04 clove cigarettes uh bus that is Zippo
0:28:07 leans kneel up against himself and
0:28:09 starts walking as he lights the
0:28:10 cigarette wind takes her hoodie and puts
0:28:13 it on Neil pulls the hood up up over his
0:28:15 face do we maybe have
0:28:18 sunglasses or I'm telling you guys it's
0:28:21 fine no one's going to be noticing
0:28:23 details about the US walking other than
0:28:26 the fact that it's a crew people walking
0:28:27 on the side of the Merit that's weird
0:28:30 enough as it is we don't have to think
0:28:32 worry about covering up any details
0:28:34 about them you're right I'm definitely
0:28:36 wearing a long black trench coat with
0:28:39 various things in a guitar case I think
0:28:42 I feel like the next stop along this
0:28:44 route is probably
0:28:46 at least an hour's walk away
0:28:49 so let's get moving let's go the group
0:28:53 of you rock
0:28:54 and every now and again a car slows down
0:28:58 and honks someone says lewd things in
0:29:03 Britta Direction and then it speeds on
0:29:05 forward and it seems like most of these
0:29:09 late night douchebags are far more
0:29:11 interested in Britta than the literal
0:29:13 corpse that the group of you are carting
0:29:14 along with you and it's cold and none of
0:29:17 you have The Telltale sign of a living
0:29:20 breathing person that the the hot
0:29:23 visible air that comes from your mouth
0:29:25 when you breathe nope they don't care
0:29:27 about any of that they just honk at
0:29:29 Britta and move on
0:29:31 and eventually
0:29:33 the group of you find yourselves at a
0:29:35 Mobile gas station that looks largely
0:29:39 empty say for two or three cars that are
0:29:42 parked on the side you've made it at
0:29:45 least to the place that you intended to
0:29:47 be your first stop
0:29:48 Johnny why don't I take him and you see
0:29:51 about securing us a ride well I'm gonna
0:29:54 secure me some cigarettes
0:29:56 um I think Miles might be that might
0:29:59 have a better
0:30:00 easier time of convincing somebody to
0:30:03 just give us their keys yes I will make
0:30:06 a persuasive negotiation to purchase the
0:30:08 vehicle sounds much more legal than what
0:30:10 I was thinking I don't want to put
0:30:11 somebody out of the transportation they
0:30:12 can ruin their livelihood or they'll get
0:30:14 it wrong that's still plan B I mean yes
0:30:16 push comes to show but you know I'd
0:30:18 rather not but we have options right let
0:30:21 me go see if I can find a vehicle
0:30:22 that'll fit us without sitting on each
0:30:24 other's laps at least of the cars that
0:30:26 are there uh there's actually only one
0:30:29 that belongs to anyone that's actually
0:30:31 just kind of stopping in
0:30:33 buying like collecting uh this weird
0:30:36 eclectic collection of snacks are these
0:30:40 two guys one of them is very tall and
0:30:42 lanky he's got long dreads and a little
0:30:46 goatee his pants are insanely like wide
0:30:51 with far more fabric used for them than
0:30:53 is possibly needed and on his shirt is
0:30:56 this huge huge baggy shirt that comes
0:30:59 down almost to his knees and miles for
0:31:02 some reason it it seems to call itself
0:31:04 corn but it's spelled with a K instead
0:31:07 of a c and accompanying him there's
0:31:10 another fellow both of them with
0:31:11 bloodshot eyes is a young man blonde
0:31:16 kind of a pretty boy but he has this red
0:31:20 New York Yankees baseball cap you've
0:31:22 been seeing them everywhere and his coat
0:31:26 is extremely like puffy it's unzipped
0:31:29 and opened you can see like the white
0:31:30 t-shirt underneath he's got these bright
0:31:32 bright
0:31:33 blue jeans and they're just that they're
0:31:37 probably meant for someone that's over
0:31:39 six and a half feet tall they they kind
0:31:41 of hang down around his ass and these
0:31:45 two you know young guys are just
0:31:47 shopping for every stupid snack they can
0:31:50 think of and telling insanely bad jokes
0:31:53 one of them seems to actually notice you
0:31:56 when you uh enter with a little little
0:31:58 ding for the the gas station and he
0:32:02 gives you this nod and is like yo what
0:32:05 up
0:32:07 not much he nods and then just goes
0:32:10 continues about his business so I assume
0:32:12 they have some sort of van or vehicle
0:32:15 because or this is like the only vehicle
0:32:16 here is these two uh there's like three
0:32:19 cars outside cars outside they're all
0:32:20 like sedans okay
0:32:22 um you're not sure which one's theirs
0:32:23 right
0:32:25 excuse me yo me and my friends are out
0:32:29 transportation and where
0:32:31 in kind of emergency
0:32:34 or going into Central Connecticut and I
0:32:37 was hoping that maybe we could if
0:32:39 nothing else maybe borrow I could get
0:32:41 your car back to you or possibly just
0:32:44 straight out buy your vehicle
0:32:45 why
0:32:47 hmm
0:32:48 I need your car I'm willing to pay money
0:32:51 right now you need a ride bro
0:32:54 can you fit six yeah Johnny standing
0:32:58 over at the counter
0:33:00 has just bought a pack of cigarettes and
0:33:02 it's kind of dumbfoundedly watching
0:33:04 miles bother negotiating with these two
0:33:08 guys and gives him uh miles a look and
0:33:13 when miles looks over to Johnny he kind
0:33:16 of does like a spiral motion with his
0:33:19 finger like just dominate them
0:33:22 which vehicle is yours it's a weird
0:33:24 question but you need a ride right yes
0:33:27 well

0:34:09 then
0:34:10 I look like a blade reject at this point
0:34:15 [Applause]
0:34:18 Johnny walks over uh he pulls a
0:34:21 cigarette out of the fresh new pack that
0:34:23 he's purchased Pops in his mouth and
0:34:25 doesn't even bother waiting to go
0:34:26 outside before he lights it up looks at
0:34:29 the two new friends that Miles has made
0:34:32 A-Dog yeah that's me the little one with
0:34:35 the the red baseball cap kind of gives a

0:35:39 gotta be honest the the Reds broke it

0:35:45 nah these guys are real oh man
0:35:48 fair enough and now you know fair enough
0:35:51 they scored extra points with Johnny he

0:35:55 they got him
0:35:58 they're not all bad guys come on
0:36:01 so I signal over to you guys to approach
0:36:05 that I really hope four-door Honda Civic
0:36:08 it is indeed a four-door Honda City okay
0:36:10 the two-door would have been in town
0:36:13 it's got like a really [ __ ] oversized
0:36:15 spoiler in the back no wait after market
0:36:17 you're pretty sure yes win secures the
0:36:20 hood around Neil's face and starts
0:36:23 bringing him over you know she cinches
0:36:26 it shut so he's basically cornholio
0:36:29 and um brings him over like he's had a
0:36:32 rough night drinking brother probably
0:36:33 still has her arms crossed from How The
0:36:36 Walk went but it's walking with win a
0:36:39 very tall and lanky uh young man with a
0:36:41 goatee light complexion and like uh long
0:36:45 ass dreads
0:36:47 kind of pauses when he sees Britta and he
0:36:49 looks her up and down very overtly and
0:36:52 says yo
0:36:55 oh
0:36:57 this is C-Dog or which one is this uh
0:36:59 this is C-Dog which of the
0:37:01 aforementioned dogs is this very
0:37:03 difficult to track so Britta looks back
0:37:05 at C-Dog just kind of nods she looks
0:37:10 at miles for a second this doesn't a
0:37:12 little surprise at uh she doesn't let it
0:37:16 sit that long he Strokes his goatee as
0:37:18 if pondering a complex math equation and
0:37:20 then he moves on to the Civic hey yo
0:37:24 what's your name asks A-Dog to Miles my
0:37:28 name is Miles
0:37:29 I assume A-Dog is not your birth name
0:37:33 I'm sorry is is Miles your birth name
0:37:36 bro yes they both look at each other and
0:37:39 laugh at some internal joke
0:37:41 all right
0:37:43 sorry miles I like it trench all right
0:37:48 I look over it Britta and like I saw the
0:37:50 interaction I'm like essentially
0:37:52 significantly for her to pull C-Dog
0:37:54 off for a minute or two Your Girl is
0:37:56 Fine By the way
0:37:57 miles gets gives Rita that look and
0:37:59 that's followed by C-Dog's comment and
0:38:02 she kind of does the slow blink of
0:38:07 um okay uh and looks back at miles for a
0:38:12 second like she's not really down for it
0:38:15 Wynn kind of gives Johnny a look like
0:38:17 what is happening right now uh they
0:38:20 start eating like gummy bears and
0:38:23 Swedish Fish on the curb just kind of

0:40:15 it later and you will be able to get
0:40:17 money for this vehicle but we need to
0:40:19 take your car yeah

0:40:23 of mesmerism
0:40:25 to switch this guy essentially a
0:40:27 business card for his car keys roll it
0:40:32 seven successes he immediately complies
0:40:34 with your request and I will give him uh
0:40:37 200 bucks cash just so he can get a ride
0:40:40 to wherever the hell they're going okay

0:41:08 kind of shitty weed and he takes out a
0:41:10 Britta and he tucks that [ __ ] into his
0:41:13 jeans and then he uh kind of gives you
0:41:16 the thumbs up if you go and see dog and
0:41:18 A-Dog kind of gives him like an up nod
0:41:21 and she dog like gives him an up nod and
0:41:24 then they will kind of stand on the curb
0:41:25 next to each other
0:41:26 have a good night too shorty Johnny
0:41:30 catches the keys out of the air and then
0:41:31 I will get into the uh oh God

0:41:36 passengers seat
0:41:39 and kind of eases a deal into the middle
0:41:42 seat the car reeks of weed as miles
0:41:46 opens the passenger door Johnny kind of
0:41:50 raises a hand and goes um miles I know
0:41:54 you might think this is below you
0:41:56 the back seat might be cleaner
0:41:59 I'll take my chances
0:42:01 okay I would hate to take a black light
0:42:04 to this car no please don't let's just
0:42:07 let's just go uh as soon as the car
0:42:09 starts you hear sick ass stained music
0:42:12 playing all right I mean these guys are
0:42:15 very up on the popular modern rock scene
0:42:18 are they it just sounds loud Johnny
0:42:21 visibly Withers at that line
0:42:24 I mean yes it's still loud it's played
0:42:26 at a look uh miles we're all on the old
0:42:30 side here I know that but when you talk
0:42:34 about how these young kids are up on the
0:42:36 modern rock scene yes oh
0:42:40 doesn't help man music keeps going
0:42:44 yeah but saying [ __ ] like that makes you
0:42:46 you know what you know stained is local
0:42:48 right this is the band we're listening
0:42:50 to right now
0:42:51 but from Massachusetts that that's
0:42:54 wonderful and I hope you know that the
0:42:56 St the seats underneath you are also
0:42:58 stained and that's local I'm sure all
0:43:01 right you two just because you're both
0:43:02 old doesn't mean you have to argue like
0:43:04 it can we
0:43:05 Britta why have you heard me so
0:43:09 I'm young at heart all right punks we
0:43:11 all know that's not true Britta actually
0:43:13 does cake oh my God
0:43:17 let's go to New Haven so I can ride in
0:43:19 and be a real vehicle you realize we're
0:43:21 all gonna smell like weed when we go to
0:43:23 court I have things to do with that I
0:43:25 don't think that's going to be the worst
0:43:26 impression you know you might be right
0:43:28 honestly I will be extremely surprised
0:43:31 if any of the elders at court recognize
0:43:33 the smell of weed well like wheat is a
0:43:35 modern invention well first of all
0:43:37 though will we be able to get there on
0:43:40 time we did have to walk for a bit we'll
0:43:42 see I mean court goes on pretty late all
0:43:45 right but we will have to stop at home
0:43:47 and I don't know we'll figure out
0:43:48 something I have to do something with
0:43:50 Neil bringing him in feels like an
0:43:52 invitation for someone else to try what
0:43:54 you tried
0:43:55 and I don't think
0:43:57 yeah I'm not planning on submitting him
0:44:00 to anything else are we leaving him at
0:44:02 your house then
0:44:03 something like that
0:44:04 all right
0:44:06 let's get on
0:44:07 back on the highway
0:44:09 all right
0:44:10 Johnny uh fires up the Civic and gets on
0:44:14 gets set back on to uh 95 and we're
0:44:17 gonna Merit and starts heading back
0:44:19 towards New Haven
0:44:23 [Music]
0:44:26 on Route he gets a bright idea
0:44:30 you know
0:44:31 a good I a good place to start if we're
0:44:34 trying to figure out how to get him back
0:44:35 on his feet might be uh giving my buddy
0:44:38 Kabir a call how do we get in contact
0:44:40 with Kabir I got some numbers for him I
0:44:43 mean he did give us this uh he did give
0:44:45 me this job after all so he's at least
0:44:47 got some kind of connection to the
0:44:49 Assamites and if uh Wynn gives him a call
0:44:52 he might be more inclined to do us some
0:44:54 favors he kind of gives you some eyes
0:44:57 from the from the rear view and kind of
0:44:59 like his eyes or his uh his uh eyebrows
0:45:02 flutter a little bit wind does have our
0:45:04 new cell phone okay whatever
