0:00:01 Empire the Masquerade podcast set in the
0:00:03 classic world of Darkness we're all
0:00:05 friends we're here to have fun but our
0:00:07 story can include graphic violence drug

0:00:11 themes we've talked at our table about
0:00:13 safety comfort and consent both as
0:00:15 players and storytellers we know what to
0:00:17 expect we're all excited to be here and
0:00:20 we want you to feel the same so listener
0:00:22 discretion is advice
0:00:23 now let's walk the path of night
0:00:29 [Music]
0:00:33 last time on path of night
0:00:35 [Music]
0:00:36 the coloring walked to find their Haven
0:00:38 of flame
0:00:39 together they scrambled to put it out
0:00:41 while Johnny managed to kill their
0:00:43 mortal attackers though at the cost of
0:00:46 his Humanity
0:00:47 the group learned that the attack was
0:00:49 personal and followed the clues
0:00:52 they also discovered that Arabella
0:00:54 rolands has a connection to the order of
0:00:56 the cloven hoof an old coven of witches
0:00:59 who seek the uracodex
0:01:10 the group of you are gathered up and
0:01:12 together as a quotery you head to meet
0:01:15 Quentin King ruler of Boston
0:01:18 it isn't long before a cars pull up that
0:01:22 you begin to notice that there's
0:01:24 something about this place that is very
0:01:26 um disconcerting
0:01:28 there's a number of people that seem to
0:01:30 kind of walk along the street head to a
0:01:32 corner check their phone and walk right
0:01:34 back the way they came stop at the
0:01:36 corner again turn around check their
0:01:38 phone
0:01:39 and walk this circuit and this is the
0:01:42 this is true of about a dozen people you
0:01:46 can kind of count out wandering the
0:01:47 streets operating as some sort of
0:01:50 human surveillance system do you think
0:01:54 they're the same ones who are looking
0:01:55 for us
0:01:58 who's in the car with us it is uh just
0:02:01 the group of you and Sullivan
0:02:04 it's uh it's possible unless
0:02:07 unless the prince has his own
0:02:10 um
0:02:11 surveillance Network
0:02:13 but
0:02:14 it wouldn't be
0:02:16 silly are any of these people looking
0:02:18 out on the street corners yours
0:02:20 these guys are uh
0:02:23 they work for the domain and um they're
0:02:25 meant to kind of keep an eye out for any
0:02:27 signs of trouble uh rumors of Sabbat
0:02:30 that makes sense what do the rumors say
0:02:33 um the rumors say that the Sabbat are
0:02:36 moving on the east coast and Boston's
0:02:38 one of the main targets
0:02:39 hmm
0:02:41 makes sense
0:02:43 well we had time to go
0:02:45 um okay Johnny peeks out the window
0:02:47 where are we you find yourself outside
0:02:49 the Boston Opera House it looks like all
0:02:51 of the security measures that this place
0:02:53 has in effect are centered around that
0:02:57 site
0:02:58 Sullivan escorts the group of you in and
0:03:01 it is not long before you can see
0:03:06 Kindred pass by here and there just to
0:03:09 the nines this is definitely uh an
0:03:11 Elysium
0:03:13 at a certain point a one of the bully
0:03:15 boys a very non-descript looking person
0:03:17 kind of giving the impression this is
0:03:19 probably an esferatu the approach and
0:03:22 they're like excuse me uh
0:03:24 we're gonna need your uh your weapons
0:03:26 your weapons
0:03:28 I don't know that's allowed here so oh
0:03:31 um yeah okay
0:03:33 over the suit Neil unzips his fanny pack
0:03:35 and hands him over a just a pepper spray
0:03:38 I'm checking I thought we left the
0:03:40 weapons in the car or the heavy duty
0:03:43 ones we did I don't know if anybody else
0:03:44 has got stuff on them no wind would
0:03:46 lever pistol in the car Niels has got a
0:03:48 bag of garbage around his waist so I can
0:03:50 I don't remember where the knife is
0:03:52 ruining your suit look but if I have a
0:03:55 knife I'll hand it off Johnny probably
0:03:57 is carrying a steak in his jacket and he
0:04:00 has his boot knife on him the matte
0:04:03 black ax I think is in the duffel bag
0:04:05 so yeah just pulls out the boot knife
0:04:07 puts that in possession of the uh bully
0:04:10 boy along with a wooden stake oh knives
0:04:13 that's right and Neil digs through his
0:04:15 little fanny pack and pulls out like a
0:04:16 letter opener size knife oh you could
0:04:18 probably hold on to that let's kind of
0:04:20 moves on thanks win hands over a set of
0:04:23 brass knuckles thank you
0:04:25 I didn't bring any weapons Blondie you
0:04:27 got something no all right what about
0:04:30 you well here's a better question
0:04:32 Storyteller did our occasionally
0:04:35 energetic uh Toreador
0:04:37 leave her weapons behind her did she
0:04:39 accidentally share his arms to the teeth
0:04:43 pulls a full rifle out of her dress like
0:04:46 what the [ __ ] it's just the parts of it
0:04:48 Britta will hand over a knife I kind of
0:04:50 like meet your eyes because it's like a
0:04:52 nod it just takes a knife yeah it's then
0:04:55 that you're allowed to travel deeper
0:04:57 past the foyer and into the actual uh
0:05:00 one of the theater spaces
0:05:02 as you get there you see an unusual
0:05:06 sight the lights are dim there's a
0:05:09 handful of Kindred in the room and one
0:05:11 of them is this man with kind of like a
0:05:17 a shoddy haircut sitting in a like
0:05:21 soft old like recliner chair but as
0:05:25 treating as though it's some sort of a
0:05:27 throne and flanking him is a group of
0:05:31 people three on each side and he looks
0:05:34 he he carries himself in the manor as if
0:05:36 he is holding court but Kindred of this
0:05:40 domain seemed to be like attempting to
0:05:43 avoid him at all costs they they avoid
0:05:46 the spaces that he looks they kind of
0:05:48 don't really talk when they're in the
0:05:50 same room as him
0:05:51 you can feel this tension
0:05:55 the moment the group of you enter
0:05:57 something about you catches his
0:05:59 attention immediately
0:06:00 and despite all of his like Eerie
0:06:03 presence there's this Whimsy when he
0:06:07 sees you he smiles bright waves
0:06:11 hello come over
0:06:12 but a very automatically a way of Spock
0:06:15 yes you she'll start to walk away Neil
0:06:18 being in the presence of
0:06:21 these mockavians immediately starts
0:06:24 walking over as soon as commanded you
0:06:26 can kind of feel this thrum come from
0:06:28 them Johnny will keep step uh at a
0:06:31 respectful few Paces back from Britta but
0:06:34 kind of flanking her like trying to give
0:06:36 her an Air of a bodyguard more than
0:06:39 anything else you're very late for your
0:06:40 meeting
0:06:42 I was holding court so I couldn't meet
0:06:44 with all of you right away but
0:06:46 I'm here now
0:06:47 when you're here now we appreciate it
0:06:49 your grace this grace is also here now
0:06:51 and uh together we will meet and
0:06:55 we will discuss your involvement with
0:06:57 our future plans I'm definitely bringing
0:07:00 up the rear and just trying not to talk
0:07:02 based on the amount of information I
0:07:04 received about how much people hate my
0:07:06 clan in this particular area uh of
0:07:08 course your grace
0:07:10 Neil is not managing to make eye contact
0:07:13 like more than normal in a very
0:07:16 deferential like Clan pecking order kind
0:07:19 of way wind kind of follows with Johnny
0:07:23 um kind of flanking the other side of
0:07:24 Britta symmetry if nothing else but also
0:07:27 to just give this idea that she has
0:07:29 backup I'm to understand you are members
0:07:32 of the New Haven domain is that correct
0:07:34 we are your grace is it true that it's
0:07:36 overrun by Sabbat no your grace well
0:07:39 it's very concerning because
0:07:41 I'm hearing that it is there was an
0:07:44 issue but it was dealt with your grace
0:07:46 what was the issue well
0:07:49 someone dropped off a lupine to attack
0:07:52 Elysium
0:07:53 oh my
0:07:55 what is your name my name is Britta
0:07:58 Britta Ashcroft oh I'm sorry you are not
0:08:01 acknowledged you can actually speak here
0:08:02 um I apologize she backs away you look
0:08:06 like a smart person he looks at when I
0:08:08 appreciate the compliment your grace
0:08:09 tell me the story of the Lupine well yes
0:08:12 now definitely tell me that one but I
0:08:13 was actually asking about this about we
0:08:15 were holding Court one night and you're
0:08:17 going to have to
0:08:19 yep I apologize your grace I am not a
0:08:21 gifted Storyteller well which one of you
0:08:23 is
0:08:23 she looks to Johnny
0:08:27 um
0:08:28 don't withhold this from me speak are
0:08:31 you familiar with the tactics of the
0:08:33 Sabbat sir I am certainly not it is
0:08:35 something that their deplorable sect
0:08:39 enjoys to do uh kidnapping a lupine
0:08:44 and releasing it inside of a court they
0:08:47 thought it would disrupt New Haven
0:08:49 unfortunately myself and my Coterie mate
0:08:54 dispatched the werewolf before it could
0:08:57 Rampage any further than the Elysium
0:09:00 werewolf
0:09:02 yes your grace it's true we're not for
0:09:05 this quarterly
0:09:06 the remain of New Haven would have
0:09:08 fallen
0:09:09 and stepping into the room to kind of
0:09:11 join you for this conversation is Roman
0:09:14 pendrick
0:09:14 [Music]
0:09:19 Prince Pendragon
0:09:21 Hello Johnny
0:09:22 win kind of lowers her head
0:09:25 I am most pleased that the group of you
0:09:26 are able to make it
0:09:28 the malkavian prince interjects well
0:09:30 hold on now uh so at the point of the
0:09:32 story was the Sabbat involved well they
0:09:35 merely brought the Lupine thinking that
0:09:38 would be enough to break the back of New
0:09:39 Haven and then it was not
0:09:41 it was not
0:09:43 there's been some reports that they've
0:09:45 conducted some
0:09:47 uh
0:09:49 oh you say raids no
0:09:52 um vandalism
0:09:54 they uh attacked a Dunkin Donuts
0:09:59 um Anita Linda Haystack what a very
0:10:02 astute my my prince
0:10:04 um the uh
0:10:06 if if the Sabbat were truly running amok
0:10:09 I think it would be more than just a
0:10:12 scattered handful of Sabbat making
0:10:15 practical jokes around New Haven but
0:10:18 unfortunately it's just that
0:10:22 well it is my expectation that any
0:10:24 camera on the domain would not allow
0:10:25 this about to make fun of it so uh Bravo
0:10:28 Britta's keeping her head dipped in
0:10:31 respect to having been told to be quiet
0:10:34 well I grant the group of you
0:10:35 Hospitality that is of course so long as
0:10:39 you are continue to work in service of
0:10:42 Mr pendragons Grace and when you are
0:10:46 finished and you are free to leave
0:10:49 thank you you guys thank you your grace
0:10:51 thank you you Grace
0:10:52 thank you Brett adapts her head once
0:10:55 more if uh your grace
0:10:57 we may ask a favor of you
0:11:01 um Britta ashroth here you're correct she
0:11:04 has not yet been acknowledged
0:11:06 but
0:11:08 um as part of her accounting
0:11:10 we heard code remates have decided that
0:11:13 she needs to be instructed in how to
0:11:17 interact with other domains if you would
0:11:20 allow her to perhaps be a bit more
0:11:24 um vocal during her stay here
0:11:26 we think that your domain would be very
0:11:29 instructive in showing her how to behave
0:11:32 when outside of her own domain you
0:11:35 display great wisdom for your clan
0:11:37 um
0:11:38 say is she under your accounting she is
0:11:41 under the accounting of my code remate
0:11:43 The Other Woman
0:11:45 no your grace
0:11:47 the gentleman to my left
0:11:48 oh
0:11:50 how did that happen
0:11:51 tell me another story it was a dark and
0:11:54 stormy night yes he like leans forward
0:11:58 to hear more and a young girl was found
0:12:01 having been embraced and she was taken
0:12:05 in
0:12:05 by the domain of New Haven and decided
0:12:09 that she would do far more good for the
0:12:11 domain alive than dead and so she was
0:12:14 placed under the accounting of someone
0:12:16 who had shown himself to be responsible
0:12:19 but Ventrue are the worst at accountings
0:12:21 they take forever
0:12:23 my Lord
0:12:25 um my my Coda roommate miles yes
0:12:30 um
0:12:32 he is unable to speak for himself
0:12:34 because he's taken a vow of silence I
0:12:37 very wise for adventure you see my Lord
0:12:40 he has been Dishonored by uh the actions
0:12:45 of
0:12:47 his fellow Ventrue quite typical who is
0:12:50 that uh who's running amok in your city
0:12:52 and he is sworn an oath of Vengeance to
0:12:55 retrieve her and will not speak in your
0:12:58 presence until this has been done so
0:13:00 I really wish the audience could see Tim
0:13:02 physically right now
0:13:06 this is the slip is fully in his mouth
0:13:08 it's pretty um it's pretty painful uh
0:13:11 just uh FYI thank you this is this
0:13:14 Ventrue man is humiliated will not speak
0:13:16 in my presence he is taking he has taken
0:13:18 an oath to see a wrong righted I see and
0:13:23 and uh this young toriator lady uh is
0:13:26 under his accounting
0:13:28 that is correct my Lord but he cannot
0:13:30 speak for her not until the problem is
0:13:32 where is my heartbeat and
0:13:34 uh an incredibly nervous person comes
0:13:37 over miles you actually recognize this
0:13:39 person has like uh pins associated with
0:13:43 the digma's house that they have earned
0:13:45 over time
0:13:46 um don't worry it it isn't time for your
0:13:49 Beating
0:13:50 um what I do need to know is
0:13:53 um I would like you to write a missive
0:13:55 to uh his grace uh the prince of New
0:13:58 Haven informing him of a modification to
0:14:03 the standing of Kindred who normally
0:14:05 reside within his domain and they're
0:14:07 like yes yes of course and they kind of
0:14:09 like you can see their hands like
0:14:11 fidget and Knuckles like turn white as
0:14:14 they tense and get ready to take these
0:14:16 like notes down
0:14:17 and I'm I'm sorry what does the name her
0:14:21 name
0:14:22 Ashcroft yes
0:14:25 well this is a formal this is not the
0:14:28 time for nicknames um Brittany uh come
0:14:31 forward please Greta keeps looking down
0:14:33 until she's told not to and steps
0:14:35 forward I'm going to ask you the most
0:14:37 typical question that's asked of any
0:14:38 country that intends to become part of
0:14:40 the camera what is the most important of
0:14:42 the traditions and why fritta takes in a
0:14:45 deep breath and answers
0:14:48 domain your grace
0:14:50 and why is that
0:14:52 because as Prince you stand for the rest
0:14:55 of it
0:14:56 that is correct the camera begins and
0:14:58 ends with its princes
0:15:00 nothing else really matters anyways
0:15:03 um so
0:15:05 let it be known especially to the court
0:15:07 of New Haven that you are formally
0:15:09 acknowledged as a member of the camera's
0:15:12 eyes go real wide at the ground uh she
0:15:15 does look up after he acknowledges her
0:15:18 she swallows and
0:15:20 kind of like manages a bear nod uh and
0:15:24 afterwards remembers to turn it into
0:15:26 like more of a respectful like dip of
0:15:28 the head and murmurs
0:15:30 thank you very good record this Hobby
0:15:32 and uh yes take that Rowlands and
0:15:38 I'm sorry could you make sure to write
0:15:41 in there uh address just to Rowlands uh
0:15:44 don't turn your ass [ __ ]
0:15:47 I mean I was kind of mad and then he
0:15:50 said that and then I kind of shrugged
0:15:52 and I was like fair enough fair enough I
0:15:55 got you bro
0:15:56 now if you'll excuse me I'm going to go
0:15:59 walk my Ventrue and the group of you are
0:16:01 free to uh have your conversation with
0:16:03 this Grace Roman Pendragon
0:16:06 um I see you and you like kind of like
0:16:09 points at like Roman Pendragon like you
0:16:12 know like like a like a pal like we're
0:16:14 cool friends and room it just washes
0:16:17 over Roman
0:16:20 and he is just completely unfazed by any
0:16:23 attempts to like be endearing towards
0:16:26 him from this poor Prince
0:16:29 and then awkwardly Quentin King his
0:16:31 harpy and his Knights go outside off
0:16:34 Elysium grounds
0:16:38 [Music]
0:16:41 Freda is still trembling a little bit as
0:16:44 she steps backwards towards the group uh
0:16:48 and looks around not entirely certain
0:16:51 how to process what just happened Johnny
0:16:53 turns around goes over to the miles I am
0:16:56 so sorry for that Miles kind of just
0:16:58 shrugs at Johnny's apologies like I all
0:17:02 sorts of things happen in different
0:17:03 domains
0:17:05 okay this might be the weirdest thing
0:17:08 that's happened in my own life
0:17:11 um
0:17:14 first
0:17:15 are you okay
0:17:16 isn't Roman Pendragon still sitting here
0:17:18 I think we might want to cut the chatter
0:17:20 just kind of letting you have your time
0:17:22 yeah this is all beneath them
0:17:26 that was more indicated with a face when
0:17:27 you started like I'm like hey miles
0:17:29 gives Neil the look and then Neil
0:17:32 immediately goes oh [ __ ] yeah and turns
0:17:35 and defers to miles's wisdom in shutting
0:17:39 the [ __ ] up about her emotions right now
0:17:40 with that brother turns to look to
0:17:43 Pendragon and see if he does have
0:17:46 something to say he gives this slight
0:17:49 smile
0:17:50 well
0:17:51 that was interesting agreed welcome to
0:17:55 Boston
0:17:56 as you can imagine his grace was told
0:17:59 that you would be here not simply for
0:18:01 The Haunting of Ms Rowlands
0:18:05 but because the group of you have been
0:18:08 placed into a very difficult position by
0:18:11 your prince and the domain that you hail
0:18:13 from
0:18:14 and so while you're outside of that
0:18:16 domain
0:18:17 free of the Yoke fought in Ruins
0:18:20 I thought we might have a conversation
0:18:22 about the future of this region
0:18:25 he kind of like walks forward you can
0:18:28 kind of like hear like the Click of his
0:18:29 shoes
0:18:30 as like the whole room is quiet and one
0:18:33 by one all of the little Kindred that
0:18:35 are here and there kind of make a point
0:18:37 of leaving
0:18:38 We're alone in this throwing room now
0:18:40 you are
0:18:42 and Pendragon kind of gets cozy sitting
0:18:47 down in the recliner Crossing his legs
0:18:51 and looking towards the group of you so
0:18:54 what is it you would like to discuss
0:18:55 I think I just defined that
0:18:57 I'm at the next Parts the next part
0:19:01 is we address
0:19:04 the fact
0:19:05 that I've been Rowlands is an idiot and
0:19:09 he is going to get the people of your
0:19:10 domain killed sorry more people of your
0:19:13 domain killed
0:19:14 it is my intention to take New Haven I'm
0:19:16 sure you've pieced all of that together
0:19:19 but
0:19:21 I find myself in a challenging position
0:19:24 where
0:19:27 I must consider how much of New Haven
0:19:30 there will be when I have taken it
0:19:32 and it is my belief
0:19:34 that with a group of you
0:19:37 I can claim the domain of New Haven
0:19:39 without
0:19:41 significant bloodshed
0:19:43 so what you're saying is that you don't
0:19:45 want to be responsible with another
0:19:47 Prince's blood on your hands
0:19:49 and have the archons coming breathing
0:19:51 down your throat I've never met an
0:19:54 archon that is a threat to me archons
0:19:56 are Pawns Pawns of Justice who are in
0:20:00 turn pawns this is beyond that this is
0:20:03 the level of the Jihad that is not
0:20:05 easily understood and I will not
0:20:08 I will not look down on you for not
0:20:09 being able to understand it
0:20:11 but understand
0:20:13 that the Sabbat is coming and if I lay
0:20:17 waste to New Haven
0:20:19 it becomes all the more difficult for
0:20:22 New Haven to defend itself from the
0:20:24 inevitable Sabbat attack
0:20:27 you understand this arithmetic I will
0:20:29 have New Haven
0:20:31 whether it is a pile of dust or a
0:20:34 thriving domain
0:20:36 and which of the two it is
0:20:39 I must say it is the group of you
0:20:42 who gets to decide
0:20:44 why influence power and capacity for
0:20:48 violence a willingness to do it
0:20:51 you are not the strongest Kindred of New
0:20:54 Haven but you are the most willing to
0:20:55 fight
0:20:56 and willingness to fight is something
0:21:00 among within the camera that can win
0:21:01 battles before they begin
0:21:04 and why should we
0:21:06 help you
0:21:07 besides saving supposed lives well you
0:21:11 are the leader of your quotery I'm in a
0:21:14 lot of favors can you perform for your
0:21:15 prince at the risk of your friends
0:21:17 before you start losing them
0:21:19 how many times must the group of you
0:21:21 find yourselves in torpo in danger
0:21:24 surrounded by enemies
0:21:26 or that any support from your prince
0:21:28 whatsoever
0:21:30 and you're offering that support of
0:21:32 course
0:21:33 it is a byproduct of competent
0:21:35 leadership
0:21:37 miles has his he's not wrong face on
0:21:42 that thought is going through winside as
0:21:44 well
0:21:45 pretty sure that thought is going
0:21:46 through all of our heads Neil's thinking
0:21:48 about the moon
0:21:52 I haven't seen it in a couple days
0:21:56 um can I ask a tangentially or a related
0:22:00 question
0:22:01 um I mean all of well not everybody but
0:22:04 all of us at least in this conversation
0:22:06 are aware that the Sabbat are forming a
0:22:09 massive unprecedented Crusade
0:22:12 do we know why
0:22:15 do you know why
0:22:18 did your sire not tell you
0:22:21 he looks at Miles not in so many words
0:22:24 I see
0:22:26 the spot have reinforced the position
0:22:28 Mexico City
0:22:30 I never masked
0:22:31 incredible power
0:22:34 that power has begun to sweep up the
0:22:36 East Coast
0:22:38 archon's just the cause
0:22:41 they've never thought this about who
0:22:43 have this level of ferocity most of the
0:22:46 Canada's leadership resides in Europe
0:22:48 and domains that have never seen the
0:22:52 Zulu form
0:22:53 they have never seen the results of a
0:22:56 Blood Feast they have not seen the
0:22:58 Sabbath's power
0:23:00 their strategic choices are made without
0:23:04 any understanding of what it is that
0:23:05 they are dealing with
0:23:07 and this about knows this
0:23:11 um
0:23:12 I guess I meant why now
0:23:16 as the time when all
0:23:18 manner of actions are coming into play
0:23:21 yeah
0:23:23 the sabata prepared for centuries and
0:23:26 it seems only now
0:23:28 their ruler the Regent of the Sabbat the
0:23:31 one who sits in Cain's throne
0:23:33 has indicated that they are ready for
0:23:37 the conquest of the camarilla
0:23:39 and so now we are hunted
0:23:42 but there are things that this about
0:23:44 fears
0:23:45 and I have taught them
0:23:47 to fear us
0:23:49 and that is going to provide a degree of
0:23:51 protection that you're Upton Mullins
0:23:52 never can
0:23:54 your archons they maintain their own
0:23:57 lives for now
0:23:58 but they will sacrifice you to preserve
0:24:00 them and they will still lose
0:24:03 the only way to defeat the Sabah
0:24:06 is to remind them of fear that they have
0:24:09 not felt since mortality I don't
0:24:11 disagree but I'm not sure changing
0:24:13 leadership will help either
0:24:15 even if he is
0:24:17 not particularly well suited to this
0:24:20 kind of job is that your word for it
0:24:23 miles makes a small shrug and before
0:24:26 continuing you might want to take a
0:24:27 moment to be honest with yourself
0:24:30 I know about Rowlands then you know the
0:24:35 consequences that your domain suffers
0:24:37 because of his incompetence
0:24:39 so can you really look at me and say
0:24:42 that you don't know that there will be a
0:24:43 difference
0:24:45 when he is so sad
0:24:47 so weak
0:24:49 that you can't even speak of him without
0:24:51 sugar coating it
0:24:53 putting you in power out of their hands
0:24:56 would mean that instead of a puppet
0:24:59 Prince
0:25:00 that allows us the freedom to make our
0:25:02 own choices and how we defend New Haven
0:25:05 we're willingly giving up as sacrifices
0:25:07 for your War
0:25:09 I've heard rumors about how you wage war
0:25:12 I've been told to embrace Brujah for your
0:25:15 War
0:25:17 I'm not sure that that's what I want to
0:25:19 be serving that's because if you had it
0:25:21 your way you would serve no one
0:25:23 but I think you understand
0:25:27 that what you want is not something you
0:25:29 will be able to have
0:25:32 so rather than worry about whether or
0:25:34 not I am this brutal War Monger that you
0:25:37 call me and
0:25:38 yes many of those rumors are true
0:25:43 recognize
0:25:45 that the way Upton has it is just you
0:25:47 protecting your Quarry it is just you
0:25:50 protecting the people that you care for
0:25:52 and when you are gone
0:25:54 they will have no one
0:25:56 The Mortals of that domain
0:25:59 the humans
0:26:02 who have made New Haven their home
0:26:04 you know
0:26:06 more than anyone here what the Sabbat
0:26:09 will do
0:26:10 on this Feast with a superior opposition
0:26:13 and I also recognize what the sound of
0:26:17 an elder vampire trying to sound
0:26:20 empathetic sounds like
0:26:23 and when you said Mortals and humans
0:26:26 you nailed it right on the head bub
0:26:28 you don't give a [ __ ] about any of that
0:26:29 no but I know that you do
0:26:31 and whether or not Eye Care doesn't
0:26:33 matter because you do see the one thing
0:26:36 that I do believe is that I do believe
0:26:37 you're gonna make New Haven yours one
0:26:39 way or the other a pile of Ash or a
0:26:43 somewhat assembled defense
0:26:45 I think that's exactly how you want it
0:26:47 you'd rather have the defense because
0:26:49 that means the speed bump would work a
0:26:51 little bit faster for you but either way
0:26:53 you're planning to sacrifice the
0:26:55 entirety of New Haven
0:26:57 am I wrong
0:26:58 I sacrifice nothing to the Sabbat
0:27:04 you grossly underestimate my desire to
0:27:07 win on every front
0:27:10 and you're sure of your winning
0:27:12 yes so too is the Sabbat
0:27:15 then why would they attack
0:27:17 you now in New Haven while I am not in
0:27:21 control of it
0:27:22 that is a silly question I mean why
0:27:24 would they attack in Mass if
0:27:27 they know you hold the Northeast
0:27:30 they're going to take every domain that
0:27:32 they can
0:27:33 because right now I don't hold all of
0:27:35 the Northeast
0:27:37 and if they can strike soon enough if
0:27:40 Upton rolands and the group of you
0:27:43 can resist just long enough they may be
0:27:46 able to have New Haven yet
0:27:48 but it will be them or me
0:27:52 so no
0:27:53 I will not pretend to have empathy for
0:27:56 your peasant morality
0:27:59 but I will speak to you of the math
0:28:02 the undeniable truth about what comes
0:28:05 next
0:28:07 and you would have our backs
0:28:09 notice how War works
0:28:11 now I recognize that this is not an easy
0:28:15 choice
0:28:17 so I do not expect you to make it here
0:28:18 in this moment
0:28:20 so I'll take my leave for now
0:28:22 and we will speak again before you leave
0:28:25 Boston
0:28:26 we'll be here for a while
0:28:27 yes
0:28:29 will you reach out to us or shall we
0:28:31 contact you
0:28:32 you will come to me when it is time he
0:28:35 turns and he walks away Greta has that
0:28:38 mortal moment of letting a breath go
0:28:40 before remembering that she doesn't have
0:28:41 to breathe
0:28:44 um
0:28:45 so in the short term none of this has
0:28:48 been help well we have hospitality yeah
0:28:51 we got what we accomplished let's go
0:28:53 back to the hotel room and you all look
0:28:55 pretty great
0:28:56 so
0:28:57 okay I feel I know that that wasn't a
0:29:00 genuine attempt at a compliment but I
0:29:02 feel like it was a self-complement
0:29:03 because you bought us these clothes
0:29:04 it can be both
0:29:06 um Johnny gives a quizzical look at the
0:29:09 two of you having said that at the same
0:29:10 time I need to learn from him guys but
0:29:13 it's gonna happen it's been a very weird
0:29:15 night Johnny on the same page I just
0:29:18 never thought I'd see him actually start
0:29:20 to rub off on you well I mean make a
0:29:22 suit maybe I'm rubbing off on him
0:29:25 that's true I just won't wear those
0:29:27 shoes they're gross nope all right they
0:29:29 are not as bad as they used to I regret
0:29:31 bringing this up that with with
0:29:34 by the short term I mean yes we have
0:29:37 Hospitality now but we need to find
0:29:40 Arabella and and when didn't you need to
0:29:42 talk to the premiere yes well we can
0:29:45 look around now can't we yes that's true
0:29:47 but I don't have any Premier contacts in
0:29:50 the city and everyone fled this room
0:29:52 there's other rooms in the building
0:29:54 though they didn't go far this is way
0:29:56 too interesting for them to have gone
0:29:57 far I mean I hope so honestly if well
0:30:01 there's anyone like me they're probably
0:30:03 listening around a corner this is why I
0:30:06 should always carry an air horn you mean
0:30:07 freshly acknowledged oh no please don't
0:30:09 do that I read that joke I wouldn't do
0:30:11 that to you buddy that wouldn't hurt so
0:30:13 bad I know Britta kind of looks over to
0:30:16 Miles and uh she laughs a bit but she
0:30:18 says
0:30:20 um
0:30:20 do you think um our Prince will be
0:30:25 mad at us
0:30:28 for that truth be told I can't tell but
0:30:31 probably okay I'm sure we can shift that
0:30:34 I know that you just said people are
0:30:36 probably listening but there is no one
0:30:38 in our immediate vicinity so
0:30:41 to dial this back a few minutes are you
0:30:44 okay
0:30:46 um I'm not really worried about that
0:30:49 right now I'm being acknowledged is
0:30:51 something that will help us in this
0:30:53 domain I mean we just need to get
0:30:55 through this
0:30:56 this domain yes but still okay if you're
0:30:58 not worried about it that's fine just
0:31:00 okay
0:31:01 um
0:31:02 second question
0:31:04 miles are you okay
0:31:05 that was shitty
0:31:07 I mean it's about as far as I expected I
0:31:10 know and and we talked about it a lot
0:31:11 and we prepped it but I still
0:31:13 oh I'm I'm fine apparently they let this
0:31:17 guy run the place so that's what happens
0:31:19 Neil's flashing back to the couple of
0:31:21 times that miles's Authority was
0:31:23 questioned and he frenzied
0:31:25 listen I didn't really expect to be
0:31:29 acknowledged and um not entirely sure
0:31:32 that I know what it means I'm just
0:31:34 surprised that I answered the question
0:31:35 correctly so if we can keep going and
0:31:39 just get this figured out yeah
0:31:41 got that uh let's go find someone to for
0:31:44 a win to talk to and then I guess maybe
0:31:46 speak with the other scourges about um
0:31:49 where Arabella might be hold up Sullivan
0:31:51 said you could take us to the spot where
0:31:53 he'd burn where they had found the bird
0:31:56 and other Scourge depending on how long
0:31:58 ago that was if I mean I might be able
0:32:01 to get something I just need a starting
0:32:02 point yeah it's a clue at least but
0:32:04 let's go see if we can go mingle with
0:32:06 the tramir Apparently okay this is all
0:32:11 right and now I have a valve science
0:32:12 thanks for that in front of in front of
0:32:14 Quentin yeah there are other people here
0:32:17 but he did couch it in the he won't talk
0:32:20 in front of you okay I kind of missed
0:32:23 that I was a little yeah no no no no
0:32:25 that's why I was checking in on how you
0:32:26 were doing
0:32:27 besides I think you need some practice
0:32:29 that's disobeying the prince
0:32:31 occasionally
0:32:33 I think you do it enough for the both of
0:32:35 us
0:32:36 I'll keep on doing until rubs off on you
0:32:38 all right can we stop talking about
0:32:40 rubbing off and and like just go fun it
0:32:43 wasn't weird until you just made it
0:32:44 weird yeah Johnny Johnny starts walking
0:32:46 off the very final place to smoke what
0:32:47 are you talking about here I absolutely
0:32:49 Neil just left [ __ ] holding the bag
0:32:52 all right it's a Fanning pack
0:32:56 it isn't fanny pack
0:33:01 [Music]
0:33:04 so a group of you start moving together
0:33:07 through Elysium is that correct just
0:33:09 splitting apart no I don't see the point
0:33:11 of doing that in enemy territory trying
0:33:13 to get to go smoke shrimp
0:33:16 do I see a balcony or something
0:33:17 somewhere uh so where you are uh there's
0:33:21 actually a pretty easy path to what's
0:33:24 like a uh a big smoking area kind of
0:33:27 like outside and there's also just kind
0:33:31 of different rooms that are kind of
0:33:33 smoking areas inside so if I'm looking
0:33:36 for Constantine rejects I'm going to
0:33:37 look for smokers
0:33:39 I mean this is a vampire game if we do
0:33:40 need to socialize with people we should
0:33:42 probably go find what the smokers are oh
0:33:43 yeah
0:33:46 just wear those with power gather
0:33:50 um
0:33:51 just so that we're not
0:33:53 no one's wandering off alone when we'll
0:33:55 go with Johnny to find because she's
0:33:57 just as likely to find someone to talk
0:33:59 to outside his inside okay
0:34:01 when you guys head outside you find what
0:34:05 looks to be
0:34:07 a click of three young women all of them
0:34:11 are kind of like very gothy a lot of
0:34:15 fishnets black lipstick dark dark
0:34:19 eyeshadow and they're covered
0:34:24 and well looks like you know pentagrams
0:34:27 and all sorts of like little icons and
0:34:32 the three of them are smoking clothes
0:34:35 and kind of just like relaxing out in
0:34:39 the cold
0:34:40 when you kind of like look their way a
0:34:43 little too long
0:34:44 the three of them paused from whatever
0:34:46 hushed conversation they were having
0:34:48 and look towards you
0:34:50 hi there wind Cabot from New Haven
0:34:55 so are the rumors true one of the masks
0:35:00 kind of like giving this look with a
0:35:02 corked eyebrow which ones
0:35:05 um that you're a prisoner
0:35:09 no
0:35:10 you sure
0:35:12 why would there be rumors that I'm a
0:35:14 prisoner motions with their finger for
0:35:16 you to get closer
0:35:18 she comes closer
0:35:19 so there's a bit of news going around
0:35:24 Boston
0:35:25 right now after some conversation that
0:35:29 happened with the prince
0:35:31 that you and your friends are not
0:35:33 allowed to leave the city
0:35:35 so
0:35:38 is it true
0:35:41 not as far as I know very interesting
0:35:46 so I'm Sonia pleasure to meet you Sonia
0:35:50 welcome to Boston thank you and uh I
0:35:54 hope things don't go really bad for you
0:35:55 here you and me both what brings you to
0:35:59 the area
0:36:01 couple matters of business I'm actually
0:36:04 looking to speak with someone from Clan
0:36:05 Premiere oh we can help can you now you
0:36:10 all right
0:36:11 I need to get into contact with the
0:36:13 Giovanni
0:36:15 what do you need a Giovanni for uh some
0:36:18 trouble with the shadowlands around here
0:36:20 it's the milliners who are kind of like
0:36:22 handling a lot of things I don't know if
0:36:24 you know but that it's like a like a
0:36:26 subgroup with the Giovanni they're like
0:36:28 relatives but not relatives and then is
0:36:32 this guy called amrigino and
0:36:36 he's pretty powerful from the Giovanni
0:36:39 name rings a bell and if you want we
0:36:42 could maybe help you out but I don't
0:36:45 know if you're in some kind of trouble I
0:36:47 don't want to bring the Giovanni you
0:36:50 know well I'm not in any kind of trouble
0:36:53 do you want to confirm that maybe would
0:36:57 that smooth things out for you it would
0:36:59 make me feel safer I can confirm that
0:37:02 okay all right thank you Sonya thank you
0:37:06 win
0:37:07 foreign
0:37:09 kind of takes a step back
0:37:11 it took some palpable effort for her
0:37:13 eyes to not glaze over just at the
0:37:15 general tone of Sonia but
0:37:17 Sonia looks at the others as you're like
0:37:19 walking away and they're like did you
0:37:21 smell that
0:37:23 oh my god get back over to Johnny who's
0:37:26 on the other side of the area smoking
0:37:27 the hell was that all about
0:37:29 [ __ ] if I know apparently I'm a prisoner
0:37:33 what apparently we're not allowed to
0:37:35 leave the city hell with that I'll get
0:37:37 out of the city whenever we want that's
0:37:39 kind of my thought too but I will
0:37:41 confirm that we are in fact not trouble
0:37:43 so that I can talk to the Giovanni I
0:37:45 believe Pendragon said something about
0:37:47 not leaving the city until we talked to
0:37:48 him did you yeah that was the last part
0:37:51 of the things that he said Oh I thought
0:37:53 he meant to go back to New Haven um not
0:37:56 not here today I meant before we go back
0:37:58 to New Haven so effectively yes the
0:38:01 prince of the this domain said we were
0:38:04 free to leave whenever we wanted he he
0:38:07 explicitly said that it's true the
0:38:09 hierarchy presented didn't seem to
0:38:12 enforce that the same way I'm just
0:38:14 saying that the prince of this domain
0:38:16 said we could leave
0:38:18 it doesn't matter do you need what form
0:38:21 of confirmation do you need for them I
0:38:23 suspect I don't know I don't really know
0:38:25 but uh they weren't spectacularly
0:38:28 helpful well they just wanted
0:38:30 it sounds like they wanted to know that
0:38:32 they wouldn't be getting in trouble for
0:38:34 helping you right
0:38:35 so my first instinct is to talk to the
0:38:38 harpy but that may or may not be a good
0:38:40 idea you know I hate to say this but you
0:38:43 might be able to call in a favor with
0:38:44 Reiss
0:38:45 didn't Raven have your contacts or
0:38:47 something like that she did but I
0:38:49 haven't heard back from her yet do you
0:38:51 like try calling her she doesn't have a
0:38:53 phone
0:38:54 if she does she hasn't given me the
0:38:56 number flashback to early in season one
0:38:59 where Prince Roland goes Gangrel don't
0:39:01 have phones
0:39:04 damn it he's right Juan does now all of
0:39:09 the Gangrel in New Haven have a phone
0:39:10 now it's a Nokia sounds like rumors are
0:39:13 garden of ahead of us it's not
0:39:15 surprising in a domain like this that
0:39:17 happens
0:39:18 um
0:39:19 maybe we could start looking to Arabella
0:39:21 see if Raven gets in contact with us
0:39:23 because
0:39:24 I don't know anyone here I will say it a
0:39:27 second time even though it really
0:39:28 bothers me I have to do this but we
0:39:30 could call Reiss their Clans very tight
0:39:33 if he call if if you you have his number
0:39:36 I do you could make a call to him have
0:39:39 him get in touch with the Chantry up
0:39:40 here and he could inform them that
0:39:44 giving win a uh the help she needs is in
0:39:49 their best interest and what are we
0:39:50 willing to give up for that
0:39:51 I would probably have to owe him
0:39:53 something [ __ ] we're on Business
0:39:55 from The Domain we're working for the
0:39:56 prince if he wants this taken care of
0:39:58 which I'm sure he does then he'll do
0:40:00 this this isn't technically business for
0:40:02 the prince though this is my own thing
0:40:04 he doesn't have to know that I suspect
0:40:06 he already knows that he'll probably ask
0:40:09 it's just it'd be what like a minor Boon
0:40:13 a trivial Boon to to just be like hey
0:40:15 can you
0:40:17 but it's not a if he wants something too
0:40:20 much we
0:40:21 I don't know he'll probably screw me
0:40:23 over yeah just let me see what we can do
0:40:25 here first we can always call Reiss
0:40:27 later what did those girls say anyways
0:40:29 like you asked if the rumors were true
0:40:32 that I was a prisoner here and they they
0:40:34 but they said that they would just help
0:40:35 put you in contact uh they told me the
0:40:38 family that
0:40:40 I would probably need to get into
0:40:41 contact with but they wanted to make
0:40:43 sure that they're not sending trouble to
0:40:45 the Giovanni yeah which totally makes
0:40:46 sense but they said they would help out
0:40:47 you just better better plan of action I
0:40:50 just figured it out you the new sheriff
0:40:53 call The Prince and tell the prince not
0:40:56 ask him tell the prince to inform
0:40:58 sanasha Reiss he is to give a uh a call
0:41:02 to the Chantry up in Boston and inform
0:41:04 them that it's all right that we go see
0:41:06 them well it's a different domain I mean
0:41:10 will that really go through it would be
0:41:12 miles calling rolands no I think he
0:41:15 meant for the between the race and the
0:41:18 Chantry here yeah but you if you call
0:41:20 the prince and have the prince tell tell
0:41:22 uh tell Reiss then no Boons change hands
0:41:24 and you're working within the structure
0:41:26 of the domain and the the using some of
0:41:29 the benefits of your ill-gotten title
0:41:31 why don't we see what we have otherwise
0:41:34 before we start calling in people from
0:41:35 the other domain
0:41:37 and causing them for us to owe them or
0:41:40 where's Scourge Sullivan I don't know
0:41:42 somewhere around probably don't Scourge
0:41:45 stuff we have his phone number because I
0:41:48 I want to know if there's a Gangrel
0:41:50 primage in here okay so so here's the
0:41:52 the
0:41:53 question right all right um
0:41:56 we have Hospitality now
0:41:58 beyond the three-day window but we
0:42:00 there's so much to do we don't want to
0:42:02 spend forever here so what is what is
0:42:04 highest priority we we could I mean you
0:42:07 could ask you know word is now out now
0:42:09 that you've talked to the coven over
0:42:11 there uh that
0:42:14 um you want to talk to the Giovanni I'm
0:42:16 sure it'll make its way around if rumors
0:42:18 are already being making their way
0:42:20 around
0:42:20 um
0:42:21 and we can talk to the scourge and call
0:42:24 him anyways because he had mentioned
0:42:26 that he would give us a starting point
0:42:28 whatever so we can start looking for
0:42:29 Arabella
0:42:31 um
0:42:31 and then hopefully Raven gets in contact
0:42:33 with you and since that has been
0:42:35 established and we go from there and if
0:42:38 if within what do you want to say 24
0:42:39 hours we don't have a better lead on how
0:42:42 to talk to how to find
0:42:44 um
0:42:45 the Giovanni for you to talk to then uh
0:42:48 then we call in favor stories I mean by
0:42:51 me we're we're dead we got time on our
0:42:53 hands here right
0:42:55 well at least a little bit well time is
0:42:58 a factor yeah but 24 hours is
0:43:01 well it was less than 24 hours before we
0:43:04 got made by Arabella and she sent a hit
0:43:06 squad of three guys to our Haven also to
0:43:09 kill us in our sleep or did you forget
0:43:10 that part no I didn't how could I forget
0:43:12 I was the one who woke up uh-huh I
0:43:15 didn't forget I know that but worrying
0:43:18 about our accommodation what I'm saying
0:43:19 though is you Johnny like you're
0:43:21 inadvertently agreeing with me here
0:43:22 because I'm saying hey let's pursue the
0:43:24 Arabella thing and wait the 24 hours on
0:43:27 finding the Giovanni that's just I I
0:43:29 don't think that I'm being unreasonable
0:43:32 also it might take you more time
0:43:34 depending on what we find out to start
0:43:36 narrowing down Arabella oh yeah this
0:43:38 could take a while right I have no idea
0:43:41 all we know about Arabella is what
0:43:43 cloven Hooves and thinks when did he get
0:43:45 any sense of what the girls wanted to
0:43:47 prove that you're not a threat besides
0:43:50 messing with us
0:43:52 why don't we ask him hey the crap
0:43:56 yeah I'm talking to you over here
0:43:57 everyone looks at the others I think
0:44:00 that old guy's talking to us
0:44:02 I just kind of look at him
0:44:05 we could maybe have someone else in the
0:44:08 code Rico talk to them but all right you
0:44:12 know forget it Sonia what would smooth
0:44:14 things over for you uh knowing that I'm
0:44:17 not gonna get in trouble
0:44:20 oh boy we're just we're a little
0:44:22 confused on where the rumor is coming
0:44:24 from so we're trying to figure it out
0:44:26 help but uh
0:44:29 came from the prince
0:44:31 and then other people said it and then I
0:44:33 heard it from them
0:44:34 well the prince told us we were free to
0:44:36 come and go uh uh I don't know how to
0:44:39 explain this to you
0:44:40 but
0:44:42 the prince is kind of
0:44:45 unique
0:44:46 yeah the others kind of give me her an
0:44:49 encouraging nod like unique was a good
0:44:51 choice
0:44:52 so
0:44:54 so you need to hear it from someone else
0:44:56 so I just want to make sure that I'm not
0:44:58 going to get in trouble
0:44:59 uh I don't really care how
0:45:02 um
0:45:03 when Neil says this like to win but loud
0:45:06 enough for them to hear
0:45:08 uh
0:45:09 that thing you wanted to talk to the
0:45:11 Giovanni about it was kind of about
0:45:13 helping them with a with a mutual
0:45:15 problem right yeah
0:45:17 okay so I don't see how that could get
0:45:19 anybody in trouble if you are helping uh
0:45:22 the Giovanni I mean that is true I am
0:45:25 here to help the Giovanni with a problem
0:45:26 they put out a call for people like me
0:45:28 well do they like give you contact
0:45:30 information
0:45:32 I heard it second hand
0:45:34 okay well
0:45:37 um I don't know how to tell you this but
0:45:41 the Giovanni
0:45:43 are very busy right now
0:45:46 and
0:45:48 you know
0:45:49 if you're planning to help them you need
0:45:52 to like I don't know be clear about it
0:45:56 so Clarity is something important to you
0:45:58 then yeah and also
0:46:02 um
0:46:02 you're not allowed to leave Boston and
0:46:05 we all have to report it if you try to
0:46:07 leave
0:46:08 so don't do that
0:46:11 okay well we're not going anywhere for a
0:46:14 while anyways
0:46:15 yeah we have business I just kind of
0:46:18 said that they kind of look at each
0:46:19 other and then like look at neelic is a
0:46:22 weirdo as soon as the trio of women look
0:46:24 at Neil like he's a weirdo he just shuts
0:46:26 up and like folds in on himself would it
0:46:28 would it be all right then if we could
0:46:31 get contact information for the Giovanni
0:46:33 so that we could share that we want to
0:46:35 help and that way we don't have to leave
0:46:38 we'll just be talking
0:46:40 uh fine but
0:46:43 you didn't get it from me no of course
0:46:45 not all right that's kind of like starts
0:46:48 going through her stuff and she uh why
0:46:51 don't you give me a perception occult
0:46:52 rule she has to dump out her purse and
0:46:55 then
0:46:58 four successes with four successes you
0:47:03 notice that among the little like dangly
0:47:05 symbols that she has all over the place
0:47:07 they should probably gotta like Hot
0:47:08 Topic or whatnot there is a cloven hoof
0:47:12 hmm those are cute charms ah thanks I
0:47:16 guess where'd you get that one she takes
0:47:18 out her nose and starts running it down
0:47:22 um
0:47:23 she like practically shoves the note at
0:47:26 you that has the phone number on it
0:47:29 um mind your business mind your mouth
0:47:32 your mouth guess there we go here
0:47:35 all right well it looks like we're done
0:47:37 here appreciate it yeah okay thank you
0:47:40 we didn't hear it from you
0:47:42 bye bye
0:47:44 I just kind of looks as you see her eyes
0:47:47 like like started discussing among
0:47:50 themselves I think she's a Gangrel
0:47:53 all right thank you Britta you're
0:47:55 welcome
0:47:57 all right
0:47:58 contact information acquired yep and we
0:48:02 found out that there's a rule we didn't
0:48:04 know about so good progress you want to
0:48:06 call or do you want to move what do you
0:48:08 guys want to do
0:48:09 I've got progress made if you guys want
0:48:12 to take a leap towards Arabella I don't
0:48:16 think a whole lot is going to be
0:48:17 happening um
0:48:19 here for us
0:48:21 unless somebody disagrees with me and
0:48:23 Sullivan was our ride unless we take a
0:48:25 cab so well it's Boston though we could
0:48:27 take
0:48:28 I assume that's me miles is to you
0:48:31 excuse me
0:48:33 I put the phone miles here
0:48:36 it's been a long time miles
0:48:38 you've recognized the voices Arabella
0:48:41 Rowlands
0:48:43 good evening I heard you're in Boston I
0:48:46 am
0:48:48 I heard you talk to Roman Pendragon
0:48:51 not for the first time
0:48:54 we need to talk
0:48:56 all right
0:48:57 some were public
0:49:00 that's agreeable to me
0:49:01 or the last person that came to talk to
0:49:03 you uh ended up uh ashes so
0:49:08 well
0:49:10 things are more complicated than
0:49:12 than I would like always are
0:49:16 but we need to talk
0:49:19 sure who
0:49:21 just me or everyone else
0:49:23 I don't care how you bring miles Quincy
0:49:25 Market half hour all right I'll see you
0:49:27 then
0:49:28 she hangs up
0:49:30 I believe
0:49:31 well that was quick yes good um
0:49:34 what
0:49:36 is it
0:49:37 we need to be in Quincy Market in 30
0:49:39 minutes so good news not enough time to
0:49:42 change
0:49:43 what's that your priorities are skewed
0:49:47 yes all right let's get our stuff back
0:49:50 and get ready uh Neil why don't you give
0:49:53 me a perception plus learn this role I
0:49:55 don't have uncenses up so it's just a
0:49:56 regular one right yep
0:49:58 unfortunately
0:50:03 uh What's the diff you want seven
0:50:05 three successes with three successes you
0:50:09 will know uh that while we've been
0:50:12 talking there has been someone kind of
0:50:14 quietly following you around Elysium at
0:50:16 this point do I have a read on like who
0:50:18 they are or I just kind of know
0:50:19 someone's watching young woman
0:50:21 strawberry blonde
0:50:23 I dressed rather well for the occasion
0:50:24 and
0:50:26 she is kind of doing that thing or she's
0:50:30 paying attention to other conversations
0:50:31 but she always has near towards you
0:50:33 not wanting to tip anyone well no
0:50:37 yeah Neil sort of freezes for a second
0:50:40 um well I can probably just hear us
0:50:42 anyways
0:50:44 um turns and makes very awkward looks
0:50:47 towards a fellow skulker
0:50:51 um
0:50:52 we've uh we have a we have a fan
0:50:54 what by a a
0:50:58 H and me a Fester
0:51:03 well that depends entirely on the
0:51:05 intention I don't like that I said a me
0:51:07 and you immediately jumped to a creeper
0:51:09 okay we already know that there are
0:51:12 certain rules in place here right and
0:51:14 they're gonna keep an eye on us and
0:51:16 that's fine because we're going to act
0:51:17 to help you're right Johnny will take
0:51:19 his hands and clap very loudly
0:51:23 Britta well Yelp she doesn't have
0:51:25 heightened silences on she just didn't
0:51:26 expect that does anybody else yell
0:51:28 though
0:51:30 Premiere women Yelp and look really
0:51:32 annoyed at the weird old guy and then
0:51:35 um there is this uh again a young woman
0:51:38 trunk strawberry blonde hair she's not
0:51:40 she wasn't like obfuscated or anything
0:51:42 but you can like see this like wince
0:51:47 when uh you clap
0:51:49 let's go find the coat check
0:51:51 all right we have to get back all of the
0:51:53 knives that we left apparently
0:51:56 um it's just just as a general pointer
0:51:59 uh sometimes when I'm in that position
0:52:02 uh I either don't want to be seen or I'm
0:52:04 waiting for an opportunity to be seen so
0:52:07 I if we go to the code check and it's a
0:52:09 wait for an opportunity you know that
0:52:11 might be a great time for someone who
0:52:13 wanted to talk to us to be able to talk
0:52:16 to us
0:52:17 Neil says out loud why do I feel like
0:52:19 you're not talking to me but all right
0:52:21 let's keep going I am talking to
0:52:23 everyone yeah I got that sense he's very
0:52:25 inclusive that's true like thank you
0:52:28 you're welcome we got all over the place
0:52:30 compliments and insults today I don't
0:52:32 know a creeper wasn't meant to be an
0:52:34 insult how
0:52:36 because you creep
0:52:38 it's not an insult if it's true if it
0:52:41 was coming from me it'd have been an
0:52:42 insult but coming from when you know
0:52:44 that was actually probably meant as a
0:52:46 compliment yeah creeper is a type of
0:52:47 Vine right yes see yeah I'm just gonna
0:52:49 go get my
0:52:51 coat I guess and we go to get our
0:52:55 weapons back I'm pretty sure tomorrow
0:52:57 I'm gonna mean creeper is a compliment
0:52:58 you're gonna mean as an insult oh hello
0:53:00 there hello uh bad news uh we're not
0:53:03 turning on over any weapons
0:53:05 um your uh personal effects are required
0:53:08 so you can be tracked if need be but uh
0:53:10 uh but that said you know enjoy it
0:53:12 reaches out and grabs his shirt thinks
0:53:15 better of it and then kind of lets him
0:53:18 go yeah it's I know it's a rough one uh
0:53:20 but you know try to be positive about it
0:53:23 noted thanks for the advice gotcha uh so
0:53:27 um well that's it he starts kind of
0:53:29 walking off
0:53:30 um The Woman strawberry blonde hair kind
0:53:33 of like stops him
0:53:35 you see this like quick exchange of a
0:53:38 conversation between them and he gives
0:53:40 her the bag
0:53:41 and she approaches the group of you
0:53:45 and is like
0:53:47 gesture of Goodwill and starts handing
0:53:50 you guys back your stuff thank you thank
0:53:53 you very much although
0:53:55 should we be taking these back it says
0:53:59 Neil who only gave over pepper spray and
0:54:01 is not emotionally attached to it anyway
0:54:03 well if you're not supposed to have them
0:54:05 back
0:54:06 I will accept responsibility and and I
0:54:10 can work that out great okay
0:54:12 um thanks
0:54:13 I am I just had some questions about a
0:54:16 fire that happened pretty recently and I
0:54:18 was just looking to know if you knew
0:54:19 anything about it meanwhile
0:54:22 she is saying two things at once and
0:54:25 she's speaking to them about a fire uh
0:54:29 the words you hear
0:54:31 are I represent Elsa London's will and
0:54:35 the Gemini league is watching this
0:54:37 situation if you attempt to leave Boston
0:54:39 you will be killed do I hear that she's
0:54:42 saying anything else or do I hear that
0:54:46 there so there's like a background noise
0:54:48 of like other sound and she's like she's
0:54:51 giving this long-winded explanation as
0:54:54 to why she has these like this like very
0:54:56 small handful of questions Britta has a
0:54:59 very different expression uh then it
0:55:01 might seem appropriate for what she's
0:55:03 saying there's a widening of eyes as she
0:55:05 like takes in some new information which
0:55:07 might seem a bit odd if there's
0:55:08 questions happening about something that
0:55:11 we would know about and she kind of dips
0:55:13 her ahead
0:55:15 um making you know eye contact with
0:55:17 someone very seriously holding on to her
0:55:18 words and then says just she nods she
0:55:22 nods and her eyebrows are a little
0:55:24 higher
0:55:26 is going to provide you with the Haven
0:55:28 they will make sure that you are not
0:55:30 tracked but we do not have a means of
0:55:32 getting you out of the domain just yet
0:55:34 do not attempt to flee because Roman pen
0:55:37 dragon has the power to summon you to
0:55:40 him if you attempt to go he will kill
0:55:43 you
0:55:44 so we must find another means
0:55:48 I'm going to give you an address
0:55:50 this addresses where the Treme are going
0:55:53 to meet you and make arrangements to
0:55:55 keep you at a safe location during your
0:55:57 time here in Boston is there anyone that
0:56:00 the group of you need to contact in New
0:56:02 Haven
0:56:03 in the meantime what we have figured a
0:56:05 way to work this out
0:56:07 because right now you are hostages
0:56:10 what weathers need to know about the
0:56:12 fire Britta says looking at the group at
0:56:16 Large
0:56:17 what I mean you'd probably be interested
0:56:19 in it just in like a general sense I
0:56:22 mean to follow up on the investigation
0:56:24 well no but like he no if I if I was if
0:56:27 I said weathers you want to hear about a
0:56:29 fire up in Boston he'd look at me like I
0:56:31 had three heads yeah but what about one
0:56:32 where you were like a cool guy if he
0:56:35 needed to help us here I to be perfectly
0:56:38 honest I don't think that weathers would
0:56:39 think I was cool at all for what I did
0:56:41 in that in that house I think you'd
0:56:43 probably have a few select words to say
0:56:44 to me about what I did in that in that
0:56:46 building dear Johnny please don't rip
0:56:47 the heads off of people
0:56:49 talk about that maybe in polite company
0:56:51 at least hey is there anyone else that
0:56:55 we could talk to if we needed to about
0:56:58 that fire or anything similar can I make
0:57:01 a well like problems perception roll
0:57:03 roll me perception plus subterfuge
0:57:06 you're looking extra deer in the
0:57:09 headlights right now I don't know what
0:57:10 the heck's gotten into you

0:57:51 meet you too and uh what exactly are you
0:57:53 doing here in Boston listening in on us
0:57:56 uh to be fair the error codex is
0:58:00 something of interest to me huh and as I
0:58:03 understand it the group of you are here
0:58:05 looking into matters regarding uh
0:58:08 Arabella Rowlands and I've had some
0:58:11 trouble with her in the past I had Haven
0:58:14 the head uh burned because she's in
0:58:17 pursuit of a few articles that I am in
0:58:20 possession of oh and uh so I thought I
0:58:23 might bring it up
0:58:24 meanwhile
0:58:25 yes I can determine a means of
0:58:28 contacting these people and warning them
0:58:30 about what is taking place thank you for
0:58:33 your interests John Reiss and Elsa
0:58:35 Linden will send word once we have a
0:58:39 plan of action for extracting the group
0:58:40 of you all right
0:58:42 is that in the double speak or is yep
0:58:45 that's all just toried orator no we
0:58:48 don't have much time so it's been a
0:58:50 pleasure to meet you Veronica
0:58:52 um thank you for following up on our
0:58:54 harrowing apologies for any
0:58:56 interruptions oh no thank you and you'll
0:58:59 send on any results from your
0:59:01 investigation soon I'd be happy to share
0:59:04 findings regarding uh the air codex and
0:59:06 the like so if you hear anything I am
0:59:08 willing to pay Boons what have you well
0:59:11 we'll keep them talking plainly about
0:59:13 the error codex okay sure why I guess we
0:59:16 can keep that in mind I like that you
0:59:17 made the added character symbol with
0:59:18 your fingers
0:59:21 okay all right well thank you thank you
0:59:24 sure uh she slips off Britta looks
0:59:28 directly at Neil and let's get moving
0:59:31 before we start talking about more stuff
0:59:32 she looks back at Miles nods walks fast
0:59:37 what's what it's getting a car first and
0:59:40 out of Elysium what you just gave me a
0:59:41 weird look should I just give him a
0:59:43 little weird look it's almost like she's
0:59:44 trying to communicate with him his knife
0:59:47 back in his boot takes the stake puts it
0:59:49 back in his jacket okay
0:59:51 what do you uh when you get outside
0:59:54 Sullivan in the car he brought you guys
0:59:55 here and gone I guess we flag a taxi or
0:59:59 we could just take the tea we flag
1:00:01 attacks we live in Connecticut we have
1:00:02 terrible products
1:00:04 can you get in I guess
1:00:08 and she Taps the side of her head with
1:00:11 her two fingers if you want me to and
1:00:16 with a commanding voice uh Neil will
1:00:20 attempt to get inside britta's brain go
1:00:23 for it I start getting as a taxi
1:00:25 however long that might take sorry or
1:00:27 group your size uh it's just sedan after
1:00:31 sedan Simple cars where are we going why
1:00:34 don't we just walk because we need to be
1:00:35 there quickly where are we going Quincy
1:00:38 Market why are we going to Quincy Market
1:00:39 because we need to be in Quincy Mark in
1:00:41 30 minutes probably like 25 minutes and
1:00:44 I will tell you once we get into a car
1:00:47 to be perfectly honest I uh I think Neil
1:00:50 might be right about this I think moving
1:00:52 and grabbing it grabbing the T might
1:00:54 actually be faster do you know how the
1:00:55 transportation works here I do actually
1:00:57 you know how the trains run here I do
1:01:01 actually Boston is also uh Boston is
1:01:04 designed where their public transit is
1:01:06 actually really easy to use but their
1:01:08 streets are hot nonsense unlike New York
1:01:10 uh I'm Neil we'll try and get into her
1:01:12 head uh what's your current willpower
1:01:14 rating three okay
1:01:17 five successes so I can read some pretty
1:01:20 deep thoughts but right now I'm just
1:01:23 trying to figure out what you're why you
1:01:24 want me in your head like what are you
1:01:26 trying to project to me I am trying to
1:01:28 give Neil all the information that I was
1:01:30 just given in the double talk
1:01:32 okay yeah so
1:01:34 she kind of uh you see these like kind
1:01:37 of very what's becoming very deeply
1:01:39 rooted concerns that if the group of you
1:01:42 try to leave
1:01:43 you will be summoned before Upton
1:01:45 rolands and killed I'm sorry before uh
1:01:47 Roman Pendragon and killed and the
1:01:50 information as well about the safe house
1:01:51 provided by Reiss and all of that she's
1:01:54 projecting that information through the
1:01:56 link
1:01:58 oh
1:02:01 oh wow that is not at all what I heard
1:02:05 um and you understand why right right
1:02:08 yes absolutely can you and she points at
1:02:12 the other Coterie members oh
1:02:15 um I insist on the T then we can take
1:02:17 the T
1:02:23 I've done plenty of driving on Boston
1:02:25 roads and I think we're much better off
1:02:28 I mean Jeff's taking the tea besides we
1:02:31 we had we got good uh line of sight on a
1:02:33 car we can get into one where there's
1:02:34 not many other passengers we can kind of
1:02:37 talk in confidence if there's nobody on
1:02:38 the same car as us I'll follow you a
1:02:40 direction of this if we can stop at the
1:02:42 hotel before Quincy Market to grab stuff
1:02:45 then that'd be fine but otherwise if I
1:02:47 know anything about Boston's public
1:02:48 transit the only issue is it it shuts
1:02:51 down at like 1am and it is impossible uh
1:02:55 and as Neil is talking he is going to
1:02:58 try and shoot that information into
1:03:00 people's brains
1:03:14 six
1:03:15 all I need is one success to implement
1:03:18 implant a thought and I'm not trying to
1:03:19 hide that it's me so
1:03:22 it's Johnny that's when
1:03:26 that's that's not miles no no as a
1:03:31 matter of fact I get I get no successes
1:03:32 on Miles
1:03:34 and you shouldn't have gone in this
1:03:35 order give you a false sense of
1:03:37 something yeah it made me feel good and
1:03:39 it was wrong
1:03:41 I thought maybe I'm better at this
1:03:47 miles miles [ __ ] wheel of force just
1:03:51 get Farms your brain
1:03:53 please leave my brain alone
1:03:56 anyways so as as Neil is talking about
1:04:00 like the merits and downfalls of
1:04:02 Boston's public transit the information
1:04:05 from Britta gets projected pretty clearly
1:04:08 in his voice directly into your brains
1:04:11 I don't know how Johnny would feel about
1:04:13 that
1:04:14 this is I think the first time Neil has
1:04:17 done that done telepathy to anyone in
1:04:20 the Coterie and that's part of the reason
1:04:22 why he was so reticent to like just jump
1:04:24 I imagine we're walking into the pickup
1:04:26 on it t-stop and then you will probably
1:04:28 like stop
1:04:30 yeah Buddha's looking at people after
1:04:33 looking at Neil like she's waiting for
1:04:35 the input everybody has boots or shoes
1:04:39 of someone sort and I think fertile
1:04:40 probably has wood
1:04:41 Johnny kind of reels a little bit and
1:04:45 like kind of like slaps at his head a
1:04:47 little bit and you can already see that
1:04:49 his beasts hackles are rising I don't
1:04:52 know if this would necessarily send him
1:04:53 into a full-on frenzy but I'm gonna make
1:04:57 a self-control check like no willpower I
1:05:00 have very little willpower
1:05:02 foreign
1:05:05 [Music]
1:05:11 yeah so he starts smack pulling at his
1:05:14 own head kind of like as if he's trying
1:05:16 to get something out of it out of his
1:05:17 his ear
1:05:19 um I asked him too and then his eyes
1:05:21 start to kind of shake like you guys
1:05:23 notice that they do and he's kind of
1:05:26 starting to like get ready to like pop I
1:05:29 asked him too and I'm sorry but I don't
1:05:31 know any other way that we can share
1:05:33 that can we leadership can I actually
1:05:34 support her in this to try and give her
1:05:36 extra dice or no yeah you can eat
1:05:38 another all right I'm gonna try and Aid
1:05:40 bread in this I'm just like objection I
1:05:42 can't passion him
1:05:44 um uh using powers feels shitty isn't
1:05:47 that how we got here
1:05:49 no uh passion's not gonna honestly
1:05:52 considering everything that's been
1:05:52 happening passion might be the right
1:05:54 [ __ ] thing he has been on edge since
1:05:57 we got here so as Britta is talking to
1:05:59 him Neil is gonna look over and just be
1:06:01 like hey uh Johnny
1:06:04 um all that stuff about the Tea you
1:06:05 heard me right you you heard me uh
1:06:08 talking about how we can safely use the
1:06:10 tea he actually just gets more irritated
1:06:13 somebody trying to explain to him how to
1:06:14 use Transportation
1:06:16 we're very funny so that gives me an
1:06:20 extra dice or what does that do the
1:06:21 difficulty on the self controls your
1:06:23 humanity is a six right ooh makes it
1:06:26 easier for me
1:06:28 goodie
1:06:30 seven successes does not do it for a way
1:06:34 longer period of time then yes it does
1:06:36 no I'm sorry six successes so like a
1:06:38 year three months three months three
1:06:42 months of calm down dead in your
1:06:45 emotions a little bit don't get so angry
1:06:47 so easy I'm gonna call it a minus one
1:06:49 difficulty on your frenzy checks I feel
1:06:51 like they're not positive for right now
1:06:54 manipulation plus leadership
1:06:58 I have one success trying to give me
1:07:01 self-control
1:07:04 success because of the minus one death
1:07:08 a storm of success his uh
1:07:12 his mouth kind of closes a little bit
1:07:14 his fangs retract and his eyes kind of
1:07:17 come back to being focused
1:07:20 I know we're not used to living
1:07:21 somewhere with
1:07:23 public transit Neil what did you do
1:07:25 nothing I'm just talking about the T he
1:07:28 says looking directly at your eyes like
1:07:30 there's a reason I did that and we're
1:07:32 not talking about it openly on the
1:07:34 street yeah when she did not have
1:07:36 Johnny's reaction because she's used to
1:07:39 weird things going on in her head a
1:07:40 little bit but the fact that someone
1:07:43 kind of just dumped all that in she has
1:07:47 some kind of processing issue and is
1:07:49 while Johnny is freaking out she's just
1:07:52 kind of blinking uncontrollably not
1:07:55 fully in her senses we can all talk more
1:07:58 about the transportation options later
1:08:00 yeah maybe
1:08:02 um once we once we go uh have our
1:08:05 meeting and then you know uh maybe
1:08:08 hunker down for the for the day
1:08:11 at
1:08:12 you know
1:08:13 right yeah but right now we have a
1:08:15 meeting to get to right miles that's
1:08:16 correct the thing I've been trying to
1:08:18 get us to go to right which is why I was
1:08:20 talking about until you started
1:08:22 irritating and we'll talk about the Tea
1:08:23 yes I saw all right
1:08:26 miles completely outside of this weird
1:08:28 four-way conversation
1:08:32 he knows how to get us there just let
1:08:34 him do his job okay I'm sorry Johnny I
1:08:36 didn't mean to free annoy you no it's it
1:08:39 I I think I I overreacted a bit
1:08:42 it's not that's okay so where it's okay
1:08:45 yeah he looks really thrown for a loop
1:08:49 so Johnny where where do we get this uh
1:08:52 right right up on the corner here and he
1:08:53 leads the the group up to where the t is
1:08:56 fantastic I can't wait for public
1:08:58 transportation

1:10:54 like you guys were like all right we're
1:10:55 really gonna put Britta forward and I did
1:10:57 it for a little bit and he's like oh

1:11:00 really what I really want to see you are
1:11:02 relying on the Tory door no what I
1:11:06 should have done was I should have been
1:11:07 like uh miles and you've been like I'm
1:11:09 not doing this
1:11:11 um Neil and then have Neil you're like
