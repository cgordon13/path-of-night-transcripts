0:00:26 [Music]
0:00:30 last time on path of night
0:00:33 when the quarter investigated marcos's
0:00:35 death Neil determined that Reiss was
0:00:38 responsible for the murder
0:00:39 [Music]
0:00:41 to prevent miles from illegally
0:00:42 embracing Marcos Neil used sorcery to
0:00:45 ensure the ghouls stayed dead
0:00:49 revealed the black crescent moon on her
0:00:51 Palm to John causing the Borah to recall
0:00:54 his traumatic Sabbat embrace
0:00:58 as the cordray attempted to recover from
0:00:59 the night Johnny learned that the court
0:01:01 of New Haven was on the verge of
0:01:03 declaring a blood hunt on Neil
0:01:09 [Music]
0:01:12 miles
0:01:14 you brother and Neil
0:01:18 arrived to release him
0:01:21 and what car do they arrive the
0:01:24 storm purple Lamborghini Diablo how much
0:01:27 blood am I able to get before we go each
0:01:30 of them holds within them 10 uh traits
0:01:33 of blood so you can take up to 20. no
0:01:38 um and anywhere in between 0 to 20.
0:01:41 I'd like to take uh four total two from
0:01:44 each sounds good
0:01:45 she does that as uh she directs Neil to
0:01:49 wipe the blood from his face and when
0:01:51 she comes back she makes sure the two of
0:01:52 them
0:01:53 look right and are settled and ready to
0:01:55 get into the storm purple Lamborghini
0:01:58 Tim can you please describe to us what
0:02:00 miles looks like going to court right
0:02:02 now because I don't think he's in his
0:02:04 usual like buttons all the way up kind
0:02:07 of look I feel like he's dark miles
0:02:09 right now and I want and I want to know
0:02:11 what that looks like
0:02:13 I just feel like hair swept back he's
0:02:15 carrying his Katana long blue coat I
0:02:19 mean he's a sheriff he can have that
0:02:20 Katana oh the katana is definitely
0:02:22 coming this time around oh yeah is he
0:02:24 wearing a tie
0:02:26 yes but it's only a half windsor
0:02:29 I don't know I'm not currently no I'm
0:02:32 thinking like yeah I'm now that likes
0:02:35 put in my head like the the semi-dark
0:02:37 blue suit with the open open collared
0:02:40 shirt and everything else like that
0:02:41 French cuffs with no cufflinks
0:02:44 she's not giving a [ __ ] just just like
0:02:48 [ __ ] showing up and this is what you
0:02:49 guys like holding the katana in one hand
0:02:51 just [ __ ] it Brita makes it damn sure to
0:02:54 be wearing her gloves once more before
0:02:55 they get into the car Neil is
0:02:58 essentially catatonic and has not taken
0:03:01 care of himself at all uh and like blood
0:03:04 wiped off the face will
0:03:07 if it's anything more than just a smear
0:03:08 from listening will have to be done by
0:03:11 someone else he's wearing the exact same
0:03:13 clothes as he was
0:03:14 despite the fact that he is has been a
0:03:18 kindred for 30 years looks like he's
0:03:21 about to throw up
0:03:23 and has that face on the entire time
0:03:26 like I haven't had any contents in my
0:03:28 stomach for 30 years but I'm about to
0:03:30 lose it Bretta is making damn sure like
0:03:33 she's keeping a watchful Toreador eye on
0:03:36 Neil's appearance anytime there's even
0:03:38 like a threat of a smear of blood she
0:03:41 has a makeup wipe at the ready uh she's
0:03:43 as everyone's settling into the
0:03:45 Lamborghini she's trying to straighten
0:03:47 Nails collar almost like in a very
0:03:49 official sort of way
0:03:51 uh he doesn't fight any uh like attempts
0:03:55 to make him look even somewhat
0:03:57 presentable for court uh but he also
0:04:00 doesn't help in any way he just like
0:04:02 he's just so far inside his own head at
0:04:04 this point that Neil basically doesn't
0:04:07 exist on the car ride over Neil you
0:04:09 gotta remember that you've helped this
0:04:11 domain all right you've done so much for
0:04:14 them and we we can maybe use that right
0:04:20 what about my filing system when we get
0:04:24 there miles I'm gonna try
0:04:27 and see if we can talk to Elsa
0:04:31 um you might want to make calls before
0:04:33 we get there if possible and just let
0:04:35 her know
0:04:37 we need to get things in motion
0:04:39 then I'll call her also Neil Johnny's
0:04:41 making sure your stuff is in touch so
0:04:43 you need to pull yourself together
0:04:46 I don't know if he knows what's
0:04:48 important what isn't important he's not
0:04:49 gonna let anyone touch anything
0:04:50 including himself
0:04:52 okay okay
0:04:54 Bretta will pull out her phone to call
0:04:57 Elsa Linden as we tear through the
0:04:59 streets at high speed hello hi this is
0:05:03 Bretta
0:05:05 um
0:05:05 we heard what was going down at court
0:05:07 we're coming as soon as possible but I
0:05:09 was hoping that I could talk to you what
0:05:11 did you wish to discuss
0:05:14 um
0:05:14 naturally I'm worried about Neil
0:05:18 nothing it's he's not his sire that's
0:05:22 ridiculous
0:05:24 why is that ridiculous
0:05:25 he's been with us helping the whole time
0:05:27 and I just was hoping that
0:05:30 maybe that you would um
0:05:33 help
0:05:35 okay
0:05:36 I have a question for you yes is it true
0:05:39 that he practices acid might Magic
0:05:43 he's always helped the domain
0:05:46 you see how strange it is
0:05:48 that you wouldn't answer my question
0:05:51 and then you
0:05:53 Kindred with your own secrets
0:05:56 who has only been in this domain for a
0:05:58 handful of months
0:06:00 would make such an insistence
0:06:03 I know it's strange
0:06:06 but
0:06:07 you know that he's loyal to The Domain
0:06:10 you know that he helped you
0:06:13 and I know that that he should have
0:06:17 but I just hope that you can see in him
0:06:19 that he's but I don't think this
0:06:21 conversation can advance if you won't
0:06:22 answer my questions
0:06:24 Brito makes eye contact with miles
0:06:27 I can't listen on people's Publications
0:06:29 he says to her
0:06:32 she kind of points to Neil
0:06:35 covers the phone mute
0:06:38 do I tell the truth you need to trust
0:06:40 her
0:06:41 there's no point in you not dealing with
0:06:44 her straight
0:06:45 unmuted
0:06:47 yes
0:06:49 but he's not he's not his sire
0:06:52 you understand that there might be
0:06:54 little difference
0:06:56 I don't know anything about his sire
0:06:59 really but the last time I helped your
0:07:01 cordery
0:07:03 your friend miles showed up to my Haven
0:07:05 and squeezed me for a lifeboom so here's
0:07:09 what I'm going to do
0:07:11 I am going to help you Retta
0:07:15 and in exchange you are going to procure
0:07:18 for me two life Boons from your cautery
0:07:20 I do not care who from whom they are
0:07:22 given
0:07:24 what you
0:07:25 accept instead no
0:07:28 not even the cancellation of that boom
0:07:30 as I understand it miles likes Hardball
0:07:32 so that's the ball we're going to play
0:07:35 then if two life Boons is the cost then
0:07:38 That's What It Takes Two members of your
0:07:40 quotery
0:07:42 and let's be very clear
0:07:46 I don't like Hardball
0:07:49 and I find it regrettable
0:07:51 that this is the game we must play
0:07:53 she hangs up
0:07:55 that's [ __ ] she started that hard
0:07:57 ball miles it doesn't matter who started
0:07:59 it if she's gonna help and
0:08:01 think we need her too yeah she's the one
0:08:04 that started trying to squeeze me first
0:08:05 all I did was this all right one of
0:08:08 these life booms is coming from me who
0:08:10 else
0:08:13 we'll find out don't make any promises
0:08:15 yet until we figure out what's going on
0:08:16 there no we need this no we don't have
0:08:20 we don't know the situation yet by
0:08:22 indebting ourselves before we know
0:08:24 what's going on you're the one who said
0:08:26 there are certain choices we have to
0:08:27 make I'm willing to do this I understand
0:08:29 that but taking advantage of our fear is
0:08:33 what these people do our fear yes right
0:08:37 now is what we have what else do we have
0:08:40 I the only other way I see out of this
0:08:43 and trust me when I say that I know that
0:08:46 you don't have any wish to do this is to
0:08:49 apologize to Reiss
0:08:53 who takes a second
0:08:56 this was going to come for him
0:08:58 regardless of the circumstance that me
0:09:00 and Rhys had but when he chose to start
0:09:03 participating without some white sorcery
0:09:05 it was always going to be a thing that
0:09:07 came up at some point or another but
0:09:09 whenever Rowlands moves it's race behind
0:09:11 it
0:09:13 it's quite possible Rowlands is also
0:09:15 captured by his fear his grace is not
0:09:19 going to move from this unless we have
0:09:21 people on our site that's part of it
0:09:24 correct what else do we have and we need
0:09:26 it I need also too
0:09:29 remember the fact that this codery is
0:09:33 effective and by pissing us off they do
0:09:38 a lot to lose that
0:09:40 and that's part of the reason they're
0:09:42 trying to get us under their thumbs
0:09:43 miles it sounds like you offended Elsa
0:09:47 okay and I I understand that you think
0:09:49 that she offended you but she has way
0:09:51 more power than we do we're effective
0:09:54 sure but this is court now it's not
0:09:56 about what we can accomplish through our
0:09:58 talent or our willpower it's about
0:09:59 politics
0:10:01 yes I understand that so we need her we
0:10:05 need anyone that we can get on our side
0:10:07 and I realize that you might
0:10:09 I I can't say it enough part of it is
0:10:12 that they need us too that's why they go
0:10:15 through these things it's all a series
0:10:18 of control but if they were going to
0:10:20 call a bloodhound on Neil they decided
0:10:22 they didn't need him
0:10:25 which ones of us are they willing to
0:10:27 start throwing out life Boons here and
0:10:30 there this is how Roland ended up
0:10:32 indebted to Reiss so that's why you must
0:10:35 think carefully
0:10:37 and the reason why Elsa is pissed off is
0:10:40 because she knew she owed that
0:10:43 and she doesn't like being under someone
0:10:45 else's thumb either I will place myself
0:10:47 under Elsa's thumb if it saves Neil
0:10:51 Boons the whole point of boots is
0:10:54 supposed to be giving someone a reason
0:10:55 to care about you
0:10:57 we're supposed to be important as a
0:10:58 codery to these Elders fine I'll give
0:11:02 her a reason to keep me alive I'll give
0:11:03 him her reason to keep this code real
0:11:05 life but we need two of them
0:11:07 and I know that you don't want to rush
0:11:08 into this and I'm not exactly happy
0:11:11 about it either then but I don't think
0:11:14 no no I won't take a second this needs
0:11:17 to happen
0:11:18 I'm calling Gwen
0:11:20 and she's calling when
0:11:22 um
0:11:23 why isn't it me
0:11:25 Bretta will pause in pulling out her
0:11:27 cell phone
0:11:28 do you think she'd accept one from you
0:11:30 if she already owes you one I don't I
0:11:34 don't know she's
0:11:35 don't know hey who are you calling
0:11:38 it's going to call when to see if she
0:11:40 would do the lifeboon too
0:11:42 it's being thrown around
0:11:46 I'll do it it's fine I won't even
0:11:49 cancel my other cash amen I'll just
0:11:52 I'll I'll do it I I just
0:11:55 um because I get some more reason to
0:11:57 want me around uh rather than wanting to
0:11:59 get rid of me and then the thing but um
0:12:01 if you're calling win can you uh can you
0:12:04 put them on speaker I I don't think that
0:12:06 Johnny knows uh that so like okay the
0:12:10 guitars are supposed to be in order of
0:12:12 when they were sold and created right
0:12:14 like there's a system to it and I need
0:12:16 him to know Bretta calls when but
0:12:18 decidedly does not put her on speaker
0:12:23 [Music]
0:12:26 when back at the uh at Miles place has
0:12:30 run up to the truck and kind of baps on
0:12:34 the window of the truck I think you're
0:12:36 already just saying that you were
0:12:38 running out the door for me I figured
0:12:39 that we got in together and Johnny was
0:12:41 just like ah I guess I got back up so as
0:12:43 they're cruising around when when's
0:12:45 phone goes off and she picks it up hey
0:12:48 I don't know what's wrong I made a call
0:12:50 okay Elsa knows that it's true that Neil
0:12:54 practices the magic but [ __ ] she'll
0:12:57 accept two life booms from the codery to
0:13:00 help so one's coming from me one's
0:13:03 coming from Neil
0:13:04 should be stated that I don't believe
0:13:05 that we should be doing that all right
0:13:07 what's going on Elsa wants two life
0:13:10 Boons in order to help Neil well tell
0:13:13 her to get stuffed Johnny is of the
0:13:15 opinion she should get stuffed all right
0:13:18 that matches that matches with miles's
0:13:20 opinion but here's the thing I don't see
0:13:22 another way out of this and every time
0:13:24 that someone's telling me to calm down
0:13:25 and not do it do it they're not saying
0:13:27 another solution
0:13:28 that's because we haven't been presented
0:13:30 the whole case yet mention the guitars
0:13:32 no so we need Elders on our side we're
0:13:37 losing all of the elders that we had at
0:13:39 all connections to okay anyway I thought
0:13:42 you should know before you walk into
0:13:43 whatever you're walking into because
0:13:45 because I don't know what telling her
0:13:48 that means I don't know if that
0:13:49 information spreads or not is she going
0:13:51 to accept one from Neil I don't know
0:13:57 if she doesn't put my name on Johnny
0:13:59 gives a look Acro over at uh win in the
0:14:02 passenger seat like you crazy
0:14:05 look I'm
0:14:07 I'm willing to do what it takes to
0:14:09 survive this and if the day comes when I
0:14:12 have to break that boon
0:14:14 we'll cross that when it comes
0:14:16 as I see it I already own my life solve
0:14:19 my life to all of you so you don't but
0:14:24 all right
0:14:25 so we have that plan I guess miles you
0:14:28 can try to talk me out of it but look
0:14:30 Elsa is playing the Elder game she
0:14:35 if she can help I'm willing to pay for
0:14:37 it I need to focus on making sure they
0:14:39 don't even get inside Neil's Haven
0:14:41 because that'll be the final nail in his
0:14:43 coffin yes here's the thing
0:14:46 Elsa was willing to talk to me even
0:14:49 though she was offended and I don't I'd
0:14:51 like to talk to her I don't want this to
0:14:53 be another
0:14:54 I don't want this to be the story of our
0:14:57 relationship with Elders in our domain
0:14:58 okay
0:15:00 that feels like we're putting the cart
0:15:02 before the horse a little bit Brita
0:15:04 winner they already at the court are you
0:15:06 there yet we're close
0:15:09 not yet tell her to stop worrying about
0:15:11 court before she's even there once she
0:15:14 gets there tell her to have a
0:15:15 conversation with Elsa and act like
0:15:17 she's important and stop being like a
0:15:20 little like she called her Johnny oh I
0:15:22 get that but she needs to remember that
0:15:24 she's important and that she's got
0:15:26 better but
0:15:28 just tell her to act like like she's as
0:15:31 important as we know she is Johnny says
0:15:34 believe in yourself when you say it like
0:15:36 that listen whatever conversation miles
0:15:39 that you had with Elsa it didn't go well
0:15:43 she's upset and she was upset she
0:15:46 couldn't push me around sure I honestly
0:15:50 don't care I just want us to live and
0:15:53 right and by letting her push us around
0:15:55 I get it and now we're in a position to
0:15:57 be pushed around I I get to some of
0:16:00 those degrees
0:16:01 but put miles on Reddit hands the phone
0:16:05 to Miles kind of sharply miles speaking
0:16:08 let's win
0:16:10 look you brought me into this cotery
0:16:13 because I don't have the same opinions
0:16:15 as you you brought me in because I see
0:16:17 things different than you right you
0:16:19 brought me in because you need people
0:16:22 around you who don't just yes man you um
0:16:25 sorry I'm driving at high speeds can I'm
0:16:27 I am agreeing with you then slow the
0:16:29 [ __ ] down when can you do that speaker
0:16:31 thing I want to hear you're on
0:16:33 speakerphone now hello can you hear me
0:16:35 yep you need to acknowledge that this is
0:16:39 maybe not the best solution right now
0:16:41 which solution the let's play hardball
0:16:44 I'm not playing Hardball you are to be
0:16:47 exactly playing Hardball both of you
0:16:50 shut up you're not my dad I don't have
0:16:52 time for this I'm not playing horrible
0:16:54 and I didn't play hardball with her
0:16:56 until she started to push it last time
0:16:58 this is people trying to gain control
0:17:00 over us we need to let them sometimes to
0:17:04 get what we want which is meal surviving
0:17:08 my terms are set Niles Neil is worth it
0:17:11 to me I understand that did you really
0:17:14 think I was going to let him die I think
0:17:16 you were close
0:17:19 really Johnny reaches out and puts a
0:17:21 hand on when just to kind of and gives
0:17:25 her a look out of the corner of his eye
0:17:27 like hey maybe peel it back a degree or
0:17:31 two I think that you get so hung up in
0:17:34 not being controlled that you lose sight
0:17:36 of us sometimes
0:17:39 I mean all of us
0:17:41 look how fragile your world is
0:17:45 already
0:17:46 your quarter is frightened
0:17:49 dragging you into this meaningless games
0:17:54 this is your truth miles
0:17:58 I know that deep down you see how
0:18:03 fragile this chord is how fragile all
0:18:06 courts are
0:18:09 and you simply lack of the power to
0:18:12 enforce your will
0:18:15 I will afford to seeing how you deal
0:18:19 with this helplessness
0:18:21 the meekness that is the truth of yours
0:18:25 ordering
0:18:26 miles this isn't the time that I wanted
0:18:29 to have this discussion but she was
0:18:31 specifically offended the list is too
0:18:34 long we have to make some form of event
0:18:36 amends she was going to be specifically
0:18:38 offended regardless of what had happened
0:18:40 because it's in her interest to be
0:18:43 offended is that part of the background
0:18:44 I can't hear can you can you put her on
0:18:46 speaker too oh my God yeah
0:18:48 miles passes the phone over shakes his
0:18:51 head would you please put that on there
0:18:53 I can't do high-speed driving and switch
0:18:56 it over Brita takes it but does not
0:18:58 narrate that she's putting on
0:19:00 speakerphone
0:19:01 look I'm in agreeance with Miles and all
0:19:03 of this
0:19:04 look we we saved Elsa's life she knows
0:19:08 what she's doing she's she's the one
0:19:10 that's playing Hardball with us she's
0:19:12 trying to push you around because you're
0:19:14 a new Kindred and a new Embrace as far
0:19:16 as she sees wait till you get to court
0:19:18 get a better view of the uh of the
0:19:21 scenario
0:19:22 I don't think that Miles has actually
0:19:24 done anything that breaks any laws that
0:19:26 I'm aware of Reiss just has it out for
0:19:29 us and sounds like he's trying to make
0:19:30 some power plays so keep an eye on him I
0:19:33 think you mean Neil no I think Reiss is
0:19:35 trying to make Power plays right but I'm
0:19:37 saying Neil didn't break any laws right
0:19:39 right that's what I mean Neil didn't
0:19:40 break any laws uh so don't worry about
0:19:43 that just try to play Kate Elsa she's an
0:19:47 elder they're weird and old and get all
0:19:50 kinds of weird Notions about etiquette I
0:19:52 think this is the only way that we have
0:19:55 a working relationship with also moving
0:19:57 forward we saved her life and she owes
0:20:00 Anil a life Boon but she owes it angrily
0:20:03 and she has every tool that she would
0:20:05 ever need in order to make that so what
0:20:09 so so don't don't play hardball with her
0:20:11 go back to playing softball when you see
0:20:13 her give her compliments tell her how
0:20:15 pretty her dress is things like that
0:20:17 work with toriador all right there's is
0:20:21 the whole Cutlery has been and like
0:20:22 arguing and going back and forth Neil
0:20:24 has just been getting more and more
0:20:26 agitated in the back and then looks and
0:20:29 from the back seats like there's there
0:20:30 there's another option here what there
0:20:33 is another way out of all of this
0:20:35 you guys stop fighting over it miles
0:20:38 doesn't want anybody to be
0:20:39 in any sort of um debt to anyone uh and
0:20:45 the only reason that we are thinking
0:20:47 about being in debt to anyone is to get
0:20:51 me around the things that I've chosen to
0:20:54 do so
0:20:55 the other way around it is we just go to
0:20:57 court and I
0:20:59 tell them everything
0:21:02 and then
0:21:04 that's it then we don't have to talk to
0:21:06 anybody
0:21:08 then I I don't want you guys to get hurt
0:21:10 because of the things that I've been
0:21:12 doing
0:21:13 so if it's everyone like watching all of
0:21:18 you in each other's throats versus
0:21:19 versus just you know
0:21:21 me
0:21:24 eating whatever comes
0:21:26 that's not a hard decision for me
0:21:30 yeah but we're not gonna let that happen
0:21:32 but and I'm not against owing people
0:21:35 it's just this degree is egregious but
0:21:39 miles what
0:21:42 what if you just did because you
0:21:45 wouldn't be in this position if you
0:21:47 weren't working with us
0:21:49 specifically if you weren't you didn't
0:21:51 even know until like a month ago right
0:21:53 but you were still using your stuff your
0:21:57 magic to help us at various points and
0:22:01 the domain so it's one way to look at it
0:22:03 I mean you were probably doing it on
0:22:06 your own but you were using it more when
0:22:09 we started asking you to you want us to
0:22:11 think selfishly if we let you go down
0:22:14 for this each and every one of us who
0:22:16 has a pass is going down next all of us
0:22:19 who have something to lose are going
0:22:21 down next I I have stayed alive this
0:22:26 long by having no one look at me
0:22:29 and now that they're looking at me it
0:22:31 means they're looking at all of you too
0:22:33 because the rest of you can't not be
0:22:35 there but if I can just go away then no
0:22:41 one's looking at the recipe quite the
0:22:42 same way everyone needs to listen up
0:22:44 real carefully
0:22:45 you're all losing sight of what's
0:22:47 Happening Here
0:22:49 this is Reiss
0:22:51 coming at us
0:22:52 we stopped his play in Elysium and he
0:22:55 tried to kill us
0:22:57 didn't work there
0:22:59 and now he's making he made a play at
0:23:02 Marcos he's making a play at you now
0:23:04 this is just Rhys taking swings at us
0:23:08 get to court and defend yourselves
0:23:11 because it didn't work in in when we
0:23:13 actually fought him in physical combat
0:23:16 now he's trying to take it take swings
0:23:17 Us in the in the social game so keep
0:23:20 that in mind use your assets don't spend
0:23:22 any unnecessary life Boons and just play
0:23:26 it cool
0:23:27 you don't know what's happening just
0:23:29 like just like Miles said you're putting
0:23:31 the cart before the horse you don't know
0:23:33 what's happening until you actually get
0:23:35 to court I'm willing to take a look
0:23:38 around if we have the time but I don't
0:23:41 think we do I think we're showing up and
0:23:43 I think the court is going to be in a
0:23:45 rebel and I think immediately we're
0:23:47 going to go and have to talk to his
0:23:49 grace about all of this that's a great
0:23:51 Theory and I'm re I will be very sad if
0:23:54 it's the case but just be prepared to do
0:23:58 to take course on that it hasn't
0:24:00 happened yet Brita listen to Miles don't
0:24:04 put the cart before the horse the
0:24:06 Lamborghini arrives to Elysium
0:24:12 [Music]
0:24:16 outside I was already a crew of bully
0:24:18 boys and a tramir waiting to assist in
0:24:22 detaining the Rogue Thoma Church uh
0:24:26 before we got out of the car
0:24:28 miles
0:24:29 um
0:24:31 you're the sheriff so
0:24:33 go ahead and act like a sheriff
0:24:36 I'm
0:24:38 for these purposes
0:24:39 I think I mean if you're looking at what
0:24:42 Reddit was talking about what you were
0:24:43 talking about at the same page is that
0:24:45 neither one of you
0:24:46 should
0:24:48 um
0:24:48 be treating me like a friend right now
0:24:51 I get out of the Lamborghini move the
0:24:53 seat forward so that he can get out
0:24:55 Sheriff you're greeted politely as uh
0:24:59 they make their way to uh approach Neil
0:25:02 one already has like thick chain and
0:25:06 manacles and it does not look like the
0:25:11 that Neil is in for a very good time I
0:25:14 will stop them from putting his like I
0:25:17 are we stepping beyond your position
0:25:19 here I'm taking him in yes but my orders
0:25:22 of the prince he is to be bound and
0:25:24 detained in such a manner that he cannot
0:25:26 perform his uh disgusting Magics great
0:25:29 give me those
0:25:31 yes sir he kind of offers the chains and
0:25:34 then they give this like metal bit
0:25:37 that's supposed to be like put into his
0:25:39 mouth so that it his jaw is like locked
0:25:41 into place Neil has a very like it's a
0:25:45 weird look on his face that I think can
0:25:47 best be described as like a dog looking
0:25:49 at you like it's okay put me down well
0:25:52 we're gonna put them on though but we
0:25:54 don't have to do it in a rough manner
0:25:55 there's no reason we can't do it in the
0:25:57 easy going way and such that it doesn't
0:26:00 have to be like jamming it into him of
0:26:02 course uh Sheriff there's no reason to
0:26:04 indicate to this diablarist that uh we
0:26:07 are not civil people they kind of like
0:26:08 look almost like annoyed that you're oh
0:26:11 no kindness to Assamites I will put the
0:26:15 stuff on him they can yeah give me yeah
0:26:17 and then we'll go in yep and I will take
0:26:20 him with me uh they like stop you at the
0:26:22 door he has to go to the room you know
0:26:25 they kind of like look at gesture
0:26:26 towards Brita indicating it's the same
0:26:28 one that she had been put in a while ago
0:26:30 I'll bring him over to the room
0:26:33 and be like that should be
0:26:35 this should be good you're going to
0:26:37 stand outside this room yes sure uh well
0:26:40 the Trimmier going ahead and investigate
0:26:42 and determined the degree to which he is
0:26:44 influenced by his magic sounds like a
0:26:47 sheriff responsibility I didn't remember
0:26:48 making any bullets
0:26:50 the prince has made very clear his
0:26:53 intentions regarding Assamite Magic
0:26:56 all right
0:26:58 well give me five minutes before you go
0:27:00 in there uh we're going to go in there
0:27:02 and we thank you for understanding
0:27:04 Sheriff again we are not here to argue
0:27:07 or give you a hard time but when the
0:27:09 prince speaks
0:27:11 we do as he wishes
0:27:14 of course miles are you ready to go in
0:27:17 yeah as the two of you head over
0:27:21 um Reiss can be seen actually walking
0:27:23 past you and heading to the room Greta
0:27:26 makes eye contact with Miles he's not
0:27:29 looking at anyone
0:27:30 there is a tight fist to grab on his
0:27:33 current weapon Rhoda's eyes kind of drop
0:27:35 drop then down towards the katana which
0:27:38 takes in that grip looks some miles and
0:27:42 then slowly takes one step forward to
0:27:44 indicate to walk with her
0:27:46 oh wait Reiss is walking that way yes
0:27:48 Reiss is headed to the room that Neil is
0:27:50 in and then I'm heading towards the
0:27:51 prince yes the opposite directions you
0:27:54 guys are yeah but that's what I'm saying
0:27:56 he walks past you right that means he's
0:27:57 not with the prince currently right I'm
0:28:00 gonna talk with the prince all right do
0:28:02 what you think but I'm saying that she's
0:28:05 also not playing as well as she could I
0:28:08 understand and I appreciate you caring I
0:28:12 just it's a price I'm willing to pay
0:28:14 negotiate I'll try I like I said I'm not
0:28:18 against being indebted this is just a
0:28:21 way too far of a step and the only
0:28:23 reason I wanted that Boon in the first
0:28:24 place was to put her in a position
0:28:26 better position without Reiss being
0:28:28 around
0:28:29 but things are changing it didn't come
0:28:32 off that way miles well she was
0:28:34 insisting on a lot of stuff from us
0:28:35 after saving her she was insistent that
0:28:39 we repay her and give her many things
0:28:40 for saving her life and keeping her safe
0:28:43 in this domain
0:28:45 I'm gonna go talk to her yes I just
0:28:47 wanted you to be aware of things from my
0:28:50 perspective I know but and
0:28:55 but I need to play this a different way
0:28:57 miles I got it and I'm we need to make
0:29:00 our choices I get it but I need you to
0:29:02 be informed I know but what I'm going to
0:29:04 do is I'm gonna go over there and
0:29:05 apologize to her and I'm gonna pay the
0:29:08 life spoons
0:29:09 I'm gonna ask for her help and I'm gonna
0:29:12 make it clear that I'm grateful
0:29:13 that's my intention
0:29:15 I'm going to apologize for the codery
0:29:18 including you
0:29:21 all right but you'll be inviting more
0:29:23 trouble in the future
0:29:26 I hope not
0:29:27 see it's not even a hope and he'll just
0:29:30 move away and with that my trajectory is
0:29:32 towards whoever she is okay
0:29:35 [Music]
0:29:41 cut away to win and Johnny who have now
0:29:45 just pulled up to uh Neil's Haven
0:29:48 immediately the first thing you notice
0:29:51 is the police lights that are everywhere
0:29:54 and there are police officers all over
0:29:56 the place redirecting people within that
0:30:00 like perimeter that's been created by
0:30:03 nhpd you see some bully boys some of the
0:30:08 common visages worn by local Nosferatu
0:30:13 and you see members of the tremeer clan
0:30:15 they are like inside you kind of hear
0:30:19 the occasional like a shelf be like
0:30:22 knocked over some of the bully boys are
0:30:24 just kind of like knocking it's like the
0:30:26 bruja bully boys that were tight with
0:30:28 Shaw kind of knocking things down and
0:30:32 kind of like having a pretty good time
0:30:34 the police officers are kind of like not
0:30:36 blissfully unaware but kind of accepting
0:30:38 like you know this is like another day
0:30:40 on the job for them so I can see that
0:30:42 all of these uh bully boys are already
0:30:44 inside and there's New Haven Police that
0:30:47 have cordoned off the whole scene yes
0:30:50 win looks to Johnny
0:30:53 I'm following your lead man I have one
0:30:56 set of skills for this situation
0:30:58 I was really hoping we'd get here before
0:31:00 this happened but
0:31:02 wind kind of cracks her neck just in
0:31:05 anticipation of what's coming
0:31:09 do you have any poll with the police
0:31:11 I do know a guy in dispatch but I don't
0:31:13 think he's going to be able to pull all
0:31:14 of this away from here
0:31:16 I mean it's worth a shot if even if he
0:31:19 can thin it out some this place has
0:31:20 metal shutters we can pull them down and
0:31:22 take care of things inside if we need to
0:31:24 have enough of this area to work with
0:31:26 tell you what
0:31:28 I'm gonna drop you off here
0:31:30 I'm gonna go cause a distraction do you
0:31:33 just want me to be an owl that might
0:31:35 help
0:31:36 um I need you to be able to get in there
0:31:37 and make sure that that uh whatever's
0:31:40 going on in there stops going on in
0:31:42 there
0:31:43 um or if they draw off
0:31:45 I need you to be able to go in and at
0:31:48 least secure
0:31:50 the uh Neil's friend all right yeah nope
0:31:56 uh Johnny will pull up and uh let win
0:31:58 out win gets out
0:32:01 she kind of TAPS the door a couple times
0:32:03 in a move of solidarity and she just
0:32:05 kind of stands at the police barricade
0:32:07 pretending to be in onlooker give me a
0:32:10 perception plus alertness rule oh that's
0:32:13 really really good
0:32:16 foreign
0:32:17 you can kind of hear that there's some
0:32:19 sort of like conversation they're
0:32:21 interviewing someone in there but you
0:32:23 don't get a look at who when kind of
0:32:25 looks to the officers that are present
0:32:27 do they look like they're rookies or do
0:32:29 these look like veteran cops they look
0:32:31 like older cops a lot of them are kind
0:32:34 of a little bit out of shape they've got
0:32:36 that like that really kind of classic
0:32:40 1970s cop mustache going on uh these are
0:32:44 kind of the guys who are really kind of
0:32:46 thinking about their pension and
0:32:49 retiring Wynn kind of watches for a few
0:32:52 minutes and then kind of slips away down
0:32:54 an alley there's like a whistle as you
0:32:56 go but that's it what kind of whistle
0:32:58 like a police stop whistle or a hey lady
0:33:01 whistle it's like it's like a cat call
0:33:03 whistle she sticks up her middle finger
0:33:05 she walks away like there's some
0:33:06 clapping and like the cops can like joke
0:33:08 around with each other about their
0:33:09 sexual harassment they're a classy Bunch
0:33:11 you hear actually Johnny turn the truck
0:33:13 off when you notice that all the cops
0:33:16 are kind of on the doughy side in a
0:33:17 little bit like on the more retired edge
0:33:19 of things and he actually jumps out of
0:33:23 the truck and walks over to where you
0:33:25 are what's up I was gonna do something
0:33:27 stupid right but I'm thinking that we
0:33:29 might actually be able to play this a
0:33:30 little bit quieter okay why don't you
0:33:34 use that phone of yours and give Kabir a
0:33:35 call see if he's in the area some of him
0:33:38 his tricks might be were uh worth their
0:33:40 weight in gold right now I'm gonna go
0:33:42 see if I can't get past that Gordon okay
0:33:45 win pulls out her phone and dials
0:33:48 kabir's number that she inexplicably
0:33:50 hasn't deleted he answers immediately

0:34:58 oh my God
0:35:00 uh Johnny walks up to the uh to the
0:35:03 police Cordon
0:35:04 I feel like they're losing Kabir off
0:35:06 your sheet and slowly migrating over it
0:35:08 too I will give her those points
0:35:12 I'm fine with sharing custody
0:35:16 um
0:35:18 Johnny will walk up to the uh the cordon
0:35:20 and uh can I help you sir
0:35:23 yeah I'm actually a contact at Suarez's
0:35:26 they kind of look between each other and
0:35:28 he actually will just kind of put on a
0:35:31 confident Swagger and just kind of brush
0:35:34 past the cordon and start walking
0:35:36 towards the pawn shop
0:35:37 the cop rests his hand on his shoulder
0:35:39 hey I just want to say I'm sorry about
0:35:41 what happened to him and they kind of go
0:35:43 back to what they were doing but they
0:35:44 they do not stop you from going in
0:35:46 Johnny kind of like grits his teeth a
0:35:48 little bit and like
0:35:50 closes his eyes but then keeps on
0:35:52 walking right towards the uh the shop as
0:35:55 you head in uh you will know that the
0:35:57 Nosferatu primogen seems to kind of be
0:35:59 overseeing the investigation and that is
0:36:02 flanks is a pair of tremire they are in
0:36:07 the middle of interviewing a young woman
0:36:08 that they found in the pawn shop she has
0:36:12 dark skin
0:36:15 chocolate kind of like colored hair
0:36:17 hazel eyes and has this very like
0:36:21 tight-lipped aloof demeanor as they
0:36:26 interrogate her with a slew of clearly
0:36:30 offensive questions
0:36:33 do I recognize anyone from the Sheriff's
0:36:34 Office yeah there's like a half dozen
0:36:36 bully boys from the sheriff's office
0:36:37 here and are they just kind of like
0:36:39 standing around doing nothing no they're
0:36:41 they're knocking stuff over and a couple
0:36:44 of them have like rolled up these old
0:36:46 comic books and tucked them into their
0:36:47 back pocket they're just kind of being
0:36:49 like massive [ __ ] apparently though
0:36:54 you kind of start getting the impression
0:36:56 based on the conversations they're
0:36:57 having with each other the reason that
0:36:59 they're being massive [ __ ] is
0:37:01 because they fully believe that Neil is
0:37:04 in fact his sire and they all [ __ ]
0:37:07 hate him they believe it's hussar that
0:37:10 Neil your Neil is in fact Neil sire who
0:37:13 is a blood-hunted mulcavian who had
0:37:17 signed over to the blood cult that
0:37:20 controls alamut and is this like rampant
0:37:22 diablers to escape the blood hunt oh and
0:37:25 they think that he's the same person
0:37:26 that's what they're there for they're
0:37:28 there to look for signs of asamites and
0:37:32 or the like you know blood magic like
0:37:36 ritual components and it looks like
0:37:38 they're setting a bunch of stuff aside
0:37:40 and are interviewing an assemite
0:37:42 Johnny's going to put on his best
0:37:43 manager voice because he's I think he's
0:37:45 one of the more veteran bully boys in
0:37:47 the domain yes and he's going to be like
0:37:49 hey you lot drop the comics get your
0:37:53 [ __ ] asses out of this place now I
0:37:56 want the place cleared and I want a word
0:37:58 with him and he points at the Nosferatu
0:38:00 I kind of look between you and then
0:38:03 osferatu particularly the bruja that
0:38:07 were involved in the scuffle with
0:38:09 setites some time ago
0:38:12 they kind of give you guys space but
0:38:15 don't seem to leave the pawn shop just
0:38:18 because there's not a roof to throw one
0:38:20 of your asses off of don't mean I won't
0:38:22 punish you the same the Nosferatu looks
0:38:25 at you there is no need for hollow
0:38:28 threats
0:38:29 you smell like something I ate once I
0:38:32 don't think we've met name's Johnny
0:38:33 Saxon you may yet choke on it again and
0:38:37 he turns to the young woman that he's
0:38:40 interviewing and kind of snatches her up
0:38:42 by the neck and exerts some sort of
0:38:44 discipline and her eyes kind of like
0:38:46 goes soft
0:38:48 and her aloof demeanor kind of
0:38:52 crumbles and she becomes passive and
0:38:55 weak I understand you have some
0:38:57 questions he says like kind of sounding
0:39:00 more human because of the the mask that
0:39:03 he's wearing
0:39:04 what the hell are you doing here well
0:39:07 I'm here because I'm the scourge and
0:39:10 this young woman seems to be an
0:39:13 Uninvited Guest I see congratulations on
0:39:17 the uh promotion I guess
0:39:19 how do you enjoy working for uh Upton
0:39:22 Rollins well it's much like how you must
0:39:25 enjoy it say that I have an actual
0:39:27 position so who is this Uninvited Guest
0:39:31 it appears that this is young woman
0:39:34 traveled to New York
0:39:38 or was involved in some sort of uh trip
0:39:42 from Baghdad to New York she is an
0:39:45 Assamite and we have determined that she
0:39:48 is aware of the existence of both Neil
0:39:50 and hisiah
0:39:52 and
0:39:53 we also have determined that she is
0:39:57 familiar with the practices of Duran key
0:39:59 and
0:40:00 uh
0:40:02 soon
0:40:04 we will be able to confirm whether or
0:40:07 not
0:40:07 Neil learned his Duran key from Assamites
0:40:12 or some other
0:40:15 other worldly presence
0:40:18 well you can hand her over to me now
0:40:20 because I'm taking custody of her as
0:40:22 Scourge I have right of Destruction over
0:40:24 her and
0:40:26 uninvited Kindred fall directly under my
0:40:28 jurisdiction I'm sure you already know
0:40:30 that oh I do but I'm telling you you can
0:40:33 turn her over to me now you are welcome
0:40:36 to call your sheriff in fact there's no
0:40:39 need for a middleman call your sheriff
0:40:41 and have him contact me such as proper
0:40:43 and he kind of just turns away
0:40:46 I need a frenzy check do I actually do
0:40:48 friends make a frenzy check for that
0:40:50 because I was going to Banter more with
0:40:51 him he is specifically daring you to
0:40:53 attack him yes is he using gunpower to
0:40:55 provoke me he is doing something that
0:40:57 falls under a frenzy check on the chart
0:40:59 fair enough
0:41:03 two successes
0:41:04 three because you have uh the bonus is
0:41:07 it difficulty eight was that it's
0:41:08 difficulty eight and then drops down to
0:41:10 six perfect so three successes hey look
0:41:12 here [ __ ] just because you got handed
0:41:15 a position doesn't mean that you run
0:41:17 things around here the sheriff already
0:41:19 sent me here so hand me over the girl
0:41:22 or
0:41:24 I can collect some more Nosferatu teeth
0:41:27 so here is how this is going to go
0:41:31 you are not going to interfere with the
0:41:35 workings of this domain I'm going to pot
0:41:38 and slam him in the face and knock his
0:41:40 teeth out okay that's just runs of
0:41:41 combat yep
0:41:43 I'm going to interrupt him saying this
0:41:45 is how this is going to go uh initiative
0:41:47 19.
0:41:48 okay at the top of the initiative is one
0:41:52 of the two premier that are with him oh
0:41:54 and they're going on a 23 they uh the
0:41:58 warm age Burns for Celerity and we'll
0:42:00 reach out to grab you
0:42:02 okay
0:42:03 are you doing anything in response
0:42:05 nope
0:42:09 they have six successes to grab you I
0:42:11 guess I'm grabbed and then he will take
0:42:14 three traits of blood from your pool
0:42:16 okay
0:42:18 um and uh the difficulty to resist
0:42:20 frenzy increases by three
0:42:24 uh it is your turn okay so I'm in a
0:42:26 grapple yes I mean I cannot uh throw the
0:42:29 punch I intended to throw right he's
0:42:31 pulling you away and you your your body
0:42:33 like sizzles as uh uh your veins like
0:42:38 blackened and they're definitely using
0:42:40 magic to rip blood from your body in
0:42:42 fact uh what they are doing is they're
0:42:44 expending uh those three successes
0:42:47 towards blood rage are going to be used
0:42:49 to make you suffer a massive nosebleed
0:42:53 as you find yourself spending blood to
0:42:55 blend in with humanity and like bleed
0:42:57 Johnny is going to reverse the grapple
0:43:01 and basically announced did clantromere
0:43:04 just attack the sheriff's office so
0:43:07 that's going to be a brawl plus strength
0:43:09 yes you had to come uh
0:43:13 five successes
0:43:15 okay uh are you reversing or Breaking
0:43:17 Free
0:43:19 um I think maybe I'll just break free
0:43:20 okay yeah you push the little nerd off
0:43:23 of you uh pretty easily yeah and he's
0:43:26 just kind of kind of he's gonna kind of
0:43:27 basically uh stop his combat pose and
0:43:31 just be like did Clan Premiere just
0:43:33 attack a member of the Sheriff's Office
0:43:34 you should probably call the sheriff and
0:43:36 let him know he kind of says like with
0:43:38 an eye roll is anybody else taking any
0:43:39 combat actions uh when when you stop uh
0:43:43 taking aggressive actions they just kind
0:43:44 of hold I'm just kind of waiting a
0:43:46 holding pattern for initiative to
0:43:48 continue what do any of the other bruja
0:43:50 members of the Sheriff's Office do they
0:43:53 look thrilled that you're frustrated
0:43:57 like all of the people that used to be
0:43:59 loyal to Shaw feel like this is like
0:44:02 justice for the whole set type thing
0:44:04 okay it's like this group might have
0:44:07 been hand-picked well if you're not
0:44:09 going to give me the girl then the rest
0:44:11 of you can at least get the hell out of
0:44:12 here
0:44:13 the I know for a fact that you as the
0:44:15 scourge do not have right to be just
0:44:17 walking around in another kindreds
0:44:18 domain that is actually specifically the
0:44:21 part that a Scourge is granted uh kind
0:44:23 of like Smiles not not us not a kindred
0:44:27 that's been given domain in this city
0:44:28 actually as a matter of fact it is is it
0:44:30 yeah it's part of my job to quietly
0:44:31 monitor the local Kindred and ensure
0:44:33 that they're not embracing people
0:44:34 without permission and you can just
0:44:35 simply break domain that way yeah well
0:44:37 only the prince's domain actually
0:44:39 matters he kind of like you know relaxes
0:44:42 and yeah I actually have
0:44:45 um
0:44:46 the exact power I need to do what I need
0:44:48 to do here
0:44:52 and it's okay and what is exactly that
0:44:54 you need to do here kind of shrugs
0:44:56 whistles and uh kind of waves his index
0:45:00 finger around and the bruja that used to
0:45:03 be loyal to Shaw demonstrate their
0:45:05 loyalty to this Nosferatu and they
0:45:08 collect uh all of these strange red
0:45:11 plants that they found uh Tupperware
0:45:13 containers and he drags they're such a
0:45:18 their satai their asamite prisoner by
0:45:20 her hair and he starts walking out I
0:45:23 figure you might need some time to think
0:45:24 so we're gonna clear out
0:45:26 that's all right you at least won your
0:45:28 fight with my sire right and he just
0:45:30 walks past
0:45:32 one of the bra kind of turns around
0:45:33 points finger guns at Johnny and he's
0:45:35 like hey man heard about the Haven raid
0:45:38 sorry about that
0:45:40 all right Johnny frenzies all right
0:45:46 I feel like in a frenzy he's going to be
0:45:48 going for the Nosferatu though yeah the
0:45:50 actual the The primogen Scourge yeah all
0:45:54 right so uh bruja one is type for
0:45:58 19.2 is uh is at 14. uh so what are you
0:46:03 looking to do he's gonna try and grab
0:46:06 the the Nosferatu okay Lex let me know
0:46:09 when either Kabir shows up or when win
0:46:11 can get involved in this okay yeah Kabir
0:46:14 is definitely on his way but uh things
0:46:16 kind of things have gone sideways but
0:46:18 but let me know if when hears this if
0:46:21 this is something she can intervene in
0:46:23 any way I mean wind definitely hears the
0:46:26 the altercation that broke out and uh
0:46:29 the cops are kind of like nervously
0:46:31 looking around hoping that things don't
0:46:33 suddenly explode and then you hear it
0:46:35 all explode so yeah if you want you can
0:46:36 just roll initiative and join in
0:46:39 whatever works for you
0:46:41 I'm going on a 14 when it comes up okay
0:46:43 so he's taking priority over me and the
0:46:45 Brew home tied with uh you that's why I
0:46:47 asked okay yeah so he will he will grab
0:46:49 the uh I'll split my action okay
0:46:53 um I will grab the uh the Nosferatu
0:46:56 um and I will sink my teeth into him
0:46:59 okay are you biting for damage or defeat
0:47:03 oh let's play for damage okay
0:47:07 uh he's gonna Dodge I will spend a point
0:47:09 of willpower
0:47:11 six successes to grab uh he will Dodge
0:47:14 you with six successes to dodge uh the
0:47:16 other Brewhouse is gonna attempt to
0:47:17 Grapple yep
0:47:20 one success to Grapple grappled when
0:47:23 when is going to
0:47:25 oh God this is not her forte she is
0:47:29 gonna run in and she is gonna grab
0:47:30 Johnny okay I can go ahead and make a
0:47:33 DEX brawl I'm not using
0:47:35 for the record
0:47:37 Johnny from the inside out
0:47:41 there was like cat affection
0:47:45 four successes okay uh with four
0:47:48 successes uh you wrap your arms around
0:47:52 uh Johnny you can feel it is like it is
0:47:56 like hugging a horse and trying to push
0:47:59 it back when it really wants to go
0:48:01 forward no I'm anticipating going for a
0:48:03 ride so you're not you're not sure how
0:48:04 long you're gonna hold on but for the
0:48:06 moment you grab Johnny and she's just
0:48:08 gonna whisper Johnny stop
0:48:11 the second bruja kind of like
0:48:15 looks like he wants to like try to
0:48:16 Sucker Punch you but seems to kind of
0:48:19 like reconsider yeah she's not focused
0:48:23 on any other [ __ ] except for the one
0:48:24 in her codery
0:48:27 good girl
0:48:29 uh so yeah and around basically the uh
0:48:33 brujar kind of like
0:48:35 they put their hands up not really
0:48:37 wanting to tussle with two members of
0:48:38 the codery but there's still a raging
0:48:42 Johnny that may not let them leave uh so
0:48:46 why don't we start with uh Johnny you're
0:48:49 currently in a grapple uh so you would
0:48:51 have to break out of
0:48:53 um being held and she just keeps
0:48:55 Whispering Johnny please stop Johnny is
0:48:58 it just winds grappling me or is it both
0:49:00 of her and the bruja uh when when grabs
0:49:03 you yeah they back off okay they're like
0:49:06 you know willing to be tough when they
0:49:07 have like the numbers Advantage but like
0:49:09 if they don't they kind of when you're
0:49:11 bruh you're probably gonna control the
0:49:13 fight but the moment you don't you're
0:49:15 just dead
0:49:17 it's probably not worth the risk they
0:49:19 don't know that I'm not above using
0:49:20 claws on other camerians no they
0:49:23 actually specifically seem to think
0:49:25 you're not above using closet camera
0:49:26 lens uh largely based on the last
0:49:28 Gangrel primigen who just never showed
0:49:30 up one day
0:49:31 um so he will uh try to take two actions
0:49:34 he'll try to throw her off so that he
0:49:35 can once again re-establish grapple on
0:49:37 the uh the NOS okay
0:49:41 five successes to break out of the
0:49:42 grapple
0:49:43 all right
0:49:46 I got three successes and three ones oh
0:49:50 that like overpowering that you sensed
0:49:53 was about to happen
0:49:55 and uh you do not hold on to the Bowl as
0:49:58 it goes forward
0:49:59 is he still able to be uh is Johnny
0:50:01 still able to clear distance to grab him
0:50:04 or is that going to be clearing the
0:50:05 distance going to be his other half of
0:50:07 the action uh do you have leap with some
0:50:08 bounds I do it Leaps and Bounds so then
0:50:10 no okay
0:50:15 only two successes this time
0:50:16 uh he will weave out of the way
0:50:19 enough successes to dodge him yeah he
0:50:20 has five successes too weave out of the
0:50:23 way one of the the first of the bar is
0:50:25 going to hold his actions like you you
0:50:26 need to get your friend into control
0:50:28 he's freaking out no [ __ ]
0:50:31 thanks Captain Obvious
0:50:34 uh when did your go oh we're gonna do a
0:50:36 thing win is not at all good at
0:50:39 Wynn puts herself in Johnny's path and
0:50:42 glares him in the eyes and says you do
0:50:44 not scare me Johnny Saxon stand the [ __ ]
0:50:47 down
0:50:48 and she's going to attempt to intimidate
0:50:49 him okay uh this is going to be a uh
0:50:53 your charisma an intimidation versus
0:50:56 Johnny's willpower is that the
0:50:58 difficulty or am I rolling about you are
0:51:00 rolling will power in a contested role
0:51:02 current willpower uh you were rolling
0:51:03 your total power and a contested role
0:51:07 I am spending a willpower what a time to
0:51:09 roll poorly one success
0:51:12 don't roll once two successes okay three
0:51:15 three counting the willpower hell yeah
0:51:17 Johnny yeah um the Beast is very
0:51:21 difficult to frighten but you're given
0:51:25 just This Moment of clarity
0:51:27 with your friend
0:51:29 kind of becoming the focus of your
0:51:31 frenzy now and offering a Moment of
0:51:34 clarity where you can kind of see her
0:51:37 trying to like cow your Beast you may
0:51:41 spend a point of power and real
0:51:42 self-control Johnny will uh he will roll
0:51:44 self-control to try and actually break
0:51:46 out of the uh out of the frenzy then
0:51:48 since he really doesn't want to destroy
0:51:50 win I will spend the uh point of
0:51:52 willpower to make the roll and I'll
0:51:54 spend a further point of willpower to
0:51:56 make sure I have a success because I
0:51:58 don't think I'm Gonna Roll a 10.
0:52:00 [Music]
0:52:01 yeah no tens but the point of willpower
0:52:03 will give me one success okay so what
0:52:06 this means is for the round you are in
0:52:09 control of your actions you are still in
0:52:11 frenzy which means that in order to end
0:52:15 the frenzy the subject of your frenzy
0:52:17 needs to be outside of your awareness
0:52:19 when you need to leave just leave me in
0:52:21 here
0:52:22 Johnny holds his beast but it's very
0:52:25 clear that he's wrestling with it right
0:52:27 now I'm proud of you Johnny and she gets
0:52:30 outside okay
0:52:32 the door to the pawn shop is shut and
0:52:36 Johnny begins to come too alone in this
0:52:40 like dark trashed pawn shop wind kind of
0:52:43 stands outside patting her pockets for a
0:52:45 cigarette she doesn't find any she has
0:52:47 half a broken joint but nothing that she
0:52:50 could actually smoke at the moment the
0:52:52 uh there's a woman that is brought out
0:52:55 by the Nosferatu she's kind of stuffed
0:52:58 into the back seat of a squad car and
0:53:01 and the trunk they lay out all this like
0:53:04 pieces of Tupperware and like potted odd
0:53:07 plants and they closed the trunk of the

0:56:32 tramir getting out of the car yeah he

0:57:22 in season two there has been Carnage
0:57:27 and Kabir comes out and helps uh six
0:57:29 successes to hit him uh success you
0:57:32 actually get plus two because you're
0:57:33 like behind him and I actually forgot to
0:57:35 roll my Celerity
0:57:37 oh my god well I rolled two more ones
0:57:40 only uh
0:57:42 um only seven successes to hit him okay
0:57:45 uh six will carry over into damage I'll
0:57:47 spend a point of uh blood for potence
0:57:50 Johnny don't kill him
0:57:52 if he dies from a punch he deserves to
0:57:54 die
0:57:56 only seven levels of damage okay he is
0:57:59 two successes on soak five are all over
0:58:01 and you thump in the back of the head
0:58:03 his face smashes into like where the the
0:58:07 dashboard area is and the airbag goes
0:58:10 off
0:58:11 um he reaches around and unlocks the
0:58:13 door for the back for the uh for where
0:58:14 the woman is okay uh she uh is a little
0:58:19 kind of like frightened and out of it it
0:58:22 looks like she wants to go with you but
0:58:24 does not possess the strength of will to
0:58:26 kind of like take the make the act of
0:58:29 getting out of the car and going with
0:58:31 you so you kind of have to like I reach
0:58:33 it and grab her and pull her out yeah my
0:58:35 name is Johnny I'm a friend of Niels
0:58:37 that's when that's Kabir they're also
0:58:39 friends would you like to come with me I
0:58:42 would like that very much Kabir do you
0:58:43 have wheels yes of course my friend come
0:58:46 to my van we'll leave together we'll
0:58:48 take your vehicle out of here and he
0:58:51 leads you to this like gaudy van that
0:58:56 has frankly unrealistic amounts of
0:59:00 detail on the like ridiculous [ __ ]
0:59:03 decals and like painted animals and like
0:59:07 there's like a seagull that's there with
0:59:09 like big old eyes and
0:59:12 inside there's like a collection of like
0:59:16 gold chains that hang from underneath
0:59:19 the mirror please this way he opens the
0:59:22 door and kind of like gives like a
0:59:24 bowing gesture extending his hands uh
0:59:27 towards uh when to help her into the van
0:59:30 okay wind just takes the hand and uses
0:59:33 it to help her up into the van she
0:59:34 doesn't need to take you to see what
0:59:36 we're the I'm sorry did the uh did the
0:59:38 the plants all go in the squad car as
0:59:40 well they are in the trunk
0:59:42 um would have seen that happen uh while
0:59:45 he's Gathering up the woman she gathers
0:59:47 up the plants perfect I will Frisk the
0:59:50 tremeer's pockets to see if there's any
0:59:52 other evidence in there I there is uh
0:59:55 they're like these little bags of like
0:59:57 rolled up Khalif that have been kind of
1:00:00 like absconded with by the tremire well
1:00:02 that will go in Johnny's pockets and uh
1:00:06 they will abscond away into kabir's van
1:00:11 okay we've touched a butt here so what
1:00:14 are we gonna do now
1:00:15 I was thinking we might be able to
1:00:18 run nevue at my place
1:00:21 gather our thoughts and
1:00:24 it's not a bad idea computer time
1:00:26 together just so you know the new
1:00:28 scourge of the city is a Nosferatu that
1:00:31 has no love for me and would probably
1:00:33 love to lash out of my friends so you
1:00:35 need to be extra careful as you're as
1:00:37 you're [ __ ] around here yeah
1:00:42 oh this is not good for my business
1:00:46 short kid I won't just kill him like we
1:00:49 did his pie like how to like punches
1:00:52 your arms like a little bit
1:00:54 come here keeping it real
1:00:58 yeah it's done us a world of good that's
1:01:01 only because you haven't gotten the job
1:01:02 done yet
1:01:03 kill this [ __ ] and I can go back
1:01:05 to business and also win would be much
1:01:08 happier and I don't worry would not be
1:01:10 much happier
1:01:11 yeah yeah
1:01:13 all right so now we have I'm I'm sorry
1:01:16 ma'am what's your name Nara all right
1:01:19 now we have Nara who we've just taken
1:01:21 from the scourge
1:01:23 she kind of like shifts away from the
1:01:24 rap nose figuring out what the [ __ ] he
1:01:26 is well we took we took him from the uh
1:01:29 from the tremeer to be fair but point
1:01:32 taken we are messing with the scourge at
1:01:33 this point a Scourge who as you've said
1:01:36 has no love for you and probably me
1:01:38 hmm
1:01:41 this is the guy you at who was asking
1:01:43 about me and what I did with Shaw yep
1:01:44 well
1:01:45 I can only think of one One Direction
1:01:47 that that relationship is going to go
1:01:48 into
1:01:50 all right well let's Kabir you get us to
1:01:53 your place and we'll uh I don't think
1:01:54 that's a good idea no no if he's a
1:01:57 Nosferatu he'll figure out where Kabir
1:01:58 lives if we go there we could leave we
1:02:01 could leave the city what about the
1:02:03 anarchs that's kind of what I was
1:02:05 thinking I know that they're having a
1:02:06 lot of problems with the satellites and
1:02:08 uh lately though wouldn't it be handy if
1:02:10 we gave them some help
1:02:12 tell you what I'm gonna call the old man
1:02:14 he'll he I think he's currently hanging
1:02:16 out amongst the anarchs and if not he'll
1:02:19 know a good place to go I like that idea
1:02:21 can I borrow your phone will I get it
1:02:23 back
1:02:25 I think so okay
1:02:27 and Wynn hands her phone over to Johnny
1:02:29 Johnny will call Weathers
1:02:34 [Music]
1:02:37 miles you make a way to where a number
1:02:41 of very nervous Kindred who are kind of
1:02:46 it's kind of evident that they are
1:02:49 frightened of Neil and Upton is visibly
1:02:55 pacing when he sees miles he is oh thank
1:02:58 goodness miles
1:03:00 the sheriff is needed where were you I
1:03:03 was dealing with the matter at home I
1:03:04 came as soon as I heard
1:03:08 the senatorial attempted to police call
1:03:09 to you we didn't get an answer we were
1:03:11 very concerned that
1:03:13 kneel or bison had forgotten to you
1:03:16 there was a mishap with my phone
1:03:18 that's the only reason why I did not
1:03:21 answer the Summons of the court at first
1:03:24 very good
1:03:25 may we talk without
1:03:27 so you can get me up to date without
1:03:29 giving more Panic to the court
1:03:32 yes uh there are a handful of matters of
1:03:36 politics that we must resolve uh right
1:03:38 away like gives he gives Brita this like
1:03:42 dirty [ __ ] glare she looks dismayed
1:03:46 and looks back at
1:03:48 miles I understand things have been very
1:03:50 difficult for you but together miles we
1:03:54 will maintain my Throne let's go he
1:03:56 follows along with him when you go into
1:03:58 the other room he kind of gives you a
1:03:59 hug I'm a little taken aback but I
1:04:01 return it uh miles I need your help
1:04:05 um I understand that your friend
1:04:07 needs to die but under he is an
1:04:10 infiltrator against your quotery and I'm
1:04:12 going to take care of you
1:04:14 but there are more important matters at
1:04:17 hand I mean that's one of the factors of
1:04:20 Boston wrote me a letter
1:04:22 indicating that he has given
1:04:24 acknowledgment
1:04:26 to an asset of our corn
1:04:29 and everyone now knows that he has done
1:04:31 this
1:04:32 the wolves are at our door miles
1:04:35 laughs
1:04:40 I mean
1:04:42 we should stop and look at it I we
1:04:44 understand that but he is a mulcavian
1:04:46 yes I know
1:04:48 I mean I mean the only way to do it is
1:04:52 if you decide miles were you about to
1:04:54 say how much damage can a mulcavian do
1:04:57 when we just had to dispatch half the
1:04:59 court to detain the asamite malkavian
1:05:02 who has returned to this domain no doubt
1:05:04 to consume our very Souls
1:05:07 okay they're two separate things but I
1:05:10 do his hug is like very tight at that
1:05:11 point but he eventually let's go thank
1:05:13 you Prince but one we could just
1:05:17 acknowledge her and pretend that
1:05:18 whatever he said didn't matter what
1:05:20 miles everyone knows y'all look at me
1:05:24 like I am some buffoon
1:05:27 and that's why we can go around and
1:05:29 pretend that what this mulcavian did
1:05:32 didn't matter no it mattered I've read
1:05:35 the letter myself and ever since I
1:05:38 couldn't stop thinking of the Damned
1:05:39 letter but how many other people know
1:05:41 that
1:05:42 have you told anyone
1:05:43 yes of course I told everyone as soon as
1:05:45 I got here and I warned them to not
1:05:47 speak of it or I will blood on them very
1:05:50 good so
1:05:52 we can handle this
1:05:54 and what exactly would we do if Brita
1:05:56 attempts to take the throne now that she
1:05:58 has been acknowledged by another Prince
1:06:00 she's not going to Miles you were the
1:06:03 only one who I thought might understand
1:06:04 me I do and my codery is loyal you run
1:06:08 if you were not doing what I want you to
1:06:10 do miles you're clearly not
1:06:11 understanding me what did you want me to
1:06:14 do I want you to obviously go kill this
1:06:17 imposter of Neil go kill Brita go warn
1:06:20 the rest of domain that they're never to
1:06:22 speak of this again and kill them if
1:06:23 they do friends don't you think this
1:06:25 might be a tax from Pendragon to weaken
1:06:28 our domain yes and I will not stand for
1:06:30 it wipe them out the attacks are
1:06:32 specifically made to weaken Accord by
1:06:35 white yes I understand what you're
1:06:36 saying miles wipe them out
1:06:39 can we take it a breath
1:06:41 or he takes breath and he starts pacing
1:06:42 and like you can kind of see like bloody
1:06:45 tears welling up in his eyes
1:06:47 are at our door miles why do you not see
1:06:51 that I believe you may be under the
1:06:53 effects of something that was on that
1:06:55 letter yes miles I am deeply offended by
1:06:58 the ink that was applied to that letter
1:07:00 by my nemesis
1:07:03 we must begin the killing Purge
1:07:07 these actions will do nothing besides
1:07:09 give the domain to Pendragon miles
1:07:12 listen to me all right I'm going to say
1:07:15 this as slowly as possible so that you
1:07:17 can understand what I'm saying
1:07:19 I received a word
1:07:21 from my contacts my spot I have space
1:07:24 everywhere miles I know everything and
1:07:27 those spies informed me the Premier
1:07:30 discovered that Neil is capable of
1:07:32 Blasphemous asamite diablary magic and
1:07:36 it became quite evident that the Neil
1:07:40 that returned to New York was in fact
1:07:42 not Neil and it was in fact his sire who
1:07:44 practices these filthy Magics so I
1:07:47 dispatched everyone I could to get rid
1:07:49 of him and deal with all of these
1:07:52 problems because I will not have them
1:07:53 miles I cannot have these problems I am
1:07:56 in the midst of so much politics right
1:07:59 now you cannot begin to understand my
1:08:00 problems you're correct I cannot begin
1:08:03 to understand your problems but thank
1:08:05 you for understanding miles I wish you
1:08:07 would come to me as a fellow Venture and
1:08:09 I know that I did that is what we are
1:08:10 doing iron circling right before you
1:08:13 would start dispatching these things
1:08:14 because
1:08:15 I am here and you are my Sheriff I am
1:08:19 here but
1:08:20 who gave you that information it wasn't
1:08:22 just your spies that had made all those
1:08:24 determinations it was absolutely my
1:08:26 spice was it also possibly coming
1:08:29 through Reiss
1:08:31 Reiss is the one who maintains my spice
1:08:33 right
1:08:36 what a stupid question
1:08:38 you're correct I did not have that
1:08:40 information
1:08:41 well now you know
1:08:43 but so now you know that the information
1:08:45 is completely legitimate we must act
1:08:48 since you're the attempt at taking your
1:08:50 throne
1:08:51 Reiss has been doing more and more and
1:08:55 more miles he said he's not going to do
1:08:57 that anymore but he is making all of the
1:09:00 phone calls to me from you yes I asked
1:09:02 him to make I I don't understand phones
1:09:05 I make him do all of my phone calls and
1:09:08 sometimes she dials for me and passes it
1:09:10 over when I wish to exert my authority
1:09:13 but otherwise yes of course I ever used
1:09:15 to everything and all of these actions
1:09:17 he is
1:09:18 taking away from your grandeur
1:09:21 he is undermining your domain
1:09:24 by using your name
1:09:25 miles
1:09:27 I need you to understand me I need you
1:09:29 to understand me all right
1:09:31 he would not do that we are friends
1:09:34 if you are friends he wouldn't hold the
1:09:36 Boon over you
1:09:37 why not because that's not how friends
1:09:40 operate
1:09:42 okay have you ever done anything where
1:09:44 he has threatened to take use that Boon
1:09:47 instead of doing what you wanted my
1:09:48 spoons are exactly how I made most of my
1:09:51 friends
1:09:52 well Prince you we don't have a boon
1:09:54 between us
1:09:55 you're right you kind of like Narrows
1:09:57 his eyes well we are friends
1:10:00 I am here and I have saved your throne
1:10:03 you are my most willing
1:10:06 killer
1:10:08 nightmare that in you
1:10:10 I've done a lot for this domain
1:10:12 Brita Must Die
1:10:15 continuing down this road will just lead
1:10:17 to disaster fine
1:10:19 then I'll fix it another way miles why
1:10:22 don't you go take care of the Assamites
1:10:23 and makivian convert probably actually
1:10:27 an Assamite and I will take care of Brita
1:10:30 are you not willing to listen to me I
1:10:33 have listened to you I thought we just
1:10:34 came to an agreement no you've said
1:10:36 things and then made fine miles say what
1:10:39 you think we should do instead of me
1:10:42 I am offering suggestions as ventured
1:10:45 event true should we not be listening
1:10:47 and coming together to promote ourselves
1:10:50 and the clan Above All Else miles what
1:10:53 cousin I imploreth I eat
1:10:55 bro [ __ ] the wolves are at the door you
1:10:58 must secure my domain
1:11:01 any way possible
1:11:03 why are you asking me that you're kind
1:11:05 of like shifts like his Demeter changing
1:11:08 the moment he realized he never had
1:11:09 Boons on you
1:11:11 because your domain is an assault from
1:11:13 things you're not seeming to believe
1:11:16 when I tell you
1:11:18 so what uses my help if you don't listen
1:11:20 to the things that I'm trying to help
1:11:22 you with well perhaps if you worked on
1:11:24 things that you weren't just clearly
1:11:26 obsessed with in conspiracy theories
1:11:28 we'll be able to get more done he like
1:11:31 sasses you
1:11:32 at this point it's incredibly clear that
1:11:34 though Upton was always kind of like not
1:11:37 all there this dude is not here tonight
1:11:40 is there anything I can do about that
1:11:43 well you don't want to kill oh oh uh to
1:11:46 help his mind yeah
1:11:48 uh I mean you're not entirely sure
1:11:52 unfortunately there's probably one dude
1:11:54 in the cutlery who might be able to help
1:11:56 with something like that and he's Bound
1:11:58 in irons in a closet no you can't just
1:12:00 punch him yeah I can
1:12:02 I promise you I can't just slap the
1:12:06 stupid right out how dare you
1:12:09 miles
1:12:11 we've known each other for a long time
1:12:14 I'm not going to kill Brita for you
1:12:18 but I need you
1:12:20 to go out there
1:12:22 and make sure everyone respects me
1:12:25 and also I need it to be figured out
1:12:28 whether or not this impersonator always
1:12:31 let's be honest Nick Miles he is very
1:12:34 likely an impersonator
1:12:35 we need to verify a is in fact not an
1:12:39 impersonator and if he is an
1:12:40 impersonator and again miles he is very
1:12:42 likely to be an impersonator
1:12:45 I give you the right of amaranth
1:12:47 destroy him utterly
1:12:50 teach those asamites a lesson
1:12:53 I think I can do these things for you
1:12:56 thank you I need to go to a meeting uh
1:12:58 because I I was told by Elsa and then
1:13:02 she has an urgent meeting with me that
1:13:04 she needs to do and has some important
1:13:06 news
1:13:07 um so if you'll excuse me I must wait
1:13:10 for her
1:13:12 also
1:13:13 before you go
1:13:15 he approaches his desk opens his store
1:13:18 and sets out
1:13:19 a like small glass probably Crystal
1:13:24 actually like container of perfume I was
1:13:28 thinking I might offer this to Elsa
1:13:30 what do you think of it I take a look at
1:13:33 it and examine it with my it's kind of
1:13:35 gaudy but a lot of diamonds and
1:13:38 Crystal
1:13:39 so it's acceptable but it's definitely
1:13:41 his style yeah I mean she will probably
1:13:44 smile and not but she's not getting
1:13:46 entrance by it right I believe it is an
1:13:49 excellent representation of your
1:13:52 intentions excellent
1:13:56 this is why you work for me miles now go
1:13:59 and force my will and again
1:14:02 is there any way we can hold off on any
1:14:03 judgments until at least maybe tomorrow
1:14:05 night
1:14:06 just to make sure there's no reason to
1:14:08 weaken the domain we're vampires we have
1:14:10 all the time
1:14:11 hmm
1:14:13 but that would that make me seem weak
1:14:14 and indecisive no you're looking into
1:14:17 matters you're making sure that your
1:14:19 domain and your people are taken care of
1:14:20 without needless accusations like that
1:14:23 to make them think I'm taking care of
1:14:25 them go forth miles
1:14:27 you're Grace uh but I'm we're definitely
1:14:29 going to kill him tomorrow
1:14:31 well we're gonna kill an impersonator
1:14:33 tomorrow
1:14:34 yes there we go good announce that too
1:14:37 and he kind of like goes off to find
1:14:40 Elsa
1:14:44 [Music]
1:14:48 meanwhile Beretta is looking for Elsa
1:14:51 but I'm not sure if she's findable
1:14:53 considering everything that was just
1:14:55 said uh Elsa is in no rush to meet the
1:14:57 prince yeah okay
1:14:59 she's sort of uh sits she relaxes she's
1:15:04 accompanied by a throng of other
1:15:08 toriador who are kind of like clearly
1:15:11 most of those stories are very nervous
1:15:13 about what Neil like the horrors Neil is
1:15:16 going to do to them if he gets free yeah
1:15:18 but uh Elsa seems relaxed and when you
1:15:22 approach she kind of Pats the seat next
1:15:25 to her and she begins talking about
1:15:28 music that she wrote quite some time ago
1:15:31 that she thinks she would appreciate and
1:15:33 begins to kind of explain that she would
1:15:35 like you
1:15:36 to learn some of the sheet music that
1:15:41 she has prepared and in reality she
1:15:43 talks to you about something totally
1:15:44 different and what she says to you is
1:15:48 I'm becoming less confident that your
1:15:51 quanary is genuinely interested in
1:15:54 helping myself
1:15:56 weathers and many of the others who
1:16:00 stuck our necks out for you and I am not
1:16:03 going to tolerate being pushed again so
1:16:07 I hope you understand why I require this
1:16:11 demonstration of humility Brita sits
1:16:15 delicately when in the spot exactly as
1:16:17 she's indicated to and when she said she
1:16:21 mirrors Elsa's posture say if Elsa has
1:16:24 her ankles crossed vertical will do so
1:16:27 too
1:16:28 and she sits with the attentiveness of a
1:16:31 student but is her head is tilted as
1:16:34 she's understanding the true message
1:16:36 that she's receiving she picks her words
1:16:38 carefully
1:16:40 I understand
1:16:42 I'm sorry that I'm still a student
1:16:46 the mistakes that
1:16:48 I make I
1:16:50 you don't deserve them and I apologize
1:16:52 for them
1:16:54 she's clearly picking her words to talk
1:16:56 like past the crowd and to speak vaguely
1:17:00 and
1:17:01 if myself
1:17:03 and another could benefit from what you
1:17:06 have to teach
1:17:08 from the help that you've given you
1:17:10 deserve that confidence
1:17:13 I've seen the ways that you've helped us
1:17:15 I
1:17:16 helped me
1:17:18 and
1:17:19 you shouldn't have to feel
1:17:22 like
1:17:23 it's a stretch
1:17:25 I respect what you could teach
1:17:29 there's a not of understanding
1:17:32 one of the other Torah kind of gives you
1:17:34 this big hug and she's like you've been
1:17:36 through so much Greta does hug back
1:17:39 she's a little reserved uh she's looking
1:17:41 down and her posture remains very demure
1:17:44 uh very submissive not quite looking at
1:17:47 the other torador but looking
1:17:50 devoting all of her attention in this
1:17:52 moment to Elsa uh when anyone else
1:17:55 intervenes she maintains like in every
1:17:58 element like her body faces towards Elsa
1:18:02 uh that thing where her knees are
1:18:04 pointed towards her as she speaks and
1:18:07 when the hug is through she remains like
1:18:10 in that submissive posture
1:18:13 I'm going to help you
1:18:15 and I'm going to do two things
1:18:17 one
1:18:19 I am going to have Neil
1:18:23 turned over to the Tory door
1:18:26 as of right now
1:18:27 his grace has agreed that the tramir
1:18:30 will oversee
1:18:32 verification as to whether or not he is
1:18:34 who they are concerned he is and whether
1:18:37 or not he is a practitioner
1:18:39 of Rogue blood magic
1:18:43 I have enough sway to have him brought
1:18:45 to me instead what I do not have is the
1:18:49 ability to ensure that he will be found
1:18:51 innocent but I can prevent
1:18:54 the premiere from sabotaging any hopes
1:18:57 of proving such I will meet with his
1:18:59 grace
1:19:00 and I will also ensure that your cautery
1:19:04 has the opportunity to prove
1:19:07 his innocence
1:19:09 before any judgment is made
1:19:12 now
1:19:14 I wish for you and she holds her hand
1:19:18 out and someone else presents her with
1:19:20 this like very like well-crafted
1:19:25 book how well crafted uh not so crafted
1:19:28 that you are uh and change it almost
1:19:31 like specifically said okay
1:19:34 and she opens the book and she sets the
1:19:38 book down on your lap and what you see
1:19:40 is this like running list of Boons and
1:19:43 transactions
1:19:44 she hands you the pen and she says your
1:19:48 corduroy made up their minds as to who
1:19:51 will offer these Boons to me
1:19:53 the other torador are still paying
1:19:55 attention
1:19:56 unclear yeah they are okay
1:20:00 do they still appear to be hearing music
1:20:03 however yes okay Bretta supports the
1:20:08 book in her lap and will accept the pen
1:20:11 and she looks down into the book with
1:20:14 all the boons and she says
1:20:17 are you sure this is what you'd want
1:20:20 I am sure
1:20:22 I am sure that this is not what I want
1:20:24 but it is what I need
1:20:27 I cannot have anyone
1:20:30 stepping on me
1:20:32 if I'm to maintain the power that I have
1:20:36 here
1:20:37 intended or not you know quotery
1:20:39 undermined me
1:20:41 and I can never allow that to happen
1:20:42 again
1:20:44 if you can undermine me my enemies can
1:20:49 and if
1:20:50 there was another way that you would
1:20:52 know that I would appreciate your
1:20:54 tutelage
1:20:55 and Britta lets her eyes drop to her own
1:20:58 wrist
1:20:59 and then tells us
1:21:02 considers
1:21:04 I would need to know
1:21:06 that you were worth the investment
1:21:09 she says almost like apologizing for I
1:21:13 mean to say such
1:21:15 so I want an apology for Miles too
1:21:17 side out here
1:21:19 and nilism
1:21:21 I'll show that my rivals may hear it
1:21:24 I'm not certain if I'll be able to get
1:21:26 it what would you like in the meantime
1:21:30 the bones
1:21:31 okay give me the bones
1:21:33 and should you accomplish this
1:21:36 I will release my hold of them
1:21:38 and with that Britta writes her own and
1:21:41 Neil's name down for two lifeboats she
1:21:44 kind of gives you a look we are unsure
1:21:46 whether or not Neil is Neil any
1:21:48 crustacean debts uh he has cannot be
1:21:52 cleared as of yet and he cannot create
1:21:53 prestation deaths I hope someone else
1:21:56 was understanding
1:21:59 if I write down another name
1:22:01 and when Neil
1:22:05 has proven innocent could that name be
1:22:08 switched back
1:22:10 if he has proven innocent
1:22:12 the bonias on me maintains and you may
1:22:15 use it as easy spit
1:22:17 okay and brother writes down one's name
1:22:20 she closes the book very like
1:22:23 gingerly with you and rest her hand over
1:22:25 yours and there's this kiss on your
1:22:27 cheek I was very brave of you
1:22:30 [Music]
1:22:36 just sometimes Niels finds himself alone
1:22:39 with a pair of tremire that kind of pace
1:22:42 around the room arms crossed and just
1:22:44 kind of fixing mean stairs
1:22:47 you're still Shackled up there's a piece
1:22:51 in your mouth preventing you from
1:22:52 speaking and looks like they have put
1:22:55 significant effort into making sure that
1:22:57 you cannot cast your magic and then
1:23:00 the door opens
1:23:02 Reiss enters he carries with him a
1:23:06 suitcase which is set down on a table
1:23:08 that's you know some five ten feet away
1:23:11 from you and then he Paces for a little
1:23:15 while with his Premiere and they they
1:23:17 tell him in Latin and then you have made
1:23:21 others do you speak I do not speak Latin
1:23:23 they speak amongst themselves in Latin
1:23:25 and then uh or the gesture he dismisses
1:23:28 the two tremeir from the room and they
1:23:31 leave
1:23:32 Reiss pulls up a seat
1:23:35 he sits down with a casual gesture
1:23:38 the piece of metal kind of like locking
1:23:41 your jaw in place melts into an ooze
1:23:44 that tastes like bile but you find you
1:23:48 can speak
1:23:49 neol sort of spits some of the like
1:23:53 gross just leavings of his uh of his
1:23:56 summoning out of his mouth then looks up
1:23:59 at Reiss and he is quite clearly just
1:24:03 absolutely terrified right now but in
1:24:06 that way he's gotten a couple times
1:24:07 before where he just like there's no
1:24:09 hope of getting out of this and so he's
1:24:12 scared but accepting maybe maybe not as
1:24:17 cowed as Rhys might expect
1:24:21 and he just looks up at Reiss
1:24:24 um good evening
1:24:26 Mr race
1:24:28 good evening Neil
1:24:30 I understand that you have found
1:24:32 yourself in a bit of a pickle found
1:24:35 myself here is is one way to put it
1:24:38 he says and he's just continuing to sort
1:24:41 of a fix that mulcavian Gaze on Rhys
1:24:45 I imagine it is a rather appropriate
1:24:49 term for it you are here because the sum
1:24:52 of your actions and the actions of
1:24:54 others
1:24:55 surely even you didn't predict that you
1:24:58 would be here tonight
1:24:59 no no
1:25:01 um I feel kind of stupid about that
1:25:03 maybe I should have
1:25:05 as uh
1:25:07 as soon as I saw the pieces moving
1:25:10 around the board I should have seen some
1:25:11 of the other ones coming
1:25:13 that's uh that's probably on me
1:25:16 don't be so harsh on yourself Neil
1:25:19 you're only now being introduced to Jean
1:25:22 that has existed for millennia
1:25:25 you lack the scope to understand what
1:25:29 you are looking at
1:25:30 Neil gives this very weird look on his
1:25:34 face when Maurice talks about scope and
1:25:37 gives like a nervous giggle like a like
1:25:40 a nervous laugh
1:25:42 that's almost but not quite mocking
1:25:45 that's something amuse you now
1:25:48 just talking about
1:25:49 um scope uh
1:25:53 I I just it's um it's
1:25:56 you're right I've only started really
1:25:58 seeing scope recently
1:26:00 uh
1:26:02 the the much larger pictures and I
1:26:07 I don't know the answer to this question
1:26:08 but I'm I'm really wondering of the two
1:26:11 people in this room which one of us has
1:26:14 the narrower scope right now
1:26:17 if you're pondering this
1:26:19 you have made yet another mistake
1:26:22 nice for the minor things
1:26:25 do you understand
1:26:27 why it is that your cautery has suffered
1:26:30 as it has yes
1:26:32 tell me
1:26:33 I mean I think so it's always really
1:26:36 hard for me to start thinking and sort
1:26:38 of like absolutes there's a million
1:26:41 little things that might have led to
1:26:43 this moment my guess uh at first uh if I
1:26:48 was gonna put my best guess on it is uh
1:26:52 you
1:26:53 me going back a little bit of a ways
1:26:58 um actions that were undertaken uh By Us
1:27:02 by Miles
1:27:04 that you took umbrage with
1:27:08 um
1:27:09 as you're sort of moving about yeah I'm
1:27:14 curious
1:27:15 um I'm curious how far
1:27:18 down the road
1:27:21 you've thought about uh the
1:27:23 repercussions of
1:27:25 everything that's going on the
1:27:27 repercussions of my actions
1:27:30 kind of is that what you think you
1:27:32 should be considering in a time like
1:27:33 this
1:27:36 I
1:27:39 we both know I'm not
1:27:43 what the rumors say that I am
1:27:47 who they say that I am
1:27:49 you are
1:27:51 shadow
1:27:52 of what the rumors say that you are of
1:27:55 all of the makings all of the reasoning
1:27:57 to become and of course the necessary
1:28:02 training
1:28:03 truth
1:28:05 is that
1:28:06 the difference between you and your side
1:28:09 is a matter of experience
1:28:11 and temperament and personality
1:28:14 and thought all of those things are
1:28:17 quite unreliable
1:28:20 when it comes to the mulcavians
1:28:22 aren't they
1:28:24 no have you not spend much time around
1:28:26 your clan everything that every member
1:28:29 of my clan does they do for a reason and
1:28:31 I think that's sort of the thing that
1:28:33 people forget yes a lot but perhaps you
1:28:36 do not understand how much your sire may
1:28:38 act through you
1:28:39 how much your choices may not be truly
1:28:42 your choices at all I mean if we're
1:28:44 gonna debate Free Will I
1:28:46 yeah it's possible and is in the nature
1:28:49 of tremendous debate Free Will okay
1:28:54 um you were saying something about why
1:28:57 this is happening that's correct you
1:29:00 know he his hands are still bound but he
1:29:03 does like a
1:29:04 he like nods his head a little bit in a
1:29:06 please continue to monologue at me like
1:29:09 gesture where's the piece of the book of
1:29:12 Nod
1:29:13 Neil goes real quiet for a second ah
1:29:16 perhaps you don't want me to monologue
1:29:18 and perhaps you should speak instead
1:29:20 why are you interested in things like
1:29:24 that do you believe yourself in a
1:29:25 position to ask me questions
1:29:28 I think that I'm in a position where I
1:29:31 can't help but to always ask questions
1:29:33 and then a change of subject the woman
1:29:35 that was found at your Haven
1:29:37 she is here in violation of hospitality
1:29:39 and is to meet final death
1:29:41 shall we speak of her instead
1:29:44 the thing that I'm having a lot of
1:29:46 trouble
1:29:47 trying to figure out is what your end
1:29:50 game here is
1:29:52 outside of petty Vengeance you struggle
1:29:56 to understand because you lack scope
1:29:58 I've already told you as much yeah so
1:30:00 I'm not going to waste my time
1:30:01 attempting to expand your mind because I
1:30:04 I see a path here
1:30:07 and and it doesn't the path that I see
1:30:11 it ends badly
1:30:15 for you for the domain for the Northeast
1:30:17 I I see all of that and I I can't
1:30:21 I can't see uh maybe I am too narrow in
1:30:26 scope I I can't see past
1:30:28 a path that doesn't go well for anyone
1:30:33 you
1:30:34 first and foremost
1:30:38 and Neil's face he like he looks like
1:30:40 he's actually considering it like he
1:30:42 like he does not get it and is trying to
1:30:46 piece it together sort of in spite of
1:30:49 himself there's this little puzzle in
1:30:51 front of him that like he's literally in
1:30:53 a position where he could die at any
1:30:55 second and it's like yeah but the puzzle
1:30:56 though like what's I don't know
1:30:59 that he's not even quite looking at
1:31:00 Reiss at this point he's sort of like
1:31:02 staring in the middle of the distance
1:31:03 like trying to piece things together
1:31:06 because what I see right if if I wanted
1:31:09 the easiest thing in the world and the
1:31:12 thing that
1:31:14 the Sabbat are here
1:31:17 and they're coming
1:31:18 and
1:31:20 everybody is faction wising off
1:31:22 inside the camarilla they're already
1:31:24 split and there's the Gemini league and
1:31:27 there's pendragon's Army
1:31:29 I know which side that you fall on and
1:31:31 based on our actions every action we've
1:31:34 taken you have to know which side that
1:31:35 we we fall on
1:31:37 which is your side which is a much
1:31:40 smaller side than the other side
1:31:42 and it would be so easy
1:31:45 to just I mean the ties to Pendragon are
1:31:48 already there and between Pendragon and
1:31:50 the Army the Gemini like in the Sabbat
1:31:52 the Gemini League doesn't but we're
1:31:54 making the choices for here anyways and
1:31:57 one of the major reasons that we're
1:31:58 doing that is is Miles and and just the
1:32:03 Cuttery in general we we have thrown our
1:32:06 lot in to help you and so by doing this
1:32:09 I I can't see how you're not just
1:32:13 undermining some of the only actual
1:32:15 allies in the area who who've been able
1:32:17 to accomplish anything for you can
1:32:19 actually do and if I wanted to kill you
1:32:23 I would kill me
1:32:25 that's like the easiest answer there
1:32:27 like if you can't just see the ripples
1:32:29 of how every single one of them act
1:32:31 after that even if you've destroyed them
1:32:33 like
1:32:34 I I just I don't know I don't understand
1:32:36 what your end game here is I don't
1:32:38 understand how you can't see the value
1:32:42 that each of us has outside of the fact
1:32:45 that it might not matter to you
1:32:48 which means you have something else some
1:32:51 other goal and they're like that's other
1:32:53 than survival other than the
1:32:55 continuation of the Gemini League or the
1:32:57 camarilla rather than the overthrow of
1:32:59 the Sabbat and that's that's the part
1:33:00 that I can't quite
1:33:02 put my mind to it's the peace that's
1:33:05 missing or maybe I have it already and I
1:33:08 I just don't know because sometimes I
1:33:11 when you have a box full of puzzle
1:33:13 pieces to like three or four or five
1:33:15 different puzzles uh and he just like
1:33:16 keeps rambling as his like thought
1:33:21 do you truly believe that you are some
1:33:25 benevolent Force who should simply be
1:33:28 taken at face value
1:33:30 no I think we should be judged
1:33:33 on
1:33:34 the choices we've made and continue to
1:33:37 make possession of the book of nada's
1:33:39 death sentence among the camera so I've
1:33:41 heard Leo robe thomaturgy
1:33:44 makes you a fair game to ultramere so if
1:33:47 we are discussing face value we kill you
1:33:50 here in this room
1:33:52 we asked Buddha to come give her a count
1:33:55 of what happened but we kill her
1:33:57 we have put a call Johnny for help and
1:34:00 he comes rushing over and we kill him
1:34:03 after that
1:34:05 miles falls apart
1:34:07 again
1:34:09 and when just leaves
1:34:11 and then what happens after that
1:34:13 we'll move on you're not the first
1:34:15 quarterly like this
1:34:16 you're not the first group who thought
1:34:18 they had connections that would bring
1:34:20 down the Wrath Of Heaven on anyone that
1:34:22 hunted and killed them not saying
1:34:25 that we are but
1:34:27 after that
1:34:29 the sabata and the city and they're
1:34:32 coming and Pendragon is
1:34:34 nipping at your heels
1:34:37 and
1:34:39 I'm not saying we're
1:34:41 special
1:34:42 I'm saying that all right now before you
1:34:45 go wandering off in this conversation
1:34:46 again I understand that the board is
1:34:48 bigger than you think
1:34:50 I know so stop dwelling on that
1:34:52 I know where is see the trees the book
1:34:55 of not
1:34:57 where is it
1:34:59 where is Johnny's child
1:35:02 what makes you think I would know those
1:35:04 where is Johnny sire
1:35:07 I don't know the answers to your
1:35:11 questions
1:35:12 you know I've been out of the city for a
1:35:14 while
1:35:15 for some reason and it gives Reiss like
1:35:18 a not accusatory but sort of a just like
1:35:22 come on man like I haven't even been
1:35:24 here and you know why I haven't been
1:35:25 here how can I answer these questions he
1:35:27 knocks on the door activate the ritual
1:35:30 you feel the presence within the room
1:35:32 and you know now that should you begin
1:35:35 to answer any question you will be
1:35:37 forced to answer truthfully and you are
1:35:41 not even capable of lies of omission it
1:35:44 is an agonizing experience
1:35:47 what do you know of your sire
1:35:49 on July 20th 1969 he approached me
1:35:51 outside of a high school in New Haven
1:35:53 said it was an auspicious night and
1:35:56 embraced me while I was trying to use a
1:35:58 stone cell telescope to look for the men
1:36:02 who had landed on the moon he brought me
1:36:06 to New Haven uh eventually he started
1:36:09 talking about things I didn't understand
1:36:11 and he never explained like the get of
1:36:14 Cain he got very obsessed with the
1:36:18 concepts of justice and then he fled to
1:36:21 alamata leaving the camarilla now you've
1:36:24 seen no size since no
1:36:27 tell me of your fragment of the book of
1:36:29 Nod
1:36:30 it was in possession of Vito Sentosa it
1:36:33 was given to him presumably by his
1:36:35 contacts within the Sabbat to help as
1:36:38 far as I understand Shaw and the web as
1:36:41 larger pieces of information gathering
1:36:43 Shaw used Vito as part of the web of
1:36:47 information for the Nosferatu it was
1:36:49 recovered by us the night that the
1:36:53 assault on the Elysium took place and
1:36:55 Arabella Rollins's attempted Praxis in
1:36:58 the kerfuffle as part of it I had made
1:37:02 photocopies of the fragment in order to
1:37:05 use them to uh prove to The Domain that
1:37:08 Shaw had been in possession of them
1:37:10 after that I'm not entirely sure what
1:37:13 happened to everything because that
1:37:15 night
1:37:17 started a long period of time where I
1:37:19 was no longer in the domain the first
1:37:21 time that I had returned to my Haven in
1:37:24 forever was uh
1:37:27 just the other night
1:37:29 what do you know of Brita and where she
1:37:32 comes from
1:37:33 what happens if I try not to answer do
1:37:37 you try not to answer yes you are racked
1:37:40 with pain and then your mouth starts
1:37:42 moving giving the answer
1:37:45 I know that she doesn't know who she is
1:37:49 that none of us do we don't know who our
1:37:53 her sire is and it was curious to me
1:37:56 that you didn't check
1:37:58 um because presumably that is the sort
1:38:00 of thing that the premiere can do uh I
1:38:04 know that
1:38:06 um the few fragments of memory that she
1:38:08 does have uh are in black and white
1:38:12 black and white like an old movie I see
1:38:17 Neo
1:38:19 is there anything about you that you
1:38:20 don't want me to know
1:38:22 I I don't want you to know that I have
1:38:26 been practicing the art of Mastery of
1:38:29 Heaven and Earth for the last 20 years
1:38:30 figuring it out on my own
1:38:33 I don't want you to know that I made a
1:38:38 pact with a demon in order to save my
1:38:41 friends that I outwitted it that I am
1:38:45 more than you think that I am I don't
1:38:48 want you to know that I still have
1:38:52 personal connections to the children of
1:38:56 Hakeem that
1:38:59 on there I don't want you to know
1:39:01 because it would tell you that I am
1:39:05 connected in some ways to the children
1:39:06 of Hakeem not in the ways that you think
1:39:09 but enough ways for you to bury me that
1:39:11 I am currently being perceived by
1:39:14 members of the web of knives who are
1:39:16 already in the city coming to kill me I
1:39:19 don't want you to know I
1:39:23 used to fear you the most and now I
1:39:26 don't he answers on his own the door
1:39:29 opens and Elsa London strolls into the
1:39:32 room accompanied by a handful of
1:39:34 Toreador Reiss kind of like turns and
1:39:37 looks at Elsa who has just like who has
1:39:41 arrived uh like on a horse made from
1:39:44 Serendipity and
1:39:49 oh man
1:39:51 and very kind of like casually and
1:39:55 cordially knots to you and she kind of
1:39:57 takes out this like this very like
1:39:59 pretty silk like handkerchief and she
1:40:02 actually kind of like wipes some of like
1:40:03 the black ooze that's like smeared
1:40:06 across your mouth from you and kind of
1:40:08 rest the handkerchief on your lap so you
1:40:09 can kind of finish on your own when once
1:40:11 you're Unshackled and uh she turns to
1:40:16 Rhys and begins to speak French do you
1:40:19 speak French I do not okay the only
1:40:22 thing that is clear about the
1:40:25 conversation that the two of them have
1:40:27 is that there comes a moment where Rhys
1:40:29 goes very quiet he's very rigid he slaps
1:40:33 the table with his hand uh like having
1:40:36 like this physical Outburst
1:40:37 interestingly the table cracks
1:40:41 hmm
1:40:43 and he gets up and he walks out at the
1:40:46 door and the other side of the door is
1:40:48 the same camera that we're watching over
1:40:50 you kind of giving like confused and
1:40:53 apologetic looks to a recent unsure of
1:40:56 what what's happening and then they just
1:41:01 like little good ducklings they can get
1:41:03 right behind him and the train of
1:41:05 Tremere leave
1:41:06 and then Elsa shuts the door one of the
1:41:09 Toyota heads over and they've got like a
1:41:11 couple of like these pins in their mouth
1:41:13 and they kind of start like [ __ ] with
1:41:16 the locks and they pop the shackles that
1:41:19 you're in and they kind of take that and
1:41:21 they set it on the table and Elsa kind
1:41:23 of like looks away and gestures for you
1:41:25 to clean off your disgusting mouth
1:41:27 and well I hope you treated you well
1:41:30 um
1:41:31 honestly about as expected maybe a
1:41:35 little better what did you learn from
1:41:37 him that he
1:41:40 believes
1:41:41 that he has much bigger games that he's
1:41:46 playing that
1:41:48 he has plans to destroy the entire
1:41:50 cotery
1:41:52 is attempted to enact that he is looking
1:41:55 for the book of Nod Neil is just like in
1:41:57 a weird truth-telling mood anyways now
1:41:59 that he's here he can't be stopped now
1:42:01 and just uh the also the weird sense of
1:42:05 relief
1:42:06 do you smoke now
1:42:08 um I I don't really know how to answer
1:42:10 that question well I had to remember
1:42:13 that you do
1:42:15 and oh I do not have your favorite brand
1:42:18 on hand as one of the toroid I kind of
1:42:20 like
1:42:21 takes out a cigarette and says it down
1:42:23 to the table for you Neil not used to be
1:42:25 the one receiving cigarettes instead of
1:42:27 giving them just sort of picks it up and
1:42:30 uh
1:42:31 um
1:42:32 thank you my friends are going to be
1:42:35 taking care of you until it is time that
1:42:38 you come before the prince and speak
1:42:41 okay I understand that you have a
1:42:46 relationship of sorts with the asamites
1:42:52 yes I see not the one that they think I
1:42:57 have though I I'm not a I'm not a killer
1:43:00 okay then who who what which assemites
1:43:03 do you have a relationship with
1:43:06 um they're a band of Assassins so which
1:43:09 assassin is your friend not all of them
1:43:11 there's a it's complicated
1:43:15 I see well I gave you a cigarette for a
1:43:18 reason take your time I'm not here to
1:43:21 interrogate you so if you don't feel
1:43:23 like you should share by all means don't
1:43:25 but I can only help you with what I know
1:43:27 I there are Assamites there are children
1:43:31 if I came that I have personal
1:43:34 relationships with from a long time ago
1:43:37 and then there are other ones who are
1:43:39 currently in the process of hunting me
1:43:41 down to drag me to all of it or kill me
1:43:43 I'm not really sure which one why
1:43:46 because they want to know what I know
1:43:49 I see
1:43:50 I have a cigarette
1:43:53 prepare yourself
1:43:55 from what is likely to be a very
1:43:58 one-sided conversation
1:44:00 what do I do
1:44:03 well
1:44:05 and you asked me that question some time
1:44:07 ago
1:44:08 I would have told you
1:44:10 to find
1:44:13 a political power
1:44:15 attach yourself to it be loyal to it
1:44:19 and do not run off half conked into some
1:44:23 of the most dangerous things that plague
1:44:25 this region
1:44:27 or a bit past that conversation aren't
1:44:29 we and like a little bit
1:44:32 but for now I will tell you what I told
1:44:34 you
1:44:35 smoke your cigarette
1:44:37 clear your mind
1:44:38 and get ready for a harrowing evening
1:44:43 thank you and don't be ridiculous I
1:44:45 didn't do this for you
1:44:47 just kind of walks out and shuts the
1:44:49 door uh the Tory door kind of hang out
1:44:51 with you and uh they mostly talk to each
1:44:54 other
1:44:55 and you start to kind of get the feeling
1:44:56 that like what conversations they do
1:44:58 have with you they're like laughing at
1:45:00 weird times and are not overly invested
1:45:04 in the actual conversation itself but
1:45:07 rather some sort of subtext
1:45:09 um I suppose anybody has a light
1:45:14 I thought about it
1:45:17 but then I realized I Neil doesn't want
1:45:19 to know
1:45:21 no but you know the moments to laugh at
1:45:24 now
1:45:29 just give them the impression that I can
1:45:31 hear them yeah no it's
1:45:33 uh yeah and Neil just sits and kind of
1:45:36 quietly smokes a cigarette and tries to
1:45:38 calm down
1:45:40 as much as he's ever capable of calming
1:45:43 down

1:47:36 there's I mean there's so much
1:47:40 um
1:47:41 I need you to go into the vaults and
