0:00:00 path of night is an actual play vampire
0:00:02 the masquerade podcast set in the
0:00:03 classic world of darkness we're all
0:00:06 friends we're here to have fun but our
0:00:07 story can include graphic violence drug
0:00:10 use sexual content and other mature
0:00:12 themes we've talked at our table about
0:00:14 safety comfort and consent both as
0:00:16 players and storytellers
0:00:18 we know what to expect we're all excited
0:00:20 to be here and we want you to feel the
0:00:21 same so listener discretion is advised
0:00:24 now let's walk the path of night
0:00:30 [Music]
0:00:33 last time on path of night
0:00:36 the quarterly gathered to the side to
0:00:37 hear when recount her meeting with
0:00:39 shaw's child the new nosferatu primogen
0:00:42 who had many questions about what
0:00:43 happened between john and desire
0:00:46 the news didn't bode well so the
0:00:48 quarterly gathered up neil and their
0:00:50 gear to head off to boston in search of
0:00:52 the answers wynn wanted about the dead
0:00:55 rising and with a little luck
0:00:57 to gain favor with the new haven court
0:01:09 [Music]
0:01:12 during the trip it's all pretty easy
0:01:14 going
0:01:15 sometimes you see you know state trooper
0:01:18 cars kind of like whip by but never
0:01:20 they're never looking for you and then
0:01:23 as you kind of get close you start
0:01:24 really kind of seeing boston's
0:01:38 assume we had a uh contact who would
0:01:41 like introduce us
0:01:42 i uh talked to jane before we left she
0:01:44 gave me a number of her contact
0:01:46 okay should we call before we get into
0:01:48 the city limits johnny holds up a card
0:01:50 with a phone number uh jotted down onto
0:01:53 it this is a ventrue kind of dead zone
0:01:55 unfortunately there's uh
0:01:57 it's probably why arabella came up here
0:02:00 but other than that she might be
0:02:01 involved in the financial sector
0:02:03 okay so um
0:02:05 i guess
0:02:09 brilliant wants to make a phone call
0:02:11 adventurer persona non grata up here i
0:02:13 mean it's it's somebody that jane's is
0:02:16 friends with and i'm assuming that she
0:02:17 probably gave them a heads up
0:02:20 okay let's somebody needs to make a
0:02:22 phone call yeah we need to make that
0:02:23 point of contact in person or over the
0:02:25 phone rather johnny would it be a Brujah
0:02:27 or i guess i could try well they're a
0:02:30 friend of james just go from there
0:02:32 he hands the card to you with the number
0:02:34 uh britta looks at the card
0:02:36 and
0:02:38 do we know her name
0:02:39 anything about her
0:02:41 they're friends with jane
0:02:43 give them a call tell them who it is all
0:02:45 righty
0:02:46 and she will call the phone rings for a
0:02:49 little while and
0:02:50 you hear someone pick up
0:02:52 what the hell is this
0:02:54 um hi this is britta um i'm a part of
0:02:58 johnny's Coterie
0:03:00 who the hell is johnny
0:03:02 we're friends with jane we're getting
0:03:04 into boston
0:03:05 jane
0:03:09 all right
0:03:10 you're okay what's your name
0:03:12 i'm Britta
0:03:13 all right Britta
0:03:15 and you said something about a
0:03:16 quartering we have a group yeah
0:03:19 i'm scourge sullivan i work here in
0:03:22 boston
0:03:23 i'll get you checked in
0:03:25 uh if you if you need more than that let
0:03:27 me know and i'll make sure you're taken
0:03:29 care of
0:03:31 right now
0:03:33 the prince is holding his court
0:03:35 uh no one's invited
0:03:37 so we're not sure when he's going to be
0:03:39 available again
0:03:41 but in the meantime i have clearance to
0:03:44 have you
0:03:44 granted permission to remain in the
0:03:47 domain until he's all set to have
0:03:49 you know an appointment
0:03:52 thank you scourge sullivan that's very
0:03:54 helpful i guess i'll do what i can any
0:03:57 particular meeting place you'd like for
0:03:58 us
0:03:59 yeah i'll pick you up at quincy market
0:04:01 all right try not to make any noise
0:04:04 i appreciate it
0:04:06 and i give him an approximate time based
0:04:08 on johnny's estimate
0:04:10 where we're headed quincy's market
0:04:13 gadget to meet with
0:04:15 scourge sullivan um they're not holding
0:04:18 well they're not having visitors right
0:04:19 now but his grace is in the middle of
0:04:21 court it's gonna be a little bit getting
0:04:23 through through the actual township so
0:04:25 i'm say would probably be there about an
0:04:27 hour or so
0:04:28 um about an hour or so
0:04:30 yeah yeah it's fine for sure thank you
0:04:33 yeah he hangs up five minutes later
0:04:35 dunkin donuts is on fire
0:04:39 all right guys we just got to be cool
0:04:40 for an hour in boston how hard can that
0:04:42 be
0:04:44 [Music]
0:04:45 he did mention not to make any noise i
0:04:48 don't know if that means he's expecting
0:04:50 anything but
0:04:52 um
0:04:53 yeah he's said he had clearance to hold
0:04:54 us for a while maybe until um
0:04:58 court is open to us no you said that was
0:05:00 the scourge
0:05:01 scourge sullivan
0:05:03 okay
0:05:04 it sounds like you have we explained
0:05:06 what a scourge is i don't remember okay
0:05:10 scourge is a position within some courts
0:05:12 they
0:05:13 take care of undocumented kindred that's
0:05:16 us right well not anymore
0:05:18 we made contact with him yeah so
0:05:21 in theory he'll um he'll give us the
0:05:23 okay until we can formally ask for the
0:05:26 hospitality of the prince being that i
0:05:28 know jane
0:05:29 does the name sullivan
0:05:31 ring any bells for me duh bruh she's
0:05:33 vaguely referenced on a handful of
0:05:35 occasions i never never knew that it was
0:05:37 the scourge right yeah okay
0:05:39 i think sullivan's a Brujah
0:05:42 but uh
0:05:43 i've only heard their name in passing
0:05:46 james mentioned them a few times i
0:05:48 didn't realize it was the scourge though
0:05:50 well hopefully they'll be able to give
0:05:51 us a little bit of lay of the land and
0:05:52 then we'll go from there i was kind of
0:05:54 hoping for an elysium but i mean scourge
0:05:57 sounds more ominous than just a waypoint
0:06:00 sort of a weird title isn't it well they
0:06:03 when he says take care of undocumented
0:06:05 kindred yeah yeah there's lots of
0:06:07 different ways to take care of
0:06:08 undocumented kindred usually scourge
0:06:10 looks for those who
0:06:13 they're not the welcoming committee
0:06:14 let's put it that way i see
0:06:16 but
0:06:17 on the plus side we get to go to quincy
0:06:19 market
0:06:20 that's true no um just i don't know if
0:06:23 it's been
0:06:24 been made clear yet or anything but i
0:06:26 know we've talked about it's been a
0:06:28 little while since we've talked about
0:06:29 the traditions and things don't um
0:06:31 we're not going to be feeding or
0:06:32 anything while we're here until we get
0:06:34 permission for you know different people
0:06:35 have different territories different
0:06:37 different hunting grounds so
0:06:39 all right um we topped outside the city
0:06:41 everything's fine but we
0:06:43 will not be eating in boston until
0:06:46 someone says here's where you can eat
0:06:48 just as a general as always neil i
0:06:50 appreciate the warnings
0:06:52 it's really helpful thank you
0:06:54 well you know i just also the uh the
0:06:57 camaria
0:06:59 owns boston
0:07:01 but there are parts of it that are
0:07:04 pretty well um held by another clan
0:07:08 called the giovanni
0:07:10 they're who i'm here to see
0:07:12 they're not necessarily uh
0:07:15 always friendly with the camarilla i
0:07:17 think right now relations are pretty
0:07:20 good
0:07:20 it's kind of like uh new haven and uh
0:07:24 the settights exactly
0:07:26 by the way as we're approaching are you
0:07:28 seeing anything here when i mean you
0:07:31 said some sort of like
0:07:32 conflux or
0:07:34 large happening what's happening out
0:07:36 here is there anything you're seeing
0:07:39 when
0:07:39 takes a look around
0:07:41 it's like desolate here there's
0:07:45 nothing to speak of in terms of
0:07:47 uh ghostly activity even like the really
0:07:50 old boston structures that you would
0:07:52 assume
0:07:53 would be there especially like around
0:07:54 downtown
0:07:56 boston it's all shredded and torn down
0:07:58 it looks like a storm recently ripped
0:08:00 through this place and every now and
0:08:02 again the wind kind of picks up again
0:08:04 it's a [ __ ] wasteland
0:08:06 is that normal yeah it's no okay no
0:08:09 that's not it
0:08:10 you know how remember hurricane andrew
0:08:13 yeah what it did to florida let's go
0:08:15 with yes i remember it crashed the
0:08:17 insurance industry around here and
0:08:18 closed a bunch of businesses it um
0:08:21 it's sort of like that
0:08:23 all of these old structures are torn
0:08:25 down they look like they've been clawed
0:08:26 to pieces
0:08:28 okay and the
0:08:29 wind keeps picking up again why would
0:08:31 that be that's what i'm here to find out
0:08:34 sometimes there are storms
0:08:36 but this would have to be a hell of a
0:08:37 storm people uh people talk about the
0:08:39 giovanni and i think this is a little
0:08:42 bit more than rumor
0:08:44 but
0:08:46 word is they have their hands
0:08:49 deep into the spirit realm
0:08:51 so they're kind
0:08:53 they're specifically they
0:08:57 they i'm gonna say work with
0:09:00 the realm of the dead there's some
0:09:02 sorcery that
0:09:03 binds the dead
0:09:06 why are you hesitating when you say
0:09:08 that they because some of it is
0:09:12 some of it is more benevolent than
0:09:13 others some of them
0:09:14 they're just mediums they just work with
0:09:17 them like any other
0:09:19 medium would but
0:09:21 a lot of necromancers
0:09:24 their practices are unsavory they make
0:09:26 things out of the dead
0:09:28 like freeze yeah Reiss isn't Reiss has
0:09:32 things that were made by
0:09:34 soul forging but i don't think he's a
0:09:36 soul forger you can't trust any blood
0:09:38 source or
0:09:39 you can trust at least johnny's eyes
0:09:41 kind of flick in the rear view for a
0:09:42 second neil is not capable of meeting
0:09:46 his eyes
0:09:47 how does that help johnny it's the truth
0:09:50 that's your truth
0:09:52 all right so we treat the giovanni like
0:09:54 their friends
0:09:58 acquaintances be polite be respectful
0:10:02 sort of
0:10:03 how you would treat anyone
0:10:05 okay uh i need to get in touch with
0:10:07 raven
0:10:08 to get a point of contact with them
0:10:11 uh once
0:10:12 i probably shouldn't be summoning and
0:10:14 speaking with any animals until we've
0:10:16 been
0:10:16 given clearance to do so all right
0:10:20 eventually the group of you do make it
0:10:21 to quincy market
0:10:23 and you almost hear it before you see it
0:10:27 as the kind of cobblestone
0:10:30 pathways here
0:10:32 cause
0:10:33 drunk women with high heels
0:10:36 to get their heels stuck
0:10:38 frequently
0:10:39 so every now and again one takes a dip
0:10:42 hits the ground
0:10:44 says something very loudly about how
0:10:46 incredibly drunk she is
0:10:48 and then her girlfriends kind of help
0:10:49 her back up to their feet and the cycle
0:10:50 begins anew
0:10:52 these
0:10:53 incredibly drunk women issue their
0:10:55 mating calls repeatedly
0:10:57 and
0:10:58 uh drunk
0:11:01 kind of like beefy muscled up guys who
0:11:04 are not very like tall wow kind of head
0:11:06 over flirt with them with their like
0:11:09 soul patches and like head of spiked
0:11:12 hair are there chin straps too sometimes
0:11:14 yeah yeah absolutely there goes our late
0:11:16 90s uh central boston we did it we hit
0:11:19 the quota
0:11:20 we've uh they no longer want to listen
0:11:22 to us they got puka shell necklaces
0:11:25 [ __ ] [ __ ] red sox everywhere
0:11:28 socks
0:11:30 the group of you find yourselves being
0:11:32 followed as you uh
0:11:34 make your way around quincy market and
0:11:37 uh eventually this
0:11:39 this man in kind of like a like a
0:11:41 tarnished old faded like white
0:11:43 button-down shirt old tie old pants old
0:11:46 shoes
0:11:48 uh approaches you he's got like
0:11:50 he's one of those guys that has like an
0:11:52 endless five o'clock shadow
0:11:54 like it's always five o'clock for his
0:11:56 beard
0:11:58 he uh
0:11:59 approaches the group and uh
0:12:01 gives like a little bit of a surly nod
0:12:04 britta lifts her hand to
0:12:06 wave a little bit offers a smile
0:12:09 so are you here we're looking for
0:12:11 arabella Rowlands
0:12:13 who sent you a combination of uh
0:12:16 pendragon and upton Rowlands
0:12:19 okay
0:12:20 uh
0:12:21 he kind of gives you like this look like
0:12:23 he might not
0:12:25 trust you
0:12:26 but it's unclear as to which individual
0:12:28 you mentioned that causes this
0:12:30 all right well his his grace
0:12:32 is uh holding a court right now
0:12:35 and when it's done
0:12:37 uh we can we can take a look
0:12:40 at getting the group of you
0:12:42 uh more permanently allowed to stay here
0:12:45 but sometimes when you hold this court
0:12:47 it can be a few days
0:12:49 so you're gonna have to bear with us
0:12:50 while we work on that
0:12:52 um
0:12:53 a few days well people aren't allowed to
0:12:56 attend his courts when he's holding them
0:12:58 so it's it's mostly just him in a quiet
0:13:00 room but
0:13:02 sometimes you could take a while with it
0:13:04 we don't really give them a hard time
0:13:05 about it because they're sick as [ __ ]
0:13:06 red coats on you and then it's all over
0:13:08 it's game over neil looks not at all
0:13:10 surprised by the idea of holding court
0:13:12 in an empty room basically you're going
0:13:13 to want to be in your best behavior uh
0:13:15 if you're not [ __ ] around too much
0:13:17 i'll keep you out of trouble
0:13:18 um but if you want to file with the
0:13:20 redcoats they're gonna [ __ ] kill you
0:13:22 and i'm not gonna help you uh i'm sorry
0:13:24 can you explain who the redcoats are
0:13:27 somebody send you to boston and tell you
0:13:28 about the redcoats
0:13:30 short answer yes they're the enforcers
0:13:33 uh
0:13:34 bully boys but allowed to kill people
0:13:37 uh the ring leader is an elder gangrel
0:13:40 tough guy name i'm not gonna go heavy
0:13:43 into the structure of the city until
0:13:44 we're somewhere actually safe
0:13:46 just understand that these are very
0:13:48 aggressive individuals and they're
0:13:50 pretty much just looking for the
0:13:51 opportunity to kill kindred especially
0:13:54 out of towners thank you for the warning
0:13:57 so
0:13:58 why don't we get going
0:13:59 i
0:14:00 i'm gonna have you layla for a night
0:14:03 see what i can do to get you set up why
0:14:05 what what are you here for again what is
0:14:06 what is this
0:14:08 why did you princess send you especially
0:14:10 two princes that don't like each other
0:14:12 arabella Rowlands has been making waves
0:14:14 up here
0:14:15 and they realize they're going after
0:14:16 arabella Rowlands
0:14:18 i wanted to talk to her at least
0:14:22 he
0:14:22 gives this cynical laugh
0:14:25 all right your funeral let's go
0:14:28 why
0:14:29 what's going well okay we'll wait till
0:14:30 we
0:14:31 they didn't warn you or nothing
0:14:33 any information you have would be
0:14:35 helpful if you're willing to share
0:14:38 was was this a suicide punishment
0:14:40 mission we were sent on
0:14:42 would that surprise any of us
0:14:44 no because we keep doing things that are
0:14:46 considered suicide so
0:14:49 so it's a win-win for them pretty much
0:14:53 right well
0:14:54 follow me this way and he basically kind
0:14:56 of takes you on a walk headed into like
0:14:58 the financial district it's kind of
0:15:00 later in the evening so there's like
0:15:01 [ __ ] nobody there
0:15:04 and it's like this weird ghost town even
0:15:06 though you haven't actually traveled
0:15:07 very far
0:15:08 from where people actually are and you
0:15:10 go for the walk and there's like a lot
0:15:11 of hills and there's lots of like little
0:15:13 sights to see
0:15:15 and when far enough he kind of turns
0:15:18 and
0:15:19 kind of sits down by the curb and lights
0:15:21 up a cigarette and again like it's
0:15:22 there's like no one here there's like no
0:15:24 cars passing through nothing your friend
0:15:26 arabella Rowlands has been looking for
0:15:29 something uh
0:15:31 uh
0:15:31 tied to a little bit of um
0:15:34 an urban legend
0:15:36 uh kind of an old story for the area
0:15:38 something called the ur codex
0:15:41 and she's a very uh occulty kindred
0:15:44 dangerous dangerous woman
0:15:46 the last scourge was found having been
0:15:49 completely [ __ ] incinerated looking
0:15:52 for her
0:15:53 she's she's killed kindred and she looks
0:15:55 like she's willing to do it again
0:15:57 this does not sound like the same woman
0:15:59 that we dealt with like a month ago
0:16:02 all right well she like a month ago
0:16:04 she was in new haven
0:16:06 doing what
0:16:07 acting as harpy well and then calling
0:16:09 practice on the prince
0:16:11 which failed
0:16:12 but not really excited to uh involve
0:16:15 herself in a fight
0:16:17 right and not wielding magic something
0:16:20 i'm aware of yeah she ran from the
0:16:22 lupine there is non-magical ways to
0:16:24 incinerate somebody that's fair yeah
0:16:26 that's definitely [ __ ] fair i can
0:16:28 slap you in the mouth and leave burn
0:16:30 marks um
0:16:31 so all right
0:16:33 but you said she was looking into this
0:16:35 codex
0:16:36 or rumor that's the rumor
0:16:39 what's uh the r codex yeah
0:16:42 is that
0:16:43 all right
0:16:45 so
0:16:46 allegedly
0:16:48 during like the time of like
0:16:50 witchcraft and
0:16:52 trials okay um
0:16:54 there was uh a cult
0:16:57 and the ringleader had bound his soul
0:17:00 into an ancient tome and through that
0:17:02 tome he was able to
0:17:04 you know teach all sorts of secrets to
0:17:06 anyone that held the book
0:17:09 supposedly
0:17:11 she's looking for it at least that's
0:17:12 what the nosferatu say
0:17:14 the last scourge actually a redcoat who
0:17:17 went after i don't know fought for some
0:17:19 booby trap or some [ __ ] and ended up
0:17:21 dead
0:17:23 Britta as he's kind of telling the story
0:17:25 will sit down on the curb as well and
0:17:27 listen and when he says that the last
0:17:29 scourge ended up dead uh she'll look
0:17:32 over and ask
0:17:34 so
0:17:35 you've had to be looking for her too
0:17:37 right something like that and does she
0:17:39 officially have hospitality here
0:17:41 uh no she does not uh no Ventrue may
0:17:44 have hospitality here i feel like the
0:17:46 whole party just looks at me at the same
0:17:48 time
0:17:49 is actually suspiciously quiet during
0:17:51 this whole conversation
0:17:53 johnny doesn't burn you with a look
0:17:56 i would look at me
0:17:58 i mean i mean you're obviously miles is
0:18:00 looking at himself like just uh yeah i
0:18:02 mean you are offv yeah obviously [ __ ]
0:18:05 adventurer
0:18:06 [Laughter]
0:18:09 is that
0:18:10 negotiable
0:18:11 uh no there's no way they're gonna let
0:18:13 eventually live here however
0:18:15 your uh
0:18:16 friend he kind of says like vaguely
0:18:18 gesturing to miles miles waves uh
0:18:21 as long as he keeps his mouth shut isn't
0:18:23 disrespectful they're not gonna tear him
0:18:24 to pieces
0:18:25 um
0:18:26 they're probably not going to let them
0:18:28 stay for more than a few nights which
0:18:29 means if you're going after this person
0:18:31 you need to actually like chop chop get
0:18:32 it done or else you're going to end up
0:18:35 being sent home before you really
0:18:36 accomplish anything good to know even if
0:18:39 we're solving a problem for the city
0:18:41 like this to them The Ventrue of the
0:18:42 problem you add another Ventrue you're
0:18:44 not actually solving the problem you're
0:18:45 just adding more problems yeah that's
0:18:47 logical
0:18:48 um no that's that's math that's how math
0:18:51 works yeah
0:18:52 one douche bag plus one douche bag makes
0:18:54 two douches this is this one the object
0:18:56 is zero douche bags
0:18:58 this is where your agreeance was a
0:18:59 little bit hurtful do you have any idea
0:19:01 where to start looking for perspective
0:19:04 if we had a death wish i could drop a
0:19:06 couple locations see if that helps you
0:19:08 out that'd be great do you think the uh
0:19:10 the premiere in the city might be
0:19:12 willing to talk to us if she's looking
0:19:13 for the ur codex they might ask some
0:19:15 insight yeah i know that i'm sure the
0:19:17 tremor will be happy to talk to you
0:19:19 thank you i can't tell if that was
0:19:21 sarcastic yeah i very much told without
0:19:23 myself that tremeer's usually never
0:19:25 happy to talk to people how's that
0:19:26 archer mirror is very grumpy who's your
0:19:29 tremaine
0:19:30 Reiss
0:19:32 yeah they're probably not that different
0:19:34 so
0:19:35 but they're at least willing to talk
0:19:37 yeah fair enough
0:19:38 sounds good um hey so sullivan how do
0:19:40 you know uh jane uh she and i have the
0:19:43 same sire
0:19:44 oh brood mates then yep good to know
0:19:48 is there gonna be a problem if i talk to
0:19:50 some of the animals in the city what the
0:19:51 [ __ ] are you going to say to them
0:19:53 i just need to send a message back to
0:19:54 someone oh yeah it's fine i just i mean
0:19:56 i don't really talk to animals so i have
0:19:58 no idea what's going to piss them off
0:19:59 well i was worried about pissing off
0:20:01 anyone who does talk to the animals more
0:20:03 than anything but we've just heard
0:20:04 things about king and wanted to make
0:20:06 sure we are extra polite and respectful
0:20:08 before we go around flexing any of our
0:20:10 powers that's pretty a good idea he's
0:20:12 got like an order of knights and uh the
0:20:14 [ __ ]
0:20:15 it's uh you're you're stepping into a
0:20:17 pretty strange situation so being
0:20:19 careful about it is not a bad idea
0:20:21 sounds like we
0:20:23 share an objective a little bit
0:20:25 if arabella's become your problem i'm
0:20:27 not really willing to commit to that
0:20:30 okay
0:20:31 her being your problem or
0:20:32 sharing an objective i i don't know why
0:20:35 you said the same thing twice but
0:20:37 just wanted to check no to both
0:20:39 how long you've been scourged for
0:20:41 a couple months how do you like it well
0:20:43 uh i think um
0:20:46 i think i get by and uh
0:20:49 i'd like to keep doing that wait
0:20:50 arabella killed the other scourge a
0:20:52 couple of months ago
0:20:54 no there's three scourges in the domain
0:20:56 i was under the impression that you took
0:20:57 the job from the other dead one oh no no
0:20:59 i would have never [ __ ] taken if i
0:21:01 knew that [ __ ] was going on so arabella
0:21:03 is a recent problem yeah wanted to check
0:21:06 my timeline is there anything else that
0:21:08 we should keep an eye out for why are
0:21:09 you
0:21:10 boston's got a long history with the
0:21:12 dead so that's part of the reason i'm
0:21:15 here yeah so you know weird things
0:21:17 happen sometimes but where are the uh
0:21:20 where are the giovanni uh hiding out in
0:21:22 this city currently the giovanni
0:21:24 actually mainly operate out of the
0:21:25 prudential that's where milliner and all
0:21:27 of them have their little meetings our
0:21:29 relations with them they get along all
0:21:31 right actually they're very tight with
0:21:32 the tremere so
0:21:34 one of those things if you want to get
0:21:35 in with the giovanni get in touch with
0:21:37 the trimming let's show it this way to
0:21:38 do it you want to piss off the giovanni
0:21:40 piss off the trimmer good to know um
0:21:43 so it looks like we need to have a
0:21:45 couple of conversations and things while
0:21:46 we're here uh do you have a sort of a
0:21:48 place for visitors to stay here yeah i
0:21:51 can put you up okay i much appreciate i
0:21:53 appreciate it thank you very much he uh
0:21:56 takes you guys for like a walk over to
0:21:58 the north end and you guys get like this
0:22:00 little [ __ ] hole in the wall
0:22:02 restaurant like haven space
0:22:05 and
0:22:06 are able to kind of get rested up and
0:22:09 settled in well before dawn it's sold
0:22:11 and one last question
0:22:13 yeah did the uh did you get an edict up
0:22:15 here about having to embrace
0:22:18 people for Pendragons army yeah we did
0:22:21 so that bullshit's going all around the
0:22:23 northeast huh you should see the
0:22:24 compound all right so go ahead and get
0:22:27 some rest and uh i'll see what i can do
0:22:29 to help you guys out tomorrow but i'll
0:22:31 make sure he has a phone number for us
0:22:33 good night thanks again have a good
0:22:35 night
0:22:38 [Music]
0:22:41 the group of you head to the location
0:22:42 that's given to you by scourge sullivan
0:22:45 and there you come to an apartment in
0:22:48 the north end that overlooks what's this
0:22:51 string of restaurants
0:22:54 um on kind of like a a small like road
0:22:58 that seems to see a ton of traffic
0:23:00 there's people kind of walking around
0:23:01 you can hear the bustling of the city
0:23:03 even at this time as people start
0:23:05 closing up restaurants and getting ready
0:23:08 to head home and
0:23:10 in this little apartment it's it's cozy
0:23:13 huge thick curtains that are
0:23:17 pretty obviously designed to kind of
0:23:19 make the area more comfortable and
0:23:20 useful as a haven but beyond that it's
0:23:23 actually rather spartan no one lives
0:23:25 here there's some furniture definitely
0:23:27 no art whatsoever even the kitchen area
0:23:30 doesn't seem to have anything in the way
0:23:32 of dishes there's no pots and pans this
0:23:34 is not a place that the living
0:23:36 makes use of
0:23:37 with that said it's very clean that uh
0:23:41 it's a tidy space
0:23:42 and it looks like this might be a spot
0:23:44 that they frequently use to
0:23:47 care for visitors
0:23:49 so the group you head in one at a time
0:23:51 it's got two bedrooms there's the living
0:23:53 room then there's the dining room slash
0:23:55 kitchen area there are more view than
0:23:58 there are rooms
0:23:59 so there's going to be some figuring out
0:24:01 to do
0:24:02 but beyond that there's certainly enough
0:24:03 space for all of you all right who wants
0:24:06 to bunk up sure okay
0:24:08 all right
0:24:09 looks like we've got a space a little
0:24:11 bit of time let's go over what we're
0:24:12 supposed to be doing
0:24:14 tomorrow so i need to get in touch with
0:24:16 raven because
0:24:17 my job here just got a lot more
0:24:18 complicated how come raven asked me to
0:24:21 help her find this book that arabella
0:24:23 rowlands has i don't know if she'd mind
0:24:25 me telling you but i'll tell you anyway
0:24:27 it belonged to her so the er codex is
0:24:30 that whether they're codex
0:24:31 how long ago did it belong to raven very
0:24:34 like
0:24:35 it belonged to her and her coven to
0:24:37 people they created it do people outside
0:24:39 of Gangrel know this i doubt it wait
0:24:43 like coven like like a witch coven yeah
0:24:45 raven's history is very long and
0:24:48 um arabella Rowlands what what does she
0:24:50 want do you think then if it's raven's
0:24:52 book it's probably full of a lot of
0:24:54 magic stuff
0:24:55 was arabella i mean arabella is
0:24:58 reasonably old-ish
0:25:00 i think
0:25:01 miles how old is arabella unsure i was
0:25:04 under the impression that her embrace
0:25:06 was not terribly off from mine but oh um
0:25:09 but i don't know for sure i've never
0:25:11 actually looked up her pedigree because
0:25:15 so it's not likely then that like but
0:25:17 she's the child of Rowlands the this is
0:25:20 sure of that fairly sure she wouldn't
0:25:22 have been in like a a
0:25:24 a witch coven with with raven then no
0:25:26 it's so she just wants it for different
0:25:28 things but raven wants it too raven
0:25:30 wants it yes okay because the impression
0:25:32 i got and i you know i don't know for a
0:25:34 fact obviously but the impression that i
0:25:36 got was that
0:25:37 uh arabella doesn't have it yet
0:25:41 yeah but she has fragments of it
0:25:43 oh okay
0:25:45 that's what i thought he said i i don't
0:25:47 know so the tremere do their own kind of
0:25:49 magic then there's what neil can do
0:25:53 when you when you say a coven
0:25:55 how's that separate
0:25:57 different kind of magic
0:25:59 different
0:26:00 neil sculpts with clay the tremere
0:26:04 carve ice this is painting on us on a
0:26:07 canvas
0:26:09 is it because i mean it might
0:26:11 there's the possibility that it might
0:26:12 not even be
0:26:14 magic
0:26:15 like you know could just be if we're
0:26:17 using
0:26:18 if we're using art analogies i think
0:26:21 zantosa sculpts with clay i think neil
0:26:24 makes collages with newspapers yeah but
0:26:26 they're like really good collages
0:26:28 i'm not saying they're bad anyways
0:26:31 it may be a form of mortal magic too not
0:26:34 any of the things that we're dealing
0:26:35 with is that even real while we're
0:26:37 talking about this neil yeah do you mind
0:26:40 doing that thing you did to the windows
0:26:43 yeah i had kind of planned on it um
0:26:46 and i was also gonna do a thing wherever
0:26:49 i end up
0:26:50 sleeping uh
0:26:52 i
0:26:53 to so that if we get interrupted during
0:26:55 the day that'll i can wake up um but
0:26:57 i'll
0:26:58 yeah yeah yeah johnny uh and sort of
0:27:00 like taking that neil sort of looks a
0:27:03 little perked up like johnny is taking
0:27:05 him seriously and not just immediately
0:27:07 attacking him for doing blood magic you
0:27:09 can see that he's actually
0:27:11 very reticent about asking you but you
0:27:14 get the feeling that he's trying to
0:27:16 extend an olive branch
0:27:19 of pops his fangs and uses one of them
0:27:21 to rip open his thumb
0:27:23 and then starts walking around just
0:27:25 drawing little blood sigils on all the
0:27:28 windows and doors
0:27:29 well he'll walk with you and kind of
0:27:32 watch
0:27:34 while he's listening to
0:27:36 when talk more about the er codex
0:27:38 he's kind of giving you a sneer as
0:27:41 you're doing it but he's
0:27:43 controlling himself and just holding
0:27:45 back the curtains so that you can do
0:27:48 your ritual still listening to wind talk
0:27:51 about the or codex but as he's doing
0:27:53 this ritual sort of muttering under his
0:27:55 breath he occasionally will throw out
0:27:58 little explanations of stuff kind of
0:27:59 like a like a kid showing off his art
0:28:02 project that he's like really excited to
0:28:04 see for his dad to see even though it's
0:28:06 bad that kind of energy as he just walks
0:28:10 the paces and it takes him like the
0:28:11 better part of an hour as they're all
0:28:13 talking so when it sounds like we don't
0:28:16 really
0:28:17 know what kind of magic if anything the
0:28:19 codex has in it honestly i don't know
0:28:22 what kind of magic is in it i know that
0:28:24 there probably is magic in it rumored to
0:28:27 be powerful and i suspect the rumors are
0:28:30 what drew
0:28:31 arabella to it it's important to raven
0:28:33 one way or another it's important to
0:28:35 raven and it's something that she asked
0:28:38 me to help her with in exchange for
0:28:40 getting an in with the giovanni oh so
0:28:42 we're in boston we do in theory have it
0:28:45 in with the giovanni they owe raven some
0:28:47 favors and she's agreed to
0:28:50 help me with it
0:28:52 if i help her with this we have kind of
0:28:54 two
0:28:55 sort of three goals while we're up here
0:28:57 in boston right two of them seem to
0:28:59 involve arabella well i mean
0:29:01 they're they're kind of related but we
0:29:03 need to to deal with arabella we need to
0:29:06 deal find the er codex for for raven or
0:29:09 at least try to give her some clues so
0:29:11 she can keep the up the search yeah uh
0:29:14 and then related to all of that was you
0:29:17 had something you wanted to talk to
0:29:18 giovanni about
0:29:20 with something with the lens of the dead
0:29:21 i there was a huge storm um and they're
0:29:25 anticipating
0:29:26 so i want to hear more about this storm
0:29:29 and the giovanni but before we get there
0:29:31 real quick when i got your back i trust
0:29:34 you on this
0:29:35 but what
0:29:36 what's raven's game here because
0:29:38 i know you have a relationship with her
0:29:40 but i don't trust that Gangrel as far
0:29:42 as i can throw her granted i can throw
0:29:44 people ways but yeah but you get my
0:29:46 point
0:29:47 i understand and sympathize is raven i
0:29:51 don't know elders are weird
0:29:54 play their own
0:29:55 their own cards they keep their cards
0:29:56 close to the chest she i would be lying
0:29:58 if i said she had drew on me and for
0:30:00 anything but she has a lot of knowledge
0:30:02 and she's
0:30:04 she's an asset when when i was in um
0:30:07 when i was in baghdad uh jubair nara
0:30:10 were talking to me about
0:30:11 basically more people now are are
0:30:14 playing their elders games then than
0:30:16 ever before that basically every elder
0:30:19 is trying to push towards their end game
0:30:21 raven said something similar so whatever
0:30:23 her end game happens to be
0:30:26 it involves their codex well i guess we
0:30:28 kind of have to we have to go out on a
0:30:30 limb and trust some people so you you
0:30:33 think raven is it would be okay to
0:30:36 facilitate this business with our codex
0:30:38 for her i do yeah if arabella is burning
0:30:41 people alive
0:30:42 i i feel like i would rather have raven
0:30:45 have it than arabella i mean it's really
0:30:48 depending on what those people did which
0:30:49 those people the one that you burned
0:30:51 alive if arabella is interested in
0:30:54 things like magic books
0:30:56 and people who go after her burst into
0:30:58 flames
0:30:59 i mean there's a lot of ways that can
0:31:01 come about
0:31:03 stopping arabella doesn't mean we have
0:31:04 to we have to find this book for raven
0:31:07 but
0:31:08 when if you think this is the best way
0:31:10 to maintain that relationship and she
0:31:12 hasn't shown you anything to turn you
0:31:15 off from helping her in this endeavor i
0:31:17 don't trust her with my life but i do
0:31:19 trust her that's good enough for me she
0:31:21 did leave us behind to deal with
0:31:23 the weeping bear that's why i trust her
0:31:26 but i don't trust her with my life on
0:31:28 the flip side uh the more the time is
0:31:30 going on uh and the more things i'm
0:31:33 learning about the more i think that
0:31:34 raven was actually kind of straight with
0:31:36 us back in january
0:31:38 i think she loves
0:31:40 things
0:31:41 i don't think she's kept a lot of
0:31:43 secrets when it comes to stuff that we
0:31:44 need to know
0:31:46 she's just looking out for herself all
0:31:49 right if the two of you think that it's
0:31:51 a good idea to be dealing with her i'm
0:31:53 in oh i have no idea i just think she
0:31:55 was
0:31:56 you know i trust yours i can be trust
0:31:57 your instincts well i'm trusting win on
0:31:59 this one but well speaking of
0:32:02 arabella and the codex
0:32:05 it seems to me that if she's got
0:32:07 fragments of it if we find her then
0:32:09 we're closer to getting to the actual
0:32:11 codex but
0:32:13 well speaking of someone who
0:32:16 just recently got lit on fire a little
0:32:18 and oh that's not really something
0:32:21 how are we going to approach this
0:32:23 well
0:32:25 uh we don't have any leads on arabella
0:32:27 other than the fact that she's in boston
0:32:30 um the people who might have leads are
0:32:32 probably the giovanni so when why don't
0:32:35 you go back to telling us about why
0:32:37 exactly you want to talk with them
0:32:39 before i uh interrupted you on that
0:32:42 among the dead there are
0:32:44 legends of these great storms called
0:32:47 maelstroms
0:32:48 and
0:32:50 there's the story that when the sixth i
0:32:53 believe
0:32:54 comes
0:32:55 it will wipe out the souls of the dead
0:32:57 now is this like a storm
0:32:59 that we can see or no there might be
0:33:02 effects in the
0:33:04 what they call the skin lands but
0:33:06 there's
0:33:07 this would be something that just
0:33:09 annihilates the land of the dead i'm
0:33:10 sorry when
0:33:12 i know you have these visions with the
0:33:14 dead
0:33:15 treat me like
0:33:17 that i'm an elementary school student
0:33:21 and i need to be explained this from the
0:33:23 ground up what exactly is going on here
0:33:26 so
0:33:27 how elementary school go like you need
0:33:29 to know what what the shadow lands are
0:33:32 yeah all right
0:33:34 so i'll do my best um
0:33:36 this is something kind of
0:33:38 i've always seen um
0:33:40 you mean ghosts
0:33:42 ghosts spirits different worlds
0:33:44 interlaid on top of each other um
0:33:47 there's a place
0:33:49 where for spirits
0:33:51 you know elemental
0:33:52 things and then there's a place called
0:33:54 the shadow lands
0:33:55 which is for creatures called raves
0:33:57 which are souls of the dead that are
0:34:00 somehow trapped there
0:34:02 so like people who can't move on yeah
0:34:04 that's where joey found himself huh
0:34:06 yeah joey was still anchored here and he
0:34:09 still is
0:34:10 um
0:34:11 it's not a kind life
0:34:14 so to speak
0:34:15 that wraiths live aside from the
0:34:18 possibility of necromancers using them
0:34:21 to fuel and
0:34:23 power objects and themselves other
0:34:27 wraiths more powerful wraiths will often
0:34:29 feed on
0:34:30 the smaller ones
0:34:32 they like diabolize each other
0:34:35 cannibalize is probably more the word
0:34:37 well a soul eating a soul yeah and this
0:34:40 shadow lands is all around us it's all
0:34:42 around us
0:34:43 it's
0:34:44 it's not a reflection of our world so
0:34:47 much because there's not a lot of
0:34:49 things have to be very old to exist
0:34:52 in the shadow lands or they have to be
0:34:54 made made of soul-forged wraiths well
0:34:57 that sounds awful it's awful
0:35:00 it's
0:35:01 an eternity of being hammered on an
0:35:03 anvil
0:35:04 being raised to malleable temperatures
0:35:06 and being hammered now i'm more anxious
0:35:09 about dying so and this maelstrom seems
0:35:11 to be doing
0:35:12 massive destruction to the
0:35:15 shadow lands yes and the wraiths and
0:35:17 it's causing
0:35:19 some unforeseen consequences if any of
0:35:21 part of this could be foreseen it's
0:35:23 knocking souls back into their bodies
0:35:25 but not not in any kind of
0:35:28 not in any kind of productive way it's
0:35:31 creating zombies
0:35:33 just like like romero walking dead
0:35:36 [ __ ] that seems you know incapable
0:35:39 of
0:35:40 of speech um
0:35:42 no real goal other than violence it
0:35:44 seems like they're in pain that was that
0:35:46 business in the whole holy land right
0:35:48 yeah yeah weathers gave me a call on
0:35:50 that i didn't actually take care of it
0:35:52 but i heard about some of the guys that
0:35:54 did have to clean it up yeah it's not
0:35:56 good one of the wraiths i'm regularly in
0:35:58 contact with told me about it and he
0:36:01 told me about all the things that are
0:36:02 happening
0:36:03 he's not a good person by the way you
0:36:05 know raids are just like anyone else
0:36:08 some are like joey some are like mr
0:36:10 perfect uh if he calls himself mr
0:36:12 perfect i can i could understand why he
0:36:14 would not be the best well he wanted me
0:36:16 to watch him cannibalize some of the
0:36:17 other ghosts okay so that's um gross
0:36:20 yeah it's right so these these giovanni
0:36:22 are the ones to talk to about this
0:36:24 problem with the shadow lands the
0:36:26 giovanni are known necromancers and they
0:36:28 um they have a relationship with the
0:36:31 shadow lands that few other clans do
0:36:33 yeah i'm not anticipating getting along
0:36:35 with them very well but they are looking
0:36:37 for mediums they are looking for so
0:36:40 you're going to probably run into a lot
0:36:41 of scenarios like how Reiss was abusing
0:36:44 ghosts yeah but it's going to be can you
0:36:47 keep that much worse because if we piss
0:36:49 off the giovanni here we piss off the
0:36:51 tremier which means we piss off the
0:36:52 whole city guess we'll see i know that's
0:36:54 not the right answer if but
0:36:57 if you need help
0:36:59 keeping calm before we go in anywhere
0:37:01 let me know i might i think that might
0:37:03 be a good idea i'll give you a high five
0:37:05 if i need a hand okay or just tell you
0:37:08 the situation allows you to
0:37:10 preemptively dead your nerves before i
0:37:13 don't want that neither help or without
0:37:15 your say so but in case i appreciate
0:37:18 that we have very few friends in this
0:37:20 city
0:37:21 the premier and the giovanni are
0:37:24 potentially a few of the only ones that
0:37:27 might actually
0:37:29 be willing to help us
0:37:31 give it some thought you were saying
0:37:32 something about being able to find
0:37:33 arabella neo i think so yeah i haven't
0:37:36 done it i i had in practice but i know
0:37:39 who she is i can at least follow her
0:37:41 trails i just we need a like a starting
0:37:43 place
0:37:44 a place to really look for so if the
0:37:46 scourge could tell us where the burned
0:37:48 body was found where the last one died
0:37:50 yeah uh it might help pick up some clues
0:37:53 uh it'll take us a straight a trail
0:37:54 straight to our
0:37:56 in theory i haven't done it but it's
0:37:59 possible otherwise it's just looking for
0:38:01 clues and and trying to to get a sense
0:38:03 of where to go i can i mean i'm good for
0:38:05 anything right it's looking at stuff
0:38:08 you're good for lots neil is it safe for
0:38:10 you to do this
0:38:12 good question
0:38:14 it seems like we have a pretty i feel
0:38:17 like they're going to let us do what we
0:38:19 need to do if we can get rid of the
0:38:20 arabella problem for them so long as
0:38:23 we're pursuing arabella that it's kind
0:38:24 of i mean between up and Rowlands and
0:38:27 pendragon and
0:38:28 they seem surprised one of those held
0:38:31 more weight than the other probably the
0:38:33 pendrive dragon around here unless
0:38:35 there's a schism within this i mean if
0:38:38 we're lucky uh we can just take care of
0:38:40 all this real quick and leave and and
0:38:43 never have so why would you say that if
0:38:45 the court wants to reach out to us
0:38:47 that's true who's
0:38:48 who's going to speak to the court on on
0:38:50 the behalf of the coterie because it
0:38:52 might unfortunately not want to be you
0:38:56 miles i mean i could put on other
0:38:57 clothes but i think that would still be
0:38:59 a good one i think yeah you're i don't
0:39:01 think you're going to change your blood
0:39:02 with a change of suit quinn king i'm not
0:39:04 unknown yeah
0:39:06 i'd say either britta or neil
0:39:09 is that even
0:39:11 allowed well we'd find out fairly
0:39:13 quickly well i just mean that i'm
0:39:15 not um
0:39:17 acknowledged yet better uh better keep
0:39:20 that under wraps no one needs to know
0:39:22 the business of new haven
0:39:24 uh unless you uh unless you're asked
0:39:27 directly don't lie to somebody like
0:39:28 quinton king
0:39:29 i mean he's
0:39:31 presumably
0:39:33 uh better at picking out truths than we
0:39:35 are plus his
0:39:36 his group of knights there are they
0:39:39 scare me
0:39:40 they really scare me i mean would he get
0:39:43 along better with you being a malkavian
0:39:45 not necessarily not if i stumble over my
0:39:47 words uh
0:39:49 how much do you know about like courtly
0:39:50 speech and arthurian legend
0:39:53 i mean
0:39:54 when it comes to etiquette and stuff
0:39:56 like that i've been learning as well as
0:39:59 i can
0:40:00 he might look at me like a court jester
0:40:03 if he looks at you like a like a
0:40:05 visiting princess or something like that
0:40:07 might be
0:40:08 that might be a benefit um i mean we can
0:40:10 both be there obviously but when it
0:40:13 comes to talking to people i will 100
0:40:16 let you take the lead and if there's
0:40:18 something i think you really need to
0:40:20 know i'll just put the thought in your
0:40:21 head that's a weird way to put that why
0:40:23 apparently that's a new thing you can do
0:40:25 what do you mean putting a thought in
0:40:27 the head
0:40:28 i can hear thoughts if i try
0:40:30 that's what i mean by a new thing that
0:40:32 you can do have you been doing that a
0:40:34 lot hearing thoughts um
0:40:37 not without listening
0:40:39 i'm just gonna let this go that's
0:40:40 probably for the best
0:40:42 all right it sounds like we have a plan
0:40:45 i think first thing tomorrow we'll
0:40:47 it sounds like you're gonna contact
0:40:49 raven i'm gonna try and contact rita and
0:40:50 we're gonna then try to see if we can
0:40:52 locate arabella if you guys really want
0:40:54 me to be talking in from the court i am
0:40:56 gonna need a lot of help i
0:40:59 will yeah hopefully it doesn't come to
0:41:00 that hopefully we can just in and out
0:41:02 and if you got a talk with quentin king
0:41:04 or any of his knights i will be there by
0:41:07 your side and no one will lay a finger
0:41:09 on you
0:41:10 um okay
0:41:12 yeah thank you guys we'll all be there
0:41:15 but i'm sure they won't let us wander
0:41:16 around by ourselves frankly and and not
0:41:18 to i hope you take this as more of a
0:41:20 compliment than an increase of pressure
0:41:23 as we lay stones upon you but um
0:41:26 frankly out of all of us i think you're
0:41:28 probably the best choice to
0:41:30 talk to people and make them not hate us
0:41:33 in this city
0:41:34 i just don't want to repay what you guys
0:41:37 have done for me by endangering you just
0:41:39 because i don't know something like
0:41:42 like like what a scourge is or
0:41:44 how to properly ask for hospitality or
0:41:47 anything like that
0:41:48 um
0:41:49 don't worry about that well see the
0:41:51 thing is miles can probably coach you if
0:41:53 we have to go somewhere beforehand and
0:41:55 just
0:41:56 he can tell you the etiquette and
0:41:58 then you can execute it i mean some of
0:42:01 the stuff we've covered before too so
0:42:03 just don't terribly different
0:42:05 if you need a quick refresher on what
0:42:07 court positions are we can also make
0:42:09 that happen also quentin king's court is
0:42:11 weird so like
0:42:13 kind of none of us really know the rules
0:42:15 all right
0:42:16 thank you guys it's all jazz and
0:42:18 hopefully we don't have don't forget the
0:42:20 camarilla is a society that's existed
0:42:23 for centuries
0:42:25 maybe even more the oldest of us have
0:42:27 only been part of it for less than half
0:42:30 a century it takes
0:42:32 a long time to appease some of these
0:42:36 elders if you realize that
0:42:38 and that you're never going to be good
0:42:40 enough for them
0:42:41 except that use it as armor
0:42:44 and just let your attitude do all the
0:42:46 talking a lot of it's about first
0:42:48 impressions and and again i think you're
0:42:50 gonna give a better first impression
0:42:51 than any of us
0:42:54 i'll try
0:42:55 oh we can ask miles don't give me that
0:42:57 walk i cannot help myself
0:42:59 he understands his position in the
0:43:01 cities since it's backwards
0:43:03 sometimes it's easy for me to
0:43:06 get too caught up and remembering that
0:43:08 i've only been remembering for a couple
0:43:10 months
0:43:11 so thank you that helps
0:43:14 helps put things in scale johnny
0:43:16 if it helps make you feel better too you
0:43:17 might be older than any of us you might
0:43:19 be better presumed we we don't know that
0:43:21 all right that's enough helping all
0:43:22 right uh neil did you finish
0:43:24 doing your luge to the windows neil goes
0:43:27 into like the last windows and just
0:43:30 finishes and with a little expenditure
0:43:32 of like ritualistic will closes off the
0:43:35 space so that light can no longer come
0:43:37 inside
0:43:39 okay so
0:43:40 sun's coming up soon should we i'm gonna
0:43:42 turn in okay all right
0:43:45 um i need to take the suit off but then
0:43:47 i'm good to go johnny just takes his
0:43:49 jacket off tossed it on the floor and
0:43:51 kind of like bunches it up like a pillow
0:43:53 and then beds down right in the main
0:43:55 room neil goes to sleep in the tub and
0:43:57 right before he goes to sleep takes a
0:43:59 little ziploc baggie out of his fanny
0:44:01 pack and scatters a bunch of ashes into
0:44:03 the tub first and then curls up and
0:44:06 closes the curtain apparently i get my
0:44:08 own room i love this
0:44:10 um
0:44:11 very proper i love it
0:44:12 it's one of the uh one of the bedrooms
0:44:14 and just kind of cuddles up on the bed
0:44:17 yeah it's sleep overnight for the girls
0:44:19 yep and as dawn rises each of you find
0:44:23 yourselves in a restlessly
0:44:28 [Music]
0:44:32 kneel as the group of you rest you find
0:44:34 yourself very suddenly
0:44:37 jerked awake
0:44:39 by the power of your blood magic
0:44:42 already
0:44:43 you can smell smoke
0:44:46 in your nostrils and this like
0:44:48 this soft orange flickering light
0:44:51 from somewhere else in the apartment i
0:44:53 need you to make a humanitarian
0:44:56 difficulty can i spend a willpower on
0:44:57 this yes
0:45:01 three successes with three successes you
0:45:04 will be able to
0:45:06 remain active for a period of three
0:45:08 rounds
0:45:09 at no dice penalty for the first two
0:45:11 rounds because of your ritual that you
0:45:14 have in place neil pulls himself out of
0:45:16 the bathtub and starts yelling everybody

0:46:44 later double colors early early 2000s
0:46:48 do you know what we're talking about
0:46:50 it's where you wear two polos at the
0:46:52 same time so you got two different
0:46:53 colors and they're both popped i know
0:46:55 what the color thing is but this all
0:46:57 just kind of sounds like uh i have bro
0:47:00 it just sounds like jersey shore to me
0:47:01 to be honest
