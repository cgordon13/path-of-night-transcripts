0:00:30 [Music]
0:00:32 last time on path of night
0:00:35 the quarter he dealt with the gargoyle
0:00:37 bound into the surface of the tremere
0:00:39 and descended into the library at the
0:00:40 heart of the abandoned chantry
0:00:44 they discovered a demon named zofia
0:00:45 sealed away and in possession of the era
0:00:47 codex
0:00:49 as neal attempted to deceive the demon
0:00:51 into handing over the book the demon
0:00:53 tricked miles
0:00:55 and believing that buddha was about to
0:00:57 trade her soul away miles decided to
0:01:00 make his own deal
0:01:08 [Music]
0:01:12 zophil i will strike a deal with you
0:01:14 you will have a 49
0:01:17 voting rights within my own body for the
0:01:20 next moon
0:01:21 but no
0:01:22 torturing or tormenting myself
0:01:25 throughout that process
0:01:27 at the end of it you will be returned to
0:01:30 your home plane or the circle at your
0:01:32 choice
0:01:34 49
0:01:36 49
0:01:38 but enough to give me the power to call
0:01:40 for a vote
0:01:41 correct i agree
0:01:44 [Music]
0:01:50 thunk the door slammed shut
0:01:53 neil red wins surface thoughts
0:01:56 neil buddy i'm doing my best here you
0:01:58 can you can you hear me can you hear me
0:02:00 can you hear me he gives a nod okay
0:02:03 are you able to tell me what's going on
0:02:05 in your head right now he shakes his
0:02:07 head
0:02:08 crap uh he shakes his head but in a
0:02:11 manner that says like i could
0:02:15 but i won't
0:02:17 i need to know what you're planning
0:02:19 because you're planning something it's
0:02:21 time to decide
0:02:24 do you intend this book or not
0:02:26 neil sort of stretches and backs off and
0:02:29 like rubs his hands on his face he looks
0:02:31 over at johnny hey man can
0:02:34 uh sorry win i'm having a little trouble
0:02:37 thinking here um
0:02:38 you give me a little space johnny um
0:02:41 can you
0:02:42 let's get away i'm getting hot in here
0:02:44 can you can give me a hand for a second
0:02:46 johnny who's down below and has
0:02:48 collected the remaining pieces of her of
0:02:49 the er codex does he find anything down
0:02:52 there that sparks his interest depends
0:02:55 on what johnny finds interesting one
0:02:56 thing that you'll notice is that none of
0:02:58 the books fall open
0:03:00 they all
0:03:01 are closed
0:03:02 all of them have uh lion writing and
0:03:05 many of them have uh various symbols
0:03:08 marked on the cover usually like circles
0:03:10 some sort of uh pentacle what have you
0:03:12 but you do notice that there is one
0:03:14 that has the same symbol on it that the
0:03:17 brass ring is made from
0:03:18 or made into rather he'll snatch that
0:03:21 book up and and tuck it into his jacket
0:03:23 okay or rather he'll tuck the the pages
0:03:26 of the codex into his jacket and he'll
0:03:28 just snatch that one up in his hand
0:03:30 and
0:03:31 looking up where neil has kind of been
0:03:33 calling to him from
0:03:34 will
0:03:35 once again channel his strength and take
0:03:38 a bounding leap
0:03:40 up to the uh bookshelf where neil has
0:03:43 been pacing
0:03:44 okay the one thought that neil sort of
0:03:46 projects to win before
0:03:48 he looks over at johnny uh as johnny
0:03:50 comes up is like i need you to trust me
0:03:53 and i need you to trust that johnny is
0:03:54 about to do what i ask him to do and
0:03:57 this is how i want things to go
0:03:59 uh and then he looks over at johnny and
0:04:02 is going to try and
0:04:04 act normal like sort of looking at the
0:04:06 demon and just as johnny comes up looks
0:04:08 over i have to roll for telepathy here
0:04:11 johnny what's your current willpower six
0:04:13 okay that's uh two successes so it's
0:04:15 enough to get into your head as johnny
0:04:16 jumps up next to neil and neal's kind of
0:04:18 like looking at the demon and thinking
0:04:19 he just projects into johnny's head
0:04:23 stay calm as soon as i say the words
0:04:25 deal done i need you to stake me real
0:04:28 hard in the chest and do not let them
0:04:29 remove it until sunup
0:04:32 not till tomorrow night i need you to
0:04:34 trust me and i need you not to hesitate
0:04:36 johnny just kind of gives you a hard
0:04:38 glance as he passes the book that he uh
0:04:42 spotted
0:04:43 and just kind of uh hands it over to you
0:04:45 emile opens up flips through the pages
0:04:46 real quick it's written in latin
0:04:48 he does not seem to understand what is
0:04:50 written in there but sort of closes it
0:04:53 and hands it off to Brittain for a second
0:04:55 the book as he passes you the book he
0:04:58 definitely gives you a hard stare okay
0:05:01 and neil looks up at the at the like
0:05:04 wispy
0:05:05 at the form of the the rings i'd like to
0:05:07 make a deal with you for that codex
0:05:09 johnny
0:05:11 is going to fold his arms
0:05:13 and start spending blood
0:05:15 on dexterity
0:05:18 i'm listening
0:05:20 the tremier bound you in that circle
0:05:22 right they're the reason you're stuck
0:05:24 here they're the ones who called me yes
0:05:27 there's two of them upstairs i'm sure
0:05:30 that you'd like a few hours at least
0:05:33 out in the world not just riding around
0:05:36 in some sort of mortal man but riding
0:05:39 around
0:05:40 in
0:05:41 a kindred
0:05:43 international
0:05:45 doing whatever it is you'd like to do
0:05:47 yes
0:05:48 yes
0:05:49 [Music]
0:05:50 if you hand over the er codex
0:05:53 you may
0:05:54 with
0:05:55 no
0:05:57 reservations about your level of control
0:06:00 have me until the next sun up however if
0:06:04 i die you are immediately to return and
0:06:06 be bound in this circle and at sun up
0:06:09 you leave my body
0:06:11 and you are bound here again in this
0:06:13 circle but for the next
0:06:16 six hours
0:06:18 or however long it is until sunup you
0:06:20 may do
0:06:21 anything that you require
0:06:23 but
0:06:24 you don't harm any of my coterie and you
0:06:27 give us the er codex in the meantime
0:06:29 you have your power and mine
0:06:32 you will add
0:06:34 just one more thing
0:06:38 what's that
0:06:39 johnny's fingers
0:06:40 wrap around the stake in his jacket the
0:06:42 coin you care
0:06:45 toss it into the circle
0:06:48 do i know if i
0:06:50 would it break by throwing the thing no
0:06:51 because he got the book in there so
0:06:52 throwing a coin in there will not break
0:06:54 the seal or anything like that right
0:06:55 okay
0:06:56 very well
0:06:57 i will toss a coin in
0:06:59 and then
0:07:01 i will tell you
0:07:03 that i agree
0:07:05 and then you may possess me
0:07:08 no i will toss a coin in
0:07:11 you will
0:07:12 honor the deal that we make to the
0:07:15 letter
0:07:16 just like i will
0:07:19 and you you agree to give us the book
0:07:21 and not to harm my codery until sunup
0:07:24 when you return here or if i die
0:07:27 and you return here bound again but you
0:07:30 have that time yes
0:07:33 to seek vengeance on the tremere that
0:07:34 hurt you or do whatever you want
0:07:38 yes
0:07:39 [Music]
0:07:40 neil slowly
0:07:42 unzippers his nylon fanny pack
0:07:45 and digs around
0:07:48 and pulls out a coin
0:07:50 which for out of game clarity is
0:07:53 just a regular quarter
0:07:57 and
0:07:58 flicks it into the circle the shadows
0:08:00 kind of coalesce into like a physical
0:08:02 figure and think this coin is caught in
0:08:05 its hand
0:08:07 then very well
0:08:09 i agree
0:08:12 the deal done
0:08:14 the
0:08:15 book their codex
0:08:18 flips through pages until it reaches a
0:08:20 specific page
0:08:21 ignites
0:08:23 and then is gone
0:08:25 and then it leaps from the circle
0:08:27 smashing into your mouth and you see
0:08:30 this like smoke
0:08:31 goes straight down into neil's lungs
0:08:35 johnny will leap forward having pumped
0:08:38 up his dexterity to get the speed he
0:08:40 needs and will plunge a stake directly
0:08:43 into his heart give me an attack while
0:08:45 your difficulty is nine
0:08:46 for out of game clarity i am physically
0:08:49 shaking right now i am still goddamn
0:08:51 nervous
0:08:53 absolutely am spending a willpower
0:08:58 does being swift help yes
0:09:01 for once in my life i did not roll a
0:09:02 single one i have seven successes
0:09:06 reroll except the lowest of the two
0:09:08 re-roll all the dice that is correct
0:09:10 except the lowest of the two you will
0:09:12 accept the lowest of the two tote rules
0:09:14 this was my like there was no way around
0:09:16 this part
0:09:18 no there was going to be a difficult
0:09:19 statement oh i see you're saying
0:09:33 three successes
0:09:34 two dice carry over your rolling
0:09:36 strength plus one die i will spend for
0:09:38 potence
0:09:42 we have six successes enjoy my dumb
0:09:46 wimpy body demon
0:09:48 okay
0:09:49 okay
0:09:50 you need to clarify that you just double
0:09:52 botched that stamina yeah so
0:09:55 so it is it is two ones with neil
0:09:57 attempting to resist the stake what does
0:09:59 snake guys even mean in this context it
0:10:01 means you're super steak
0:10:04 [Laughter]
0:10:07 its total role was a negative two
0:10:10 neil goes
0:10:11 so johnny uh after plunging the stake in
0:10:14 into uh neil and seeing his friend
0:10:17 suddenly his skin tightens and he
0:10:20 withers in front of him immediately like
0:10:22 scoops him up and is just hugging onto
0:10:24 his uh body he nervously looks over to
0:10:27 win and then to Britta i
0:10:30 forgive you neil whispers into your ear
0:10:34 i trust him
0:10:35 that was all he asked of me was that i
0:10:36 trust
0:10:38 that's all you need to do johnny tarpon
0:10:40 vampires can't whisper
0:10:42 um
0:10:43 can we even get out where did the book
0:10:45 go i don't know
0:10:51 [Music]
0:10:54 miles
0:10:55 the book manifests in your hands oh
0:10:58 gotta try put this in the pocket or bag
0:11:02 or something how do i get these doors
0:11:03 open how did johnny do this i guess i
0:11:06 will go hang on the ring and try to like
0:11:09 just pull it open just pull it open like
0:11:10 yeah yeah you open the doors yep and
0:11:12 just make sure you hold on up above
0:11:14 everyone hears the sound of the brass
0:11:16 doors as uh
0:11:17 miles opens it up for you
0:11:20 miles are you all right
0:11:21 yes um that seemed to have worked out
0:11:25 what's going on in here
0:11:26 why are you holding neil why are we
0:11:28 holding neil i mean i understand we
0:11:30 couldn't let the demon do stuff but neil
0:11:34 asked me to stake him
0:11:35 whatever whatever the the pact he made
0:11:38 with that thing it seems that staking
0:11:41 him was
0:11:42 what was going to trap the demon inside
0:11:44 of him until sunlight wait so neil also
0:11:47 made a pact
0:11:48 what so yeah wasn't Britta making a pact
0:11:51 johnny looks over to where the coin is
0:11:53 or where the coin was thrown is it still
0:11:56 inside the circle over there no where is
0:11:58 it
0:11:59 you don't see it miles what did you do
0:12:02 i interceded before you could make a
0:12:04 contact with the demon Britta wasn't
0:12:06 gonna make a compact with the demon
0:12:07 that's not what i saw are you guys sure
0:12:11 about that
0:12:12 i yes i mean how short i was outside the
0:12:14 room miles you were inside the room
0:12:16 right
0:12:17 i stopped talking to the demon i i neil
0:12:20 seemed like he knew stuff about how to
0:12:22 operate with it and he told us not to
0:12:24 make the deal i don't understand why he
0:12:25 made the deal anyway you have the book
0:12:28 yeah i have the book
0:12:29 whose sale did he take
0:12:31 he may have taken both of them
0:12:33 where's that coin that kneel through
0:12:36 freda will look for the coin
0:12:38 there is no coin i don't see it i don't
0:12:41 see it anywhere around here
0:12:43 is are are these
0:12:45 are the uh
0:12:47 rings broken
0:12:48 the
0:12:49 rings
0:12:50 uh
0:12:51 there's just a crack in it from where
0:12:53 the quarter bounced into the circle it's
0:12:55 correct it's cracked right here does
0:12:57 that mean like we can't get him back in
0:12:58 here or
0:13:00 i don't think that'll be a pressing
0:13:01 concern for a while if the plan is for
0:13:03 him to disagree um
0:13:06 johnny's gonna lay down neil gently
0:13:09 and kind of look just at the uh at the
0:13:12 circle and kind of like
0:13:14 do some mental math
0:13:16 and he's going to jump down where he
0:13:18 thinks the coin may have fallen to
0:13:21 and start searching for it
0:13:23 okay uh you
0:13:25 scramble uh and start looking around
0:13:28 and
0:13:29 quickly become confident that the coin
0:13:30 is simply not here
0:13:33 neil said not to make any kind of deal
0:13:35 with it and then he made the deal and
0:13:36 then you made the deal and well actually
0:13:38 neil told me that i could make the deal
0:13:40 nope no he didn't he did
0:13:43 i don't know what you saw a sue but i
0:13:45 stopped talking to the demon when it
0:13:47 became apparent that neil knew i think
0:13:49 we've all been played
0:13:51 yeah no [ __ ]
0:13:52 i think we all heard very different
0:13:54 things than what actually was being
0:13:56 spoken i don't know who was spoken the
0:13:58 truth or maybe he was speaking to it was
0:14:00 speaking to all of us at the same time i
0:14:03 britta what's that book you've got
0:14:05 uh
0:14:06 she looks at the book she hasn't really
0:14:08 gotten a look at it yet uh she sees that
0:14:10 it has this matching symbol on it um she
0:14:13 turns so that the symbol will face win
0:14:16 and she'll say
0:14:18 i'm i'm not sure i think it's in latin
0:14:20 but
0:14:21 i found it down below johnny leaps back
0:14:23 up can i see it
0:14:25 yeah
0:14:26 it looks like it has the same
0:14:28 binding inscriptions as the as the brass
0:14:31 rings built into the floor
0:14:33 wind kind of takes the book and tries to
0:14:35 open it
0:14:36 it opens okay um
0:14:38 i would like to make an academics
0:14:41 or role
0:14:42 to see if i can understand enough of the
0:14:44 latin to figure out what it says okay go
0:14:47 for it i am also curious to do this
0:14:49 since we're looking at the book together
0:14:50 all right i am spending a willpower on
0:14:52 this okay
0:14:53 uh what is that is that intelligence
0:14:55 intelligence plus academics okay uh
0:14:58 yeah well power sounds nice right about
0:15:00 now
0:15:01 what's the difficulty
0:15:04 uh your difficulty is eight
0:15:07 botch
0:15:08 one six oh sorry not botch will power
0:15:10 zero
0:15:11 one success okay you get the impression
0:15:15 that this is
0:15:17 a book
0:15:19 pertaining to the summoning
0:15:21 banishment
0:15:23 and uh control
0:15:25 of the demon that had been summoned into
0:15:27 that circle
0:15:28 right this is how we get it back
0:15:30 but we need to figure that out now
0:15:32 according to the deal that neil said we
0:15:34 only have six hours and that ring's
0:15:36 broken you have about 30 days
0:15:40 uh
0:15:41 according to your deal yeah pretty much
0:15:43 but neil made one too i don't know what
0:15:45 his deal was that's what i'm saying his
0:15:47 deal was about six hours
0:15:49 right and what was happening at the end
0:15:50 of the six hours he was going back to be
0:15:52 bound again in the circle that's broken
0:15:55 is it broken yes right here
0:15:57 well does it seem broken there's a crack
0:15:59 in the middle well as far as i'm
0:16:01 concerned
0:16:03 what we have now
0:16:05 is an atomic demon bomb that i can pull
0:16:07 the pin on any time so we're going to go
0:16:09 up and ha and talk to those premier
0:16:11 upstairs
0:16:12 and if they don't give me answers i like
0:16:14 we're letting that thing out
0:16:16 damn be the consequences
0:16:18 no the consequences are really important
0:16:20 that might literally be the consequences
0:16:22 johnny i have a feeling that they're
0:16:24 going to be a lot more scared about this
0:16:26 than i am let's go
0:16:28 how are we getting out
0:16:29 and how do we make sure they don't just
0:16:31 take the codex off us
0:16:34 uh johnny kind of smiles and looks down
0:16:36 at neil
0:16:37 well you can fly out i can jump out that
0:16:40 just leaves uh a body i have to i have
0:16:43 to carry and the two of you
0:16:45 it's a pretty big part of that can you
0:16:48 carry them out
0:16:50 i can try and fly one of them out you
0:16:52 think you can uh
0:16:54 i did i did see you uh
0:16:56 managed to get off a skyscraper with
0:16:58 neil you think you might be able to get
0:17:00 him all the way up going up is a lot
0:17:02 harder than going down fair
0:17:04 who is
0:17:06 size wise who is the smallest of the
0:17:08 bunch i assume me
0:17:11 or neil i'm not a big boy
0:17:14 i you might be taller but i think you
0:17:16 might be thinner is what it comes down
0:17:17 to you're probably i guess equivalent oh
0:17:22 you're not sure
0:17:24 because like she has like a slim build
0:17:26 and she's probably not like she's
0:17:28 probably medium height but you're
0:17:29 probably very like wiry neil is
0:17:32 reasonably tall but he is
0:17:35 rather gangly and weird yeah
0:17:38 he's weird which has nothing to do with
0:17:40 his physical description all right well
0:17:42 he's got some jack skellington energy
0:17:45 tell you what
0:17:46 um i can try and fly them out and if i
0:17:48 can't we can make other plans no i i
0:17:51 think uh
0:17:52 i think we can we can we can figure this
0:17:54 out
0:17:55 johnny is going to
0:17:57 use his 50 feet of rope um he'll unhook
0:17:59 it from the uh from the spots it's been
0:18:02 tied to and he'll basically kind of
0:18:04 fashion a uh a small kind of like
0:18:07 sailor's knot harness
0:18:09 to put under
0:18:10 miles arms and under Britta's arms and
0:18:14 he'll actually just hold kneel to his
0:18:16 chest so he's gonna strap himself down
0:18:18 with his coterie
0:18:20 and he's gonna just basically try and
0:18:22 jump from ledge to ledge using some of
0:18:25 the tunnels
0:18:26 that have been bored into the hallway up
0:18:28 above
0:18:30 to work his way back up to to where they
0:18:33 initially went spelunky so per the rules
0:18:36 of leaps and bounds you only have to
0:18:37 rule if it is a particularly difficult
0:18:39 jump uh so you just do it so johnny will
0:18:43 get back up to the top of the ledge
0:18:45 when he lands up there
0:18:47 he'll let the rope off of his shoulders
0:18:50 so that the two of them can kind of
0:18:51 unhook themselves from the
0:18:53 harness that i kind of whipped up
0:18:55 and he'll just kind of like step forward
0:18:57 with neil uh the choo-choo mayor waiting
0:19:00 so
0:19:01 do you have it
0:19:03 uh carrie says looking at miles
0:19:05 we are in possession of
0:19:07 okay so
0:19:09 pass it on time to finish deal it wasn't
0:19:11 with you
0:19:13 so
0:19:15 you're just gonna
0:19:16 walk all the way up
0:19:19 probably
0:19:20 okay
0:19:21 um
0:19:22 you might need to fix the circle down
0:19:24 there first this isn't my chandra she
0:19:26 just kind of shrugs and starts walking
0:19:28 all right
0:19:30 johnny will
0:19:31 uh follow along cradling neil with one
0:19:35 hand on the stake
0:19:36 wind flies up out of the hole
0:19:39 and
0:19:40 perches on johnny's shoulder
0:19:42 okay uh you guys make it up to the top
0:19:45 uh they're waiting is arabella and uh
0:19:48 the gargoyle that was there earlier
0:19:51 are its dogs anywhere to be seen no
0:19:54 they step forward
0:19:56 around the collapse
0:19:57 we have the job
0:19:59 i think the circle
0:20:01 that
0:20:02 the demon was bound into
0:20:04 needs to be repaired
0:20:06 it's a pretty simple maneuver for us to
0:20:07 get back down there but
0:20:09 we lack the capability currently
0:20:12 to ask for help
0:20:14 yes
0:20:16 when
0:20:17 what happened
0:20:19 i believe
0:20:20 uh neil has made a deal with the demon
0:20:23 to get the codex
0:20:26 i kind of look i see
0:20:28 if you'd like i can unstake him and you
0:20:30 can ask
0:20:32 if you want i don't care uh
0:20:35 to clarify the demon is currently bound
0:20:37 inside neil okay
0:20:40 i think it has full rain
0:20:42 okay that was probably a bad decision on
0:20:44 your part but until the next dawn then
0:20:48 it goes back to its ring
0:20:50 okay there's three concentric rings
0:20:52 one's broken so yeah we're this i don't
0:20:54 live in boston so um
0:20:56 you don't think it's going to be a
0:20:57 problem um i'm sure it's going to be a
0:21:00 very big problem but i don't it's not my
0:21:02 problem
0:21:03 what would this demon do if we got out
0:21:05 give me a ballpark it all depends uh
0:21:08 jermeer bounded yes tremir did right i'm
0:21:11 saying would it go after tamir
0:21:14 i don't think that it would risk going
0:21:16 after those who have bound it right
0:21:18 now without some sort of greater
0:21:20 strategy oh i'm just worried about
0:21:22 innocents dying for no particular reason
0:21:24 i know that's
0:21:26 quite possibly less of a concern i'm
0:21:28 certain
0:21:30 that it will claim victims
0:21:32 we had to stick our coterie in me in
0:21:35 order to get this book i don't think
0:21:37 it's so much to ask to fix the ring
0:21:40 how long have you been in the camarilla
0:21:41 a couple days okay
0:21:44 miles i'm not maneuvering away from the
0:21:47 arrangement that we have right if you
0:21:50 are looking to create a new arrangement
0:21:52 we can discuss that after you have
0:21:55 honored your end of the deal
0:21:57 why would i agree to new things with you
0:22:00 if
0:22:01 you're already attempting to squeeze
0:22:03 this additional help i'm just trying to
0:22:05 stop a demon from getting out great i
0:22:07 understand that but
0:22:09 like to take two seconds let's put it
0:22:11 this way
0:22:13 if you keep [ __ ] around with us i'm
0:22:15 gonna pull this steak out let the demon
0:22:18 do what it wants to you and your friends
0:22:19 i will turn that stick to ash i do not
0:22:22 care and i care about i'm gonna tear
0:22:24 that [ __ ] book in half then tear it
0:22:27 in half johnny you've already brought it
0:22:29 to the surface honor the deal miles yes
0:22:32 stop
0:22:33 johnny and keep your bra in check
0:22:36 it's not helping right now
0:22:38 we also need to deal with the fact that
0:22:40 you or arabella cannot leave here
0:22:43 arabella can leave here so long as she
0:22:45 chooses quotation marks arabella listen
0:22:47 for them
0:22:49 you as arabella Rowlands great give me
0:22:52 the codex right but you can't
0:22:54 you are confusing the situation and
0:22:56 thinking that we have more to discuss
0:22:58 until you've turned it over fine
0:23:00 she holds her hand out
0:23:02 i give her the codex
0:23:05 you [ __ ] serious
0:23:07 i am honoring the deal i know with my
0:23:09 as far as the camarilla needs to know
0:23:13 i have met final death
0:23:16 i have the token you have the token
0:23:18 correct
0:23:20 you will never you will can no longer go
0:23:22 by
0:23:23 precisely
0:23:25 and i'll use the air codex to ensure
0:23:27 that i am able to do such
0:23:29 as far as your domain need be concerned
0:23:31 you are uh the hero of the
0:23:35 regardless of our other deals can you
0:23:37 provide us with the ability to keep that
0:23:40 demon at bay it is important to us and i
0:23:42 know that
0:23:43 it is beyond the original deal but it is
0:23:46 important to us what are you offering
0:23:49 what do you need
0:23:51 some kind of pace is a little bit
0:23:55 a sire
0:23:57 a sire yes
0:24:00 for who
0:24:01 i'm going to create a
0:24:05 ghost in the system
0:24:07 and
0:24:09 as far as the harpy records of
0:24:13 what's a good domain
0:24:15 washington dc knee be concerned
0:24:19 you had visited six years ago
0:24:22 impressed the prince he granted you
0:24:24 hospitality and you embraced a child
0:24:27 that child was put through the gauge was
0:24:29 accepted into The Ventrue i require that
0:24:33 you
0:24:34 corroborate that story whenever asked
0:24:37 is there any other ramifications i'm
0:24:38 gonna deal with that
0:24:40 don't get caught
0:24:41 i mean is this child gonna get up to
0:24:43 stuff
0:24:44 that child is going to be a very
0:24:47 dangerous woman
0:24:49 am i going to like the kind of dangerous
0:24:51 well that's up to you miles what is this
0:24:53 child planning on doing
0:24:55 perhaps a practice somewhere
0:24:58 i will do so
0:25:00 good
0:25:02 make sure i get the details it will take
0:25:04 time to repair the circle
0:25:06 uh i will let you know when it's ready
0:25:08 how much time i will let you know when
0:25:10 it's ready
0:25:12 we have until dawn
0:25:14 well
0:25:16 it will not be before then she kind of
0:25:18 chuckles and starts walking away fair
0:25:19 enough we'll make two
0:25:23 get in the van i will explain
0:25:26 i don't think there's a whole lot that
0:25:27 needs to be explained there are more
0:25:29 things that need to be explained
0:25:34 [Music]
0:25:37 so the group of you piled into the van
0:25:40 johnny starts driving a group of you
0:25:42 exchange occasional looks clearly having
0:25:44 a great deal on your mind
0:25:47 neil
0:25:48 looks to be trapped in this state of
0:25:50 pain
0:25:51 he doesn't move his eyes don't blink
0:25:53 it doesn't react at all it's it's like
0:25:56 driving around with your dead friend
0:25:58 with a wooden stake driven through his
0:26:00 heart
0:26:01 and after some time driving away from
0:26:03 the coast
0:26:04 you find yourselves headed back towards
0:26:07 boston
0:26:08 right down the highway you even hit a
0:26:10 point where you can now see the exit
0:26:12 what are you guys doing
0:26:14 johnny's looking
0:26:16 at
0:26:16 the signs in the highway and he
0:26:18 basically sees the turn off for 90. and
0:26:22 he can either head east
0:26:24 into boston or he can head west
0:26:27 back to connecticut and new haven
0:26:30 we gotta make a decision guys
0:26:32 i don't think it's a good idea to be
0:26:34 heading back into the court of quentin
0:26:35 king no we're out but there are some
0:26:38 powerful vampires there who might be a
0:26:40 little bit upset if we don't at least
0:26:42 say goodbye
0:26:43 do you think that
0:26:45 we'll get summoned back
0:26:47 if we go
0:26:50 i think that's going to be a risk no
0:26:52 matter what
0:26:53 we can't stay hostage in boston forever
0:26:56 yeah
0:26:58 we've made our way out arabella says
0:27:00 she's got us covered um i think if we're
0:27:02 going to leave this is the best
0:27:03 opportunity we're going to get and the
0:27:05 reason we came to boston is
0:27:07 to kill her theoretically been taken
0:27:10 care of arabella Rowlands no longer
0:27:12 exists also
0:27:14 roman pendragon
0:27:16 is a rather busy
0:27:18 kindred
0:27:20 he might
0:27:21 not want to be staying in boston for
0:27:24 multiple nights waiting for us to return
0:27:26 to him so we might even have at least a
0:27:28 couple of nights before he thinks about
0:27:30 that and hopefully
0:27:32 he forgets about us
0:27:34 i see him kind of you see him kind of
0:27:36 shake like he's not really believing his
0:27:38 own words at that point
0:27:40 do you think when you summon someone you
0:27:42 know where they're coming from
0:27:44 no but uh i think
0:27:47 as far as i understand it
0:27:50 you
0:27:52 you're compelled to go to that place
0:27:54 not to that person
0:27:56 it's weird
0:27:57 i think i could
0:27:59 do that
0:28:01 if we need it do what
0:28:03 it feels like
0:28:05 it feels like other
0:28:07 things that i've been able to reach
0:28:10 like reaching out to people
0:28:12 by my presence by my personality it
0:28:16 if i knew someone their name i i think i
0:28:19 could
0:28:20 do that same thing so you think you
0:28:22 could summon us back if we get summoned
0:28:24 i've never tried it i'm not sure
0:28:27 how it works it's just
0:28:29 talking about it hearing about it it
0:28:31 sounds familiar to me johnny who very
0:28:34 rarely ever takes his eyes off the road
0:28:37 usually just will
0:28:39 catch people's eyes in the rearview
0:28:41 actually turns back and kind of looks at
0:28:43 you like shocked that you've progressed
0:28:45 this far and then kind of just goes back
0:28:47 to looking at the road
0:28:49 what
0:28:50 is that bad
0:28:52 no i'm just
0:28:53 just impressed
0:28:55 oh
0:28:56 um thank you
0:28:57 i think
0:28:58 and being that with our new cargo it
0:29:00 might not be best to go back into boston
0:29:03 i don't know a lot about the particular
0:29:05 entity but it's probably not a good idea
0:29:08 it's not a good idea
0:29:10 when do you know anything about i don't
0:29:12 really want to call
0:29:14 can we nickname him or something that
0:29:17 and Brittain starts like pointing at zeal
0:29:20 z z seems like it works i just
0:29:23 i don't know
0:29:24 demons isn't there a bunch of stuff
0:29:26 about their names
0:29:28 you know a cult stuff win there is
0:29:30 there's
0:29:32 i don't know the specifics about it i
0:29:33 know that demons
0:29:36 demons exist at the edge of reality and
0:29:38 they're always looking for a way in
0:29:40 you can make bargains with them for
0:29:42 power but there's always a catch
0:29:45 i just
0:29:46 i
0:29:47 i'm superstitious i don't want to call
0:29:50 him
0:29:50 it makes it feel like it's a summoning
0:29:54 speaking of that i think calling it z is
0:29:56 fine
0:29:57 okay
0:29:59 so then
0:30:00 how do we say goodbye
0:30:02 to this so man we should probably
0:30:04 contact scourge sullivan
0:30:06 he was the nicest person we dealt with
0:30:09 in many cases and
0:30:11 he'll know who to tell the so that they
0:30:13 can tell quentin and
0:30:14 possibly pendragon from there that we
0:30:17 have taken our leave of the city all
0:30:19 right i
0:30:20 guess i can call it's a solid plan and
0:30:23 i'm generally not well liked within that
0:30:25 city so and they acknowledged you you're
0:30:27 practically almost part of their core
0:30:29 right
0:30:30 i am
0:30:32 is that how that works are they going to
0:30:34 be
0:30:35 mad in new haven
0:30:37 aren't they always
0:30:39 well i i just it feels like this i don't
0:30:41 know i i it is a slight i
0:30:45 unsure how much Rowlands is going
0:30:47 to care if Rowlands cares then a bit of
0:30:51 a bit of advice for you britta sure
0:30:54 uh
0:30:54 most of the camarilla
0:30:57 is determined by acting like you know
0:31:01 so
0:31:02 just uh
0:31:04 don't worry about apologizing for not
0:31:07 just uh fake it till you make it so to
0:31:09 speak
0:31:10 you get me
0:31:11 i think so
0:31:13 that's where you say yes
0:31:16 i just
0:31:17 yes i just don't
0:31:19 want to any other particular fallout i
0:31:21 can handle this isn't a big deal it's
0:31:23 just but if
0:31:25 if it upsets Rowlands then that's not
0:31:27 good for us
0:31:28 lots of things upset Rowlands
0:31:30 like what
0:31:32 that particular day
0:31:34 uh people talking to them in weird tones
0:31:37 we should have we're using a particular
0:31:38 tone
0:31:39 let's not get into the details of this
0:31:41 at this point the northeast is so [ __ ]
0:31:45 that we need to start having some real
0:31:47 talk with prince Rowlands so if he
0:31:49 doesn't like it he can shove it all
0:31:51 right no
0:31:53 he shouldn't
0:31:54 i mean we should be respectful he's a
0:31:56 prince
0:31:56 let's all take it down a notch johnny
0:31:58 kind of looks like he sighs a little bit
0:32:00 and goes oh yeah
0:32:02 i forgot
0:32:04 why don't you make that call
0:32:06 uh all right
0:32:08 and bretta pulls out her cell phone and
0:32:11 she calls the scourge hello sully
0:32:15 hi scourge this is bretta of the
0:32:17 visiting codery oh
0:32:19 i uh
0:32:21 admit i'm a little surprised to be
0:32:22 hearing from you how did it go
0:32:24 well we were calling to notify um it's
0:32:28 handled oh [ __ ] all right well
0:32:31 uh there's gonna be some need for uh
0:32:33 proof
0:32:34 of uh
0:32:36 arabella's
0:32:37 final death
0:32:39 um
0:32:40 but
0:32:41 you know arrangements can be made where
0:32:43 are you
0:32:44 um we're headed back to our domain we're
0:32:46 needed there
0:32:47 oh
0:32:49 all right so i guess this is uh goodbye
0:32:52 is there anything you want me to relate
0:32:53 to the prince
0:32:54 freda we'll turn to the rest of the car
0:32:57 hey anything else that we need to relay
0:32:58 other than thanks for the hospitality
0:33:00 yeah we're grateful for his hospitality
0:33:02 all right um
0:33:04 then i think the only thing that we need
0:33:06 to relay is
0:33:07 thank you very much to the prince for
0:33:09 his hospitality
0:33:10 all right i'll be sure to let them know
0:33:12 thank you very much all right you have a
0:33:14 good night you too
0:33:16 she hangs up
0:33:17 so handled well for now it sounds like
0:33:20 they're going to ask for some sort of
0:33:22 proof i have that you have it
0:33:25 okay the symbol that she gave me is not
0:33:26 something that
0:33:28 a
0:33:29 living venturer would give up
0:33:31 glad to hear
0:33:33 okay
0:33:34 so i guess we're taking a
0:33:37 90 uh back home then i'll trust you
0:33:40 johnny
0:33:41 yeah
0:33:42 um
0:33:43 wynn leans back and kind of just puts an
0:33:46 arm over her eyes and
0:33:48 just kind of veges out
0:33:50 yeah
0:33:51 let's talk when we get back all right
0:33:54 i don't really want to talk to neil like
0:33:56 this
0:33:57 yeah and the group of you head back a
0:33:59 long drive
0:34:01 but ultimately
0:34:02 shortly before dawn you make it back to
0:34:05 new haven and
0:34:07 you can see you know
0:34:08 the city itself and
0:34:10 the light pollution that kind of blots
0:34:13 out all of the stars
0:34:15 in the city you get to dix well
0:34:18 and the group of you started getting
0:34:20 ready to split up for the night who is
0:34:23 taking neil
0:34:24 uh
0:34:25 johnny will leave him in the van
0:34:28 uh when we're kind of discussing where
0:34:30 we're going
0:34:32 i uh
0:34:33 it's all the same to you i i can hang on
0:34:35 to neil for the time being i got a safe
0:34:37 spot and uh i'll probably have the
0:34:40 easiest time getting him down into my
0:34:41 haven sounds like a plan that's fair i
0:34:44 think that'll be good anywhere you
0:34:47 particularly want this uh vehicle
0:34:48 stashed miles where did this van come
0:34:50 from again
0:34:52 you don't have to worry about it if if
0:34:53 uh i'll i'll i'll make sure it finds the
0:34:55 right it's right here yeah wherever you
0:34:57 want you can keep it you can get rid of
0:34:59 it you can torch it whatever
0:35:01 you have no idea what we do with the
0:35:02 domains motor pool do you
0:35:04 no
0:35:05 johnny goes to grab his uh another
0:35:07 morley and notices that he is finally
0:35:09 out of
0:35:10 uh cigarettes he grimaces
0:35:13 do you uh when you need a ride back over
0:35:15 towards your uh place no i think i've
0:35:17 got enough time to walk rita you and
0:35:20 miles are pretty close you're gonna be
0:35:21 good
0:35:22 i think so and if it's all the same i'm
0:35:25 gonna get out of here
0:35:26 sky's starting to look like it's
0:35:28 lightning
0:35:30 all right
0:35:30 let's talk soon everybody meet up early
0:35:33 tomorrow
0:35:34 tonight tomorrow night
0:35:37 you leave uh
0:35:38 yeah hit me up on my uh on my pager when
0:35:41 you figure out where you want to meet up
0:35:43 i was going to say leave a message at
0:35:45 the sheriff's office but i'm not sure if
0:35:47 we can trust that quite yet no it might
0:35:49 be best to meet up my haven since this
0:35:51 discussion probably can't be for any
0:35:54 outside years okay you can also use mine
0:35:56 if you want
0:35:57 i don't have furniture but
0:35:59 it's quiet
0:36:00 there is a distinct not happy looking at
0:36:03 the suggestion from
0:36:06 maybe some other time all right good
0:36:08 night good night good work
0:36:10 everyone and the group of you part ways
0:36:15 [Music]
0:36:20 things pick up the next night
0:36:22 when the sun finally sets over new haven
0:36:26 and miles
0:36:28 you wake up in your haven
0:36:30 feeling
0:36:32 off
0:36:34 it is the first time since becoming a
0:36:36 kindred
0:36:38 you feel a little lightheaded
0:36:40 maybe a little under the weather
0:36:43 as you sit up
0:36:46 you realize that
0:36:47 marco
0:36:49 isn't tending to you
0:36:51 he doesn't bring over clothes
0:36:53 he doesn't bring the news
0:36:56 he isn't in your room at all
0:37:00 my peer around
0:37:02 check to see if there's any notes and
0:37:04 then
0:37:05 i proceed to put on whatever and
0:37:10 i look around the house for him
0:37:12 as you explore the house you do notice
0:37:15 that
0:37:16 the main bathroom light is on
0:37:20 and
0:37:22 as you slip
0:37:24 into the bathroom
0:37:26 you see
0:37:28 a tub filled with red
0:37:32 and beside it
0:37:34 on a neatly folded towel beside a knife
0:37:39 is the book
0:37:41 that re-escaped you
0:37:43 in the tub
0:37:44 with deep
0:37:46 deep slashes going
0:37:48 down from
0:37:51 marco's
0:37:52 inner elbows
0:37:54 right on down to the wrist
0:37:57 it looks as though he has largely bled
0:37:59 out
0:38:01 i'm your lips are cold his skin is blue
0:38:03 check him
0:38:06 he is dead
0:38:09 i
0:38:10 take my coat off and then i will proceed
0:38:12 to pick up the note
0:38:14 when you open the note
0:38:17 it says something very simple
0:38:20 do not spit in the face of gifts
0:38:24 sign simply with the letter r
0:38:30 as you kind of look his eye stirs
0:38:34 and you start to get a sense that he's
0:38:35 right there right between
0:38:37 can i
0:38:39 embrace him
0:38:42 doing so
0:38:44 violates the traditions
0:38:47 and you would be embracing a ventrue it
0:38:49 is likely that he would be put to death
0:38:53 but the choice is yours
0:38:55 would giving him blood
0:38:57 give him the ability to heal if he dies
0:39:00 you will have embraced him
0:39:04 i'll deal with that
0:39:06 describe what you do
0:39:08 i
0:39:10 take the knife that was so nicely left
0:39:12 for me and cut myself open and proceed
0:39:15 to feed him
0:39:17 the blood as i see that he's still
0:39:19 around and see if he can't use any of it
0:39:22 to
0:39:23 rouse himself
0:39:25 if
0:39:26 embraces a possibility but
0:39:29 i can't not do this
0:39:32 you feed him your blood
0:39:35 and
0:39:38 for a moment
0:39:39 it feels like everything might be okay
0:39:43 his hand even reaches up to kind of
0:39:45 grasp onto your forearm and like
0:39:47 hold on to you as he drinks this like
0:39:50 thing he has wanted
0:39:52 desperately for a long long time
0:39:56 but then he does
0:40:00 and he just lays back
0:40:02 blue
0:40:04 and sanguinated
0:40:06 and the blood-filled tub
0:40:10 remind him is there more that i need to
0:40:11 do to embrace him or anything you've
0:40:12 done your part
0:40:14 i am
0:40:16 going to
0:40:17 drain the tub
0:40:19 wash out the blood while seeing if he
0:40:22 comes around
0:40:23 get him
0:40:24 his clothes
0:40:26 and
0:40:28 i need

0:41:58 quick thank you bretta will hang up and
0:42:01 bretta will go to one of the clubs that
0:42:03 he's surrounded
0:42:08 [Music]
0:42:16 inopportune time
0:42:18 you become accustomed to it
0:42:20 fair enough who is your friend
0:42:23 the one on the top
0:42:25 yes marco the me
0:42:28 was he a friend of yours
0:42:30 yes
0:42:33 that's very sad
0:42:35 yes
0:42:37 your existence
0:42:40 as a canine
0:42:42 is
0:42:44 one of suffering
0:42:46 i can feel your pain
0:42:49 welcome to this existence
0:42:52 i'm continuing to move around and yeah
0:42:54 get stuff going and then to monitor the
0:42:56 bathroom but from like
0:42:58 outside the door basically
0:43:00 you are beyond
0:43:03 the death of a mood
0:43:06 but you cannot escape its consequence
0:43:11 that's true that's
0:43:13 part of the deal
0:43:15 it's unfortunate
0:43:18 i'm beyond death
0:43:21 but that left you trapped in a circle
0:43:22 for how long
0:43:24 not
0:43:25 so long that i couldn't wait
0:43:27 wait for you
0:43:29 but now i'm here
0:43:31 you are
0:43:33 and with me all my power
0:43:36 over life
0:43:38 and death
0:43:42 do you
0:43:43 miss your friends marco
0:43:47 yes
0:43:50 do you want your friend marco
0:43:53 you should not suffer from my mistakes
0:43:56 i agree
0:43:59 a noble stance
0:44:02 i can give him back to you
0:44:06 at what cost one share
0:44:10 so everything would be even everything a
0:44:13 tied vote
0:44:14 yes
0:44:17 until you can bargain for another show
0:44:20 yes
0:44:23 i see no reason to hide it from you
0:44:26 you will suffer
0:44:28 yes
0:44:30 you would slowly lose yourself to me yes
0:44:33 this is all true but marco will not
0:44:37 suffer
0:44:39 isn't that what you want
0:44:42 he is currently
0:44:43 beyond that
0:44:45 no
0:44:47 no he is not
0:44:49 your friend marco's sinned
0:44:52 he sinned often
0:44:55 because he told him to
0:44:58 and it is his soul
0:45:01 that will reap the consequences of his
0:45:03 obedience to you
0:45:07 because i know what lies beyond death
0:45:10 i know awaits man
0:45:13 i know who will take great pleasure
0:45:16 in his arrival
0:45:18 i closed the door one chair
0:45:23 and the voice falls silent
0:45:27 when i move
0:45:29 and kind of just
0:45:32 sit against the wall next to the closed
0:45:34 door
0:45:35 hoping
0:45:36 to hear the stirring
0:45:39 how long does this usually take
0:45:42 so it can actually vary okay so you may
0:45:44 find yourself waiting all night to find
0:45:46 out whether or not
0:45:47 the embrace took and it's not a
0:45:50 a guaranteed thing right
0:45:52 sometimes the body has too much trauma
0:45:54 sometimes
0:45:56 the embrace just doesn't take
0:45:59 [Music]
0:46:04 Britta
0:46:06 you find that when you approach these
0:46:08 people
0:46:09 they are blood dolls and
0:46:11 are very happy to come along for
0:46:14 you know a good time
0:46:16 and
0:46:17 they even offer uh themselves to you in
0:46:20 case you find yourself in need of vitae
0:46:22 is hungry
0:46:24 and she will ask them
0:46:27 to wait until she sees what miles needs
0:46:31 you are able to get uh
0:46:33 two kind of like up and coming like
0:46:36 rappers who have like they're working on
0:46:39 their mixtapes and
0:46:41 have been kind of like trying to break
0:46:42 into some industry so they're making all
0:46:44 kinds of like weird agreements and have
0:46:46 found their way into uh miles's uh
0:46:49 little book i'm able to get two people
0:46:52 to come with me yes okay so bretta like
0:46:55 hears that offer and you know there's
0:46:57 that flash of the beasts where she's
0:47:00 hungry and would like to consider it but
0:47:03 she's on a mission so she leads them
0:47:05 back to my houses
0:47:07 you arrive to miles's home and
0:47:09 immediately
0:47:11 upon crossing the threshold into the
0:47:13 haven you feel an unsettling chill
0:47:17 there's something bad about this place
0:47:21 bretta
0:47:22 stops
0:47:23 and takes a look around
0:47:25 is it familiar to her does it feel like
0:47:28 a romeo does it feel just bad just feels
0:47:31 bad
0:47:32 miles
0:47:35 inside
0:47:36 and she'll motion to the guys that she's
0:47:39 brought with her
0:47:41 hey i've got the people
0:47:44 very good
0:47:45 all right come with me please
0:47:48 uh when you head over to miles he's like
0:47:50 stained with blood
0:47:52 miles are you okay
0:47:54 i'm currently fine
0:47:57 are you
0:47:58 sure
0:47:59 yes um situate them in the
0:48:02 music room
0:48:04 give them glasses of alcohol whatever
0:48:06 all right i'll be right back keep
0:48:07 themselves amused usually
0:48:09 and bretta will go do that
0:48:12 uh she'll bring them to the correct room
0:48:13 and like leave them a bottle of wine
0:48:15 some glasses and she'll come back to
0:48:17 miles i need to go look into the
0:48:20 the first bathroom on this floor
0:48:22 okay
0:48:24 and she'll do so like i stand at the end
0:48:26 of the hall and watch but like
0:48:28 i've slowly just kind of kept near but
0:48:31 can't get near
0:48:33 susan but over to the the bathroom right
0:48:35 right i can see her but basically like
0:48:37 yeah what does it look like at this
0:48:39 point what changes have you made it's
0:48:41 cleaner yeah the blood has been washed
0:48:43 away the the tub has been drained
0:48:46 he's
0:48:47 got essentially a towel over him and his
0:48:49 clothes are folded up on the toilet next
0:48:51 to him
0:48:52 Britta steps inside the bathroom and
0:48:55 spots
0:48:56 what's there and she stops
0:49:00 in the doorway she takes it in
0:49:03 with that almost like almost a human
0:49:06 instinct to stop breathing
0:49:09 of course she doesn't breathe so it's
0:49:10 more like a total stillness
0:49:13 and
0:49:14 she looks over her shoulder to miles
0:49:18 before finding the note in her vision
0:49:20 too
0:49:21 she goes look at the note the book
0:49:25 rhys
0:49:26 killed marcos
0:49:29 he has
0:49:30 violated
0:49:32 quite a few things today
0:49:34 miles i'm
0:49:36 i'm so sorry i performed the embrace
0:49:38 upon him
0:49:40 you
0:49:42 wait
0:49:43 on on
0:49:45 marcos yes
0:49:47 you talked to prince Rowlands i'll figure
0:49:50 the details out
0:49:52 you you
0:49:53 you didn't talk to prince Rowlands
0:49:56 not
0:49:56 yet miles he could kill you for that
0:50:00 he's going to have a hard time
0:50:03 he
0:50:04 no no no no no he could he could kill
0:50:07 you for that yes
0:50:09 you think i'm not aware of the rules
0:50:12 i i understand you taught them to me but
0:50:16 we can't do that miles
0:50:19 we can't undo it either
0:50:22 yes we can i
0:50:24 by doing this you're risking yourself
0:50:27 do you understand that
0:50:28 and you read the note
0:50:31 i don't think rhys is going to catch any
0:50:34 heat for this
0:50:35 that's not what i meant
0:50:38 then what do you mean i have to do
0:50:40 something
0:50:41 what do you have to do
0:50:42 he was not
0:50:44 the punishment is not for him
0:50:47 so he gets what he wants hopefully
0:50:50 and i will deal with the
0:50:52 fallout you don't have to be punished
0:50:55 twice
0:50:56 by the domain and by race
0:50:59 i'll figure out the domain
0:51:01 and then i will figure out rhys
0:51:04 if Reiss knows where your haven is
0:51:07 this is not the only thing that he can
0:51:10 do
0:51:11 he should not have been in my haven
0:51:13 no he shouldn't have but it's not going
0:51:15 to
0:51:16 this is a first strike miles
0:51:19 this is a warning shot and i know that's
0:51:22 cold of me to say and i'm sorry i wish i
0:51:24 didn't have to say this right now but
0:51:26 this is him saying what he could do to
0:51:27 you
0:51:28 and what are you trying to tell me to do
0:51:30 now
0:51:31 i don't know if you can save marcos
0:51:34 what i've done i've already done
0:51:37 and i have more options if i decide to
0:51:39 pursue them
0:51:42 i will not let this pass

0:52:48 [Music]
0:52:56 i feel like that knowledge might
0:52:57 actually be commonplace amongst the
0:52:59 venture of new haven
0:53:00 unfortunately i have no idea
0:53:02 The Ventrue we'll share that with each
0:53:03 other yeah okay yeah yeah and i feel
0:53:05 that means i know what her feeding
0:53:06 restriction is though honestly i feel
0:53:08 like you
0:53:09 you hold parties in which there's a
0:53:11 bunch of musicians at your house
0:53:12 relatively often and i feel like
0:53:17 well mostly because you mentioned it
0:53:18 outside without telling us what it was
0:53:20 and i was like very interested intrigued
0:53:22 oh you you do want to she used to feed
0:53:24 between 12 and 12 30.
