0:00:11 um we're doing this because we wrapped
0:00:12 up season two
0:00:13 and we had put the pull out on on
0:00:17 Twitter and ask a few people like hey
0:00:19 does anybody want to just hear from us
0:00:20 because we constantly get like a bunch
0:00:21 of questions and uh figured it would be
0:00:23 good for us to just check in and do some
0:00:27 you know q a stuff and talk about how
0:00:29 we're all doing uh
0:00:32 but in K because we don't actually do it
0:00:35 in any of the episodes uh other than in
0:00:37 the outro do we want to go around the
0:00:39 table and just like introduce ourselves
0:00:41 real quick
0:00:43 um no

0:01:21 one of the questions we'll get to later
0:01:22 yes
0:01:25 all right
0:01:26 um before we get into all your actual
0:01:28 questions and stuff because we had asked
0:01:30 for questions on like Twitter I think
0:01:32 we've done Facebook we definitely put it
0:01:33 in front of some episodes uh so we got a
0:01:35 bunch of questions from a ton of people
0:01:36 uh and we'll go through
0:01:39 um thank you everybody who sent
0:01:40 questions in thank you
0:01:41 [Music]
0:01:43 before we do that though I kind of want
0:01:45 to talk about like now that we've got
0:01:47 two full seasons 50 official episodes uh
0:01:52 five
0:01:54 in-betweens and uh and a special
0:01:56 Halloween episode like

0:02:00 how's how's everybody feeling
0:02:02 [Laughter]
0:02:09 anybody how do you feel three years feel
0:02:11 surprisingly short it does yeah
0:02:14 um I think I think when I was when I
0:02:16 don't know if it's the same for you guys
0:02:17 when I was younger three years seems
0:02:18 like a long [ __ ] time now three years
0:02:21 is like a blink of the eye and I'm
0:02:25 getting really terrified about being old
0:02:27 as dirty yeah
0:02:30 [ __ ] yeah I just had a birthday and one
0:02:33 of the first graders I was working with
0:02:35 wanted to do the are you one are you two
0:02:38 so I let him go and so he gets like are
0:02:41 you 25. all right
0:02:43 and I'm like you're not even close Bud
0:02:46 you're gonna drink some water let's take
0:02:49 a break baby boy yeah I'm 25 just just
0:02:52 believe that live save yourself you're
0:02:55 not gonna make it hot oh God I don't
0:02:57 wanna I don't want to do CPR on a
0:02:58 seven-year-old just never stop him he's
0:03:01 like 112.
0:03:04 I am ancient child and this is gonna be
0:03:07 on time hey this joke applies
0:03:09 Rebecca Rebecca you're what like 17.
0:03:12 15 or something I don't know
0:03:14 I am a 27.
0:03:17 don't answer his questions
0:03:20 uh yeah you can just don't
0:03:24 listen this is a q a I might as well
0:03:27 answer questions
0:03:28 I ageless in a noble Beyond Time
0:03:32 I can work technology [ __ ]
0:03:37 you got me there no honestly like I'm
0:03:40 not good at time I understanding time
0:03:43 but the fact of recording the Q a right
0:03:45 after we release
0:03:47 the season two finale makes it more real
0:03:50 yeah and uh that's
0:03:53 it's weird I haven't quite I always say
0:03:55 I'm like pretty slow with emotional
0:03:56 processing and uh
0:04:00 it's more real uh due to like you know
0:04:03 the cool interactions from fans and uh
0:04:05 being grateful in that way and getting
0:04:07 to see uh getting to see the rest of the
0:04:11 group uh being recognized and all that
0:04:13 really helps me so that makes that makes
0:04:15 it seem like it's actually been
0:04:17 happening since 2019. yeah like so we're
0:04:20 recording this on a Friday the season
0:04:22 two finale came out Wednesday so like a
0:04:27 lot of it is very fresh and uh
0:04:29 yeah well I know on Wednesdays for me
0:04:32 like we've got a bunch of fans on
0:04:33 Twitter who like live tweet all the
0:04:34 reactions and then people on Facebook
0:04:37 it's so
0:04:39 legitimately like the word I keep coming
0:04:41 back to is sustaining right like it just
0:04:45 feels really good to see people freak
0:04:47 the [ __ ] out well and there's so much
0:04:50 nice there's like so many kind things
0:04:51 put through on email and like coffee and
0:04:53 all that yeah
0:04:55 like all over the platforms that to me
0:04:57 at least like again I'm not good at
0:04:59 recognizing time but that makes it feel
0:05:01 real yeah the the odd part about having
0:05:04 total strangers get excited when you
0:05:07 like something on their timeline or you
0:05:10 know having someone from a vastly
0:05:12 different part of my life say hey I
0:05:14 stumbled upon this podcast and I clicked
0:05:17 on it because hey nobody does podcasts
0:05:19 about New England and holy [ __ ] that's
0:05:22 you yeah that's that's that's happened
0:05:24 once or twice and it's like always very
0:05:25 cool being like guys I found this cool
0:05:27 pocket wait a minute
0:05:29 uh yeah seeing it reach outside like
0:05:32 start reaching outside the circles yeah
0:05:33 like because at first right it was like
0:05:35 mostly people we know and friends and
0:05:37 all kind of stuff and I remember we got
0:05:39 us on a shared Discord our first couple
0:05:41 of fans who were like interacting with
0:05:43 us were like hey I found you on Spotify
0:05:44 and like I love you [ __ ] and just felt
0:05:48 really good and now like as of today we
0:05:52 are house I I think I shared it earlier
0:05:54 House of households part two is cracking
0:05:57 record like download records for us like
0:05:59 that's awesome it feels just to see that
0:06:02 continuous growth of Engagement and
0:06:03 stuff it feels real it feels really good
0:06:05 it's very it's very gratifying and
0:06:07 satisfying yeah
0:06:08 it's very cool to see someone get
0:06:10 excited about something you are also
0:06:12 excited and passionate so that's the
0:06:14 thing though right like we've got fans
0:06:16 who are excited to see the stuff we are
0:06:19 also legitimately freaking out about our
0:06:21 own stuff like not in like a
0:06:23 narcissistic way but in like a like
0:06:25 thinking about the game because it is a
0:06:28 game right like so getting excited to
0:06:30 come to the table be like Lex what the
0:06:31 [ __ ] you doing is like
0:06:34 feels good
0:06:36 um so yeah oh I'm sorry no I would say
0:06:39 also I like the live trading because I
0:06:40 get to practice my gift game
0:06:43 yeah I think you and I are getting
0:06:45 better at it but
0:06:48 I'm using more of them
0:06:51 I don't know if that means better
0:06:54 right on
0:06:56 um that sort of leads us like I guess so
0:06:58 we have this question from a lot of
0:07:00 people
0:07:01 um why
0:07:04 not I'm like not like a challenging way
0:07:06 but like how did we do this like what
0:07:08 made us decide to like start wax don't
0:07:10 give me the last
0:07:12 actually before because I think mostly
0:07:15 Lex should answer this question I agree
0:07:17 but uh I would like to preface it a
0:07:19 little bit um because I think
0:07:22 um the a bunch of us started getting
0:07:24 into podcasts uh maybe like you know
0:07:29 2013 it's been a little while yeah yeah
0:07:32 I think you and I definitely were
0:07:34 starting to listen to Tim definitely as
0:07:35 well yeah we were starting to listen to
0:07:37 a lot of podcasts around 2013-ish when
0:07:39 it when things I think podcasting
0:07:41 started to like that's when it really
0:07:42 started to like getting gaining momentum
0:07:44 and speed and there's a lot of people
0:07:46 doing cool stuff with that and uh I
0:07:49 found a Kickstarter for some board game
0:07:52 um or a tabletop game that I was really
0:07:54 interested in I wanted to know more
0:07:55 about the game before I kick started it
0:07:56 and so I was looking around for reviews
0:07:58 and I stumbled up across the one shot
0:08:01 you found one shot yeah uh they did a
0:08:04 One-Shot podcast Network which is run by
0:08:07 James demotto James seriously man um I
0:08:10 got a chance to meet him one day at uh
0:08:13 meditopia and I was totally [ __ ]
0:08:15 weird because I was like geeking out and
0:08:16 I was like I really like your podcast
0:08:18 and I think I gave him like a weird vibe
0:08:20 whatever so James if you ever hear this
0:08:22 I'm sorry man if I was like weird to you
0:08:25 but he's weird don't worry but
0:08:27 regardless
0:08:28 um one shot's amazing if anybody's
0:08:30 looking for great tabletop podcasting to
0:08:32 listen to campaign skyjacks is like the
0:08:34 high water Market hey man uh campaign
0:08:37 the original Star Wars campaign campaign
0:08:39 skyjacks and honestly any of the
0:08:41 One-Shot ones where they explore a you
0:08:43 know all the cool Indie tabletops that
0:08:45 are coming out those guys are such
0:08:48 freaking like you know important
0:08:51 podcasters in my mind that I look to for
0:08:55 inspiration and how to make a good
0:08:57 podcast
0:08:58 um yeah and that extends to all of the
0:09:00 people out in Chicago because that's how
0:09:02 I ended up finding like uh you know all
0:09:04 the stuff that like like because JPC was
0:09:07 on uh campaign and then he does what a
0:09:10 real riddle with adult rafai and then
0:09:12 adult rafai is part of hello from Magic
0:09:14 Tavern
0:09:15 um uh yeah that's just all so there's a
0:09:18 huge like you know uh I you know I'm
0:09:20 geeking out about the Chicago podcast
0:09:22 scene but those guys are really really
0:09:24 cool and they do really awesome podcasts
0:09:26 and it got me thinking that like
0:09:29 that could be something cool to do that
0:09:30 could be fun
0:09:31 um so I I think you know I I think
0:09:34 because of that we were at least you
0:09:37 know myself I'm sure you and and Tim
0:09:40 were all kind of dropping ideas about
0:09:41 podcasting to be cool podcasting be cool
0:09:44 and then Lex uh really wanted to put
0:09:48 something out there that tapped into to
0:09:50 some of those old Vibes of 90s vampire
0:09:54 the Masquerade that really tapped into
0:09:56 the you know the the original
0:09:59 kind of like fun tabletop game that was
0:10:01 different than D D
0:10:03 um
0:10:04 and I I think that's vampire I don't
0:10:06 know if you agree with that
0:10:08 um
0:10:09 but I'm Lex you should probably talk
0:10:11 about this from this guy
0:10:13 yeah so I uh I
0:10:17 I was feeling kind of this uh as a lot
0:10:21 of the new kind of vampire stuff is
0:10:23 coming out
0:10:24 I had found myself kind of chatting
0:10:27 about the lore and reminiscing and kind
0:10:30 of thinking back to some of the old
0:10:31 table tops that I used to do
0:10:34 you know when I was like 15 years old
0:10:36 and telling like weird world of Darkness
0:10:39 stories and you know we all had like we
0:10:41 were all sharing one copy of the core
0:10:43 book
0:10:44 and we were pulling cash to get the
0:10:46 client books as they were coming out
0:10:48 like like that era was vampire your
0:10:51 first tabletop werewolf the apocalypse
0:10:53 was my first world of Darkness tabletop
0:10:56 what was your first tabletop uh the
0:10:58 first tabletop I ever ran is that a
0:11:01 question I've got so many questions you
0:11:03 keep jumping the gun I'm sorry man no
0:11:05 you're good you're good
0:11:06 uh the first thing with top of Iran was
0:11:09 Dragon Ball Z are you serious yep and it
0:11:13 was interesting because uh in a lot of
0:11:15 ways the system kind of just didn't work
0:11:18 um because it was a tabletop game you'd
0:11:20 end up with like so in the show most
0:11:23 fights are one-on-one and the characters
0:11:25 kind of take turns like shooting their
0:11:28 shot and trying to be the one that like
0:11:29 beats this bad guy and it didn't really
0:11:32 work as a tabletop because it just kind
0:11:35 of became like you know apc's dog pile
0:11:38 this one guy and he's like just super
0:11:40 dead no line said
0:11:42 so I ended up having to kind of make all
0:11:44 these like little rules and eventually
0:11:47 became this whole
0:11:49 scenario where it became more about
0:11:52 kind of like in term like in wrestling
0:11:55 terms mic work then the actual like
0:11:58 Dyson powers and whatnot
0:12:00 and that kind of got us wanting to try
0:12:03 other games
0:12:06 so then and will the darkness ended up
0:12:09 kind of being the best means to like
0:12:11 have lore to discuss and have a
0:12:15 rivalries and kind of be able to get a
0:12:17 little over the top but keep it you know
0:12:20 within the realm of the story we're
0:12:21 trying to tell was so that's kind of how
0:12:23 I I got there eventually yeah
0:12:27 um
0:12:27 so like so some of the like further
0:12:29 questions from people were or things
0:12:31 like so you know talking about the lore
0:12:33 and like why why did we want to do like
0:12:35 why what was the process of like turning
0:12:38 that like hey I'm having reminiscence
0:12:40 about vampire into like the story you
0:12:43 wanted to tell why do an actual play
0:12:46 like Garrett was talking about like you
0:12:47 know our the podcast stuff uh that we
0:12:50 were talking about but like for you
0:12:52 like I remember you and I talking like
0:12:54 sitting at the house at one point just
0:12:56 shooting [ __ ] about stuff and kind of
0:12:58 being like well we just [ __ ] could uh
0:13:01 what what was like that step for us uh
0:13:05 or for you between like I have this idea
0:13:08 and like nah [ __ ] it like let's find a
0:13:10 mic somewhere and let's do it
0:13:13 um
0:13:14 I mean I think we bounced it back and
0:13:16 forth and
0:13:19 well I was kind of hemming or knowing
0:13:21 about the idea
0:13:23 it was actually Tim that was like hey
0:13:26 this is actually kind of viable here's
0:13:28 how we could uh set things up so we can
0:13:31 afford it because you know we did kind
0:13:33 of want to figure out how we were gonna
0:13:34 like budget the thing and yeah it was
0:13:38 like well I mean if so if Tim is like
0:13:41 hey I think we can afford this I'm like
0:13:43 all right we're we're good guys even if
0:13:46 you did have like that 300 extra dollars
0:13:47 left over from oi that you'd forgotten
0:13:49 yeah yeah so I I had uh I had uh run
0:13:52 like a whole LARP that had like a little
0:13:54 a little bit of cash that had raised and
0:13:57 I just kind of left it there because I I
0:13:59 wasn't running the LARP to make money so
0:14:01 it just sat I was also in charge of the
0:14:03 cash yeah so Tim was like Hey you have
0:14:05 this thing just do the thing with this
0:14:07 thing and I was like whoa
0:14:10 Tim what are the questions one of the
0:14:13 questions for later is uh if we could
0:14:16 just [ __ ] do now forget it is um
0:14:18 so euthanasia on coffee specifically
0:14:20 want to know like what we all do for a
0:14:21 living
0:14:23 and so I'm just going to read this on
0:14:24 verbatim because it's like I would very
0:14:26 much like to know without going into too
0:14:27 much private detail of course what your
0:14:29 guys professions are I've been thinking
0:14:30 about this for the longest time because
0:14:32 the show is so well made in my head you
0:14:35 guys have to be involved in Show
0:14:36 Business in some way
0:14:38 uh which is wildly flattering uh but
0:14:43 there is a reason that Lex is talking
0:14:44 about like Tim being the guy who was
0:14:48 like hey we can do this uh so Tim like
0:14:52 man let's start with you what do you do
0:14:53 for a living I mean Show Business also
0:14:55 needs people who counts money so he's
0:14:57 completely correct they are completely
0:14:59 correct that's uh I am a tax accountant
0:15:02 by trade
0:15:04 um
0:15:05 and just a regular account most of the
0:15:07 time
0:15:09 I don't know where I was going with that
0:15:11 but uh I got you okay
0:15:14 uh yeah so I I handle the money in our
0:15:17 scheduling so all for the show yeah the
0:15:19 show would not run without him because
0:15:21 like Tim provides the recording space he
0:15:23 is the one who schedules everything he
0:15:25 like literally logistical wingman for
0:15:29 just about everything this podcast does
0:15:31 yeah I mean yeah it's Alexis play like
0:15:33 literally without Tim we I think this
0:15:35 would be a very cool idea that we all
0:15:38 still had we would be meeting like once
0:15:40 every six months somewhere and not have
0:15:43 the right equipment still yeah I
0:15:44 straight up like yo Tim
0:15:47 is this possible and I was like yeah
0:15:49 it's actually hilariously easy remember
0:15:51 this and I was like I don't remember
0:15:52 that at all it's just like yeah let's do
0:15:55 it and they also let me deliver lines
0:15:57 too so it's great
0:15:59 hell yeah uh Erica what do you do for a
0:16:02 living
0:16:03 [Music]
0:16:04 so I've done a lot of things
0:16:10 for years to list them all an
0:16:12 alphabetical order
0:16:13 uh alphabetical order go [ __ ] yourself

0:18:13 create cases and
0:18:17 [Music]
0:18:22 what's sort of talked about when this
0:18:23 question first came in we talked about
0:18:24 like you know it's kind of fun because
0:18:26 that this is like you guys have to be
0:18:28 involved in Like Show Business like nah
0:18:30 we're just like some [ __ ] regular-ass
0:18:31 people that being said if you want to
0:18:33 hire us for show business I mean yes
0:18:35 yeah we're in
0:18:39 we're in um contact me yeah I'll tell
0:18:43 you should be directed to Tim I uh I am
0:18:46 in I'm an ex-reporter I'm currently a
0:18:48 communications director so I do a lot of
0:18:50 like brand management stuff but like
0:18:52 it used to be a newspaper I used to be a
0:18:54 newspaper man
0:18:56 um
0:18:56 and uh you're like talking about Erica
0:18:59 so we've done a lot of stuff like you
0:19:00 know I work for nonprofits but uh for a
0:19:03 big chunk of the beginning of this I was
0:19:06 fully unemployed
0:19:08 uh for like
0:19:10 half the last three years so like
0:19:13 this has been a very fun project kova
0:19:17 didn't make that easier to get a job
0:19:18 it's so weird when you when you get laid
0:19:21 off right before covid starts it makes
0:19:24 it real hard to find a job coincidence
0:19:26 coincidence
0:19:29 uh and then our actual Showbiz person
0:19:32 Rebecca I do I'm I'm an author and a
0:19:36 playwright uh so in that in that amount
0:19:39 yes
0:19:39 [Laughter]
0:19:42 moving into like having answered that
0:19:44 right like and sort of talking about the
0:19:46 the Genesis of the idea
0:19:48 um and how Tim helped us to actually
0:19:50 actualize it uh
0:19:54 what was sort of the process
0:19:57 um
0:19:58 like
0:19:59 we sort of all know like obviously we
0:20:01 all know each other but like and lexu
0:20:03 obviously would like as the the sort of
0:20:05 spearhead of this like creatively
0:20:08 um
0:20:09 how do we so so uh a bunch of people
0:20:11 wanted to know how do we settle on us as
0:20:13 the group to do this like
0:20:15 you know did we have a casting process
0:20:18 did we all know each other beforehand
0:20:21 like why were we the people Chosen and
0:20:24 then because I sort of know the answer
0:20:25 to this I'm just gonna Loop into it uh
0:20:27 how much experience we can all go around
0:20:29 and talk about it uh after so like how
0:20:30 much experience do each of us have with
0:20:32 gaming and with the world of Darkness
0:20:36 I know it's like a lot of questions but
0:20:37 they all sort of bleed in
0:20:39 well the answer is
0:20:43 answering this we're going to view we're
0:20:45 going to be talking yeah we had a lot of
0:20:47 different people ask these different
0:20:48 questions so to start with like
0:20:52 why are we the group why like how did we
0:20:55 all come together to do this
0:20:57 so when I decided to do this I I
0:21:01 distinctly recall actually having the
0:21:03 conversation with you guys
0:21:04 uh you guys are like oh you know it can
0:21:07 be whoever you want it doesn't have to
0:21:09 be us or anything like that and and I
0:21:11 took that to heart honestly originally I
0:21:14 actually
0:21:15 was not sure who at all would be part of
0:21:20 the cast of characters
0:21:22 so what I did was I made a list of
0:21:28 things that I wanted at the table
0:21:31 um and in terms of like
0:21:34 fire mentalities uh his ability to kind
0:21:37 of like uh create dialogue between
0:21:41 characters I just kind of really spent a
0:21:43 lot of time being like you know who has
0:21:46 these like distinct voices and
0:21:48 personalities that I think would be
0:21:51 comfortable on a mic and uh as I made
0:21:55 the list I just kind of crossed off
0:21:58 names until I came to a group that I
0:22:01 thought would be able to steadily attend
0:22:03 who would play characters Dynamic from
0:22:07 each other uh so like even like among
0:22:10 you know the guys right the three of you
0:22:13 um you guys do not uh
0:22:17 generally have any interest in
0:22:19 portraying similar characters at all and
0:22:22 can look at the exact same thing and
0:22:24 really just kind of see three totally
0:22:27 different things and
0:22:29 wow and and I just kind of felt that
0:22:32 sort of uh attitude as a player was you
0:22:36 know what what the table would need
0:22:38 and I think I I think no one knew
0:22:41 Rebecca at the time she was I I uh I
0:22:45 knew you yeah uh best and then I knew
0:22:48 Rob from parlor LARP from playing camera
0:22:51 vampire yeah and I knew Garrett from
0:22:54 buffer but only a little bit we hadn't
0:22:56 talked very much no no and I think maybe
0:23:01 I met I'm not even sure if I'd ever met
0:23:04 you two in passing Erica and Tim no I
0:23:07 met you for the first time when we went
0:23:09 to our first hey this is what we're
0:23:10 gonna do here yeah so I think I yeah Lex
0:23:14 and Rob I knew best and then Garrett a
0:23:16 small amount I I pet JoJo
0:23:18 um no I think I think we we were at a
0:23:21 buffer LARP and I think you were doing
0:23:22 like a narrator kind of position so you
0:23:25 were you were doing several different
0:23:26 characters
0:23:28 um over the course of like a buffer
0:23:30 weekend yeah I think we'd also hung out
0:23:33 a couple times at parties at Lex's place
0:23:34 or something like that yeah yes yes we
0:23:36 had spoken and I was just when we were
0:23:38 just spitballing ideas for people I was
0:23:40 like well you know Rebecca's really
0:23:42 talented at role-playing different kinds
0:23:45 of characters she might be a really good
0:23:47 person to ask to you know
0:23:50 um be part of the team
0:23:52 thank you no well it's it's funny right
0:23:55 because like obviously so I've known
0:23:57 like I've known you for a while though I
0:23:59 guarant Tim I've known you guys for like
0:24:01 we've known each other like 20 years at
0:24:02 this point
0:24:04 um I deny everything okay and uh Johnson
0:24:08 Lex I put like 2008 I think it's when I
0:24:12 first met you we're like hanging out
0:24:13 yeah
0:24:14 um Erica I've known you for a while now
0:24:16 2012 was um I had a friend from a l5r
0:24:21 tabletop yes say hey uh I found this l5r
0:24:26 LARP do you win like this random
0:24:28 hodgepodge of people I've collected
0:24:30 wanna come on this car trip yeah yeah I
0:24:32 was like well yeah [ __ ] yes I do and
0:24:35 so I went up and Rob and Lex were
0:24:38 storytelling and Tim and Garrett were
0:24:40 playing that's right yeah and um I
0:24:43 walked in and my clan murdered a PC that
0:24:46 night yes you did and I helped what a
0:24:49 tough night for man that was a brutal
0:24:51 night that was a brutal night and then
0:24:53 uh it after that I just kind of like
0:24:55 okay I I need to Mainline more of this
0:24:58 LARP I'm here now
0:25:00 um so the same friend who had dragged me
0:25:02 to l5r dragged me to a vampire LARP and
0:25:05 uh my first character was actually a
0:25:07 malkavian hell yeah um and I made the
0:25:10 decided Choice she would not be good for
0:25:11 the podcast
0:25:12 she was she was mute
0:25:15 what that uh that gave me an opportunity
0:25:17 to learn how vampire Society Works
0:25:19 without saying anything that was gonna
0:25:21 get my [ __ ] pushed in yeah
0:25:23 actually I remember when
0:25:26 um when we were talking about the people
0:25:27 to invite in because I mean I think
0:25:29 you're alluding to the fact that uh
0:25:31 myself Rob and Tim the three of us we've
0:25:34 been gaming together forever so I think
0:25:36 part of the reason that Lex tagged us is
0:25:38 because we the three of us have a
0:25:41 we are we are ingrained with banter and
0:25:44 being able to play right to the point
0:25:46 where you and I occasionally have to
0:25:47 step back and be like hey man we can't
0:25:49 banter we used to play D D this is a
0:25:51 super off topic but like we used to play
0:25:53 D D and Garrett and I would just go into
0:25:55 like a Tavern in D and our characters
0:25:57 are just [ __ ] banter for like an hour
0:25:58 and Tim was like can we do plot please
0:26:00 please I can actually see Tim's desire
0:26:04 to say that so I stopped dming for years
0:26:07 keep these people online I'm sorry but I
0:26:10 remember when we mentioned uh Erica I I
0:26:12 was a little bit nervous at first and I
0:26:14 hope we don't take this the wrong way
0:26:15 but I I you you are so good at
0:26:18 portraying characters yeah and I wasn't
0:26:20 really I wasn't too familiar with Erica
0:26:23 the person
0:26:25 um I was very familiar with all the
0:26:28 characters he would play at parlor larps
0:26:30 and you go
0:26:32 all in yeah and it is intimidating and I
0:26:35 wasn't sure if if the the person behind
0:26:38 those characters
0:26:39 how flexible they were with being in
0:26:42 other groups and I mean I eat all of
0:26:45 that those words like you are just an
0:26:47 incredibly talented uh role player 100
0:26:50 yeah and you know like probably probably
0:26:53 one of the best additions to the group
0:26:54 that we've got like truly there's I feel
0:26:57 like alarm and stuff there there was
0:26:59 something that like the audience will
0:27:01 never see sadly but like Erica and
0:27:04 Rebecca both have like particularly do
0:27:07 this like physicality a LARP like you
0:27:09 guys are both so good at like that
0:27:12 occasionally like I remember some of the
0:27:14 recordings very early on like and we're
0:27:16 all guilty of this man you got to say
0:27:18 that stuff out loud just like nobody can
0:27:20 see how good you're being right now uh
0:27:23 it's gotten to the point where sometimes
0:27:25 I'm role playing Brita with an awkwardly
0:27:26 straight face because I have to remember
0:27:28 to narrate what she's doing instead of
0:27:30 doing it
0:27:32 um I forget to narrate the things wind
0:27:35 does because I'm just busy doing it
0:27:37 sometimes and then sometimes you like
0:27:39 graphically describe how you're making
0:27:41 hand job gestures of people like it's
0:27:43 well that's important things that I need
0:27:45 the audience to know very important
0:27:48 um
0:27:49 I I want to speak to everybody for like
0:27:51 but like for me yeah like some of us we
0:27:53 didn't know each other as well when we
0:27:54 first started uh and
0:27:57 uh for me like this this group has
0:28:00 become very just the process of doing
0:28:02 this because like you guys are some of
0:28:04 my best friends at this point like this
0:28:06 becomes very tight yeah this is this is
0:28:08 my this is my go-to group this is like
0:28:10 okay if I want to do a thing this is who
0:28:11 I Look to to do a thing which yeah to
0:28:13 like to like just credit right like
0:28:15 putting together the right group where
0:28:17 everybody is just clicking like yeah for
0:28:20 for Rebecca and me to come in kind of
0:28:21 late to the game because you guys have
0:28:23 all known each other the longest yeah
0:28:25 and to have us just kind of fit in so
0:28:28 seamlessly
0:28:30 um really kind of speaks to Lex's
0:28:31 Skillet judging character yeah
0:28:34 um I was so nervous I I like from my
0:28:39 perspective of everyone knowing each
0:28:41 other and then like especially
0:28:44 being younger and like knowing that each
0:28:46 and every one of you it just has years
0:28:48 of role play experience that you've used
0:28:50 and gotten better and like it shows in
0:28:52 your talent I I was I actually remember
0:28:55 I was specifically really nervous that
0:28:57 I'd uh like basically just been picked
0:28:59 to fill the Gap it was like a paranoia
0:29:01 that I had at the beginning I'm worried
0:29:03 that I was picked for the same reason
0:29:07 you guys are awesome
0:29:11 there we go we're all on the same page
0:29:13 all of us are Gap pillars I'm the gap
0:29:17 yeah
0:29:20 no but like over time as you were saying
0:29:22 I mean it's just putting our hearts in
0:29:25 this project it shows and like having
0:29:27 that uh really pulls it together yeah
0:29:30 and one of the things that this table
0:29:32 does really well and I did comment on on
0:29:34 Twitter at one point it was after wins
0:29:37 um big disclosure about her child
0:29:40 um we stopped the table a couple times
0:29:42 and it they came the episode where she
0:29:45 one-shotted someone and the episode
0:29:47 where she broke down about her Lost
0:29:48 Child God damn it one goddamn day that
0:29:52 was one session yeah that was one
0:29:54 session and so I was riding high and I
0:29:56 needed to be talked down from that and I
0:29:59 was riding low and I needed a minute and
0:30:01 at every single step this table really
0:30:04 well was just like okay let's take care
0:30:06 of Erica we thought I mean [ __ ] I was
0:30:09 jump into it like we so we we talked the
0:30:12 the we put the content warning at the
0:30:13 beginning of every episode right like
0:30:14 hey there's some [ __ ] uh this [ __ ]
0:30:16 world of Darkness like there's some [ __ ]
0:30:18 yeah um and one one of the lines we put
0:30:21 in there is you know we've all talked
0:30:22 about safety and consent and comfort
0:30:25 um and that's not like like we did that
0:30:27 early on right and it's like hey here's
0:30:29 what we're talking about but look that's
0:30:30 also sort of an ongoing process
0:30:31 constantly and that's like a very good
0:30:33 example of us just like checking in and
0:30:36 making sure shit's good I mean I think
0:30:38 you know
0:30:39 so often years of experience
0:30:42 role-playing is not necessarily a good
0:30:43 thing yeah you could well you can right
0:30:47 um you know and also like if you if you
0:30:49 if you don't
0:30:51 strive to get better at what you're
0:30:53 doing and be aware of of what it is that
0:30:55 you're doing right and
0:30:57 um
0:30:58 I I feel grateful that everybody at the
0:31:01 table here
0:31:02 is very self-aware and interested in
0:31:05 getting better at communal storytelling
0:31:09 right yeah and I think part of that that
0:31:12 a lot of people are interested in and
0:31:14 like you know the in the the Indie
0:31:17 Gaming Community is is looking at well
0:31:19 all right well what are games how do we
0:31:21 make them better you know what is role
0:31:23 playing that's that does weird things to
0:31:25 you mentally
0:31:27 um let's be careful about that and let's
0:31:28 give each other support when we're
0:31:31 you know inhabiting different personas
0:31:34 like that's a yeah you know and and I
0:31:36 think because we've had years of
0:31:39 experience with this we've you know I
0:31:42 think when we started first started
0:31:43 playing D we're probably some pretty
0:31:45 bullheaded with each other I know I I
0:31:47 definitely had some moments that were
0:31:48 not good role-playing I would like to
0:31:50 just reiterate right now uh for the
0:31:52 record on air that the mermaid was
0:31:53 looking at me and you guys up my ass
0:31:58 um but you know but I but I I like the
0:32:00 fact that and I think the reason I still
0:32:02 game with with uh you guys is because
0:32:05 the fact that you're willing to look at
0:32:07 at you know gaming sessions we've had in
0:32:10 the past and like that didn't feel good
0:32:12 I left feeling you know upset at my
0:32:14 friends why am I some of my friends
0:32:16 this is probably why well let's let's
0:32:18 get past it let's get better let's let's
0:32:20 have discussions about that and remember
0:32:22 this is a game at the end of the day yes
0:32:24 with those histories like we sort of
0:32:25 talked about right
0:32:27 um what is everybody's uh relationship
0:32:30 to tabletop games right like we had no
0:32:32 experience podcasting what is uh
0:32:36 like what are our experiences with with
0:32:38 tabletops and with the world of Darkness
0:32:41 let's not have a good start with the
0:32:43 tabletop games I
0:32:46 I tried a couple when I was like in
0:32:49 mostly High School
0:32:51 um but really like my primary form of uh
0:32:55 role-playing was Forum Forum role play I
0:32:58 did a lot of like uh Forum was it
0:33:01 freeforms.net I think or I don't
0:33:03 remember but like Guy online just random
0:33:06 uh random for a former minutia
0:33:10 um I used to do that every day and then
0:33:13 I like I kept that up for a long time
0:33:16 and
0:33:18 I had the chance to try buffer and I was
0:33:22 so excited because that incorporated
0:33:23 like
0:33:24 you know I do a lot of like acting as
0:33:27 well like any anything in theater as
0:33:29 well as a playwriting and I was so
0:33:31 excited about getting to like be an NPC
0:33:33 do costuming and with getting into
0:33:36 bother
0:33:37 uh I had the chance to try parlor LARP
0:33:40 and that was the first time for me of
0:33:44 actually substantially encountering
0:33:46 vampire the Masquerade I had come into
0:33:49 contact with it in passing uh I'm pretty
0:33:52 sure I probably accidentally played uh
0:33:56 really shitty versions of it on Guy
0:33:57 online I'm pretty sure I signed up for
0:33:59 like something like that but
0:34:03 um
0:34:04 I remember yeah I am
0:34:07 making a Toreador for a local parlor our
0:34:12 local parlor LARP was my first
0:34:15 interaction and I learned the genre in
0:34:19 that way and I I was so excited about it
0:34:23 being someone who has a very like gothy
0:34:25 alternative interests and style it was
0:34:28 something that like had been on the
0:34:30 fringes of uh
0:34:32 stuff I loved for a very long time but I
0:34:36 I had never had the chance to really
0:34:38 engage with it until then
0:34:41 um
0:34:42 so I think when we had started this
0:34:44 podcast maybe I'd been
0:34:46 LARPing for six months does that sound
0:34:49 right
0:34:50 gonna add something like that I think
0:34:52 yeah you were very early in yeah
0:34:55 [Music]
0:34:56 um
0:34:57 and I remember that being part of why uh
0:35:00 I was leaning towards Brita having
0:35:03 Amnesia so that I like maybe if I like I
0:35:06 I was doing okay learning genre I I like
0:35:09 learning through doing but uh definitely
0:35:11 helps when you have uh you match a
0:35:14 character to your capabilities it really
0:35:15 gets you through a lot
0:35:19 oh
0:35:21 and I think that was yeah I don't think
0:35:23 I'd ever played vampire tabletop until
0:35:26 this at all man my uh my first vampire
0:35:30 tabletop was with a at a father and
0:35:33 son's hobby shop and [ __ ]
0:35:37 uh Manchester Connecticut when we played
0:35:39 dueling D20 vampire the Masquerade uh
0:35:43 because I don't know oh yeah yeah uh ask
0:35:47 uh Adam about the vampire player from
0:35:49 the beginning wow that wasn't my first
0:35:51 game
0:35:52 We we played that together uh at the
0:35:55 [ __ ] hobby shop and it was us and the
0:35:58 two weird old men that played there
0:36:02 and it was very weird I remember playing
0:36:05 a bruja I remember being covered in
0:36:07 Dustin
0:36:08 like keeping my intestines in with like
0:36:11 duct tape and stuff like that after like
0:36:12 multiple combats and everything else
0:36:14 like that
0:36:16 um but my first world of Darkness was a
0:36:18 werewolf the apocalypse actually and
0:36:21 that was because of the card game and
0:36:22 specifically because of curb stomp
0:36:31 uh so werewolf the apocalypse used to
0:36:34 have a card game much like vampire the
0:36:37 eternal struggle right uh but it was his
0:36:39 own thing I remember getting it
0:36:41 they made a point of being as graphic
0:36:45 and like 90s Iron Age comic bookie as
0:36:50 possible okay uh and there was a card
0:36:53 and it is what is described warmed up to
0:36:57 tabletop since we've played this but I
0:36:59 still haven't warmed up to card game and
0:37:01 tabletop inspired card games or like how
0:37:04 that works
0:37:06 uh to be totally honest some of the most
0:37:10 vicious politics I've ever seen has been
0:37:13 over vitess which is being part of the
0:37:16 eternal struggle uh it's kind of meant
0:37:19 designed to be this
0:37:23 um multiplayer game so usually three or
0:37:26 more players at the table
0:37:27 and while there are certainly card
0:37:29 mechanics which are you know very
0:37:31 important to the game
0:37:32 there's also a lot of hey man if you do
0:37:35 this I'm not going to like attack you
0:37:37 and we can work together and then of
0:37:40 course because of the way the game works
0:37:42 there are inevitable betrayals and lots
0:37:44 of drama from it it's good it's fun yeah
0:37:47 I'm good you can go I'm seriously so
0:37:50 like what no but never mind I mean I
0:37:55 started playing d d back when I was like
0:37:56 six or seven with my uncle and then I
0:37:59 bought the books because I didn't have
0:38:01 anyone to play with for the better part
0:38:03 of a decade
0:38:04 so I was very good with the rules and
0:38:08 less good with other people dealing with
0:38:09 my rules Tim had a 10-year training
0:38:12 montage for mechanics
0:38:15 I owned a lot of books before I started
0:38:17 running into people that would play it's
0:38:20 funny I had the opposite problem
0:38:21 I did
0:38:23 um and then I still collect a lot of
0:38:27 books that is that's true as someone who
0:38:30 stays in his house on the weekends there
0:38:32 the living room is literally a third
0:38:34 filled with books
0:38:36 all right
0:38:37 I just want to shout out to past Tim's
0:38:40 role-playing uh I just I'm just gonna
0:38:43 look at Garrett and say who calls you
0:38:45 Sunset and uh that's it I don't that's
0:38:48 gonna be an inside joke for three people
0:38:49 but yeah I'll throw them under the bus
0:38:51 there's the the the one the first
0:38:54 campaign that we played together where
0:38:55 Tim was the DM yeah the the big bad that
0:38:59 we were chasing uh kicked the [ __ ] out
0:39:01 of us and then Tim's insert like self
0:39:04 insert MPC just like stormed out of
0:39:07 nowhere and killed the big bad and like
0:39:09 it was like the most like hey thanks
0:39:11 guys for playing Watch Me be cool well
0:39:13 you guys are all just on the ground
0:39:15 [ __ ] bleeding out and it was like all
0:39:16 right storming he was with you guys he
0:39:19 just killed those characters like you
0:39:22 guys don't know the mechanics enough
0:39:23 I've been working on this for a while to
0:39:26 be fair the group had to give me a a
0:39:28 ring of luck because I said she could
0:39:30 not roll again I mean I couldn't hear it
0:39:33 infamously bad at rolling dice
0:39:36 um I'm nodding I just realized the
0:39:38 audience can't see that
0:39:41 um so I started so I came very late to
0:39:44 tabletop gaming
0:39:45 um I was raised in a church that
0:39:48 basically said if you do this it is a
0:39:50 sure path to hell and my mother was very
0:39:53 worried and then I realized I was 27
0:39:55 years old and I didn't need permission
0:39:56 to play games anymore so I started
0:40:00 playing every tabletop that people would
0:40:02 invite me to now you're going to hell
0:40:03 and now I'm probably going straight to
0:40:05 hell but they're all coming with me and
0:40:06 we're going to set up a tabletop there
0:40:07 and we all have don't have anything to
0:40:09 do anymore so we'll actually show up
0:40:13 um
0:40:14 but I was in a group where we played a
0:40:18 lot of different table tops we did um we
0:40:21 did X crawl we did
0:40:23 uh BNS vampire we did Call of Cthulhu we
0:40:28 did
0:40:30 um oh what is it called it's very old
0:40:33 it's
0:40:33 uh I'm gonna hate that I can't come up
0:40:36 with roll master
0:40:38 um wow yep I was uh I know that yeah I
0:40:42 was an elf dragon slayer with stilt
0:40:45 walking as a random skill and it all
0:40:47 happened to coincide in one glorious
0:40:50 scene where I ran across stalactites to
0:40:52 slay two dragons
0:40:54 um it was [ __ ] phenomenal
0:40:57 um I shouldn't remember that that was
0:40:58 like eight years ago but uh the moments
0:41:01 of the good tabletop moments stick with
0:41:03 you but I got my start with l5r and then
0:41:09 um I played met a lot of really great
0:41:11 actual role players through table
0:41:14 topping and that segued into being
0:41:16 invited to the l5r LARP that Rob and Lex
0:41:19 ran and then it was it was a lot of fun
0:41:24 and then that trans hey we know we run
0:41:27 this other you know Indie LARP on the
0:41:29 same weekend as l5r it's called 7c AEG
0:41:32 weekend AEG weekend and it was just it
0:41:35 was the it was just such a great weekend
0:41:37 and you know so exhausting it was so
0:41:40 exhausting yeah but we were so much
0:41:41 younger took the rest of the week to
0:41:43 recover yeah some good times though yeah
0:41:45 yeah it was good [ __ ] I feel like
0:41:47 meeting good role players makes like for
0:41:49 me like like I met good role players
0:41:51 through like buffer and parlor and that
0:41:53 made me love TableTop but if you meet
0:41:54 good role players through tabletop which
0:41:56 I now have control players in tabletop
0:41:58 well I know like it pulls you in so much
0:42:01 yeah I met good role players because I
0:42:04 met the table toppers through theater
0:42:06 um
0:42:07 so I I met a lot of people who were
0:42:10 really involved in the RP and less so in
0:42:13 the mechanics and unfortunately that
0:42:15 would culminate in two hour long side
0:42:17 scenes between the St and one character
0:42:20 while the rest of us were like I guess
0:42:21 we're getting sushi for dinner because
0:42:22 it's gone over two hours so he's paying
0:42:24 for sushi now
0:42:26 um there were rules of conduct
0:42:30 um
0:42:31 but uh yeah eventually it segued to LARP
0:42:34 and now it's kind of culminated in this
0:42:36 amazing tabletop and that's more of a
0:42:39 combined story than anything else
0:42:43 yeah
0:42:44 so for for me I uh I think my my first
0:42:48 tabletop was Dungeons and Dragons
0:42:51 um I actually played when I was like 10
0:42:53 years old
0:42:54 um and I enjoyed it so much that my my
0:42:57 dad busted out his like old first
0:42:59 edition box that he had in the basement
0:43:00 and was like here you go just having fun
0:43:02 and so like that was it right like um I
0:43:05 was big into Miniatures games like uh
0:43:07 hero quests eventually went into like
0:43:09 Warhammer and stuff like that
0:43:11 um and it was just a friend my my house
0:43:13 growing up was a friendly house to like
0:43:15 make believe and things like that
0:43:17 um and my older sister
0:43:19 um got into vampire
0:43:21 you know uh right back in its Heyday in
0:43:24 the mid 90s and I would like want to
0:43:27 game with her and her friends but like
0:43:29 since there was enough of an age Gap she
0:43:30 was like get out of here so I didn't get
0:43:32 to actually play with them
0:43:34 um my first vampire game was at a Dusty
0:43:38 old Gaming shop called The Grid in
0:43:40 Manchester Connecticut
0:43:41 so Tim was over a father and son I was
0:43:44 at the grid the grid still exists it
0:43:46 does it does uh Carl runs the shops
0:43:48 great guy
0:43:49 um
0:43:55 um the um
0:43:57 but uh I it wasn't a very good good game
0:44:01 because it was you know a local gaming
0:44:03 shop
0:44:04 tabletop of vampire which is it's like
0:44:07 you know like you had the experience
0:44:08 it's not that great
0:44:09 um
0:44:10 but then
0:44:12 um my sister
0:44:13 um as I started to get older and showed
0:44:16 that I could be mature at the gaming
0:44:18 table she started to kind of like trust
0:44:19 it with others yeah
0:44:21 it ended up bringing me along to a
0:44:23 couple of the old
0:44:24 um uh east of the river larps which are
0:44:27 like the the first as far as I remember
0:44:29 the first larps in the area for vampire
0:44:32 um I didn't really care for it that much
0:44:35 and she kind of introduced me some other
0:44:37 people in The Gaming Community she
0:44:38 actually introduced me to Chris
0:44:40 um and was like hey you're about to go
0:44:42 to high school there's this kid Chris
0:44:43 you might actually be friends with
0:44:46 um and kind of like introduced us Chris
0:44:50 um is like the glue between me Tim and
0:44:53 Rob yep
0:44:54 um he would he then he decided to bail
0:44:56 on us and move out to the West Coast I
0:44:58 don't know if you listen to our podcast
0:44:59 either so like we can bash them all we
0:45:01 want yeah
0:45:03 um but Chris is an uh amazing
0:45:05 Storyteller amazing role player
0:45:07 um and I you know he definitely kept us
0:45:11 together and kept us going with that and
0:45:14 um from there I think my my sister at
0:45:18 some point eventually convinced me to
0:45:19 come back to like doing parlorps
0:45:22 um because I wasn't a big fan I
0:45:24 preferred table topping but my sister
0:45:25 said you know you should come I think it
0:45:27 was actually l5r and once again she was
0:45:30 like hey there's this cool dude Lex that
0:45:32 you might actually be friends with there
0:45:33 and I was like I don't know last time
0:45:35 you introduced me someone was Chris
0:45:38 [Music]
0:45:40 I don't know if you're a good judge of
0:45:42 my character or not who I might like you
0:45:43 know like but no once again my sister
0:45:45 was right um she doesn't listen to this
0:45:48 idea yeah yeah she'll never hear this
0:45:52 um but uh and then you know I I met Lex
0:45:54 and I do characters like have like a
0:45:57 [ __ ] like intense first meeting and I
0:45:59 absolutely had drama yeah but like there
0:46:02 was a glint in the eye of like oh yeah
0:46:04 you're down you're down to the clown
0:46:05 let's do this and that's not how that
0:46:07 works but no no
0:46:12 this is what led to it yeah but like our
0:46:15 characters immediately had drama and we
0:46:16 were both down to enjoy like kind of
0:46:19 like having that drama play out
0:46:21 and then we went out to like a party
0:46:23 afterwards and I got really obliterated
0:46:26 um and you know we ended up just kind of
0:46:30 bonding in our drunken stupor and and
0:46:32 then from there we just kind of you know
0:46:34 became pretty quick friends it's just
0:46:36 guy love between two guys yeah all in
0:46:38 Soul Calibur and Marco 27 yep
0:46:42 Morley cigarettes
0:46:44 brought to you why wolf Panther
0:46:48 oh uh
0:46:50 so I actually didn't play in tabletops
0:46:54 for like a few years have you still have
0:46:59 uh very rarely
0:47:02 um
0:47:04 but uh there was actually a handful of
0:47:06 other storytellers that were much older
0:47:09 than myself at the location that I used
0:47:12 to run games at
0:47:13 and it was three in particular I
0:47:16 remember that were pretty much mentors
0:47:19 to me for uh the experience actually
0:47:21 there's nods to them in the podcast can
0:47:23 I interrupt you can I interrupt you for
0:47:24 a second you're not actually explaining
0:47:25 why you didn't play in any games I was
0:47:29 running them yeah how many years uh
0:47:33 actually so there was a while where I
0:47:36 would be like hey guys I don't know if I
0:47:38 want to run a game and so like I will
0:47:39 buy you a bunch of packs of cigarettes
0:47:42 right now and like the book to run the
0:47:45 game if you run the game and I was like
0:47:46 all right guys make characters and that
0:47:49 they got me every time uh and it was
0:47:53 actually a lot of fun
0:47:54 um but it was yeah it was three three
0:47:56 storytellers uh that were kind of like
0:47:59 these mentors and I remember because
0:48:01 they ran each of them ran were pretty
0:48:04 much my favorite table tops kind of
0:48:06 coming up
0:48:07 and one was my friend uh Les
0:48:11 uh who was a retired police officer and
0:48:15 was running a vampire in the Masquerade
0:48:18 game
0:48:20 and when he ran a vampire the Masquerade
0:48:22 game it was a big table a lot of like
0:48:25 really kind of interesting characters
0:48:27 and uh the game went for like a few
0:48:30 years and uh that is where the Killing
0:48:34 Spree came from is that really one of
0:48:36 the killings that is where the Killing
0:48:37 Spree came back that's awesome wow and
0:48:39 it was amazing I remember being
0:48:41 specifically like wowed by the concept
0:48:44 of it and what he did when he ran his
0:48:46 tabletop game he was like I'm gonna set
0:48:47 it in 92.
0:48:49 and I'm gonna go for like a lot of
0:48:51 grunge Vibes and it's going to take
0:48:53 place on the west coast and a lot of the
0:48:57 like
0:48:58 the decisions I made when kind of
0:49:00 thinking about what I wanted this game
0:49:02 to be like actually came from like like
0:49:04 blueprints that he had shown me when I
0:49:08 was kind of first really like learning
0:49:10 how to
0:49:11 tell like a more convoluted story in the
0:49:14 tabletop yeah and uh but yeah uh Killing
0:49:18 Spree actually comes from him uh Jack uh
0:49:21 who is a member of The Killing Spree who
0:49:23 has not seen a bunch of screen time yet
0:49:24 but there's some stuff for him
0:49:27 you don't have to Jack was a character
0:49:29 he played in a tabletop game that I read
0:49:31 and he had he was such a blast uh to to
0:49:36 play Under and to storytell for
0:49:39 and the so that was that was kind of
0:49:42 where I really
0:49:44 figured out I think how vampire works as
0:49:47 a game and
0:49:49 in addition to him there was a guy that
0:49:51 we called cyber Dan who was uh he was
0:49:55 cool because his whole thing was I mean
0:49:58 he told tight very like visceral
0:50:01 interesting stories but he was the guy
0:50:05 who would say the cyberpunk quote of
0:50:07 style over substance all the time and he
0:50:11 made a point of just giving the coolest
0:50:13 descriptions for like NPCs and his voice
0:50:17 would like kind of change depending a
0:50:19 little bit depending on who he was
0:50:21 portraying yeah and uh and then there
0:50:24 was a guy called who were named slain
0:50:26 called him slain and he had actually
0:50:29 written his own fantasy setting
0:50:32 and had gone into this incredible detail
0:50:38 and he was so passionate about it and so
0:50:42 like
0:50:43 interested in this story that you could
0:50:45 ask him pretty much anything about this
0:50:46 world and it's not even that he would be
0:50:48 able to come up with something on the
0:50:49 spot it was that he had already like
0:50:52 envisioned it and that was kind of like
0:50:56 really inspiring to me because I really
0:50:58 saw the value
0:51:00 of building this like flowing Living
0:51:03 World in your head so that when people
0:51:06 are like role-playing in that setting
0:51:08 you're just kind of like on point with
0:51:11 descriptions and characters that really
0:51:13 kind of fit what you're going for and
0:51:15 it's kind of like those three that I I
0:51:18 really looked to as as these sources of
0:51:22 like wisdom as I was you know smoking
0:51:24 cigarettes and like telling edgy stories
0:51:26 and but uh yeah that was that was the
0:51:30 kind of the core and after that it was
0:51:32 like LARP and even then I was like when
0:51:35 I was first attending alarms I was like
0:51:36 this is nowhere near as cool as what
0:51:38 less is running and I was like just I
0:51:40 was so grumpy about it at first when I
0:51:42 kind of you know came to see like while
0:51:45 different as its own mystique and Magic
0:51:47 yeah
0:51:49 um
0:51:50 well it's also like just because you
0:51:53 told us this story
0:51:54 before finding out what larps were
0:51:56 weren't you running like 20 person table
0:51:58 tops I ran a like one psycho I ran a 25
0:52:03 player werewolf the apocalypse tabletop
0:52:06 game yeah and it was consisted of five
0:52:09 packs uh we had two big rooms that we
0:52:12 played in and each pack kind of had
0:52:14 their own table and they would do like a
0:52:16 lot of like role playing on their own
0:52:18 and they would kind of like talk to each
0:52:20 other and coordinate big plans amongst
0:52:22 these five packs of werewolves and I'd
0:52:25 be running small scenes for them and
0:52:26 over the course of like a nine hour
0:52:28 table top session
0:52:30 they'd eventually like all right all the
0:52:31 packs are coming together we're doing
0:52:33 this thing and then I would run a 25
0:52:34 person Mass Combat on tablets like 11
0:52:38 o'clock at night at that point do that
0:52:40 no
0:52:41 no's like two and we went to like five
0:52:45 uh but and it was weekly oh God but man
0:52:49 it was so fun
0:52:51 it's a lot easier to come back
0:52:54 smoking cigarettes outside huge circle
0:52:57 of players just kind of like chatting as
0:53:00 their characters I had no idea LARP was
0:53:02 a thing but like but but you know when I
0:53:06 found it
0:53:07 it was it was like oh okay maybe I was
0:53:10 doing that wrong
0:53:12 combat took so long
0:53:16 uh
0:53:17 yeah mine was like I the same as Garrett
0:53:20 like a 10 or 10 or 11 or whatever I
0:53:22 played with my cousins once uh the d d
0:53:25 my first game and then uh didn't really
0:53:27 play like I played like a couple times
0:53:29 uh and then Senior end of senior year in
0:53:34 high school I was like talking to Chris
0:53:36 about doing stuff and Chris was like
0:53:39 yeah I played DND and I was like oh look
0:53:41 he was just talking about DND and I was
0:53:43 like oh [ __ ] I played that once that was
0:53:44 cool I I had a fun time I just nobody
0:53:46 ever played with me he's like well
0:53:48 that's cool come uh working we're having
0:53:50 a tabletop on Saturday we're coming he
0:53:51 poached you and make a character
0:53:53 Shanghai and I was like I don't know man
0:53:54 I don't want to make a character it's
0:53:56 just like I don't know if I'm really
0:53:57 into D it just was fun at the time he's
0:53:58 like that's cool fine [ __ ] you you're
0:54:00 making a character I'm like all right
0:54:01 cool and I showed up and I made my Bard
0:54:03 and I played with Tim and Garrett at the
0:54:05 table uh and then that game ran for a
0:54:07 long time and that's how I met also also
0:54:09 Jeff and Beth to Jeff and Beth uh that
0:54:12 was our Guru our crew
0:54:15 um I heard you died
0:54:21 legitimately though that story so uh
0:54:23 that like that story of that so I made a
0:54:26 half Elven Bard and we were doing a
0:54:27 thing and then Garrett's fighter got
0:54:29 possessed and
0:54:31 so here's the thing
0:54:34 we already yeah but we already
0:54:36 established that I am terrible at
0:54:38 rolling dice right yeah except when it
0:54:41 doesn't count yeah oh we just counted
0:54:43 them character gets possessed and it's a
0:54:46 whole thing and he hits me for a bunch
0:54:47 of damage and I'm like ah I drop and
0:54:49 Chris is like Chris it's one of the only
0:54:51 mistakes Chris ever made uh Chris is
0:54:53 like well you don't drop man you're like
0:54:54 a ninth level Bard like you you gotta
0:54:56 like you're fine don't you don't drop
0:54:58 and I was like I don't know man I got
0:54:59 hit for a lot my dude's just a Bard like
0:55:02 I think I cry and he's like no you don't
0:55:03 cry you're fine yeah Rob is legitimately
0:55:05 like no my character crumples on the
0:55:07 ground and starts crying okay I just got
0:55:09 hit he's like no you can stand on your
0:55:10 feet and so I'm like okay and I try and
0:55:13 like fix Striker and it doesn't work and
0:55:16 then Garrett [ __ ] crits for Max
0:55:19 damage and bisects me in half this is
0:55:21 insane it was like the best it was like
0:55:23 the best role of my best entire life and
0:55:25 I just [ __ ] did I was possessed by
0:55:27 the DM and killing my friend it was the
0:55:29 best best attack roll and damage roll it
0:55:30 ever had so what did it ever happened no
0:55:33 so the the game that Chris was running
0:55:34 was a low Magic game yeah uh and so like
0:55:37 Garrett like broke from the party and
0:55:40 picked up my body and like went back to
0:55:42 our [ __ ] like uh Chris's old PC
0:55:45 because Chris was running at the time uh
0:55:47 because Jeff had been running and Tim
0:55:49 ran like it was the same campaign with
0:55:51 rotating DMS yeah and Chris was running
0:55:54 and so his old PC was a cleric we didn't
0:55:56 have a professional DM like Lex at the
0:55:57 time yeah someone who's chronically
0:55:59 dming we badly needed Alex uh Zoe uh he
0:56:04 brings my body back and it's like I do a
0:56:06 resurrection ritual and I'm like a weird
0:56:08 half dwarf at that point those all sorts
0:56:10 of stuff and I remember talking to Chris
0:56:11 and hanging out and being like man this
0:56:13 feels kind of like narratively
0:56:14 unsatisfying like something feels weird
0:56:16 I got my hair charger back but like
0:56:18 something feels weird about this and
0:56:20 Chris was like I know I don't like it
0:56:21 either yeah
0:56:22 something feels weird about that and it
0:56:25 was d d like people resurrecting D all
0:56:27 the time even though we were in a low
0:56:28 magic setting like it's something that
0:56:30 happens and so Chris and I like outside
0:56:33 in the dark like we weren't we neither
0:56:35 of us are smarter so like we were sorry
0:56:36 we were essentially like taking a smoke
0:56:37 break and sitting outside the dark at
0:56:39 CCSU and Chris was like yeah what are we
0:56:42 gonna do and so Chris and I came up with
0:56:44 this plan to note because all of our PCS
0:56:47 had like evil doppelgangers and all
0:56:48 sorts of [ __ ] I was like well how about
0:56:49 this one's yours and we we conspired to
0:56:53 keep me dead and like I played the fake
0:56:57 me for a little while until it was time
0:56:59 to do the big reveal and then there was
0:57:00 a boss fight and then my PC was [ __ ]
0:57:03 dead
0:57:04 uh and it felt way better and that has
0:57:07 like been the reason I bring that up is
0:57:09 like that has been narratively formative
0:57:11 to my understanding of how to like role
0:57:13 play and how to the the fact is like yo
0:57:15 no dude like I know it's a random role
0:57:17 and I [ __ ] died but there was story
0:57:19 and narrative there and that's where I
0:57:21 wanted to stay
0:57:23 um and then went like the game because
0:57:25 like we were on College and like
0:57:27 whatever so we all went to different
0:57:28 places the game like didn't really
0:57:29 continue after a while just because
0:57:31 that's what happens and uh I was doing a
0:57:33 couple other things
0:57:34 um and had to play tabletops and stuff
0:57:36 with you guys over time and then uh yeah
0:57:38 in like 2008. Garrett was like hey man
0:57:41 I'm playing this like Samurai thing and
0:57:42 I was like that sounds dumb I like I
0:57:45 don't want to do that I like I like
0:57:48 table topping and then I managed to amp
0:57:50 you up into dumb ideas which is I think
0:57:52 a consistent that is a consistent part
0:57:54 of our friendship yeah is it is that I I
0:57:56 will start joking about some offhanded
0:57:59 comment and you will talk about it like
0:58:02 taking it seriously and then I'll do do
0:58:04 the thing where I'm like this is stupid
0:58:06 I'm not doing it hey Rod you want to
0:58:08 invest some money in this Miniatures
0:58:09 game what if I [ __ ] dude I'm sorry
0:58:12 uh but yeah so to this day I was like
0:58:15 I'm not gonna do that and then like a
0:58:17 week later I was like well I'm not gonna
0:58:18 do that but if I did here's what I would
0:58:19 do and then you were like well that's
0:58:21 how I work and then a week later I'm
0:58:22 like so I I'm not gonna do that but if I
0:58:25 did here's the thing and I built a sheet
0:58:27 and then like it just goes on from there
0:58:29 and then I went to [ __ ] l5r and I
0:58:31 played an L5 R and again my character
0:58:34 got killed because of Garrett
0:58:41 and then instead of making a new
0:58:43 character I stepped on staff and then
0:58:45 like I met Lex and I'd like and then
0:58:48 eventually I was like well I do these
0:58:49 indie games but I don't play I don't
0:58:51 play vampire stuff and then okay
0:58:52 meatloaf calm down and then I made a
0:58:54 [ __ ] I made a [ __ ] Hunter and a
0:58:57 role playing games
0:58:59 and then like just yeah so now
0:59:03 yeah no now I'm just saying like now I'm
0:59:07 near right now I'm just here uh of
0:59:10 course with those two Jimbo what am I
0:59:12 gonna play if you're both off at this
0:59:14 time so now I gotta go to be fair I
0:59:16 started playing The Parlor LARP with
0:59:17 with L5 r as well yeah
0:59:19 um and I I didn't really want to get
0:59:21 back into vampire because I had some bad
0:59:23 experiences with it um previously to
0:59:25 that and I just didn't enjoy the LARP
0:59:27 scene but another one of our mutual
0:59:28 friends uh Adam Satori uh convinced me
0:59:31 to come back to
0:59:33 um was it the the Suboxone
0:59:36 yeah and um I played ended up having a
0:59:39 pretty freaking good time so then
0:59:40 playing the [ __ ] blueprint for Kabir
0:59:42 yeah yeah basically yeah Kabir is
0:59:45 basically an old character of mine
0:59:46 though so got lifted for uh for an NPC
0:59:49 on my sheet so beer is like if
0:59:53 the savat PC that it came from had like
0:59:56 was like you know what I don't do meth
0:59:59 anymore
0:59:59 [Laughter]
1:00:02 I was like I'm gonna get my [ __ ]
1:00:04 together and I'm gonna get a girlfriend
1:00:06 I'm gonna do another question that was
1:00:08 asked I'm just gonna [ __ ] jumping
1:00:10 around here but like so who is
1:00:11 everyone's favorite NPC in this in in
1:00:14 path of night like bring it back to path
1:00:15 the night a little bit who is
1:00:16 everybody's favorite NPC and Lex yours
1:00:19 yours is a two-parter because it was
1:00:21 who's your favorite like and then who do
1:00:23 you like to portray the most that could
1:00:25 be the same one but like
1:00:27 let me take some time we can go who is
1:00:28 everybody's favorite Erica I can see you
1:00:31 go ahead
1:00:37 you can say it's a couple man I don't
1:00:39 care oh it's gonna be a bunch that's the
1:00:41 issue is that it's not like top three
1:00:42 two yeah top five do top three [ __ ] them
1:00:45 okay
1:00:46 um
1:00:48 in no particular order
1:00:51 uh Joey Kabir and chaps yeah they're
1:00:56 good little guys yeah this is all the
1:00:58 people that win loves yeah well not all
1:01:01 of them and then all the people
1:01:02 it's followed by Rusty
1:01:04 no he's that was no that was hate
1:01:08 [ __ ] well so one of the other the
1:01:10 variant on this question too right is
1:01:12 like who do you [ __ ] like as a as a
1:01:15 listener however like
1:01:16 I don't think there's any bad NPCs but
1:01:18 like oh God who do you love to [ __ ]
1:01:20 hate
1:01:22 Grace I mean there's a few options right
1:01:25 but Reese is such it's [ __ ] Rhys
1:01:28 he took my son and I'm gonna eat his
1:01:31 brain one day
1:01:33 also he's Premiere exactly yeah
1:01:37 I'll put that to tape on the radio [ __ ]
1:01:40 Premiere uh when I first came to vampire
1:01:44 the uh the LARP uh my two choices for
1:01:48 starting character were either
1:01:51 um malkavian or salubri and I was said
1:01:54 if you play a salubri Healer you will
1:01:56 not make it through the door I was like
1:01:57 well I'd like to make it through the
1:01:59 door so I guess I'll play malkavian but
1:02:00 salubri healer is my white whale
1:02:06 we'll play like just a bunch of Misfit
1:02:09 weirdos in here what do you what do you
1:02:12 mean in another game
1:02:16 favorite NPC
1:02:21 um
1:02:22 probably Elsa Linden is one of my
1:02:25 favorites yeah you've had such a cool
1:02:26 art it's the punk outfit
1:02:30 especially the punk outfit but like my
1:02:32 interactions with her are probably some
1:02:34 of the longest and some of the better
1:02:36 ones and they're kind of back and forth
1:02:39 um I'm trying to think of who else
1:02:43 um that I didn't I immediately ended up
1:02:45 hating for various reasons
1:02:51 no I understand that they're half
1:02:53 vampires oh no I forgot oh no
1:02:57 we'll be back
1:02:58 flies
1:03:05 no I can't we're not supposed to be in
1:03:07 the finale
1:03:08 were they gonna be assaulting the
1:03:10 Mansion a shovelheads yeah
1:03:13 oh God I hate that I forgot you know to
1:03:17 be perfectly honest sorry to be
1:03:18 perfectly honest they still have to get
1:03:20 out of there in a van
1:03:21 [Music]
1:03:22 you've got time and I had this whole
1:03:25 Vision in my head and it's like
1:03:28 well now it's a vision in our heads and
1:03:30 we need you to make it real hi it's just
1:03:32 so sad we can revisit it in a flashback
1:03:34 yeah Wicked nightmares hey man I made a
1:03:36 character who could see the past for a
1:03:37 reason I wanted so bad to have like them
1:03:41 be like soft guys
1:03:48 [Music]
1:03:49 check it out we back Madonna
1:03:53 hey yo now I know y'all be loving this
1:03:56 [ __ ] right here
1:04:03 um
1:04:04 after Elsa Linden I think
1:04:07 other than my own sire who's been on
1:04:10 screen very rarely but uh but every time
1:04:12 he comes out he's supportive and loves
1:04:13 you yeah I like it and the whole game
1:04:15 changes yeah yeah he's a big impact on
1:04:19 the the direction of the character
1:04:22 um I think I really enjoy when I get
1:04:25 around to it I love weathers a lot too
1:04:26 all weather's [ __ ] great and and not
1:04:29 for it it's enough for it or is it not
1:04:32 for it or was it kalis was Kalise the
1:04:34 one he interacted with the one you
1:04:36 talked to not fret is the like architect
1:04:38 of My Demise she hasn't really been on
1:04:41 screen right she came on screen and like
1:04:43 glared to him yeah she was definitely
1:04:45 seen
1:04:46 um my favorite npcv hate uh was
1:04:49 definitely Rhys for most of it sometimes
1:04:52 Pendragon
1:04:55 um yeah man those are definitely the two
1:04:57 biggest ones I'm surprised you didn't
1:04:59 put Arabella on your list
1:05:00 uh she occupies a weird Nexus between
1:05:03 the two she's like caught in the middle
1:05:05 of like I [ __ ] hate this [ __ ] I
1:05:07 think I used to dislike her a lot more
1:05:09 till we had our rooftop scene like in a
1:05:11 really solidified the fact that we're
1:05:13 like
1:05:13 very tired of other vampires [ __ ]
1:05:17 she was definitely like you're so
1:05:19 handsome and smart and he's like oh my
1:05:21 God you see me
1:05:24 and and Neil's like friend she's
1:05:27 infernal this is very bad no it's just
1:05:29 stop okay whatever
1:05:32 infernal I got this who's to say okay
1:05:35 yeah who's smarter than demons like shut
1:05:37 up
1:05:39 and Neil seriously what am I going to
1:05:41 need to know about demons
1:05:44 [Laughter]
1:05:56 you didn't know so
1:05:59 once again I'll give a couple the um
1:06:03 there's three NPCs that I think really
1:06:04 have stuck with me so far
1:06:07 um the first two are are Johnny's allies
1:06:09 which are weathers and uh Kabir
1:06:12 um I Kabir is great because I love the
1:06:16 clan ravnose they're one of my favorite
1:06:17 Clans
1:06:18 um and it's I I just ha I love that kind
1:06:22 of just like trickster kind of character
1:06:24 and having that as like your as like one
1:06:26 of your best friends is fun because it
1:06:29 it always is a it's a monkey wrench you
1:06:31 can throw into a scene where it's like
1:06:32 oh you know what I'll call back up I'll
1:06:34 call the guy who's unreliable it makes
1:06:36 them go crazy right
1:06:38 um
1:06:39 and then weathers is is I mean he's he's
1:06:42 definitely patterned after Theo Bell
1:06:44 right
1:06:46 um and Theo Bell if you don't know is
1:06:48 the most badass character in all of
1:06:50 vampire the Masquerade he is the
1:06:51 freaking man
1:06:53 um and so having uh getting to have kind
1:06:55 of like Theo Bell light on my sheet as
1:06:57 like my mentor awesome and uh it's just
1:07:00 fun to have that kind of like old man
1:07:03 come in and be like all right kid let me
1:07:04 show you the ropes like that's that's
1:07:05 fun
1:07:07 um so I love Kabir and weathers are kind
1:07:09 of like the two halves of Johnny so I
1:07:11 absolutely love those two characters my
1:07:13 favorite though my favorite NPC I didn't
1:07:16 I wish it's criminal that we did not get
1:07:19 more of him which is Shaw
1:07:21 um I remember Lex explaining the concept
1:07:24 of Shaw to me and being like I hate this
1:07:27 [ __ ] already but like in that
1:07:29 like the perfect kind of heels right
1:07:31 where it was tilted about this dude
1:07:33 before we played second but like you
1:07:35 know in a way that that like a heel
1:07:37 tilts you where you're like oh guy he's
1:07:40 so hateable I love it
1:07:42 um yeah and and show is perfect and like
1:07:45 I'm I'm still bummed that
1:07:47 um that he got killed because I I I hate
1:07:50 it so did he get killed yeah well I mean
1:07:54 he did right in the passive voice I see
1:07:56 that
1:07:57 um someone he someone trips face first
1:08:00 into my teeth well but I mean here's the
1:08:03 thing like
1:08:04 um Garrett dislikes killing my villains
1:08:06 I I much prefer keeping my villains
1:08:09 around even to like the Chagrin of like
1:08:12 my my fellow players at the table like
1:08:14 back in the day of you know playing
1:08:15 tabletop games like Tim and Rob and
1:08:17 stuff like that like you know we've
1:08:19 we've had actually with Lux actually
1:08:21 like the you know we were playing
1:08:22 gutsers right iron iron Kingdom's role
1:08:26 playing games you [ __ ] so bad
1:08:28 and I I think I have to the detriment of
1:08:32 the table kept villains alive alive in
1:08:35 Triple Crossed yeah and it tickles me to
1:08:39 no end like knowing that they're gonna
1:08:40 come back around to to visit punishment
1:08:42 back on us which I think is great I I
1:08:44 think it's so much more interesting when
1:08:46 you leave a villain alive and give them
1:08:48 extra reason to do bad stuff to you
1:08:51 um
1:08:51 it makes for a more interesting game
1:08:54 right come on
1:08:55 so Shaw is definitely my number one hell
1:08:58 yeah
1:08:58 Shaw is the first NPC that I
1:09:02 that that like really like hit the
1:09:05 second Mark for me that the hatred Mark
1:09:07 uh and loving to hate Shaw was a good
1:09:11 point for me to like establish who
1:09:13 Britta was and how she thought
1:09:16 um and you know there's a couple other
1:09:18 other names on the hate lists uh you
1:09:21 know race is fun for that I feel like
1:09:22 that's a good General choice but
1:09:25 nobody likes that [ __ ] game no nobody
1:09:27 likes uh I mean
1:09:29 Roland's is fun for that
1:09:32 um yeah
1:09:34 but when it comes to I I'm really
1:09:37 struggling with this question because I
1:09:38 just adore too many of the NPCs there's
1:09:41 there's NPCs that I genuinely like full
1:09:44 on just straightforwardly adore like
1:09:48 like Ramirez and like
1:09:51 uh fester
1:09:53 and there's like just there's NPCs that
1:09:56 just like
1:09:57 uncomplicatedly fall into that category
1:10:00 but not necessarily as strongly as the
1:10:03 NPCs who complicated they fall into that
1:10:05 category like my favorite Trope for
1:10:09 anything like like we're all playing
1:10:11 games like like books like it does not
1:10:14 matter the medium I'm always here for
1:10:16 the cult of the dark story
1:10:18 so the hate love category is going to be
1:10:22 my strongest category of NBC so I mean
1:10:23 Pendragon my sire uh any any
1:10:28 any NPC that uh would outstretch a hand
1:10:33 with a knife behind it is gonna be my
1:10:36 favorite
1:10:37 oh yeah
1:10:40 um
1:10:41 God I [ __ ] love Fester
1:10:43 I love Fester so much I uh I actually
1:10:46 didn't I wasn't present for a lot of the
1:10:48 Fester scenes that we recorded uh for
1:10:51 leading up to the party wow
1:10:53 um because I was I think it was a rough
1:10:54 day and I I said I had to take a nap
1:10:57 um so I was like I was checked out
1:11:00 um and so
1:11:01 during uh Housewives part two was the
1:11:04 first time I got to hear a lot of that
1:11:05 and it was it was great it was so good
1:11:07 faster uh Ramirez also makes my list
1:11:10 well I'm a stalker for Hunter the like
1:11:12 onto the Reckoning I love it no yeah no
1:11:15 [ __ ] like and [ __ ] Ramirez the
1:11:18 innocent I mean like you and I have had
1:11:20 that like big conversation about like
1:11:21 the the best innocent tropes and just
1:11:23 the innocent who's just like hey guys
1:11:26 like I guess doing okay I brought a
1:11:28 pizza [ __ ] he's so good
1:11:31 um there's actually a picture that comes
1:11:34 to mind for Ramirez yeah yeah uh it's in
1:11:37 the Innocence book I know that picture
1:11:39 yeah with the window yeah it's basically
1:11:41 this it is it's this dude who's like
1:11:43 heavy set and like and like a tank top
1:11:47 and he's just leaning at the windowsill
1:11:49 smoking a cigarette outside and then
1:11:52 perched beside him outside in a trench
1:11:56 coat and looking as like goth out as
1:11:59 possible is his vampire friend and it's
1:12:02 just the two of them like hanging out at
1:12:04 night shooting the [ __ ] and I'm like
1:12:06 that's remember [ __ ] yeah
1:12:09 you may be a monster but he just he's
1:12:11 just he really just sees a person and is
1:12:13 like hey what's up you like pizza I have
1:12:15 to put Romeo on my list too but I'm
1:12:17 still mad at you for killing him
1:12:19 immediately after saying hi immediately
1:12:27 isn't even the first attack he's like
1:12:29 this one vampire dies like oh look he's
1:12:31 still alive like oh now he's dead
1:12:36 I uh
1:12:38 man he was on screen for so little but
1:12:40 he really liked Drew by ear he just
1:12:42 [ __ ] died immediately uh so funny
1:12:45 thing about you by ear oh is when we
1:12:47 first introduced him and he was it was
1:12:49 like recorded
1:12:51 I had a bunch of friends
1:12:55 my favorite I love this character and
1:12:59 they stop and they're like Lex please
1:13:01 don't kill them please and I'm like
1:13:04 I'll do my best and like we had already
1:13:06 because that character was dead like
1:13:08 weeks ago and I was just like oh no the
1:13:11 roles in that hotel room were so so bad
1:13:15 I gotta segue for a minute because
1:13:17 actually one of the favorite NPCs oh
1:13:19 yeah but it's been so long since the
1:13:22 recording that it was it feels like a
1:13:24 long time ago was it was Marcos yeah oh
1:13:27 yeah
1:13:29 um Sophia has to be on here I love to
1:13:30 hateless yes and no I love your love to
1:13:33 love list
1:13:35 I don't know how to feel about zofield
1:13:36 yet I feel like it's still a mystery
1:13:38 like I mean to be perfectly honest
1:13:39 there's a such a great cast of NPCs in
1:13:42 this game miles respects the game though
1:13:44 so like Z he's like okay all right I'm
1:13:48 not I'm not into you know you doing this
1:13:51 to me but like okay it's a good move I
1:13:55 understand the need to possess somebody
1:13:56 to get dirty things done sometimes I
1:13:59 gotta respect the player
1:14:00 okay real [ __ ] basketball we're
1:14:03 talking about them uh one of the
1:14:04 questions that we got was how do you
1:14:06 spell Z's name
1:14:08 oh uh Z
1:14:11 thank you Tim
1:14:14 I don't know why I thought you were
1:14:16 going to continue something there
1:14:20 uh z-o uh f-i-e-l yes I wrote it down
1:14:24 and I was correct I would have been
1:14:26 [ __ ] and then like x o p h you
1:14:29 know so one more one more NPC we love to
1:14:32 hate that has escaped all of our lists
1:14:34 and our list no he's on mine is he good
1:14:37 uh say it so my love to hate more than
1:14:39 any of the other NPCs is [ __ ] um
1:14:51 all right I'm gonna say a spoiler
1:14:54 veto story is not over no she sure it
1:14:58 was just talking about leaving don't
1:14:59 kill me like it amused me to no end that
1:15:03 you guys were like oh my God Vito's
1:15:05 being horrible I'm like oh
1:15:08 no this was supposed to be the innocent
1:15:10 like yeah I know
1:15:13 the the the odd the like visible like oh
1:15:17 this [ __ ] when he like was doing
1:15:21 creepo [ __ ] on Brita like the whole
1:15:23 table was like well he's dying now right
1:15:25 like we're gonna kill this guy we're
1:15:27 gonna hand him over we're gonna kill
1:15:28 this man for torture I gotta respect his
1:15:30 style in that particular no you do not I
1:15:33 totally do another another you got a
1:15:35 leather jacket yeah
1:15:36 the fact that you brought him in with a
1:15:38 leather jacket to denote he was a brujah
1:15:41 but the thing is he doesn't wear a biker
1:15:44 jacket like a proper bruja he wears one
1:15:46 of those like weird gross Euro trash
1:15:49 leather jackets
1:15:51 but it also had spikes on it yeah yeah
1:15:55 but but they're like the little weird
1:15:57 like flat but dazzled stuff studs yeah I
1:15:59 was gonna say are we sure they're not
1:16:00 just like tiny metal nipples or
1:16:02 something it's bedazzled into like a
1:16:05 weird like sword with like wings on it
1:16:07 and stuff like that with like
1:16:23 [Laughter]
1:16:28 but yeah a big up Deluxe on this too
1:16:30 though the um you know like hand in hand
1:16:33 with leaving villains alive I just I I
1:16:35 like I like it when you have a
1:16:37 relationship with your Storyteller where
1:16:38 you can let your character be vulnerable
1:16:41 and give yourself blind spots and Lex is
1:16:45 the kind of Storyteller that knows how
1:16:47 to take advantage of that but like for
1:16:49 dramatic reasons not in like a meme not
1:16:51 in a mean you make make you feel stupid
1:16:53 which in turn makes you as a player feel
1:16:56 more confident more giving yourself
1:16:57 risks get more risks and give yourself
1:17:00 more blind spots knowing that it's gonna
1:17:03 make things more interesting for your
1:17:04 your people playing beside you and for
1:17:07 the Storyteller giving you all some
1:17:09 stories of the fact that like you know
1:17:10 people are still alive it's great yeah I
1:17:13 want to speak to that because I was
1:17:14 talking about like my favorite NPCs are
1:17:16 all about like like that culture the
1:17:18 dark storyline and you know I love dark
1:17:22 icky gross [ __ ] I I love like like I
1:17:25 find it like really entertaining to like
1:17:27 work with villains that like you know on
1:17:30 a scale of like threat from like veto to
1:17:32 Pendragon obviously uh that covers
1:17:35 topics that if you're not with a group
1:17:37 of people that you can't communicate
1:17:39 well with could be really difficult and
1:17:41 it having a having a Storyteller who
1:17:44 cares having a group that cares being
1:17:46 able and comfortable to like express
1:17:48 yourself and feel heard and being able
1:17:50 to check in with people I mean that's so
1:17:52 incredibly important to like having
1:17:55 these amazing NPCs and having these
1:17:57 Amazing Stories oh yeah
1:17:59 what about your Lex who do you like
1:18:02 portraying the most who do I like
1:18:04 portraying the most you like portraying
1:18:06 the most and who is the so these are a
1:18:08 couple of questions we got who do you
1:18:10 like portraying the most and who is the
1:18:12 hardest for you to portray like who are
1:18:14 you just like God I have to bring this
1:18:15 [ __ ] character on screen but like uh
1:18:18 hmm okay this is actually really really
1:18:21 good questions yeah right
1:18:23 uh I think
1:18:26 so as far as my favorite NPCs go yeah uh
1:18:30 my
1:18:31 the main three are probably weathers
1:18:36 um Elsa and Rhys yeah I think those are
1:18:40 kind of the three that you can have I
1:18:43 feel like I can have very long
1:18:45 conversations with them and feel like
1:18:48 there's kind of a dynamic exchange going
1:18:51 more than most
1:18:53 uh the hardest
1:18:56 uh I I would actually have to say uh
1:19:00 Arabella this is the most difficult for
1:19:03 me
1:19:04 um because
1:19:06 I'm trying to do two things at once
1:19:08 every time I'm portraying the character
1:19:10 which is actually really hard for this
1:19:13 table because
1:19:14 uh
1:19:16 you guys egg each other on and it kind
1:19:18 of causes uh sometimes uh a reaction to
1:19:22 an NPC becomes infectious and everyone's
1:19:24 feeling it because it's one person felt
1:19:26 like you know what I mean like they
1:19:27 picked on Neil [ __ ] them we're all
1:19:29 killing him like [ __ ] all right this
1:19:31 guy's done you know what I mean uh yeah
1:19:33 but so the thing with Arabella is
1:19:36 I am trying to convey to miles
1:19:41 the whole speech of We're Not So
1:19:44 Different you and I yeah right while
1:19:47 also being like hey I am blatantly a
1:19:49 problem you guys need to deal with me so
1:19:51 the rest of the cautery and I'm trying
1:19:53 to basically get miles to be like hey
1:19:55 guys guys she's not so bad and that is
1:19:58 actually really difficult because miles
1:20:01 more than gonna be honest any PC at the
1:20:04 table really just wants to fight
1:20:06 something finally and like have a throw
1:20:09 down Tim's audible disappointment when
1:20:11 I'm sorry end of season two right very
1:20:15 finale season two where like wind and
1:20:17 Johnny are like we're gonna go deal with
1:20:18 Kabir and miles is like grabbing his
1:20:20 [ __ ] sword yeah I'm gonna do it and
1:20:22 Tim's like yeah we're gonna do it and
1:20:24 then you walk in with all the [ __ ]
1:20:25 princes and Tim's like just
1:20:49 you know what I've decided I'm not
1:20:52 waiting for you to further enchant my
1:20:53 sword we're going now
1:20:55 so like I have to kind of walk this
1:20:58 final there's also there's just like a
1:21:00 couple NPCs Arabelle is one of them uh
1:21:02 where like it you're right they're
1:21:04 definitely infectious like hey guys uh
1:21:06 [ __ ] this guy [ __ ] this guy but there's
1:21:09 also there's a few NPCs where like it
1:21:12 kind of does split the table on how we
1:21:13 look at them and it's
1:21:15 [ __ ] good story I feel like pen
1:21:18 dragon is becoming really good for that
1:21:20 yeah to some extent Roland was
1:21:25 um by one reason or another yeah which
1:21:27 kind of one of those things where uh
1:21:29 they are intended to be these kind of
1:21:33 very honestly evil self-serving
1:21:36 characters but sometimes the things that
1:21:38 they want and the things that you guys
1:21:39 want a line and when that happens you
1:21:42 guys are like oh maybe we'll kill Reese
1:21:45 next game I mean I think Reese is
1:21:48 probably one of the best vampire
1:21:50 villains I've ever encountered he's not
1:21:54 my favorite a straw is my favorite but
1:21:55 but but Reese might just be the best
1:21:58 I've ever actually seen portrayed in a
1:22:00 game because there's so many times we'll
1:22:03 be talking about the game you know uh
1:22:05 like after hours like that and Reese's
1:22:09 he's just such a problem and there's no
1:22:11 good way to solve it you can't you just
1:22:13 you can't kill him because he's too
1:22:15 essential for the domain right yeah no
1:22:18 he still is the Clan's still essential
1:22:20 to The Domain
1:22:21 um and he is respectful enough of the
1:22:25 rules where you can't just justify going
1:22:27 after him yeah it's it's it's such and
1:22:30 Bravo to you Alexa portraying that and
1:22:32 yeah creating a domain that has that
1:22:35 problem where like peripherally like
1:22:37 there's there's just no good answer for
1:22:38 that New Haven does like it'll
1:22:40 transition this a little bit New Haven
1:22:42 does feel like very you were talking
1:22:44 about lived-in world and all that kind
1:22:45 of stuff so some of the questions that
1:22:46 we were getting right are like uh why
1:22:48 New Haven 99 like why that's all you
1:22:53 so I can't reveal too much because some
1:22:56 of the reasons I chose the time that I
1:22:58 did are
1:23:00 uh kind of packed with spoilers some of
1:23:03 the things that I chose the timeline for
1:23:05 have actually already happened so like
1:23:07 uh it's in in 1999 the world of Darkness
1:23:11 kind of changes right and the
1:23:15 I thought it'd be interesting and a good
1:23:17 kind of trip down that Nostalgia road to
1:23:23 run a story set during a time when all
1:23:27 of like the exciting things are really
1:23:29 starting to kick up
1:23:31 and I chose New Haven uh so
1:23:35 for those who know uh I do draw a bit
1:23:39 from the dark Colony Source book
1:23:41 um from like I think first or second a
1:23:43 very very old
1:23:45 old vampire book but
1:23:47 had a lot of really interesting
1:23:49 characters and Concepts so I wanted
1:23:53 somewhere that was a little more
1:23:56 protagonisty than some of the others and
1:23:58 I thought New Haven would be a very
1:24:01 interesting spot because it's between
1:24:04 what's essentially you know the
1:24:07 territories controlled by operation
1:24:08 Longbow and the territories controlled
1:24:10 by what would be one of the
1:24:14 largest driving forces for the Sabbat so
1:24:17 it was a good spot to squeeze the PCS
1:24:19 right in the middle of it
1:24:21 while also giving Sanctuary to like the
1:24:25 fires themselves you know like in the
1:24:27 pan not the not the fire
1:24:30 uh so that's why I wanted to do that uh
1:24:33 because the idea was to give this whole
1:24:37 nostalgia-oriented story about kind of
1:24:40 an old school feeling Quarry
1:24:43 I felt v20 kind of offered
1:24:48 um
1:24:49 something that I was most connected to
1:24:52 in terms of my past experience of the
1:24:54 game and a lot of you uh hadn't really
1:24:56 done
1:24:58 kind of a long-term vampire the
1:25:00 Masquerade tabletop game before so for
1:25:03 that matter proper camarilla tabletop
1:25:05 yeah yeah or Camarillo
1:25:08 um no no it's cameras I can't even
1:25:10 remember where I am on that you're on
1:25:13 the camera you're on the camera is that
1:25:15 the opposite of you there yeah yes
1:25:17 that's the opposite meaning
1:25:19 but yeah so um
1:25:22 it was I didn't want to just introduce
1:25:24 the game in the world I wanted to
1:25:26 introduce my experiences with a game in
1:25:29 the world on flv20 most
1:25:31 kind of represented that
1:25:34 so that's what I did yeah we had also
1:25:36 talked about early on right like
1:25:38 um
1:25:39 because we were doing something new with
1:25:43 like podcasting and format and trying to
1:25:45 do stuff going back to the things that
1:25:46 we knew the best and like were the most
1:25:48 familiar with so we could kind of shoot
1:25:50 off a cuff and for a first time out like
1:25:52 don't stretch too hard right
1:25:55 yeah it was like well I mean so I'd been
1:25:57 running it for so long
1:25:59 uh that it felt like something
1:26:03 it felt like something I knew I could do
1:26:05 without needing to run to uh the rule
1:26:08 book frequently
1:26:10 and if I needed to make a ruling off the
1:26:13 top of my head I could do something that
1:26:14 was kind of close enough to where the
1:26:17 way the game works that it wouldn't be
1:26:20 this weird odd mechanic being tacked
1:26:23 onto the system
1:26:24 so one of the questions we got from a
1:26:27 few people
1:26:27 um speaking of was uh
1:26:32 in our in our outro we talk about we
1:26:34 have a few limited houses
1:26:36 uh do you want to talk about the house
1:26:38 rules
1:26:39 so there's
1:26:42 a couple uh that are very uh unobtrusive
1:26:47 um but there's a few that are really big
1:26:49 so in the system normally when
1:26:53 initiative gets ruled
1:26:55 everyone declares what they intend to do
1:26:58 from slowest character to fastest
1:27:01 so if someone will if there's two
1:27:04 characters fighting one rules a 12
1:27:05 initiative the other one was a 15
1:27:06 initiative the one that after they
1:27:09 determine who has what for initiative
1:27:11 the character with the lowest initiative
1:27:13 actually says what they intend to do and
1:27:15 then the character was the higher
1:27:16 initiative can take that information
1:27:18 into account when deciding what they
1:27:21 will do and then they announce what they
1:27:23 intend to do for the character that is
1:27:25 going at the lower initiative if they
1:27:26 intend to change their action they have
1:27:28 to spend a point of willpower so what I
1:27:30 wanted to do was keep the combat flowing
1:27:35 in a more narrative way and not be hyper
1:27:39 focused on the nitty-gritty of the fight
1:27:42 itself so I adopted the whole like style
1:27:45 over substance like you know themes of
1:27:48 you know some of the other games I've
1:27:49 played and was kind of I removed the
1:27:54 complexity of the initiative system and
1:27:56 kind of kept it simple so that we could
1:27:58 just all of all of your roles all of
1:28:01 your data operations all of it should be
1:28:03 focused on the action of the scene
1:28:05 so I feel that lends more to like a like
1:28:08 a cool stylish narrative combat scene
1:28:12 um
1:28:13 I mean beyond that there are some power
1:28:15 some combination disciplines that I
1:28:17 pulled from uh revised that kind of made
1:28:22 their way into things
1:28:24 um some of the character sheets for NPCs
1:28:26 in the setting had were actually from
1:28:28 second edition so I had to kind of
1:28:30 convert over in a bit of an
1:28:33 approximation of where things would be
1:28:35 in terms of power level
1:28:37 a lot of the really older character
1:28:39 sheets uh use much less in the way of
1:28:43 points than uh revised and v20
1:28:46 characters do they kind of exponentially
1:28:48 kind of grew in terms of like uh written
1:28:51 mechanics
1:28:53 um but it's a lot of that whenever
1:28:55 there's a house rule it's intended to
1:28:59 kind of keep things moving I tend to
1:29:02 feel like in a tabletop or a special an
1:29:04 alarm
1:29:04 speed kills any choice you can make to
1:29:07 make the scene move faster and have more
1:29:11 the memorable moments to be focused on
1:29:12 the things that actually people describe
1:29:14 in role play the better your combat
1:29:15 scene is
1:29:16 unobtrusive was a good word for that
1:29:18 yeah I think I think all of all of your
1:29:20 house rules are definitely things that
1:29:22 just make it more intuitive and just if
1:29:26 you're not paying attention you don't
1:29:27 notice
1:29:28 uh speaking of like sheets and mechanics
1:29:31 and updating and stuff uh one of the
1:29:32 questions we got a couple of times
1:29:34 um is would we ever consider uh
1:29:38 releasing either like some prep notes
1:29:41 for people to see or like actual like
1:29:46 screen caps uh or rather like pictures
1:29:48 of our character sheets uh I am wildly
1:29:52 against this only because mine looks
1:29:54 like it looks like a mulcavian sheet but
1:29:57 like for real it's [ __ ] unreadable by
1:30:01 this she means that he's so interested
1:30:04 I doodle on my sheet while I'm listening
1:30:07 to scenes a lot so I have a lot of
1:30:08 things in my margin I've got like weird
1:30:10 notes in the margin oh no I just have
1:30:12 like shapes I have lots of shapes
1:30:14 everywhere
1:30:16 I think I spilled like a like a drink on
1:30:18 part of mine at one point I have a
1:30:20 requisite Chinese food stain on my shirt
1:30:22 it's good to show
1:30:25 I actually had planned on scanning these
1:30:27 sheets at one point early on and then
1:30:29 completely forgot
1:30:32 maybe like maybe at one point we can
1:30:34 like
1:30:35 scan them so I did take a picture of
1:30:38 Samantha Pratt's sheet I was thinking of
1:30:40 uh uploading to Twitter Samantha want to
1:30:43 see Samantha with a c oh it's some it's
1:30:45 Samantha with a c hon and it ends with
1:30:47 an E do you know you know all stars of
1:30:48 the C coincidence
1:30:51 so I have character sheets for PCs that
1:30:57 I played when I was like 19. damn and
1:31:01 it's not like one or two like I have
1:31:03 almost all of them which is weird
1:31:05 because I am horrible about losing other
1:31:08 people's character sheets
1:31:10 but for like I have like when werewolf
1:31:13 The Forsaken first came out I have the
1:31:15 character sheet of the very first one of
1:31:17 them for second gear I saw those yeah
1:31:19 like I have I have an exaltated
1:31:21 character sheet where a friend of mine
1:31:24 from high school had drawn character art
1:31:26 on the back and I still have that that's
1:31:29 awesome um
1:31:32 and I usually uh don't show people all
1:31:37 the details of my character sheet until
1:31:38 the characters died it makes sense and I
1:31:40 think in this case I think it's smart uh
1:31:43 because if we're gonna be honest this is
1:31:46 a pretty dangerous game and you guys
1:31:47 have lucked out a long way yes but the
1:31:51 third season's coming and
1:31:54 should we lose someone uh should it
1:31:57 should a character be final death I
1:31:59 think that's when I will be comfortable
1:32:01 with them revealing their characters
1:32:02 Memorial I think that's a very cool idea
1:32:04 I don't think otherwise we'd ever be
1:32:06 able to release an accurate sheet too
1:32:08 because I mean we get XP every session
1:32:10 we like build we we there's a lot of
1:32:12 reasons that the sheets kind of change
1:32:14 as well they grow and they reflect the
1:32:17 flow of the story but when the story
1:32:18 ends I think that's when it's okay to
1:32:21 pull back it's a very cool way to do
1:32:23 that yeah yeah and I don't want to share
1:32:24 my prep work either I mean I'm literally
1:32:26 looking at the six pages of notes that I
1:32:28 took uh when I was nervous about
1:32:31 kidnapped yeah I want I want on Twitter
1:32:35 yeah I want publish all of Rebecca's
1:32:39 like I want all of Rebecca's Pendragon
1:32:42 notes
1:32:44 someone's gonna have to put a lot of
1:32:46 motive there for me did you see that the
1:32:49 the post that uh Gareth Sister Sarah had
1:32:52 posted about how uh the interaction was
1:32:55 giving Anita Blake Vibes so somehow
1:32:58 despite who I am as a person I've never
1:33:00 read that series you're fine I don't I
1:33:04 unfortunately I had no contacts for that
1:33:05 but um
1:33:08 what I
1:33:11 so uh it is obviously like a very like
1:33:15 sexual uh kind of smutty novel series
1:33:20 and
1:33:22 and uh in it
1:33:24 um
1:33:25 there are a lot of uh Blurred Lines for
1:33:29 antagonist romantic interests and Roman
1:33:33 Pendragon is very much a like
1:33:36 it is unclear as to like
1:33:39 what he's about in terms of like his
1:33:43 interactions with
1:33:45 I um
1:33:47 part of the reason someone I'm joking
1:33:50 about I mean I'm not joking there there
1:33:51 are literally six pages of notes in
1:33:53 front of me but I you know I as I've I
1:33:56 said that I I love like I love dark I
1:34:00 like dark romance I like like
1:34:02 questionable antagonists it's a favorite
1:34:04 category for me but uh I was so nervous
1:34:08 about being able to like portray like
1:34:10 flirting or portray like that
1:34:12 questionable line and like strategies
1:34:15 and like how Bretta might respond to it
1:34:16 that I spent a lot of time like like
1:34:19 exploring like
1:34:21 how she as someone as a torridor as
1:34:24 someone who like has a lot of like Grace
1:34:27 and Mystique and like ability would like
1:34:30 operate in the space
1:34:33 how many hours have we spent talking
1:34:35 about like
1:34:37 which is the podcast in general but like
1:34:39 oh my God what am I gonna do a lot
1:34:43 same actually I talked to Rebecca tons
1:34:45 about the interactions and it was I I
1:34:51 feel that it gave uh the effect that I
1:34:55 was looking for right uh foreign
1:34:58 mentioned a few times uh when he
1:35:01 listened to the episode uh he re-shots
1:35:04 me it was like oh my God Pendragon was
1:35:07 so gross I hate him so much also so
1:35:11 you're like running this LARP set in
1:35:12 Boston you should totally bring Ben
1:35:14 Dragon into that I think he's I think
1:35:16 the games need more of that and it was
1:35:20 and I was like all right I think this is
1:35:22 it's working this is uh having the
1:35:25 intended effect if you ever want those
1:35:27 notes to hit the real world there's
1:35:29 there's gonna have to be some serious
1:35:31 motivation behind that desire or just a
1:35:34 lot of One-Shot man how much how many
1:35:37 donations a month do we need I'm not
1:35:39 telling someone's gonna have to figure
1:35:41 it out yeah I kind of I kind of want
1:35:43 like pen Dragon to absolutely come
1:35:46 across as like the villain of a fanfic
1:35:48 oh God you know what I mean that's 100
1:35:50 as someone who reads and writes a lot of
1:35:52 fanfics man I heard that you hit it good
1:35:55 good good you hit that
1:35:57 sorry okay
1:36:05 see like like see what I mean like Tim's
1:36:08 already done with this guy
1:36:10 was it that that Dracula [ __ ]
1:36:13 he's a fan of the Opera [ __ ]
1:36:19 uh that's actually like so one of the
1:36:21 questions we get a couple of times
1:36:23 um just gonna [ __ ] piggyback up the
1:36:26 weird fanfic into the Blake [ __ ] uh well
1:36:29 I do have to ask okay you did a great
1:36:31 job oh yeah
1:36:33 it does need to be said that uh the
1:36:36 interactions were absolutely great and I
1:36:39 just based on the reactions I'm seeing
1:36:40 on Twitter everyone's like oh my God it
1:36:42 was pretty good too yeah honestly the
1:36:45 amount of all caps I think anyway I
1:36:47 mentioned one so we talk about like
1:36:48 people live stream or live tweet like
1:36:51 the reactions to the episodes and some
1:36:53 of those episodes grew up and just like
1:36:55 the all caps
1:36:57 yeah even when it was happening I I just
1:37:01 sickler called Garrett and uh Erica
1:37:04 watching and Gary like okay do the thing
1:37:06 now more yes continue I want to talk
1:37:09 about that yes
1:37:11 so the way that that happened in like
1:37:15 real life is that we ended a recording
1:37:19 session with Lex running the summoning
1:37:23 to to the limo and then because of many
1:37:26 factors
1:37:28 um you know coveted safety some other
1:37:30 health concerns things coming up
1:37:32 personally uh we didn't record for two
1:37:35 months so I had just like that's part of
1:37:38 when I when I mentioned like like my
1:37:40 nerves and that sort of thing which um I
1:37:42 was really lucky like that people were a
1:37:45 willing to hear me out and be supportive
1:37:47 there and be tolerant of me not shutting
1:37:50 the [ __ ] up
1:37:51 um but uh there was like two months of
1:37:54 have been kidnapped mm-hmm wonder about
1:37:58 it yeah I was I was so smug making you
1:38:01 Pond robot as a cop for two weeks she's
1:38:04 gonna wonder what's gonna happen next
1:38:06 and then it kept going I just started
1:38:08 feeling bad
1:38:09 two two quick things that that
1:38:12 kidnapping scene there was legitimately
1:38:14 a thunderstorm yeah outside that that I
1:38:18 think you can barely it sort of did it
1:38:21 didn't really come across in the final
1:38:23 editing we reacted to it it was in the
1:38:25 Raw audio I promised but it didn't make
1:38:27 it through the filters but just just so
1:38:29 you all know they're like we're having a
1:38:31 normal gaming session and then the
1:38:32 second Pendragon shows up it's
1:38:34 legitimately like thunder and lightning
1:38:37 outside so like Lex would say something
1:38:39 and we'd hear the like crack of of
1:38:41 Thunder Rex would not just say something
1:38:43 I remember distinctly there was like two
1:38:45 different times where he would say the
1:38:47 name Pendragon and it would thunder
1:38:49 outside it was so good yeah [ __ ]
1:38:52 and and then the other thing too is just
1:38:55 all of that Pendragon uh scene uh just
1:38:59 incredibly well done because I think
1:39:01 objectively not a lot
1:39:03 physically like happens right like it's
1:39:07 it's kind of a subdued thing but my God
1:39:10 you guys in an audio medium managed to
1:39:13 make that whole thing
1:39:15 so intense and dripping with just like
1:39:18 oh my God she tilted her head like it's
1:39:22 very good very used the sword to tip
1:39:26 no Erica was [ __ ] vibrating yeah
1:39:30 it's something at this table like that
1:39:33 scene and you know a bunch of other
1:39:34 scenes like getting the energy and
1:39:36 getting the hype from everyone here like
1:39:38 like I
1:39:40 I when I get nervous I've got this bad
1:39:42 habit of basically putting on like
1:39:44 blinders to the sides of my eyes and
1:39:46 just focusing on Lex but uh when I can
1:39:49 get past that and I know that like this
1:39:51 is something that Rings true for other
1:39:52 people at this table that like feeling
1:39:55 just that energy and love for your
1:39:57 character is so motivating to like like
1:40:00 contributing story and putting your own
1:40:02 details forth
1:40:05 one of the questions we got a bunch of
1:40:06 times
1:40:07 um we're gonna just sort of wrap these
1:40:09 into each other I think are like what
1:40:10 are some Inspirations for your
1:40:12 characters like what are for the
1:40:13 characters like what are some what
1:40:15 inspired your characters uh a little bit
1:40:17 and then additionally
1:40:20 um talking about all the fanfic and
1:40:22 stuff what are uh what are what's the
1:40:24 table's like favorite pieces of Empire
1:40:25 media that's
1:40:27 that's not us
1:40:30 yeah I actually I actually had can
1:40:33 answer this one for me yeah pretty
1:40:34 easily
1:40:36 um so uh John Johnny Saxon uh the
1:40:41 character was actually lifted from a uh
1:40:43 a parlor character that I I had created
1:40:45 and ran for like just a couple months
1:40:48 um but I really loved the the concept
1:40:50 for it I wanted to do more I think he
1:40:52 was originally an anarch
1:40:53 um and he wasn't as well fleshed out as
1:40:56 Johnny the podcast was but I think Lex
1:40:58 was like do that bruja and I I didn't I
1:41:02 think it's been a lot of fun
1:41:04 um but I wanted the classic
1:41:06 biker jacket like I mean in all the old
1:41:10 art for 90s bruja he's just like a dude
1:41:13 wearing a t-shirt with like jeans and a
1:41:15 biker jacket like it's the same [ __ ]
1:41:17 bruja everywhere right
1:41:20 um
1:41:21 cheesy looking dude in the in the The
1:41:23 Met book right you know what I'm talking
1:41:24 about
1:41:25 um
1:41:27 and uh for my own inspiration in in
1:41:31 outside of that uh like I think I showed
1:41:35 you the music video for killed by death
1:41:37 by Motorhead
1:41:38 where let me just crash as a motorcycle
1:41:41 through a wall to grab like this floozy
1:41:44 on the back of his bike and just they
1:41:45 drive off and you know
1:41:48 um if you've never seen it check out
1:41:49 that music video
1:41:51 um and then in terms of in terms of
1:41:53 actual like um
1:41:55 vampire media
1:41:58 um I think my my favorite vampire film
1:42:00 is near near dark
1:42:02 um and Bill Paxton and near dark who's
1:42:05 totally a Sabbat member but
1:42:08 um if anything but that that character
1:42:10 there is a lot of inspiration for how I
1:42:13 want Johnny to be if he was a good guy
1:42:14 right like that's the near dark vampire
1:42:18 that Bill Paxton plays is if Johnny
1:42:20 continued with the Sabbat and went down
1:42:22 a dark Road
1:42:24 um I'm imagining if the character tried
1:42:27 to cling to his humanity and figured out
1:42:29 it was trying to figure out how to
1:42:31 actually do that but I think that's
1:42:32 probably the big inspiration for him
1:42:37 foreign
1:42:43 the character inspiration uh it kind of
1:42:46 speaks a little bit more to my process
1:42:48 where I don't start with a character
1:42:50 most of the time I fill roles uh in in a
1:42:55 group so I have a tendency to pick a
1:42:58 bunch of roles after everybody else has
1:42:59 to figure that out and then I kind of
1:43:01 just morph into a character after a
1:43:05 certain point
1:43:06 um all of a sat down we're like we need
1:43:08 a leader I mean I'm always willing to do
1:43:12 that take charge and tell you people
1:43:14 what to do perfect
1:43:17 are straight man like we do in real life
1:43:22 um our Grump the uh
1:43:25 and the character and everything else is
1:43:28 very much the guy in the glasses 90s
1:43:30 anime
1:43:32 um
1:43:33 like wow
1:43:36 um
1:43:37 put glasses on Virgil yeah
1:43:40 yeah just there is definitely some
1:43:43 Virgil five but I actually didn't
1:43:44 realize that until much later I was like
1:43:47 oh that just makes sense because
1:43:48 Virgil's blue yeah which is that you're
1:43:52 playing blue only to Johnny's Red on it
1:43:54 and
1:43:56 um more fan art
1:43:58 yes please I the accent and talking just
1:44:02 came about I don't it just it just came
1:44:04 I don't know where it came from it just
1:44:06 existed you know like yeah like rich guy
1:44:08 transatlantic like semi weird
1:44:10 transatlantic I don't know it just I
1:44:12 start a character and it just happens
1:44:14 um
1:44:15 and in terms of vampire media
1:44:19 um mildly unconventional uh John Wick
1:44:22 John Wick is such a good cam story it's
1:44:25 crazy yeah yep the underworld in John
1:44:28 Wick is quite possibly one of my
1:44:30 favorite depictions I don't know if
1:44:32 that's ever been said explicitly but
1:44:36 it's Gotta oh my God watch the writers
1:44:38 there's no way yeah the writers had to
1:44:40 know what they're doing right maybe I
1:44:42 don't know they exchanged Boons and like
1:44:45 yeah it's if you need a good primer it's
1:44:48 John Wick and some great action scenes
1:44:49 with Keanu Reeves so white double win
1:44:52 how did you end up uh playing the
1:44:53 ventral because he's your first Venture
1:44:55 that you ever played right I mean in
1:44:57 reality it's like my first real vampire
1:45:00 that I've played for we played like
1:45:01 Requiem and stuff together you also we
1:45:03 also you also
1:45:04 with me where you played enough yeah I
1:45:06 mostly played Nosferatu actually he was
1:45:09 the goddamn Batman and it was amazing
1:45:11 um
1:45:12 why I think we we there was a list and
1:45:16 we're like here's these other ones that
1:45:17 are like yeah let's do Adventure I all I
1:45:19 remember about you playing Adventure is
1:45:21 that you're like yeah it will play
1:45:22 Adventure and then like we got two
1:45:24 sessions in we're like how does Tim
1:45:25 never played a [ __ ] Adventure before
1:45:27 this is insane I remember getting two
1:45:28 sessions in and Tim was like this is
1:45:30 really difficult and I'm like why what's
1:45:33 going on man you're right and Tim's like
1:45:34 I can just look at someone and have
1:45:37 whatever I want
1:45:39 I think I'm getting Drunk on Power
1:45:44 I had to establish some rules and I was
1:45:48 so [ __ ] proud
1:45:49 I was like oh my God I went straight to
1:45:52 his head he's ready he is
1:45:55 dominate is a hell of a drug
1:46:01 um so I don't think I made a conscious
1:46:03 choice to base win off of anything I
1:46:06 generally have a few archetypes that I
1:46:08 go to win is definitely a more combat
1:46:10 heavy version of The Bog witch that I
1:46:13 enjoy playing so with that in mind
1:46:17 um she is kind of a combination of
1:46:19 imperator furiosa and uh
1:46:22 Wolverine
1:46:24 yeah and Morgan from Dragon Age so good
1:46:28 um I was like those are two of the same
1:46:30 characters
1:46:32 um
1:46:33 and then like
1:46:35 any inspiration I I will admit that I
1:46:39 watched underworld long before I got
1:46:40 into vampire and when someone was saying
1:46:43 oh have you ever seen underworld and I
1:46:45 said yes and they said yeah they got
1:46:47 sued by by world of Darkness because for
1:46:51 copyright infringement
1:46:53 um so I said oh okay so I have an idea
1:46:55 of what this is supposed to be like but
1:46:57 in retrospect win is basically if a
1:47:01 vampire was raised by the werewolves in
1:47:03 Underworld the lichens
1:47:08 no they're not just the one was they
1:47:11 were mostly that way like most of them
1:47:13 were terrible this week okay all right
1:47:15 we can't argue about like we're not
1:47:16 doing two hours
1:47:18 no we won't not yet anyways not yet
1:47:22 um I can answer the second more quickly
1:47:25 uh my favorite growing up my favorite
1:47:27 vampire
1:47:29 franchise
1:47:30 um Kim Harrison's the hollows or Dead
1:47:33 witch walking series was huge for me
1:47:36 yeah
1:47:37 um and obviously that's multi-genre for
1:47:39 the people who know about it the main
1:47:40 character is a witch but uh there's also
1:47:43 very quickly the introduction of
1:47:45 vampires and how sort of different
1:47:47 Supernaturals interact and I I mean it
1:47:51 was to this day it still shapes how I
1:47:54 think about
1:47:55 um how a vampire chooses to take blood
1:47:58 there's some discussion in those books
1:48:00 about uh how you bodily consent and you
1:48:05 know like how how that does not apply
1:48:09 and does apply to blood and uh I just
1:48:12 found that to be a wonderful world and
1:48:14 that stuck with me uh sort of to bridge
1:48:17 the two ideas of like my favorite
1:48:19 mediums and inspiration for the
1:48:21 character I don't think I've ever made a
1:48:24 character for any
1:48:26 mildly uh mildly
1:48:30 any any LARP or tabletop that has dark
1:48:34 themes I am Evanescence is playing a
1:48:36 role in my imagination and it's been my
1:48:39 yeah it's it's and that's that's been a
1:48:41 band that's been so close to my heart uh
1:48:43 I I literally my my poor patient mother
1:48:47 would play the Fallen CD uh every single
1:48:50 day for years when I was in elementary
1:48:52 school oh no God no
1:48:56 Elementary School oh that came out I
1:48:59 think how did you bring that up I would
1:49:01 have been free yeah third grade I think
1:49:09 I'm just gonna move on really quickly so
1:49:12 uh
1:49:14 I mean I'm gonna I'm gonna no stick on
1:49:16 that for a bit and just talk about like
1:49:17 the love for that band like that really
1:49:19 like that was my introduction to like
1:49:21 goth culture and like alternative music
1:49:23 and that like pulled me into like this
1:49:24 Arena and will always remain like so
1:49:27 close to my heart and Imagination and
1:49:29 then specifically for Brita
1:49:32 um Ophelia from Hamlet is
1:49:36 um so when you learn to act uh for for
1:49:41 doing Shakespearean voice for for uh
1:49:45 Shakespeare obviously but like you you
1:49:48 take out of your own voice like
1:49:51 your accent uh the different
1:49:53 affectations your your poor vocal habits
1:49:56 you kind of like pull it back to a blank
1:49:58 and the combination of that practice
1:50:01 with the reality of Ophelia as a
1:50:05 character who has to navigate like a
1:50:08 court and nobility and like the powerful
1:50:10 people around her with a certain degree
1:50:12 of like Grace helplessness and depending
1:50:16 on your interpretation whether or not
1:50:18 she loses her mind uh for me that was a
1:50:21 character that was very helpful in
1:50:24 constructing who Bretta might be
1:50:27 uh
1:50:28 for Neil
1:50:30 um Niels II uh
1:50:33 13th generation mulcavian with an
1:50:37 anxiety disorder uh who has a
1:50:40 four-letter name that starts with n that
1:50:42 I've played in the last few years
1:50:46 it is it wasn't even on purpose
1:50:50 is a circle when we started playing
1:50:52 right like when we started like Lex you
1:50:54 had a list of like the things that we
1:50:56 wanted to see and we wanted to stick
1:50:57 with the main Clans and do all that kind
1:50:58 of stuff I have
1:51:01 wow mulcavians are a weird Clan because
1:51:04 like a lot of people don't like
1:51:06 mulcavians but then the people who do
1:51:08 but then there are people who love
1:51:10 malkavians yeah and I'm one of those
1:51:13 people who really likes small cavians
1:51:16 um a lot but I have a very particular
1:51:19 like a particular style of mulcavian
1:51:22 that I like to play that I don't see a
1:51:24 lot right like I remember talking to you
1:51:26 early on likes about like being nervous
1:51:28 playing Nick I've just playing Neil Neil
1:51:31 playing Neil
1:51:33 uh
1:51:35 because like the most famous mulcavian
1:51:37 is uh
1:51:39 was it Jeanette from Bloodlines and like
1:51:42 the like I'm crazy sexy mulcavian is
1:51:46 like the one that gets popular a lot and
1:51:48 the one that I like to do is like I have
1:51:50 a real mental disorder and I'm not doing
1:51:52 okay and like the shit's [ __ ] but I'm
1:51:55 still I don't know there's just like I
1:51:58 it's
1:51:59 I have a I love mulcavians but I have a
1:52:02 way that I like to play mulcavians and I
1:52:03 was worried that they would not come
1:52:04 across well when I was playing Neil do
1:52:06 you mind if I prompt you on this yeah
1:52:08 you talk a lot about how you love
1:52:12 malkavians who prove something true like
1:52:16 like this malkavian said speak to like
1:52:18 so yeah does that the the way that the
1:52:21 way that I look at mulcavians and their
1:52:22 derangements right is
1:52:24 um
1:52:25 and I think I've said this in character
1:52:27 as Neil when I was talking about
1:52:29 Roland's going nuts uh
1:52:32 when you are crazy or like have a
1:52:34 derangement right mulcavians aren't like
1:52:36 like there's all sorts of weird horrific
1:52:39 like lovecraftian Catholic [ __ ] going on
1:52:42 with mulcavians all the time
1:52:44 um
1:52:45 but when you when it's expressed it's
1:52:48 derangements and things like that like
1:52:49 to me
1:52:50 there is a kernel of Truth like they're
1:52:53 at the core of all kavian is a flawed
1:52:55 premise and then you just like there
1:52:58 there was something fundamentally wrong
1:53:00 with how they see the world or right
1:53:02 depending on how you look at it and then
1:53:04 all the rest of their [ __ ] just builds
1:53:05 off that one thing yeah so it's actually
1:53:07 different if you take one flawed premise
1:53:11 of like
1:53:12 uh a kernel of you know truth or untruth
1:53:16 or whatever how about how they see the
1:53:18 world then you build everything out from
1:53:19 there so like Neil's derangement uh
1:53:22 technically is like obsessive compulsive
1:53:24 hoarding right like that's his deal but
1:53:26 it's all built out of anxiety and like a
1:53:29 need to order the world and control the
1:53:31 world around him like and you know it's
1:53:35 not on screen a ton but I remember like
1:53:37 when walking in and being like oh [ __ ]
1:53:39 he's gonna [ __ ] die in a fire because
1:53:40 like we're under a pile of things will
1:53:43 be buried under a pile of magazines and
1:53:44 die like it's he's normally pretty okay
1:53:48 like he's an anxious guy but like he's
1:53:50 usually pretty okay but like he's never
1:53:52 okay but he masks well yeah he masks
1:53:55 well exactly
1:53:56 um so I don't know I just like I like
1:53:58 malkavians I like uh I like Cassandra
1:54:01 syndrome uh his obsession with the moon
1:54:03 and like stars actually predates the
1:54:07 Durante
1:54:09 um let me talk about that a little bit
1:54:10 but like uh
1:54:12 I came up with Neil and he had no real
1:54:15 ass on my connections uh or Durante or
1:54:18 anything like that and we were driving
1:54:19 back uh one day and you were like hey
1:54:22 man
1:54:24 I want like
1:54:26 there's some stuff on the list that
1:54:28 hasn't been checked yet and I think it
1:54:30 would be very cool if we did this like
1:54:31 to Rocky thing like going underneath in
1:54:34 the SMI connections and it clicked into
1:54:37 Neil's like pre-existing like it's not
1:54:39 as derangement he just likes astronomy
1:54:42 um and all that kind of stuff so like I
1:54:45 don't know it's really it was fun to
1:54:46 play that was his like Inspirations for
1:54:47 that kind of stuff real quick just
1:54:49 because we've mentioned it a couple of
1:54:50 times there uh when we were creating
1:54:52 characters there was a list that was
1:54:54 kind of like an A La Carte menu yeah
1:54:56 yeah that Lex put in front of us as um
1:55:00 as a Storyteller and said hey guys these
1:55:02 are you know I want you to create your
1:55:03 own characters but throughout that
1:55:05 process I want you guys to make sure
1:55:07 that all of the items on this list are
1:55:10 checked amongst you so share the load
1:55:13 and incorporate these ideas and Concepts
1:55:16 and they were very vague and they were
1:55:17 very loose there wasn't they didn't
1:55:19 really spoil anything they were just
1:55:21 kind of like okay so here's an
1:55:23 interesting thing I can incorporate into
1:55:24 this character and we kind of worked as
1:55:26 a team to make sure that we had an even
1:55:28 spread everything's covered um and um I
1:55:31 mean I I think that was a great a little
1:55:34 addition to character creation but
1:55:35 that's when we keep mentioning the list
1:55:36 that's what we're talking about yeah
1:55:39 um as far as vampire media and whatever
1:55:40 uh my favorite vampire Source straight
1:55:42 off is left the right one like the
1:55:44 original Let the Right One In uh from
1:55:47 Swedish Norse Norwood Norway uh whatever
1:55:50 it's a very good movie the original one
1:55:53 like I love that [ __ ] vampires it's
1:55:55 that right level of like sad and creepy
1:55:58 and like emotionally fraught that like I
1:56:01 really [ __ ] Vamp that's yeah it
1:56:03 definitely hits the the notes that I
1:56:05 think you really like those are my those
1:56:06 are the vampire notes I like a lot like
1:56:09 and so yeah I [ __ ] love Let the Right
1:56:11 One In
1:56:13 um real quick round table because they
1:56:15 like we we sort of talked about it and
1:56:17 we vaguely mentioned it when we were
1:56:19 talking about it what's everybody's
1:56:20 favorite Clan Toyota
1:56:22 it's a blueberry mulcavian for me but
1:56:25 Gangrel is a pretty close second in
1:56:27 malkavian
1:56:30 it's a toss-up for me between ravnos and
1:56:31 bruja
1:56:33 I don't really know between right I
1:56:36 wouldn't have said Venture before I
1:56:37 started playing this character but it's
1:56:38 definitely venture or not still hell
1:56:40 yeah
1:56:41 what about you Lex I am forever split
1:56:44 between three uh I can I think I can get
1:56:47 I think you're lying okay
1:56:49 it's truly it it's three that I I love
1:56:53 and which one is my favorite changes I I
1:56:56 have predictions I don't know who the
1:56:58 last one I think I know the three okay
1:57:00 all right what are your predictions I
1:57:02 listen bro
1:57:04 bruja
1:57:09 do you want me to give you guys we're
1:57:10 all gonna get we're all gonna guess
1:57:11 we're all gonna go for you guys
1:57:17 say somebody
1:57:20 uh I think it's La Sombra assamite and
1:57:23 torador
1:57:25 La Sombra asked my uh bruja that's my
1:57:28 guess I'm the same with Erica all right
1:57:29 big time
1:57:31 I feel very solid about La Sombra
1:57:34 uh
1:57:37 bruja torador
1:57:39 uh La Sombra bruja venture
1:57:44 probably not but I'm doing different
1:57:45 anyways Erica was right yeah that's my
1:57:48 three hell yeah uh it is La Sombra
1:57:52 asomit and bruja and those are kind of
1:57:56 the three claims that I tend to
1:57:59 I don't know resonate with you know like
1:58:01 those are you uh that said I super love
1:58:04 toriador yeah I love that Clan so so
1:58:08 much I'm very picky about it fourth
1:58:10 between us mandatory adore well like
1:58:13 because
1:58:15 it's funny so I think I think toriators
1:58:19 I don't Tori or I don't like
1:58:22 stand out to me more and I get mad about
1:58:24 it so I get that I have opinions on this
1:58:27 but like your version of the fish yeah
1:58:30 that I really like I'm like all right
1:58:32 that's that's a [ __ ] that's a great
1:58:34 concept right there I love playing so
1:58:37 part of why I love Toyota so much is to
1:58:40 me they give this like really unique
1:58:42 opportunity to work with like
1:58:45 art and beauty and Humanity in a way
1:58:48 that like
1:58:49 you can really explore what that those
1:58:52 concepts mean to a character and like
1:58:53 put a focus on like their perception of
1:58:57 those ideals and like what they mean on
1:58:59 a personal level and how they explore
1:59:00 that
1:59:01 and that makes me just not take an
1:59:03 interest in posers I'm sorry I don't
1:59:05 like the poser torador can be like the
1:59:07 coolest NPCs and I've seen them be cool
1:59:10 in PCS as well like I don't want to
1:59:11 knock anything off the options but I I
1:59:14 love like
1:59:15 actual artist Toreador and a torador who
1:59:19 like really like thoughtfully navigate
1:59:21 the world that's the thing that I love
1:59:22 about them is like
1:59:24 that like
1:59:26 the glue of the camarilla and that
1:59:28 concept of like how they help others see
1:59:31 themselves and how they see themselves
1:59:33 and others and ah I tend to see Toyota
1:59:35 as like the the quintessential vampire
1:59:38 right and so like the the main three
1:59:41 movies that come to mind for like
1:59:43 vampire has some version of a toroid
1:59:45 already right so
1:59:48 um
1:59:49 and it's funny because these are very
1:59:50 different movies uh so like uh The Lost
1:59:54 Boys has star who in my mind is like
1:59:58 such yeah a tour who is super super
2:00:01 interesting uh or like
2:00:04 um interview with the vampireless stat
2:00:06 is like me Tori alert to me uh who is
2:00:10 again wildly different from Star but
2:00:14 still to move just very much a Toreador
2:00:17 and then blade
2:00:20 which of course is going to be like part
2:00:22 of my life
2:00:23 but like Deacon the bad guy right Deacon
2:00:27 has this like right hand and your whole
2:00:29 thing is she is just snide and like says
2:00:34 cool things and is just this super
2:00:37 deadly combatant and is just this very
2:00:40 dangerous character and to me her she
2:00:42 always had like this like this white fur
2:00:44 going on and like tons of eyeliner and
2:00:47 when I think of a tour oriented tribute
2:00:50 that is what I see so much that I used
2:00:53 her description in the New York scene
2:00:56 when Johnny ran into a member of the
2:00:58 support is that who she was based on
2:01:00 that's who she was based that makes so
2:01:02 much sense yep that tracks so that is
2:01:05 how like my weird Love Hurts and also
2:01:08 Byzantium is to me a story about two
2:01:12 wildly different Toreador uh because the
2:01:15 mother and daughter are very uh
2:01:17 interesting and artistic in their own
2:01:18 ways yeah but are just super at odds
2:01:21 with each other because they're just
2:01:23 very different people
2:01:25 um yeah so I do also like torador
2:01:29 um
2:01:30 Lex what's your uh what's your proudest
2:01:33 moment as a Storyteller over the course
2:01:35 of the podcast
2:01:37 pick your favorite child
2:01:43 oh that's brutal what's your favorite
2:01:46 meal mode
2:01:48 what's your favorite moment why is it
2:01:50 with Neil
2:01:51 no I was a really good question that
2:01:54 somebody sent in was like what's what is
2:01:56 your uh what is your proudest moment
2:01:58 she was so good at me look it up so I
2:02:00 can't remember
2:02:01 [Music]
2:02:03 so most of my like really proud moments
2:02:08 are when I get the reaction from you
2:02:13 guys that I'm really looking for and
2:02:14 when you guys go way overboard like like
2:02:17 when it's more of what I wanted that I
2:02:19 was even like hoping that I might get
2:02:21 yes and uh so like it's very hard to
2:02:25 narrow it down but
2:02:27 for example
2:02:29 [Music]
2:02:29 um
2:02:30 I wanted you guys to
2:02:34 be intimidated by the Sabbat
2:02:37 once you fight the Sabbat but I also
2:02:40 wanted you guys like man those guys are
2:02:42 [ __ ] cool
2:02:43 and in the scene at the Dunkin Donuts
2:02:48 when I [ __ ] love Dunkin Donuts
2:02:50 Johnny's [ __ ] black hand sire presses
2:02:53 his palm to the window and all of that
2:02:56 and uh I remember the characters that
2:03:00 were there were like one PC is firmly
2:03:02 like
2:03:03 I think we should run but I'm down for
2:03:05 whatever
2:03:06 and then another character is like I
2:03:07 think we should fight put him down for
2:03:09 whatever and the other characters like
2:03:11 bisexual confusion
2:03:15 that felt great my salary is so cool
2:03:18 like that is like the the bruja that I
2:03:21 would love to make but I'm like that's
2:03:22 two of the top I can't do that I'm not
2:03:24 I'm not dude his horde form he still has
2:03:26 dope hands he's two he's two over the
2:03:28 top for that to be a possible character
2:03:30 I could play and then Alex is just like
2:03:32 yeah he's just casually like this I'm
2:03:34 like [ __ ] this he's getting away
2:03:36 with it too man he's like my favorite
2:03:38 NPC Channel I still couldn't I still
2:03:40 could not play Delgado relax 100 you
2:03:43 just casually played Elgato I [ __ ]
2:03:44 infuriating I loved speaking of like us
2:03:47 reacting to [ __ ] like
2:03:50 we were talking about like how much
2:03:52 [ __ ] timer back and I spent talking
2:03:53 about like what the [ __ ] are we gonna do
2:03:54 with this party at the [ __ ] Gala
2:03:56 we're gonna die let's just uh at the
2:03:59 moment when you turned it raw [ __ ] with
2:04:03 uh Carmen upstairs yeah I was like hey
2:04:07 this was a scary action scene and then
2:04:10 Lex was like no it isn't this is a
2:04:12 horror scene yes it was scary action and
2:04:15 you guys should be tense and Afraid now
2:04:17 it's [ __ ] horror scramble
2:04:19 [ __ ] and like just that quiet
2:04:21 voice of the dark like oh God I [ __ ]
2:04:23 love Carmen Lex does this amazing thing
2:04:26 forgetting she is [ __ ] smoking but uh
2:04:30 she you do this great thing where when
2:04:32 you're describing an NPC you give hooks
2:04:34 into the reactions that you want so like
2:04:37 when the when the SP
2:04:39 when the Sabbat were showing up at the
2:04:41 Duncan
2:04:42 um
2:04:43 and you just I I remember you describing
2:04:46 like little things like like the flip of
2:04:50 delgado's hair the Spurs and like
2:04:52 Carmen's lip liner and like yeah you
2:04:55 give these like little details that like
2:04:57 really sell so many things at once like
2:05:00 you usually get to like the danger of it
2:05:02 you usually get to the sexiness of it
2:05:03 like you you hit that really well man I
2:05:06 don't yeah that's really [ __ ] good
2:05:07 with me you say that like that's a
2:05:09 moment that you're proud of but uh you
2:05:11 should be like
2:05:13 before we all go up all on the rails are
2:05:15 there any other Storyteller moments that
2:05:17 oh really I'm really proud of that you
2:05:18 want to highlight uh
2:05:20 oh man
2:05:22 uh so one of them actually didn't happen
2:05:26 on screen it was very early on uh didn't
2:05:29 actually happen in a recording uh but as
2:05:32 a Storyteller I was like ah this is
2:05:35 beautiful
2:05:37 so I had first I was like introducing
2:05:39 vampire to you guys and be like hey guys
2:05:41 some political Intrigue and like what
2:05:43 y'all up to what are the mysteries of
2:05:46 this you know this weird zantosa guy
2:05:50 and I remember it was during covid right
2:05:54 and so like hanging out was very
2:05:55 difficult and we had worked out this
2:05:57 whole little system where you get like
2:05:58 little cubes in a parking lot remember
2:06:00 that we'd yeah we'd hang out and like so
2:06:03 I remember showing up 10 feet away from
2:06:06 each of us yeah just everyone like way
2:06:09 off of apart from each other in their
2:06:11 own like Little Worlds uh but I remember
2:06:13 showing up to Tim and Garrett yelling at
2:06:17 each other oh yeah and they were like
2:06:19 and it wasn't like like well I think no
2:06:22 they were like going at it and I'm like
2:06:24 what the [ __ ] is happening and I go to
2:06:27 like check on my friends and you know I
2:06:28 stand like my 10 feet apart and I'm like
2:06:29 I'm listening and I'm like oh my God
2:06:31 they're arguing about what they should
2:06:34 do in the tabletop game arguing about
2:06:37 [ __ ] politics
2:06:39 and Garrett and Tim who like I never
2:06:44 seemed super enthused with the idea of
2:06:48 like a like a camera look like cautery
2:06:50 uh the two of them were just all in the
2:06:53 end the thing was like I was like a half
2:06:56 hour late and I knew that like no these
2:06:58 guys had been this was the half hour
2:06:59 maybe they're a half hour deep that has
2:07:03 not been the only time
2:07:05 that we have like really like been like
2:07:08 I I think I can remember distinctly at
2:07:12 least three different times we've been
2:07:13 in a parking lot
2:07:15 arguing to the freaking Hilt about what
2:07:19 we should do politically in the game we
2:07:21 are Dynamic diametrically opposed how do
2:07:25 we handle politics what made me proud
2:07:27 because one it means that you guys have
2:07:29 spent a lot of time thinking about what
2:07:31 was going on and what you guys needed to
2:07:32 do and I also really liked that the
2:07:35 argument was never like well I'm gonna
2:07:38 take care of this no it was always like
2:07:41 hey guys we as a quarter a are going to
2:07:43 need each other in order for any of this
2:07:45 to work what are we going to do and well
2:07:49 conceptually right the books say that
2:07:53 Kindred is supposed to be kind of like
2:07:54 these selfish creatures
2:07:58 I do tend to feel that PCS are supposed
2:08:00 to be an exception to an extent where
2:08:03 instead of a vampire being like no it's
2:08:07 all about me me me me
2:08:09 the quotery is supposed to be like hey
2:08:12 it's us against the world everyone we
2:08:14 interact with has an agenda everyone we
2:08:17 interact with wants to use us for
2:08:19 something we are the only people that we
2:08:21 can count on each other for to have a
2:08:23 human experience yeah and I loved the
2:08:27 ideas as even as you guys like started
2:08:30 to descend and lose humanity and start
2:08:32 making darker and darker choices
2:08:35 um you guys are always like
2:08:37 you know no matter what happens it's
2:08:40 still us against the world and
2:08:43 that theme kind of carrying through is
2:08:46 is something very very proud of and I
2:08:48 and I love any scene that reflects with
2:08:52 that
2:08:53 um
2:08:55 I think
2:08:56 if I had if I had to pick and it's very
2:08:58 difficult if I had to pick a number one
2:09:00 it would be uh
2:09:04 the reaction of the cautery to Marcos
2:09:08 dying yeah
2:09:10 I feel like in a very interesting way
2:09:13 each of the characters kind of really
2:09:14 shined and
2:09:18 I had no NPCs in that scene no no
2:09:21 everything that had happened in that
2:09:23 scene on my end already happened before
2:09:25 the scene started so it was literally me
2:09:29 just creating an environment and being
2:09:32 like hey guys react
2:09:34 and that felt really cool
2:09:36 to kind of try to storytell a scene in
2:09:39 that way and I feel like it it really
2:09:42 worked out I mean to your point I mean
2:09:44 to be as as objective and like you know
2:09:48 clinical about this as possible Marcos
2:09:49 was just a what one point retainer on
2:09:52 your sheet or something like that like
2:09:53 just with one point retainer
2:09:58 that's my point though right like
2:10:00 literally like it's if if you look at
2:10:03 like a a character sheet for any
2:10:05 tabletop what's the most important thing
2:10:06 on there you're not going to say oh this
2:10:08 you know however many point little
2:10:10 background that you've got
2:10:12 um
2:10:13 but holy [ __ ] that I mean I think I
2:10:15 think we're all we're all still
2:10:16 traumatized from the fact that Premier
2:10:19 had the audacity to freaking kill Marcos
2:10:22 like that's insane yeah if we weren't
2:10:23 gonna kill Rhys before we're absolutely
2:10:26 going to end him and that's right every
2:10:28 plane of existence I'm still not
2:10:30 entirely sure if it was him
2:10:32 it doesn't matter I think that's a
2:10:33 really great uh takeaway too like I
2:10:36 forget who was pointing that on the
2:10:37 scene but I remember we we highlighted
2:10:39 that of like you know I think I remember
2:10:41 I I was saying like you're the most
2:10:43 powerful venturu in the city
2:10:45 and it's very clear that that this could
2:10:47 be a very good political move to pin
2:10:52 this on Rhys I'm also not very easy
2:10:55 entirely
2:10:57 unconvinced that it wasn't zulfield
2:11:00 was doing some [ __ ] yeah who I mean
2:11:04 there's a bunch of questions there still
2:11:05 right like hey who is he drinking
2:11:07 whiskey with like there's some [ __ ]
2:11:09 wait he was drinking whiskey I think he
2:11:11 poured it and left it for yeah yeah that
2:11:14 was interesting
2:11:16 my interpretation I thought there was
2:11:18 another person in the room we do this
2:11:20 all the time we do this all the time
2:11:22 with that [ __ ] smug ass smile on his
2:11:25 face that he's got right now you had but
2:11:27 you had no NPCs in that scene and you
2:11:29 had laid such good groundwork there like
2:11:31 yeah we reacted so viscerally and hurt
2:11:34 by the loss of something that most games
2:11:37 would see as an inconsequential part of
2:11:39 the character sheet right it was it was
2:11:41 very [ __ ] cool
2:11:43 um
2:11:44 so sort of talking about that right one
2:11:46 of the other questions we got was like
2:11:48 hey what are you know if we're talking
2:11:50 about favorite story moments character
2:11:51 moments and stuff but moving it into
2:11:53 like moving in the room what are some
2:11:55 favorite uh and it's not just relax this
2:11:57 is for everybody to jump in uh what are
2:11:59 some favorite player moments
2:12:02 uh for each other well it's the Venture
2:12:05 I was like talk about my moments
2:12:09 sure okay no well so legitimately like
2:12:13 I'm piggybacking off of that your
2:12:14 reaction to marcos's death and like mile
2:12:17 it's the that's the first time we
2:12:19 actually see miles unbuttoned a little
2:12:21 bit like even when he's fighting the
2:12:23 where like even when you guys were
2:12:24 fighting the werewolf even when like
2:12:26 you're dealing with the shaw [ __ ] eat
2:12:28 like miles was always buttoned up to a
2:12:31 certain degree and like was in control
2:12:32 of himself so just seeing miles and like
2:12:35 your your reactions to all of that and
2:12:38 like miles just coming out like a
2:12:40 [ __ ] bathrobe and just being like I
2:12:42 don't know and like walking off and like
2:12:44 being that not okay in front of
2:12:48 everybody was like a very cool choice to
2:12:50 show that level like vulnerability I
2:12:52 thought it was a [ __ ] very cool
2:12:53 moment to him
2:12:55 um I actually really enjoyed the the
2:12:58 sacrifice of the bowl scene
2:13:00 um yeah yeah out of uh I I don't know
2:13:04 why it particularly hit me maybe it's
2:13:06 just a joke juxtaposition to a lot of
2:13:07 the rest of the game they were going but
2:13:09 it was definitely more of the weird
2:13:12 magical Supernatural that we hadn't
2:13:14 touched upon and it was a really rather
2:13:16 just kind of a cool scene in general
2:13:18 that I don't know maybe also hit on the
2:13:19 werewolf the apocalypse where it said me
2:13:21 and Lex shared
2:13:24 but uh and just the way that you you
2:13:27 leaned into the weird blood ritual thing
2:13:31 that I would have been like yeah well we
2:13:33 just performed some magic and we got
2:13:35 this [ __ ] done
2:13:36 but yeah thanks I'd like no legitimately
2:13:40 like I one of the things I was going for
2:13:42 for a lot of like the Durante blood
2:13:43 sorcery is like yo it's blood sorcery
2:13:45 like let's we're gonna do some horrible
2:13:46 [ __ ] like this shit's awful yeah like
2:13:49 thank you I I know my moment's actually
2:13:52 pretty immediately for once I have this
2:13:54 question uh when my favorite moment with
2:13:58 win is uh the introduction seen in the
2:14:01 bathroom uh between her and Bretta where
2:14:03 wind just pulls Brita aside and says uh
2:14:06 what we are and and how being a monster
2:14:10 is like a choice is really defining to
2:14:13 who when is and how much of a like Mama
2:14:16 Bear she is and uh like how she
2:14:19 navigates this world
2:14:21 uh for for Miles my favorite moment is
2:14:25 uh Arabella seduction
2:14:28 my favorite moment is Arabella seduction
2:14:31 because which one
2:14:34 just the whole thing uh christening uh
2:14:37 Roland's office
2:14:39 the culmination
2:14:43 I love that
2:14:45 no no no it's more subtle more subtle
2:14:48 less you more me you suck dicks
2:14:52 classic I love that scene um because I
2:14:55 mean first of all it's dramatic as hell
2:14:57 um but for you as a role player I think
2:14:59 that like I I feel like you have shown
2:15:03 so much growth in like how comfortable
2:15:06 you are to portray like
2:15:08 I don't know miles is sexy as as Fester
2:15:11 says and I think that like at first you
2:15:13 maybe were a little hesitant on that and
2:15:16 I feel like that like to me showed like
2:15:19 you really growing into that and like
2:15:21 being comfortable with it thanks
2:15:24 yeah it is gotta listen to Fester I mean
2:15:27 he sounds like he knows what he's
2:15:28 talking about Professor is my next note
2:15:30 uh for for Neil I mean there's
2:15:33 hi Eric and I giggling so much during
2:15:36 the Fester scenes I think proves the
2:15:38 point on this one just
2:15:40 um like those scenes were incredible for
2:15:43 a variety of reasons but uh you had a
2:15:46 rough time with a Nails loss of humanity
2:15:49 and I think because you started off with
2:15:52 a needle conceptually at eight
2:15:53 Humanities yeah
2:15:55 where's he at now uh it was I just
2:15:59 bought it back up
2:16:01 four you got the four yeah and win both
2:16:05 dropped to four yeah but every time
2:16:07 every time you lost Humanity you double
2:16:08 botched and to me those scenes represent
2:16:10 like you taking that as a role-playing
2:16:13 problem and you like dealing with it in
2:16:15 a way that felt very true to character
2:16:18 I have two choices for Johnny and one is
2:16:20 very selfish and the other one just as
2:16:22 true the one that's just true is you
2:16:24 Kool-Aid Manning uh yeah I I can't not
2:16:29 mention it but my selfish favorite is um
2:16:32 after Bretta got a bit more information
2:16:35 about who she was I got into the truck
2:16:37 and Johnny gave her a leather jacket and
2:16:41 to me that uh just so quickly
2:16:43 encapsulated like Johnny as a father
2:16:46 Johnny is someone who like
2:16:49 takes the time out to think about the
2:16:52 people in his family and his codery and
2:16:54 like Express to them that they're a part
2:16:56 of him uh
2:16:58 so like especially at that kind of
2:17:01 vulnerable moment so
2:17:03 those are my picks
2:17:06 I have such a hard time picking one for
2:17:09 because what I just keep coming back to
2:17:12 is how [ __ ] good everybody's
2:17:14 introduction to the series was yeah
2:17:18 like just yeah we roll up on on Brita
2:17:21 who is Babe in the woods and
2:17:25 you know just doesn't realize how
2:17:28 powerful she actually is yet
2:17:31 um and knowing that we start there and
2:17:33 every big step she took along there and
2:17:37 all the steps back that it took
2:17:40 um was such a cool journey to watch
2:17:44 um Neil you popped on screen and we all
2:17:47 collectively were just like [ __ ] what
2:17:49 are you doing this is fun
2:17:52 but he was never he didn't stop at just
2:17:55 being the creepy jump scare guy you know
2:17:57 he evolved in that bowl scene where Wynn
2:18:01 realized she couldn't protect him was
2:18:03 such a [ __ ] huge moment for for both
2:18:06 of them yeah
2:18:09 um and then Johnny like stumbled upon
2:18:11 this girl and just so much was said with
2:18:13 his reaction to it
2:18:16 just how much he immediately cared so
2:18:19 much that it hurt him
2:18:22 um
2:18:24 and then miles is just like I I guess
2:18:26 that this is my circus and these are my
2:18:28 monkeys
2:18:30 um like yeah like God damn it how did I
2:18:33 agree okay I guess this is you do that
2:18:37 you do that oh oh God damn it I actually
2:18:39 care about all of you gross like you'd
2:18:42 manage her at like a store who actually
2:18:44 cares about his people under him and
2:18:46 it's like trying to shelter them from
2:18:47 the higher levels of management
2:18:49 uh so I mentioned like it was Miles
2:18:52 favorite like my favorite Tim miles is
2:18:55 you know all the Marcos stuff my
2:18:57 favorite moment with
2:18:59 um so my favorite moment with win right
2:19:01 is just like a whole Erica you're the
2:19:03 roller coaster of the one thing going
2:19:05 from like I'm in a flirt with a pigeon
2:19:07 to like uh
2:19:20 into into like combat murderer yeah then
2:19:25 immediately into just like
2:19:28 connections with Ramirez in the woods
2:19:30 and then full on like hey guys I've been
2:19:32 waiting for this sobbing like your
2:19:36 ability to to like take that whole
2:19:38 [ __ ] range the entire time so goddamn
2:19:41 good like it was [ __ ] great
2:19:45 um that was a [ __ ] like it was like
2:19:47 [ __ ] it was a roller coaster it was
2:19:48 like a privilege to get to be a part of
2:19:50 it like I remember we were talking about
2:19:51 it afterwards like God it was so good
2:19:53 yeah you guys uh you listeners didn't
2:19:55 see the 15 minutes of ugly crying where
2:19:57 Garrett and Rob were both just holding
2:20:00 Erica while she lost her [ __ ]
2:20:02 um
2:20:03 Garrett [ __ ] so my favorite Johnny
2:20:04 moments right like there's a there's a
2:20:06 few that come to mind I don't like the
2:20:07 protective dad stuff but like the one
2:20:09 that comes to mind more than anything uh
2:20:12 I think was embracing veto it was such
2:20:15 an unexpected like I gotta do like it
2:20:18 was like you were doing it to protect
2:20:20 everyone else because I'm like it's the
2:20:23 mission and like do the whole fight it
2:20:24 was just such a
2:20:25 character was so against the idea of
2:20:27 having to embrace yes and then such a
2:20:30 good such an honest like interesting but
2:20:32 then realized he had that ability to do
2:20:35 so and could save the scene or save save
2:20:38 the the day but also do something real
2:20:41 well I remember being impressed by it
2:20:42 like as a [ __ ] player just because
2:20:44 that is not a thing I would have
2:20:45 considered like that did not even cross
2:20:48 my mind and so when you were like [ __ ] I
2:20:50 embraced him and break I was like oh
2:20:52 [ __ ] yeah uh [ __ ] yeah that was a very
2:20:54 cool [ __ ] moment uh and then Rebecca
2:20:57 like the so
2:20:59 we were joking about like how much you
2:21:01 love the pendragons that like but
2:21:04 specifically the moment for me uh is
2:21:08 British I really liked the The Brita
2:21:10 breakdown in the van but the one that
2:21:12 came the little bit the one before that
2:21:14 right when you are alone finally in the
2:21:18 room and you're just like
2:21:20 collapsing in on you like the
2:21:24 Brita has had so much it's so Brit is
2:21:27 like a difficult you're in a difficult
2:21:29 position right because like she's the
2:21:31 amnesiac and shit's been like running
2:21:33 since the day you were embraced and
2:21:34 you're brand new like all that kind of
2:21:36 [ __ ] and so
2:21:38 the the portrayal of the weight of all
2:21:41 that [ __ ] hitting it once when she
2:21:43 finally has like a quiet minute to
2:21:45 herself was just [ __ ] very well done
2:21:49 like very very well done very
2:21:54 um
2:21:56 so I think oh man there's there's just a
2:21:59 lot
2:22:00 um
2:22:03 probably my favorite moment with
2:22:06 um
2:22:06 miles
2:22:08 was when we lured the Sabbat or not us
2:22:11 about when we lured the set Heights to
2:22:13 that garage and one of them was still
2:22:16 alive
2:22:17 and he gets to draw skatana and you know
2:22:21 put your arm out he goes that stays with
2:22:24 me that's mine you go back and tell your
2:22:27 Masters it was such like a just like oh
2:22:30 man that's a plan of Kings but you laid
2:22:32 a hand what's what's some stones and
2:22:35 like some freaking just there's high
2:22:37 level arrogance of just like I'm gonna
2:22:39 use my Katana to take your arm that's
2:22:42 mine like real
2:22:45 oh man it's a good good moment I thought
2:22:48 that was me vibes
2:22:51 Griffith oh yeah oh Missouri you know
2:22:54 what I mean they're good guy who's
2:22:57 dipping his toe into villains where
2:23:00 you're like oh like wait a second
2:23:02 there's he could go dark yeah
2:23:06 um [ __ ] yeah
2:23:07 the um
2:23:10 gosh there's some uh there's so many
2:23:13 good moments
2:23:14 um I had like uh Brita I I kind of loved
2:23:18 the the fact that there was that time
2:23:20 when you found out about the the
2:23:21 Crescent on your hand and she came to
2:23:24 Johnny like she had to tell him
2:23:26 that she [ __ ] up and like we had that
2:23:29 good scene on the balcony which was just
2:23:30 like and that was kind of like nice too
2:23:33 because it it you know in a weird way it
2:23:36 it felt good that
2:23:38 the the your character was
2:23:42 reinforcing my own character in the in
2:23:45 the group and that and that you were
2:23:46 kind of like like
2:23:48 you were like kind of like yes ending
2:23:50 what I put down about the character of
2:23:51 being this kind of like weird grumpy dad
2:23:55 of the of the cotery
2:23:57 um and that you know
2:24:00 uh
2:24:03 yeah I don't know that that just it it
2:24:05 just felt so cool just like seeing yeah
2:24:07 I don't know no I'm really glad to hear
2:24:09 that yeah
2:24:10 um play it in that way
2:24:13 you know um we I I I think I think I
2:24:16 like a lot of those moments because even
2:24:18 with Neil
2:24:19 um you know
2:24:21 some of the the weird Neil Johnny
2:24:25 moments that we've gotten yeah
2:24:27 um
2:24:28 you know after in in Boston when we got
2:24:30 jumped and uh in the in the Haven and
2:24:33 Johnny managed to kind of like save
2:24:36 everybody but very cool moment he had to
2:24:38 kill a bunch of people for it like I
2:24:40 think Neil kind of like went out of his
2:24:42 way to check in with him and be like
2:24:44 you're okay and Johnny and Neil don't
2:24:46 really get together get along very well
2:24:48 because we're very different yeah and I
2:24:51 I I I I mean I love role playing with
2:24:54 Rob
2:24:54 but it's and it sucks that I don't get
2:24:57 to be as buddy buddy with his characters
2:24:58 I'd like to be but I think it's
2:25:00 important that Johnny
2:25:02 you know he puts Neil over by
2:25:07 keeping him at arm's distance because
2:25:09 the fact that blood sorcery should not
2:25:11 be something that you like right it
2:25:13 should be something that your people are
2:25:15 scared of in the world so I think it's
2:25:17 important that he has somebody nearby
2:25:19 that is kind of helps helps the sell the
2:25:22 audience on the fact that what he's
2:25:24 doing is not okay yeah
2:25:26 so seeing them kind of like you know or
2:25:27 having Neil kind of like
2:25:29 these like you know like dangerous like
2:25:32 hey man are you okay like once again I I
2:25:35 love those kind of like moments where
2:25:37 where the characters check in and really
2:25:40 like you know
2:25:41 go out of their way to like show their
2:25:43 emotions which was do they feel they
2:25:46 feel good
2:25:47 um and then Wayne is just non-stop
2:25:50 freaking oh uh I mean she's she really
2:25:55 is the badass of the group
2:25:56 um you know like uh Johnny just does
2:25:59 wrestling moves he doesn't absolutely
2:26:01 like he doesn't actually hurt anybody or
2:26:03 kill anybody but he's like duplexes
2:26:04 [ __ ] Stone dog yeah
2:26:07 I love that but like you know he
2:26:10 suplexes he smashes through walls he
2:26:12 grabs people but wins the one who's the
2:26:14 actual [ __ ] dangerous person and in a
2:26:17 weird way she's like also like the the
2:26:19 the comic relief and she's the badass
2:26:22 and like it's just I I get to sit next
2:26:25 to her at the table and it's too often
2:26:27 like I I love the fact that you have
2:26:30 absconded with my ravnos like kabira's
2:26:34 points on my sheep
2:26:36 I have put nothing into this
2:26:42 and I've spent so much blood on that
2:26:44 background oh yeah and it's so good and
2:26:46 every time that she interacts with Kabir
2:26:48 I [ __ ] love it because I I Lex is on
2:26:49 one side of me and uh Eric is on the
2:26:52 other side and I get to just sit in the
2:26:53 middle like giggling every time the two
2:26:55 of them are like oh what's going on
2:26:57 what's up
2:26:59 um I take a break from doing the now
2:27:00 kiss motion and Garrett gets it for a
2:27:02 minute
2:27:05 um
2:27:05 yeah I too many moments guys well it
2:27:09 sounds like since everyone did everyone
2:27:11 else
2:27:13 Rebecca did it I I am going to do this
2:27:16 in my way by referencing everybody
2:27:18 else's moments with me
2:27:21 I would expect nothing less that's right
2:27:24 thank you that's right good job Miles
2:27:25 yes
2:27:27 I think the one that reminds with Brita
2:27:30 because actually season two with Miles
2:27:32 and bird has been pretty bumpy
2:27:35 um especially since the blood bonding
2:27:37 part it's just been
2:27:39 I've kind of had to put you over there
2:27:41 there's been a bunch of the Season like
2:27:43 keeping [ __ ] from her here I am oh yeah
2:27:46 a lot of Secrets this year
2:27:49 um but it goes back to the first season
2:27:51 in the Royale where I'm like what's up
2:27:54 with keeping this [ __ ] from me
2:27:57 that was a really good moment it was
2:27:59 like of all the times and places this
2:28:02 this is where we're choosing the
2:28:03 Rebellion
2:28:06 um I remembering it being one of our
2:28:08 first like
2:28:09 first scenes together by ourselves since
2:28:13 the interrogation where I sassed you
2:28:17 um
2:28:19 so uh good times I feel like uh you
2:28:23 maybe got me back for keeping secrets
2:28:30 I'm Prince now I decide how many Secrets
2:28:33 people have that's right thank you very
2:28:35 much uh when I think our best is the
2:28:38 fact that we
2:28:39 we have just the driest dialogue with
2:28:42 each other just dry sarcasm just back
2:28:44 and forth just like you're like I'm
2:28:46 poking you I'm like why why why are you
2:28:48 doing this you're like I just can't help
2:28:50 you have a [ __ ] tendency to like
2:28:52 smack everyone else who pokes you and
2:28:53 then wind pokes you and you're like oh
2:28:55 God damn it all right are you still here
2:28:57 why why are you doing the thing I don't
2:28:59 know man and part of it is a lot of
2:29:01 times is you're just like I'm being
2:29:03 aggressive and I'm like why and you're
2:29:04 like I don't because I need to be and
2:29:06 I'm like fast like I have no idea but
2:29:08 it's here because I have a reptile brain
2:29:11 and I'm not gonna [ __ ] you so I have to
2:29:13 fight you and I'm not gonna eat you
2:29:16 right
2:29:20 yeah that's friendship
2:29:23 thank you
2:29:24 I appreciate
2:29:26 appreciate it I will leave food out for
2:29:28 you
2:29:32 and now we can speak fisher cat and tell
2:29:34 each other to [ __ ] off it's gonna be
2:29:36 great I like by the way that in that
2:29:38 [ __ ] seed I don't know if it made it
2:29:41 to air but you guys are like hey can we
2:29:42 enter can we understand each other
2:29:44 through animal speak without doing stuff
2:29:45 and life was like No And then that did
2:29:48 not register right you guys are like no
2:29:49 we're doing it though yeah there's like
2:29:51 animal sounds at each other which by the
2:29:55 way to be 100 clear that ruling stands
2:29:58 you two are just [ __ ] weird
2:30:09 so yes that is not a house rule it's
2:30:12 just us being [ __ ] weird and
2:30:14 supporting that Johnny 100 thinks the
2:30:16 two of you can talk to each other
2:30:18 honestly I have no reason to think
2:30:19 otherwise right and then I it really
2:30:22 goes back the person that I have done
2:30:24 the most with one-on-one is with my
2:30:26 right hand man Johnny
2:30:28 we've definitely had a bunch of scenes
2:30:31 and like and I think it all comes back
2:30:33 to
2:30:34 um the season one finale I don't know if
2:30:37 it was clear in the um and when we did
2:30:40 it but that we won't talk about those
2:30:42 mechanics in a minute yeah I was gonna
2:30:43 talk about it basically now that we all
2:30:45 had to write down without talking to
2:30:46 each other what we were going to do with
2:30:49 very [ __ ] cool thing Lex did and uh
2:30:52 me and Johnny both decided to go after
2:30:54 the werewolf yeah yeah there was there
2:30:57 was a very easy possibility that one of
2:31:00 you went and we also I think I think we
2:31:02 also so we saw the werewolf kill three
2:31:06 vampires casually yes just yeah dead
2:31:09 dead dead and you know I don't know how
2:31:12 much uh fortitude you had at time I had
2:31:14 zero fortitude on my sheet I'm not a
2:31:16 glass Cannon bruja and he's like all
2:31:19 right so and and the way that Lex does
2:31:21 sometimes he very was like
2:31:24 here's how this is gonna work
2:31:26 uh it was very business when one of us
2:31:29 is a major seriously when when death is
2:31:33 on the table like things get very
2:31:34 transactional and uh not a bad way in a
2:31:38 like a very honest way yeah in a way
2:31:40 where you realize this is where you're
2:31:42 at oh [ __ ] I'm reading a choose her
2:31:44 adventure and now this one page is gonna
2:31:46 take me to death and the other one's
2:31:48 gonna take me to Good Times maybe
2:31:50 um but yeah
2:31:52 he passed out a little sheets to
2:31:55 everybody that had choices on them so
2:31:58 each one of us had a bespoke set of
2:31:59 choices based on where we were and he
2:32:02 said you need to make your choices and
2:32:03 pass them back to me you don't get to
2:32:04 talk to each other
2:32:06 um well this is this is just what you're
2:32:08 doing and so we all did and yeah [ __ ]
2:32:10 Tim and I were like well
2:32:13 I'm ready to lose my sheet are you gonna
2:32:16 [ __ ] fight this werewolf I can be
2:32:18 prepared I feel like this knife to
2:32:19 someone else ever since that Throwdown
2:32:21 uh where you use lucida's Knives By the
2:32:23 way all right but ever since that fight
2:32:27 I feel like you two have
2:32:29 fought each other
2:32:31 Non-Stop about all kinds of [ __ ] but you
2:32:34 guys always end up coming back to that
2:32:36 moment or like hey
2:32:39 remember the Lupine well it's a it's a
2:32:42 nice thing I think about I've been
2:32:43 through everything but the worst the
2:32:45 world has to offer Johnny and Miles
2:32:47 relationship I think is is great because
2:32:49 I mean Clan bruja Clan ventru are such
2:32:53 wonderful enemies and allies all at the
2:32:58 same time perfect um right and like in a
2:33:01 lot of
2:33:02 uh vampire the Masquerade lore from what
2:33:06 and like just or like TV shows that
2:33:08 remember the old TV show like they were
2:33:10 like you know they're they are like
2:33:14 consistent Rivals and even goes back in
2:33:17 the clan lore right
2:33:19 um to in Sparta and Athens I thought it
2:33:22 was Carthage Carthage was later Sparta
2:33:25 in Athens was the the first and uh Tim
2:33:28 and I I think we just I I do really
2:33:31 enjoy the fact that I think we we are
2:33:32 constantly putting each other over the
2:33:34 top right like I I at least I I try to
2:33:37 play that I'm always respecting him as
2:33:40 like the the Top Dog in New Haven in
2:33:43 terms of the political scene and I try
2:33:45 to make sure that like we give him wide
2:33:47 bursts so that he looks cool doing
2:33:49 political stuff
2:33:51 um and on the flip side like you know
2:33:52 I'm Johnny's a big Bruiser guy and that
2:33:55 only comes across on audio if everybody
2:33:57 at the table pretends that I am a big
2:33:59 boost again Garrett in real life I'm
2:34:01 five nine you know like you know I'm not
2:34:03 a I'm not a big dude
2:34:05 um but um but you know they they let
2:34:09 they react to Johnny as if he is this
2:34:12 Larger than Life presence you know the
2:34:14 idea of Johnny frenzying is so goddamn
2:34:16 scary
2:34:18 yeah well we we when we uh before we
2:34:20 actually started storytelling we just
2:34:22 ran a test with the audience where
2:34:25 Johnny was the surprise Johnny killed
2:34:28 Neil in a very nice parallel to our
2:34:31 tabletop relationship
2:34:33 um
2:34:35 so I think it's Lexus do we have to go
2:34:37 is Lex's best moments now is that how
2:34:39 this is no he was just talking about the
2:34:41 stuff you can if you wanna
2:34:43 um pick your favorite shot
2:34:48 it's actually so it's actually pretty
2:34:51 easy to identify like I what I think my
2:34:55 favorite moments for you guys were
2:34:57 um so I feel Johnny was the Braha right
2:35:01 yeah throwing the dude
2:35:04 I felt like I felt like that was when
2:35:07 chef's kiss that was that first time in
2:35:10 our story where John is like you know
2:35:12 what
2:35:13 I think I'm just gonna [ __ ] this guy up
2:35:16 [ __ ] me and like I feel like I feel like
2:35:19 that was a very good like reveal that
2:35:23 like no no Johnny is uh in fact a badass
2:35:26 he's not just like blowing smoke
2:35:29 uh for when it was uh
2:35:33 the actually it was the scene with the
2:35:36 Gangrel primogen
2:35:40 proceed with Rusty was the [ __ ] stuff
2:35:43 of Legend
2:35:45 because that whole recording was kind of
2:35:47 like hey guys so on a given night if
2:35:49 one's just walking around one night what
2:35:51 happens it's like turns out people died
2:35:54 or ghosts like just [ __ ] chaos ensues
2:35:59 and Wayne just came in like saying the
2:36:03 most ratchet [ __ ] she could come up with
2:36:05 in that moment and it was just like do
2:36:07 you want to [ __ ] go and Rusty was
2:36:09 just like I've
2:36:11 no idea what's going on anymore but I
2:36:13 can't back down and then he just died he
2:36:16 died a horrible battle he died
2:36:20 he died freed because
2:36:22 it's a badass but I'm always afraid the
2:36:24 dice are gonna be like not today I feel
2:36:27 like possibility but it hasn't [ __ ]
2:36:29 happened yet I feel like winning is next
2:36:31 to me in the foreign
2:36:34 both have the problem consistently where
2:36:38 they're like I'm just gonna hit him a
2:36:39 little whatever
2:36:42 it's someone [ __ ] dies and then
2:36:44 they're just like oops man why does that
2:36:47 keep happening every single time that I
2:36:50 end up attacking someone
2:36:51 and it's they never catch on
2:36:54 like like when to this day we'll be like
2:36:59 all right I guess it's gonna be a long
2:37:00 tussle and like whoop dead and like
2:37:03 she's like oh no again
2:37:06 like it's just a very funny thing oh man
2:37:10 uh miles was
2:37:13 probably the scene with Z
2:37:16 when he had just about made it to like
2:37:20 the summit of the mountain he'd been
2:37:22 climbing since like the first episode
2:37:24 and this thing came back to haunt him Ed
2:37:28 Tim
2:37:29 the whole table goes quiet and Tim's
2:37:32 mind is just like visibly racing and it
2:37:35 was cool because it's not that Miles got
2:37:38 like miles didn't Panic miles was kind
2:37:43 of reacting like okay
2:37:44 this is it this is the debate this is
2:37:47 the this is where we go back and forth
2:37:49 the manipulations I'm gonna go I'm gonna
2:37:50 do this me manipulative Adventure is
2:37:53 gonna go toe-to-toe with manipulative
2:37:55 ancient demon from like the beginning of
2:37:57 time yeah and it was just [ __ ] cool
2:38:00 very cool Hot Seat like stuff
2:38:04 um and
2:38:06 uh
2:38:07 I think my favorite scene for
2:38:12 hi JoJo hi JoJo
2:38:16 I think uh
2:38:18 it's very tough for brother because she
2:38:21 has like some wildly different scenes
2:38:23 that have gone down for her
2:38:26 um but I think the scene that made me
2:38:28 confident
2:38:29 and and brother as a concept and made me
2:38:31 feel good about like
2:38:33 what was coming together for her was
2:38:36 pretty early it was her confrontation
2:38:39 with Shaw during the first season when
2:38:44 he kind of like went at her and so I was
2:38:48 a pretty [ __ ] dangerous dude it's
2:38:50 funny because if you look back at it now
2:38:51 uh he doesn't really
2:38:54 he's not he's not on your level at this
2:38:57 point the scale but scale has grown yeah
2:39:00 but at the time he was the big fish and
2:39:03 uh you know how to deal with him and he
2:39:05 had put a cornered and he had presented
2:39:08 to her this terrible fate and it was
2:39:12 kind of like this really cool moment
2:39:14 where
2:39:17 Brita was like
2:39:19 don't get me wrong I recognize that I am
2:39:22 an underdog in this but I intend to
2:39:25 fight and that was just very [ __ ]
2:39:28 cool
2:39:30 um sorry I very much enjoyed that and I
2:39:32 felt like that set the tone for bread in
2:39:34 a big way yeah
2:39:36 uh and uh probably my favorite moment
2:39:39 Neil is definitely him hanging out with
2:39:41 his nice buddy like well because like
2:39:44 all right hear me out right
2:39:49 it's like so Fester is this honestly
2:39:52 this guy that's kind of struggling with
2:39:53 in life he's his his fate is to be this
2:39:57 guy that's largely ignored and unseen
2:39:59 and can never really like be on the
2:40:03 level of the people that he considers so
2:40:05 beautiful like part of why he admires
2:40:07 miles so much is that miles is the guy
2:40:09 the peacock that like [ __ ] struts
2:40:11 around court and like you know what I
2:40:14 mean like like that's that smiles
2:40:15 Professor can never be that so much of
2:40:18 like his Destiny is decided for him so
2:40:21 when he was hanging out with Neil it was
2:40:23 kind of like wait a second
2:40:25 if I bring this cool cautery guy maybe I
2:40:30 can stand out
2:40:31 and Neil is kind of like hey man I
2:40:35 really need you and we got to be subtle
2:40:36 here
2:40:37 and I I absolutely enjoyed that Neil's
2:40:42 kind of like
2:40:44 innate ability to
2:40:47 make the NPC feel heard
2:40:51 but not get waylaid by the NPC's own
2:40:54 personal desires it is a very good
2:40:57 balance going into that scene and it
2:40:59 kind of set kneel up to like later on
2:41:02 kind of be this character's hero right
2:41:04 because when the character showed up to
2:41:05 the party
2:41:06 he was like
2:41:08 there to be a servant doing like a super
2:41:12 unfortunate work
2:41:13 but with Neil he had a chance to stand
2:41:16 out he ended up Surviving this like
2:41:18 crazy attack and all of a sudden like
2:41:20 he's the he's this guy he if you think
2:41:22 about it right I don't know if anyone
2:41:23 picked up on this but the Nosferatu left
2:41:25 Fester behind yeah yes they did not give
2:41:28 a [ __ ] about him but Neil kind of like
2:41:31 scooped him up and I kind of like it was
2:41:34 a very good demonstration of Neil's
2:41:38 ability to not fit in but have that be
2:41:41 why he accomplishes these things the
2:41:43 other Kindred can't it was very very
2:41:45 good very good one of the questions that
2:41:48 we've been talking about our characters
2:41:49 and and sort of I think one of the
2:41:52 questions that came in uh from uh
2:41:54 actually the guys over the fourth log
2:41:55 podcast uh Lex was on a little bit uh
2:41:58 wanted to know how much uh our
2:42:00 characters match up with ourselves in
2:42:03 real life uh like how what aspects of
2:42:06 ourselves are in these characters and
2:42:09 like the do we typically fit Within
2:42:11 These archives or do we kind of pass
2:42:12 these hats around or well first of all
2:42:14 can we just talk about how like
2:42:16 wonderful and supportive they are like
2:42:18 they're they're just great to work with
2:42:20 and I really appreciate their like
2:42:22 presence and interaction at Fourth leg
2:42:25 yeah they've been fans for a while it's
2:42:27 very it's very cool thank you so much
2:42:29 and so you guys are freaking awesome
2:42:31 yeah super great
2:42:33 um
2:42:35 but yeah I mean I can
2:42:37 I I can tell that so Neil is me in a lot
2:42:40 of ways uh like I'm not a hoarder I'm
2:42:42 not like I don't but I definitely have
2:42:44 anxiety issues and like
2:42:46 um you know feel that that whole like I
2:42:49 don't I don't know if I feel seen guys
2:42:50 and I I feel misunderstood uh like
2:42:53 nothing freaks Neil out more than like
2:42:56 social anxiety and like the it's why he
2:43:00 gets like freaked out by Tory door and
2:43:02 like just like kind of freezes up and
2:43:04 and like has to scramble and fill
2:43:06 silence uh all that [ __ ] is straight out
2:43:09 of me like that's
2:43:10 that is that is me a hundred percent
2:43:12 like obviously I think every character
2:43:15 has like a little aspect of yourself in
2:43:17 it somewhere
2:43:18 um
2:43:21 but that's yeah that's that's the part
2:43:23 of meal that's that's kind of me
2:43:26 um
2:43:26 I'm not actually into astronomy or the
2:43:28 occult right kind of [ __ ] but like not
2:43:31 that he's telling us not that I'm
2:43:33 telling you guys
2:43:35 I think for me for Bretta the biggest
2:43:39 difference between the two of us is how
2:43:46 brother really has like
2:43:49 such a drive to
2:43:53 survive in a way where like I'm much
2:43:56 more defiant as a person than Bretta but
2:43:59 Beretta will like meld and adapt and
2:44:02 she'll do what she has to do versus uh
2:44:04 that sense of defiance and I think the
2:44:06 thing that's closest to me about Bretta
2:44:09 uh is
2:44:11 the empathy uh that she pours into like
2:44:15 trying to understand people trying to
2:44:17 convey things to people trying to
2:44:21 um
2:44:22 socially navigate and really uh
2:44:27 that that like longing for understanding
2:44:31 uh going both ways
2:44:34 I mean miles is a mild understatement of
2:44:37 myself
2:44:43 [Laughter]
2:44:47 less successful less cool what's up Tim
2:44:50 I see you yeah
2:44:51 he just has more money that's it that's
2:44:54 really what it is
2:44:57 um I don't know characters like that
2:44:59 kind of stuff like that it's always
2:45:00 weird for me because I'm always
2:45:02 portraying parts of my personality it's
2:45:05 just which ones I'm dialing up or yeah
2:45:07 yeah sure yeah for me especially is like
2:45:10 I'm not usually ever playing something
2:45:13 that isn't me but sometimes I'm tapping
2:45:15 into things that are me in a different
2:45:17 way that that's a decent way to put that
2:45:20 yo like you dial some stuff up a lot you
2:45:22 dial some stuff back and then you got a
2:45:23 different person going like right yeah
2:45:25 for sure
2:45:26 when is a
2:45:29 Erica's not much of a murder hobo
2:45:32 not much that is a worrying quality
2:45:39 um just on the weekends the the unifying
2:45:43 thing the big overlap in the Venn
2:45:44 diagram between win and Erica is it's a
2:45:48 circle
2:45:50 it is in fact not a circle I've never
2:45:53 killed a man after accusing him of
2:45:55 sucking dicks
2:45:56 um that was like
2:46:02 I've never killed a man hold on guys I
2:46:05 gotta add a few things to
2:46:06 [Laughter]
2:46:08 do way too specific and everyone's like
2:46:10 okay what like hey would anyone like
2:46:12 some not human meat dude why did you put
2:46:16 that qualifier there you didn't need to
2:46:17 do that because it's true
2:46:20 um
2:46:21 the the big overlap is that when and
2:46:24 Erica are both at their core caregivers
2:46:27 yeah
2:46:28 um that is interestingly enough not one
2:46:31 of wins nature demeanor combos but
2:46:35 um that is
2:46:36 she but she's definitely a mama bear
2:46:39 um
2:46:40 you know um I think if anything
2:46:43 there is a lot of overlap between win
2:46:46 and Erica in the sense that neither of
2:46:49 us have ever really felt like we are
2:46:52 part of a social group
2:46:56 um yeah I was diagnosed with autism when
2:46:59 I was 11 and in the late dark ages of
2:47:01 special education there was still that
2:47:03 sense of you're not really one of us
2:47:06 so I kind of grew up with the idea that
2:47:09 like okay I'm
2:47:10 this is just a I'm Ariel The Little
2:47:13 Mermaid wanting to be part of the human
2:47:15 world and I'm never gonna get there
2:47:17 um and so when is kind of whereas Erica
2:47:20 has tried to fight with that a little
2:47:23 bit wind has just been like all right
2:47:24 [ __ ] y'all
2:47:26 um and it's kind of like eager like why
2:47:28 are you guys playing into the [ __ ]
2:47:30 so if anything wins like a happier
2:47:32 version of Erica
2:47:35 um in some weird context
2:47:37 um she has no idea why people are
2:47:39 interested in her
2:47:42 um yeah I guess she's like Erica and all
2:47:44 the saddest ways
2:47:51 oh yeah yeah well we [ __ ] love you
2:47:55 yeah I [ __ ] love you guys
2:47:58 it's a follow-up on that yeah and Kabir
2:48:01 [ __ ] loves wind and
2:48:02 she loves him and neither of them know
2:48:04 how to shower and what that knows how
2:48:08 Batman reeks of wolf Panther yeah no
2:48:10 that's that's not how you do it
2:48:12 [Laughter]
2:48:14 so there's there's definitely some
2:48:16 overlap between Johnny and and myself
2:48:19 um I I I I mean I I think I think I I
2:48:24 kind of like surface level project to be
2:48:27 more of a badass than I actually am
2:48:29 which I think is the same with Johnny
2:48:30 right
2:48:32 um
2:48:32 you know because I think I think at
2:48:34 Johnny's core he's a cream puff
2:48:36 um I think it's probably the same with
2:48:37 me
2:48:38 um I mean Johnny's wife guy
2:48:41 um
2:48:42 but uh you know like I I have I have I
2:48:47 always wear my other jacket places you
2:48:49 know
2:48:50 um I I have my truck that I drive around
2:48:54 [Laughter]
2:48:56 JoJo's so excited yes Jojo
2:49:00 and uh just for everyone else out there
2:49:04 my uh our constant companion at the
2:49:06 table is my dog Jojo
2:49:08 um ravishing Wexford
2:49:11 it's pretty good he's usually pretty
2:49:12 quiet occasionally he hears his uh
2:49:14 Colorado
2:49:15 um but um he's a really good boy yeah
2:49:19 he's a good boy um
2:49:21 you know I guess you know the thing
2:49:23 about
2:49:25 my if I had to like kind of like I think
2:49:28 team plays the best was like you you amp
2:49:29 up certain parts of yourself yeah for
2:49:31 characters right
2:49:32 um I think all my characters usually
2:49:34 kind of fall into the spectrum of like
2:49:36 somewhere in the the Venn diagram of
2:49:38 like fighter thief and Paladin like
2:49:42 somewhere in those three classes you
2:49:44 find a character and usually I'll kind
2:49:45 of like lean to one side of the other
2:49:46 and I might take some part of my
2:49:49 personality and warp that a little bit
2:49:50 and amp it up
2:49:52 um yeah you know I I I I I don't think I
2:49:55 I don't nearly have have the anger that
2:49:57 Johnny has but I mean like I remember
2:49:59 part I remember times when I used to be
2:50:00 angry when I was a kid so I kind of like
2:50:02 drawn that but I'm not I'm not really an
2:50:04 angry guy
2:50:05 um
2:50:06 I think you know I I definitely Johnny
2:50:08 has a lot of morose moments where he's
2:50:10 kind of just
2:50:12 you know
2:50:12 [Music]
2:50:13 um
2:50:14 quiet introspective
2:50:17 um and a little bit kind of like just
2:50:19 you know sad I guess and
2:50:22 I think that's probably one of the
2:50:24 things that I I think I feel closest to
2:50:26 that I really amp up for the for the the
2:50:28 portrayal of the character
2:50:29 um
2:50:31 but you know I guess in the terms of the
2:50:33 spectrum he's definitely more in the
2:50:34 fighter Paladin side of the thing
2:50:36 um
2:50:37 he he's definitely furthest away because
2:50:39 I mean I love playing tricksters too
2:50:41 like that's I think one of my favorite
2:50:42 kind of character tropes is the
2:50:44 trickster
2:50:45 um
2:50:46 and I I really kind of veered Johnny
2:50:49 away from that
2:50:50 um
2:50:51 because I just I didn't I don't think
2:50:53 that that that really helps fit I don't
2:50:56 think that that me portraying a
2:50:57 trickster does not fit in this group or
2:50:59 this story I think
2:51:02 um
2:51:03 but yeah that's I think that'd be my
2:51:05 answer for that all right uh so the next
2:51:07 group of questions we're gonna do are
2:51:08 sort of about more like the plot and the
2:51:10 characters as we go forward but I think
2:51:12 we'll pick that up next time okay yeah
2:51:14 sounds good
