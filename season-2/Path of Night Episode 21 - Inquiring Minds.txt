0:00:21 want you to feel the same so listen or
0:00:23 discretion is advised now let's walk the
0:00:27 path of night
0:00:29 Our Story begins on March 10th 1999. The
0:00:33 Killing Spree has harmed the Masquerade
0:00:35 throughout the city causing the Mortal
0:00:37 flock to worry lock their doors at night
0:00:40 and avoid wandering the streets of New
0:00:42 Haven Upton Romans maintains his Praxis
0:00:45 the Sentosa remains at large as the
0:00:48 camera prepares to defend itself against
0:00:50 the Sabbat Crusade that intends to sweep
0:00:52 up the East Coast akari who has lost one
0:00:56 of its members is holding on to the
0:00:58 domain by a thread and together they
0:01:00 meet at the Cedarhurst Cafe owned and
0:01:03 controlled by Britta so they might
0:01:04 discuss what has come to pass and what
0:01:07 they might do next
0:01:10 [Music]
0:01:13 snows have begun to fade and the group
0:01:16 meets one at a time arriving to The
0:01:19 Toreadors Haven where she greets them at
0:01:22 the newly polished up Haven and Johnny
0:01:25 you're going to start us off as the one
0:01:27 who arrives last
0:01:28 the door to the cedarhursts pushes open
0:01:32 the forceful shove the Bell attached to
0:01:35 it gives a ring announcing the arrival
0:01:37 of Johnny Saxon Johnny stands just about
0:01:41 six feet tall he has a large
0:01:45 well-muscled frame hidden by some heavy
0:01:48 work and travel clothes he has a pair of
0:01:51 well-worn jeans with a couple of
0:01:53 questionable stains from Trump and
0:01:55 around the woods and maybe get into a
0:01:57 couple of fist fights a pair of uh thick
0:02:00 yellow leather work boots that are uh
0:02:03 quickly tied and kind of trapping the uh
0:02:06 the bottom of his jeans a uh red and
0:02:09 black flannel tucked in covered by his
0:02:13 well-worn leather jacket there are the
0:02:15 scars of many fights uh small puncture
0:02:19 wounds from knives and bullet holes from
0:02:21 guns and all kinds of other horrible
0:02:23 things that probably uh should have done
0:02:26 a lot more damage if it hadn't been for
0:02:28 his uh precious leather his hair is
0:02:31 about older length but pushed back
0:02:33 behind his ears and it casts kind of a
0:02:37 dark shadow across his brow showing that
0:02:40 he is looking tired
0:02:43 he probably hasn't been feeding as much
0:02:44 as he has been or should be in the past
0:02:46 few nights and his eyes barely hide the
0:02:51 hunger of his beast but he keeps on
0:02:53 soldiering through turns and regards the
0:02:56 rest of the Coterie nods to uh win on his
0:02:59 left win sits on a chair kind of splayed
0:03:03 out not really ever in her life
0:03:05 particularly accused of being ladylike
0:03:07 she Bears her stereo her typical rather
0:03:11 trademark long white braid that
0:03:13 encompasses the middle of her head but
0:03:15 bald patches on either side now though
0:03:18 there are Cobra patterns on the bare
0:03:21 skin of her scalp and if she holds her
0:03:23 mouth right you can see the the
0:03:25 unconventional fangs uh resembling a
0:03:28 Viper fangs in her mouth a hood is
0:03:30 pulled over her head most times but at
0:03:32 this point she's pulled it down because
0:03:34 she's among friends her eyes the same
0:03:37 green as a seagulls give her a sort of
0:03:39 eeriness that most people would find
0:03:41 unnerving but she again has found a
0:03:44 place with these people here uh she
0:03:46 wears her typical battle flannel many
0:03:48 different colors a red and blue flannel
0:03:51 scrap tied around her wrist a memory of
0:03:53 a woman she used to be she seems to have
0:03:56 cleaned up her appearance a little bit
0:03:58 her jeans seem to have been washed even
0:04:01 if they don't fit right her flannel is
0:04:03 buttoned even if it's clearly dirty and
0:04:06 her leather jacket is wrapped around her
0:04:08 even though again it's not necessarily
0:04:10 meant to fit her frame and her just
0:04:13 god-awful Doc Martens have been tied and
0:04:16 maybe an attempt to have polish them she
0:04:19 returns the nod to Johnny and looks to
0:04:21 miles miles is kind of walking around
0:04:24 taking in all of the the shop and the
0:04:27 improvements and changes that have gone
0:04:28 on since he was here last he's in a
0:04:30 full-length leather trench coat wearing
0:04:33 sunglasses indoors with his slickback
0:04:34 blonde hair nearby seems to be his
0:04:37 Katana and its vibrant red sheath he's
0:04:40 uh currently just poking around and
0:04:42 waiting for the whole Coterie to show up
0:04:44 he's around six foot with Slick Black
0:04:46 blonde hair and blue eyes and he's uh
0:04:49 even all this gear that he's wearing
0:04:51 it's still very put together all the
0:04:53 right places to look just correct with
0:04:56 Johnny coming in he looks over to Britta
0:04:58 Britta can be spotted wiping out the sink
0:05:01 as the Coterie arrives everything in the
0:05:04 place is immaculate now the Coterie will
0:05:07 notice that she's put various
0:05:08 photographs and calendars up like a
0:05:11 collage of beautiful images but the
0:05:13 Toreador herself moves with her usual
0:05:15 Grace her brown hair is up into a neat
0:05:19 perfect bun the big doe eye Sprite and
0:05:21 light and innocent in her gorgeous face
0:05:23 but she's still got the red leather
0:05:26 jacket that Johnny gave her tied around
0:05:28 the waist of the dress that she's
0:05:30 wearing lace edges spaghetti straps dark
0:05:33 colors fishnets beneath just as
0:05:36 everyone's kind of gathering in Britta
0:05:39 takes a look at the door for the final
0:05:40 member to arrive but no one comes the
0:05:43 group makes themselves comfortable
0:05:45 amidst Posh seating and has a moment to
0:05:49 themselves with no eyes on them so they
0:05:52 could actually maybe decompress find
0:05:54 comfort in one another
0:05:56 and perhaps most importantly
0:05:59 plot well I hope you guys have been
0:06:03 at least safe during this time period
0:06:05 but it doesn't look like you guys have
0:06:06 been unbusy Johnny definitely cast him a
0:06:09 perhaps me a little bit angry glance as
0:06:13 being one of the bully boys the domain
0:06:15 has left him constantly working in these
0:06:19 past nights to cover up masquerade
0:06:21 breaches reinforce parts of the domain
0:06:24 it's just been non-stop for for Saxon he
0:06:28 pulls out a cigarette Pops in his mouth
0:06:30 and lights it with a Fleck of his Zippo
0:06:32 miles
0:06:34 um safe might be a stretch Britta I got
0:06:36 your message sorry I haven't had a
0:06:38 chance to call back are you okay
0:06:40 well it turned out all right but um well
0:06:44 the santosa visited I guess that's maybe
0:06:47 the place to start
0:06:50 um I didn't manage to get him to stay
0:06:52 but well really um I'm sorry when I
0:06:56 don't know I don't know how to say this
0:06:57 this is more something that you would be
0:06:59 an expert in sure
0:07:01 um xantosa no um Romeo visited two I
0:07:07 think Romeo The Toreador Romeo the dead
0:07:10 Toreador he visited you it felt like
0:07:13 maybe he pulled the Zantos out of the
0:07:16 room and the room was cold and dark and
0:07:19 they're kept being like classical music
0:07:21 and
0:07:22 changes in in the room and I I get it
0:07:27 we're all dead but I hate to break it to
0:07:30 you Romeo got shredded no I realized
0:07:33 that Romeo is extra dead but he he was
0:07:36 really here and I know that I don't know
0:07:37 how to he he gave me this I believe you
0:07:40 it's like a vision and
0:07:43 um about my past about his past and it
0:07:46 felt like I was there and what did it
0:07:48 look like when you had the vision was it
0:07:50 like when the one you had before when
0:07:52 you were in the shadowlands yeah
0:07:55 it was like that okay I has he been back
0:08:00 since no
0:08:01 um not since he dragged the santosa out
0:08:03 or
0:08:04 since it seemed like he got upset Johnny
0:08:07 goes walking over to the uh the front of
0:08:09 the cafe and kind of just looks around
0:08:11 the street he's a little bit uh
0:08:13 impatient it's kind of pacing around
0:08:16 look kid
0:08:18 um I want to hear more about these ghost
0:08:20 stories I do but you said that the
0:08:22 santosa was here where'd Vito go well he
0:08:25 came in through the sink
0:08:26 um of course he did the what miles just
0:08:29 rolls his eyes at that and just just the
0:08:32 worst he came in through the sink and um
0:08:35 well he wanted to flesh craft me and
0:08:39 when he got too close something dragged
0:08:42 him out of the room I assume it was
0:08:44 Romeo it kind of it dragged him out
0:08:46 Britta gestures with her hand a graceful
0:08:49 sweep from one side to another is the
0:08:52 motion that she makes but as she makes
0:08:54 this motion uh she says yeah it was like
0:08:58 he flew okay and where did he wind up it
0:09:02 was like he was sucked out in a vacuum I
0:09:04 I I chased after him but things had
0:09:07 already changed and and here things had
0:09:09 become darker and colder and it felt
0:09:11 like it was just Romeo's presence I
0:09:13 couldn't find anything about the santosa
0:09:15 there that's all things that happen
0:09:18 so these visions that you had did you
0:09:19 write them down record them well I wrote
0:09:23 down what I could of it but honestly I
0:09:26 don't think how a lot of it was a blur
0:09:29 um Romeo said that we were part of
0:09:31 something called a shadow Crusade
0:09:33 um like like a training facility maybe a
0:09:36 dark place does that mean anything to
0:09:39 anyone else here because Shadow Crusade
0:09:41 means nothing to me I've never heard of
0:09:43 that Crusade sounds like something that
0:09:45 Sabbat would say but I've never heard
0:09:47 them specifically call out a shadow
0:09:49 Crusade the place that I was at it was
0:09:52 sort of gray and well shadowy um the
0:09:56 place in the memory that he brought me
0:09:58 into rather memories of the shadowlands
0:10:00 like you had before yeah a lot like I
0:10:02 had before it just it went deeper in
0:10:04 this time and he said that we had chosen
0:10:07 the names that we had Romeo that he had
0:10:10 chosen the name Romeo or
0:10:11 that I had chosen the name Brittany
0:10:15 he dragged you into a vision a memory
0:10:18 that's interesting choice of words
0:10:21 well I was asking him to talk to me um
0:10:24 if he was there I didn't understand what
0:10:26 that meant and so Britta what you
0:10:28 experienced some of that is very normal
0:10:31 when a wraith is present but the
0:10:34 aggression that he showed the the way
0:10:38 you described the xantosa flying out and
0:10:40 you attributing that to Romeo well
0:10:43 that's that's
0:10:44 that's not typical I wasn't sure if it
0:10:48 was Romeo I thought it might be but at
0:10:50 the time the santosa was talking about
0:10:53 um his master
0:10:54 and he started giving it seemed like he
0:10:57 might no he was talking about a sleeping
0:11:00 master
0:11:01 the master he was he's referenced it
0:11:04 before that's why he couldn't be killed
0:11:06 because he had to keep hidden placed in
0:11:10 track and
0:11:11 write the house right felt like he was
0:11:14 starting to give more information about
0:11:15 it and that's when he flew out and I I
0:11:18 couldn't tell if it was Romeo dragging
0:11:19 him out because he got too close to me
0:11:21 or if maybe something else got to him
0:11:24 all very odd do you see anything now
0:11:27 when in this area nothing at the moment
0:11:30 if it gets that cold again you did the
0:11:33 right thing calling me I'm not I'm sorry
0:11:35 I didn't respond maybe this is the time
0:11:39 when I need to acquire an actual phone
0:11:41 instead of a pager we can make that
0:11:44 happen that might be for the best well I
0:11:48 don't know if Romeo intends to come back
0:11:50 but the santosa seemed like he intended
0:11:52 to come back for whatever that's what
0:11:55 was his interest in you
0:11:58 um
0:11:58 well Berta looks visibly uncomfortable
0:12:01 she looks to Johnny and she kind of
0:12:03 pauses a moment and straightens up the
0:12:06 santosa really liked that I shot him
0:12:11 huh like like really liked that I shot
0:12:14 him I'm talking about like the it was
0:12:16 pain
0:12:17 he said it was a new experience that he
0:12:20 had never had and that he wanted to
0:12:22 share more experiences like that with me
0:12:24 and I mean dying is generally a new
0:12:27 experience that people don't get to
0:12:28 experience multiple times but winds
0:12:31 fists visibly clench at the idea that he
0:12:34 was making untoward advances towards
0:12:36 Britta you know I've been thinking a lot
0:12:38 about veto I was expecting that
0:12:41 embracing him might work in our favor
0:12:44 because we'd keep him alive so that your
0:12:46 sire could use them against our enemies
0:12:48 in the domain but he hasn't sought me
0:12:51 out
0:12:52 and I'm starting to get worried that he
0:12:55 might have some kind of weird
0:12:57 sympathetic link to some kind of
0:12:59 horrible zamizi Elder I don't know
0:13:02 everything about what that Clan is
0:13:04 capable of but I know that they
0:13:08 the sympathetic links that they can
0:13:11 create with their disciplines he wanted
0:13:14 to craft me he what she started the
0:13:17 conversation off that way he was
0:13:19 claiming that he could get into my
0:13:21 memory the same way that maybe you had
0:13:24 miles something like that not quite the
0:13:26 same but well I understand that he was
0:13:28 in theory trying to use fleshcraft to
0:13:31 affect your brain I guess he was
0:13:34 offering that maybe he could but maybe
0:13:36 by digging around in my body he could
0:13:39 get to my memories and get me able to
0:13:42 remember stuff and maybe with that
0:13:44 objective of creating a sympathetic link
0:13:47 like that that doesn't seem very
0:13:48 plausible to me no me neither well let's
0:13:52 remember
0:13:53 when we found him
0:13:55 he was in a whole garden of Flesh if you
0:13:58 will right that house was filled with
0:14:00 all kinds of crafted things that flesh
0:14:04 isn't simply created from nothing I do
0:14:07 remember that if if anything about my
0:14:10 theory carries through that might just
0:14:12 be extensions of the Elder he serves in
0:14:16 fact
0:14:17 he might we might might be better off
0:14:19 not thinking of him as a ghoul but
0:14:22 simply an extension of the same Elder
0:14:24 in which case My Embrace might have just
0:14:28 been giving that Elder access to my
0:14:29 vitae
0:14:31 we will have to see we don't have enough
0:14:32 information at this time
0:14:34 still trying to capture the vetoes on
0:14:36 the agenda there are still multiple
0:14:38 parties that wish him either alive and
0:14:40 or dead and having him run around on the
0:14:43 agenda I feel like that should be that
0:14:44 should be priority number one I would
0:14:46 love for it to be priority number one
0:14:49 this miles your phone goes off excuse me
0:14:53 for a second
0:14:54 I move over there to the uh Sheriff we
0:14:57 have a rather significant masquerade
0:14:59 issue that we need you to look into uh
0:15:02 it is a matter of silencing uh where and
0:15:04 who a man by the name of detective
0:15:06 Suarez he's been investigating into
0:15:08 actions performed by The Killing Spree
0:15:10 and recently he has come upon a handful
0:15:14 of witnesses who saw some sort of um a
0:15:18 kindred mauling outside of the Elysium
0:15:21 some some uh sabat Gangrel with claws
0:15:25 matted hair uh regardless uh detective
0:15:29 Suarez has become aggressive in his
0:15:32 pursuit of information and monitoring
0:15:35 his police reports he is beginning to
0:15:37 leave out details of his investigation
0:15:39 we believe that this is intentional and
0:15:42 that he is on to more than he is willing
0:15:44 to admit to his superiors Mr Suarez and
0:15:48 anyone that he is currently associated
0:15:50 with needs to be reviewed and if they
0:15:53 cannot be brought heal the kind must be
0:15:56 eliminated who is this you recognize the
0:15:58 voice as Reiss Reiss why are you asking me
0:16:01 this information I was asked you by his
0:16:03 grace walk Johnny's eyebrow definitely
0:16:06 arches as you mentioned the name Reiss
0:16:09 congratulations new elevation by the way
0:16:11 I expect you will perform far more
0:16:14 admirably than the Brujah I've done well
0:16:16 so far I know we'll speak again Reiss of
0:16:19 course we will I hang up the phone so
0:16:21 you buddies with Reiss now no my new
0:16:24 position calls for me to be interacting
0:16:27 with more people than I did previously
0:16:29 you got a new position too
0:16:31 yes I assume by that you also have a new
0:16:34 position yeah kind of yeah definitely
0:16:38 let's start with mine then we'll go with
0:16:40 yours at this point in time I have been
0:16:43 appointed the new sheriff of New Haven
0:16:46 what bread of Texas setback where's
0:16:49 weathers weathers is taking a temporary
0:16:52 leave of absence
0:16:53 the [ __ ] does that mean he hasn't
0:16:56 decided if he's leaving the domain or
0:16:57 not that's what it means now you're
0:16:59 going to let me explain
0:17:01 sure that's not very good one do you
0:17:05 really think that I wanted to take
0:17:06 weather's position
0:17:07 no I absolutely don't right so I didn't
0:17:11 take it I took it under duress duress I
0:17:14 couldn't back out of it basically the
0:17:16 prince
0:17:17 I mean [ __ ] rolled downhill and he
0:17:18 didn't say anything as it rained on his
0:17:20 head I definitely said something uh-huh
0:17:23 thank you your grace am I right no well
0:17:26 what did his grace want just for you to
0:17:28 be the sheriff he basically the reward
0:17:30 for preventing the Praxis was becoming
0:17:34 Sheriff after he'd awarded me event true
0:17:37 symbol of status and at that point in
0:17:39 time I could not refute it even though I
0:17:41 tried to inform him that weathers was
0:17:43 integral in preventing that practice did
0:17:45 he want you to be the sheriff or do you
0:17:47 just not want weathers to be the sheriff
0:17:49 anymore it's unclear all he was told
0:17:51 that I basically is that I was the new
0:17:54 sheriff and that I was informed whether
0:17:57 that he was no longer Sheriff because he
0:17:58 allowed these things to happen in his
0:18:00 Elysium and these orders come from his
0:18:04 grace or did they come from your new
0:18:06 buddy Reiss Johnny do you really think
0:18:08 Reiss is my new buddy no but he's got
0:18:11 your number and giving you orders Johnny
0:18:13 people have your number two yeah but I
0:18:16 don't take orders from [ __ ] every
0:18:17 [ __ ] that calls my phone
0:18:19 hey would you stop and just think about
0:18:22 this
0:18:24 I was there when you fought Reiss
0:18:26 and Shaw and the lupine
0:18:29 I'm doing what I can to keep this domain
0:18:32 together at this point and that's part
0:18:34 of it is I can't always refute what the
0:18:36 prince want and you well
0:18:39 I mean if weather's left you don't
0:18:42 really have a choice right
0:18:44 I'm hoping that weathers will come back
0:18:46 and work with me and get this done
0:18:49 this is not the time to be fractured
0:18:52 what about Jane Jane is with with us she
0:18:55 will go where he goes so the domains
0:18:57 just pretty much lost all of their Brujah
0:18:59 I don't know
0:19:01 this is a rather new position that's why
0:19:04 you hadn't heard of it yet
0:19:05 Reiss calling me is a new development and
0:19:07 I'm not pleased by it and I am working
0:19:09 to counteract his position in the domain
0:19:12 and his power yeah I thought we were
0:19:15 working towards that too but apparently
0:19:17 nothing's changed huh not necessarily
0:19:19 true what do you mean who is senocial as
0:19:23 soon as I get it cleared with the prince
0:19:24 it'll be Elsa Linden but he agreed to
0:19:26 that as part of that conversation that
0:19:28 ended up with me being Sheriff the
0:19:30 prince did correct the less power Reiss
0:19:32 has the happier I'm gonna be and the
0:19:34 safer the domain is going to be I'm
0:19:36 working on trying to limit him but at
0:19:38 the same time he's still an important
0:19:41 asset in this domain's protection and I
0:19:43 don't like him and I don't like him
0:19:45 being there but he's also going to be a
0:19:47 high priority Target for the Sabbat
0:19:49 which I don't mind and guard the party
0:19:51 line right Sheriff haven't we been kind
0:19:54 of doing that anyways makes you question
0:19:55 all kinds of things I guess yet again
0:19:58 are you saying that I haven't been doing
0:19:59 the actions that you think is right so
0:20:01 far you've been with me along the way
0:20:03 here you've seen the decisions that I've
0:20:04 made
0:20:05 I'm doing what I can under the
0:20:07 circumstances that I have you just keep
0:20:09 on making all kinds of smart slick
0:20:11 Venture moves as of late and it makes me
0:20:14 question a lot of things that's all like
0:20:16 what Johnny
0:20:18 well we all risk Our Lives
0:20:21 and at the end of the day
0:20:23 most of the same [ __ ] are still in
0:20:25 power and Miles gain status
0:20:28 and why is that a bad thing did you want
0:20:30 status do you want more responsibility
0:20:33 no I didn't necessarily want this bump
0:20:35 in status either this job does not make
0:20:38 what we've been doing easier
0:20:40 oh no so I'm working to fix that and if
0:20:43 we can get weathers and cool that back
0:20:45 that will go a long way and how the hell
0:20:48 do you expect to do that Shawnee maybe
0:20:50 they listened to you about it
0:20:53 what I mean you know them well enough
0:20:56 for it the only reason that I'm still
0:20:59 with the camarilla is because of
0:21:01 weathers Amarillo okay Maria I need a
0:21:04 friend to check
0:21:06 laughs
0:21:09 self-control oh yeah buddy
0:21:13 one success Johnny narrowly avoids a
0:21:16 frenzy you hear his jaw audibly grind
0:21:20 the only reason
0:21:23 that I am still with the camarilla is
0:21:25 because of weathers
0:21:27 and you want me to go
0:21:30 beg him to stay
0:21:34 and the only thing that you have to say
0:21:36 about that
0:21:37 is to tell me that it's the camarilla
0:21:41 why you've corrected me before
0:21:43 you think it's [ __ ] smart to push my
0:21:45 buttons right now why you've been
0:21:47 pushing your mind this entire
0:21:48 conversation
0:21:49 why are you the exempt this I'm doing
0:21:51 stuff also and you keep thinking that
0:21:54 I'm just out here [ __ ] everyone
0:21:56 give me a reason to listen to you that
0:21:58 isn't just Johnny do more of my bidding
0:22:01 when have I ever said do my bidding I am
0:22:04 saying do you want these people to
0:22:06 [ __ ] Dodge the fact that you double
0:22:08 speak all the time
0:22:10 rarely double speak with all of you [ __ ]
0:22:13 off guys take a breath
0:22:16 we don't have time for this the only
0:22:18 reason I am still in the camarilla
0:22:20 Johnny
0:22:21 is because of you [ __ ]
0:22:23 and we've lost one of you [ __ ]
0:22:28 now I am gonna stay here until I am the
0:22:31 last goddamn Gangrel standing in this
0:22:34 domain
0:22:35 and I'm gonna do that with or without
0:22:37 you [ __ ] with me
0:22:40 now miles you talk slick Johnny you talk
0:22:43 mean we don't have time for that [ __ ]
0:22:46 are we gonna get along are we gonna try
0:22:49 and save this [ __ ] domain or are we
0:22:50 done
0:22:51 am I standing alone
0:22:54 you're not standing alone
0:22:56 Johnny am I the only fighter in this
0:22:58 Bunch anymore Johnny takes a long
0:23:00 dragging his cigarette and stares
0:23:02 daggers back at you wind just Returns
0:23:05 the glare
0:23:06 he blows out the smoke and kind of just
0:23:10 shrugs and and gives you a hand gesture
0:23:12 like continue
0:23:14 so
0:23:16 you're looking at the Gangrel primogen
0:23:18 for the domain I was afraid you were
0:23:20 gonna say something about that why
0:23:22 afraid what's wrong with that we have a
0:23:24 voice on the council that's good isn't
0:23:27 it what happened to the other gangwell
0:23:28 primerton oh he's dead yeah that's what
0:23:30 I was afraid of outside the domain
0:23:32 didn't violate any of the tenets of the
0:23:34 Camarilla did you check yes okay
0:23:37 before or after that doesn't does that
0:23:39 matter no I'm just curious wait hang on
0:23:42 how does that's still not violating the
0:23:45 right of Destruction no it's not his
0:23:47 Prince's domain I didn't violate his
0:23:49 right of Destruction yeah depends on
0:23:51 what the princess to say about that well
0:23:53 that's why I keep you [ __ ] I'm using
0:23:55 that word a lot I really need to get a
0:23:57 thesaurus or a rhyming dictionary or
0:23:59 something I must have one somewhere I
0:24:00 went to college there's a rhyming
0:24:02 dictionary creative writing classes
0:24:04 Jesus get it the [ __ ] together Johnny's
0:24:06 eyebrows race when you mentioned you
0:24:07 went to college he seems impressed and
0:24:09 or surprised you're not sure anyways
0:24:13 I can handle the primogen thing if it
0:24:15 comes up though I feel like the prince
0:24:17 might not even notice I I guarantee it's
0:24:20 gonna be not something he either really
0:24:22 knows or cares about Rusty was under
0:24:25 Shaw's payroll and frankly I'm the I am
0:24:29 the only Gangrel in The Domain yeah
0:24:31 your previous speech made me think that
0:24:33 too yeah I am I am only accountable to
0:24:36 myself
0:24:37 which kind of feels appropriate
0:24:40 that and you guys
0:24:43 I think we all are our own better angels
0:24:46 and worse demons at some time so I have
0:24:49 a laundry list of things that keep
0:24:50 popping up that I have to keep taking
0:24:52 care of is there anything else that we
0:24:53 should know about before I start putting
0:24:55 my other things on the table
0:24:57 short answer yeah what else you know the
0:25:00 Holy Land not the one in the in the
0:25:03 Middle East the one in in Waterbury yes
0:25:06 that defunct Park yes isn't there like a
0:25:10 bunch of abandoned like bible stuff
0:25:13 there yeah that's not the only thing
0:25:15 that's there there's some um zombies
0:25:19 um
0:25:20 dead reanimated corpses like us no no
0:25:25 like like feral like animals like were
0:25:29 they able to speak no like the ability
0:25:31 to speak doesn't make someone
0:25:33 intelligent Johnny it is a notable
0:25:35 difference in in this in certain
0:25:37 categories of thing it to answer your
0:25:40 question
0:25:42 could not speak Beyond grunting and
0:25:44 groaning so more like like a like a
0:25:46 movie zombie yes very much like a movie
0:25:49 zombie and that's an issue for the
0:25:51 Masquerade it's an issue for the
0:25:53 Masquerade it's an issue for the
0:25:54 shadowlands something is happening in
0:25:57 the shadow land it's centered over
0:25:58 Boston and it's starting to bleed into
0:26:00 here the the wraiths of the Dead are
0:26:03 finding their way back into their bodies
0:26:05 and they're starting to walk I've heard
0:26:08 that there's certain plans outside of
0:26:10 the camarilla that have the ability to
0:26:12 summon minions like that the Giovanni
0:26:16 Raven gave me some information about
0:26:19 them and um I'm going to be making a
0:26:21 trip to Boston to talk to them about
0:26:23 what's going on you sure that's smart no
0:26:25 it's not smart at all but
0:26:28 if I want to stop what's happening here
0:26:30 there's gonna have to be some action
0:26:32 outside of the domain don't you mean
0:26:34 we're gonna make a trip then wind Just
0:26:36 Smiles like her heart grows three times
0:26:38 in size
0:26:40 if you want to come I'm not going to say
0:26:42 no want to come there's only one dumbass
0:26:45 in the domain that can get you that get
0:26:46 you to Boston without any trouble
0:26:48 well good thing he's one of my favorite
0:26:51 dumbasses
0:26:52 he rolls his eyes wind kind of reaches
0:26:55 over and punches him on the shoulder
0:26:56 like come on buddy I'll see what else I
0:26:58 can hear about that nearby hopefully we
0:27:01 can avoid a trip to Boston but
0:27:03 unfortunately that's where the center of
0:27:05 the action is there's also
0:27:08 um just so you guys know you Joey's
0:27:10 still around he's he's hanging out with
0:27:13 me good that means most of that came
0:27:16 together almost 100 I'm I'm gonna take
0:27:19 him still being around as a huge win not
0:27:22 to make fun of my own name
0:27:25 the uh the city's been crawling with
0:27:27 reports of weird things coming from uh
0:27:30 New York yeah I haven't seen too many of
0:27:33 them with my own eyes the other night I
0:27:35 did have to deal with something that uh
0:27:38 infected some local kid infected yeah I
0:27:43 don't really know what to say happened
0:27:45 to him but he wasn't like a zombie he
0:27:48 was still alive
0:27:50 sounds like a live is a strong word
0:27:52 apparently uh according to his
0:27:56 girlfriend he got bit by something in in
0:27:59 the uh Subways over in New York
0:28:02 and when I finally put him down I can't
0:28:05 say what exactly that was but
0:28:09 he wasn't human anymore but he wasn't
0:28:11 dead he was dead when I got finished
0:28:13 with him I burned I burned the remains
0:28:16 and uh nothing's coming back from that
0:28:18 so it's odd about it never seen
0:28:20 something like this before and seeing
0:28:21 that come all the way up to New Haven's
0:28:23 a little bit worrying miles kind of nods
0:28:26 at that so we've got it from both sides
0:28:28 of the uh Coast we're getting it from
0:28:30 Boston and New York Jane and weather's
0:28:33 left with not leaving me much of
0:28:35 anything and I'm still trying to sort
0:28:36 through all the reports so some of this
0:28:38 is nothing I'm aware of yet we might
0:28:40 want to keep our eyes peeled for um any
0:28:44 more kids that are killed like Joey all
0:28:47 right Justin I don't know what the
0:28:49 zamizi is still doing if he went back to
0:28:52 the house there's a chance he could be
0:28:53 making more creatures there's a chance
0:28:55 they could be killing more kids like
0:28:56 Joey and there was definitely a
0:28:58 detective on at uh Joey's house when I
0:29:01 took him to say goodbye to his mom what
0:29:03 was the detective's name his name's
0:29:05 Suarez he's been on some of this stuff
0:29:07 before that's on my that's the same
0:29:09 detective that the uh the domain wants
0:29:12 you to take care of in silence right how
0:29:13 much the call could you hear it's Reiss
0:29:15 that loud he's very nasal oh is that
0:29:18 something that is immediate miles fairly
0:29:20 immediate he seems to be on the trail of
0:29:22 uncovering the Masquerade I feel like
0:29:25 that should be something I can handle
0:29:27 without too much of an issue we can
0:29:30 handle I mean I I can just mess with his
0:29:33 memory detective Suarez yeah he's
0:29:36 that'll be my first instinct and then we
0:29:38 can go from there it's the least
0:29:39 intrusive of the items I mean that's
0:29:42 better than often him because he does an
0:29:43 awful lot of good right my attempt isn't
0:29:46 to remove the current infrastructure
0:29:49 that the humans have he seems to be
0:29:51 doing a good job he seems to be doing
0:29:52 his job in general but he's getting too
0:29:55 close yeah and he doesn't seem to be
0:29:57 apparently he has been all I would
0:29:59 imagine he's been offered bribes at this
0:30:01 point too and refused them which doesn't
0:30:03 make things better he's also just come
0:30:05 very close before now I've had my eye on
0:30:08 him for a little while so at this point
0:30:11 also as we discussed before Vito Sentosa
0:30:13 multi factions want him including
0:30:16 Messiah still you know when the spooky
0:30:20 stuff started happening at my Haven
0:30:22 stuff that I think must have mostly been
0:30:25 Romeo or some of it might have been Vito
0:30:27 I'm not sure but I thought it'd be Neil
0:30:30 at first
0:30:32 but
0:30:33 if more stuff like that keeps happening
0:30:35 I can point out the santosa that's good
0:30:39 Neil is still MIA so we we haven't found
0:30:43 him correct I don't know if that makes
0:30:45 this better or worse Johnny kind of just
0:30:48 hangs his head
0:30:49 don't get your hopes up I'd rather know
0:30:51 one way or the other this in between
0:30:54 crap is
0:30:56 it's not great
0:30:57 well we'll be able to hopefully dig into
0:31:00 that at some point
0:31:02 the detective Suarez needs to be dealt
0:31:04 with I feel like I can handle that
0:31:07 Johnny I really do need you to talk to
0:31:09 others what do you want me to ask him
0:31:11 just talk with him I just I would prefer
0:31:15 that he stayed with the domain and
0:31:16 working with us to prevent the Sabbat I
0:31:19 feel like you also want to prevent the
0:31:20 savat from coming through
0:31:23 miles you got given Sheriff because of
0:31:26 what happened with the werewolf right
0:31:28 correct
0:31:29 well that was both of you that was
0:31:31 Johnny that was you too and
0:31:34 as much as
0:31:36 I'd like for weather to be Sheriff too
0:31:38 but we need to support each other in
0:31:40 this otherwise
0:31:42 his grace is just gonna pick a new
0:31:44 person and we won't be able to help the
0:31:46 domain
0:31:47 in the way that we'd lie to
0:31:49 but I'm not sure you understand him
0:31:52 getting Sheriff was a punishment it was
0:31:55 a two-fold punishment it was hitting
0:31:57 weathers and stripping him of any power
0:31:59 that he had sought that he had been
0:32:01 building in the domain because he made a
0:32:03 move against Reiss and it was a
0:32:06 punishment to Miles because now miles is
0:32:09 under the thumb of Reiss I think you're
0:32:11 giving the grace a little too much
0:32:13 credit in all of this the grit his grace
0:32:15 no I'm giving him no credit it's Reiss
0:32:17 making all the moves and using using
0:32:20 rolands as a a mouthpiece possibly I'm
0:32:23 working to diminish that influence I am
0:32:26 going to be meeting with The Ventrues
0:32:28 soon other venture and hoping to get a
0:32:33 recent a contract of sorts I just need
0:32:35 to check with my sire my other Venture
0:32:38 do you do you mean your sire my sire
0:32:40 among them
0:32:41 we need to try and see if we can if we
0:32:43 can't find veto and make sure that you
0:32:45 have him when you talk to your sire it
0:32:48 would go a long way otherwise we have to
0:32:50 be careful because I know that Roland
0:32:52 and them wanted to give to the premiere
0:32:54 and I'd really rather not do that win
0:32:56 kind of pulls a napkin out of one of the
0:32:59 dispensers and grabs a pen from her
0:33:02 pocket and kind of sits at the bar so
0:33:05 what is it in the best most coherent
0:33:08 order of things what is it we need to be
0:33:10 focused on first I needed to deal with
0:33:13 Suarez first and also talking to others
0:33:16 I was supposed to give him a couple days
0:33:18 he didn't want to see me but I feel like
0:33:20 if nothing else you and him should talk
0:33:23 and I'll talk to others
0:33:26 I can't make any promises that you're
0:33:28 gonna like anything that comes out of
0:33:30 the conversation I'm sure but but I'll
0:33:32 try and curb the worst of his plan why
0:33:34 this is an excellent person it's just
0:33:36 he's been I don't necessarily know the
0:33:39 sheriff was working out for him he was
0:33:40 getting blood and on the moon side a lot
0:33:42 for trying to do the right thing all the
0:33:44 time and I don't it's choose your words
0:33:47 carefully here he is one of my best
0:33:49 friends he and I owe a lot to that man
0:33:52 so right you got opinions about him I'm
0:33:54 not saying that I'm just telling you
0:33:55 that's that he was in a bad position and
0:33:58 he knew it so after talking to weathers
0:34:01 and dealing with Suarez what next I'm
0:34:04 supposed to find Arabella Rowlands do we
0:34:06 have any leads on that not yet wind
0:34:08 starts jotting down notes her
0:34:10 handwriting is god-awful are you writing
0:34:12 notes with a napkin yeah I've got some
0:34:14 paper if you want
0:34:15 um that might be better I'm blowing
0:34:17 right through this napkin
0:34:19 Britta seems to have art supplies all
0:34:21 around her Haven actually strange
0:34:23 variants of art supplies she hands you
0:34:25 like a nice thick uh a notebook of like
0:34:28 nice thick quality paper and the first
0:34:32 thing that she finds is a pack of like
0:34:34 watercolor colored pencils Jesus are you
0:34:37 sure you want me using this why not
0:34:40 because I may destroy it try not to okay
0:34:43 I can do that so after weathers it's
0:34:46 probably veto
0:34:48 does a weather's veto and preparing for
0:34:51 the Tabata the top three of my
0:34:52 priorities so where does Arabella fall
0:34:54 on that wherever we can fit it I don't
0:34:57 have any leads into her at this time but
0:34:59 I don't know I unfortunately don't I
0:35:02 need to develop a new person to find
0:35:04 leads so
0:35:05 I know I also need to deal with Boston
0:35:09 and the um Romeo situation sounds like
0:35:12 something Britta and I should be looking
0:35:14 into yes and
0:35:17 um I think unfortunately I might be the
0:35:19 best lead we have for veto and for that
0:35:22 reason for everything I don't know if I
0:35:25 should I want to stay in contact with
0:35:27 you guys I don't think we were ever
0:35:29 advocating that we drop out of contact
0:35:31 with each other I'll get cell phones for
0:35:33 everyone what I mean is that I might be
0:35:36 the best she kind of closes her eyes and
0:35:38 looks like she doesn't want to say it
0:35:40 best they we have to get Veto I don't
0:35:45 want to agree with you
0:35:47 something I think we should all consider
0:35:49 in the coming nights I think we should
0:35:52 probably stop making a habit of going
0:35:54 anywhere by ourselves I agree we should
0:35:57 always be at least in a pair I agree
0:35:59 there's too many threats in the city
0:36:00 right now
0:36:01 and we can't afford to be caught by
0:36:04 ourselves again against any of them no
0:36:06 killing is pretty still active though
0:36:08 they've slowed which makes me aware that
0:36:10 they're moving for something new for
0:36:12 Neil's sake I don't want to lose another
0:36:14 one of you
0:36:16 how do we want to do this wind just kind
0:36:19 of looks to everyone except herself I
0:36:22 need to deal with as far as probably
0:36:23 nowish
0:36:25 all right then let's go deal with Suarez
0:36:27 I think uh you and Britta should
0:36:29 probably go talk to Suarez she might
0:36:31 actually be a a good hand and and uh
0:36:34 doing that and you also might want to
0:36:36 consider
0:36:37 possibly deputizing her can you do that
0:36:40 if she's under the accounting I think
0:36:42 the current state of the domain makes a
0:36:44 lot of traditions a little bit more
0:36:45 flexible I'll probably still need to get
0:36:48 that approved but it's I don't know how
0:36:50 to be a
0:36:51 Deputy it just means that when some
0:36:54 [ __ ] asks you why you're doing
0:36:57 something you can tell them you're
0:36:58 working for the Sheriff's Office that's
0:37:00 all that means okay okay I think you and
0:37:03 I should probably go see if we can find
0:37:04 weathers yep that sounds like you should
0:37:07 be a deputy day I am you're a bully boy
0:37:09 same thing different title doesn't it
0:37:12 make more sense for for you Johnny to be
0:37:15 the deputy I mean you're at the link he
0:37:17 can have as many as he wants as long as
0:37:19 they're people he trusts oh that's you
0:37:21 here's your title the title isn't
0:37:24 doesn't matter Jackson sounds pretty
0:37:26 good all I'm saying is that you should
0:37:29 also consider keep putting putting Britta
0:37:31 under that umbrella as well once I can
0:37:33 finish off the accounting it's on we'll
0:37:36 see what's going on at that point so you
0:37:38 may not want to do this kind of work
0:37:39 either well I said earlier
0:37:41 um I think we all have to do this
0:37:42 together I know that
0:37:45 can but
0:37:46 we need to stick together right now
0:37:48 so let's let's go deals for us agreed do
0:37:52 you mind coming with me to go find
0:37:54 weathers do you mind having me come with
0:37:55 you while you talk to others no I'd be
0:37:57 all right all right all right check in
0:37:59 you two all right after a difficult
0:38:02 conversation the group splits up to head
0:38:05 out to handle business
0:38:09 [Music]
0:38:11 miles and brother the two of you step
0:38:14 outside of the Haven uh miles why don't
0:38:16 you give a quick description of the car
0:38:18 that the two of you are now approaching
0:38:20 we are heading towards a 1998 storm
0:38:24 purple Lamborghini Diablo it goes 0 to
0:38:27 60 in three and a half seconds
0:38:30 it has 512 horsepower he said a brief
0:38:33 description
0:38:35 it should have a longer description than
0:38:36 I do
0:38:38 Britta takes a second appreciates the car
0:38:40 steps in the passenger I need a
0:38:43 self-controller oh you do that's true it
0:38:45 is a beautiful car it is a beautiful car
0:38:46 it calls to you calls to me too
0:38:49 [Music]
0:38:52 demanding that you admire it
0:38:56 difficulty is six every day that's six
0:38:58 and that was a success every one will
0:39:00 count against your total number of
0:39:02 successes I have one success okay you
0:39:05 kind of shake your head and blink as you
0:39:07 realize that the vehicle very nearly
0:39:08 captivates you which would probably not
0:39:11 be great if you saw it on the road this
0:39:14 is a really nice car yes
0:39:17 um
0:39:18 we're gonna be driving in it so it'll be
0:39:20 even nicer Britta looks like she wants to
0:39:22 say more but she's not quite sure how to
0:39:24 approach the subject and she kind of
0:39:25 just stands and stares at the car for a
0:39:27 bit longer is there a problem
0:39:29 um if something like this surprised me
0:39:32 it might I think it might freeze me I
0:39:35 don't know what to do about that I guess
0:39:37 maybe I could try to I'm not driving
0:39:39 uglier cars
0:39:41 Britta opens the door and gets in
0:39:48 uh the door does not open as you expect
0:39:50 it to what happens I believe it has
0:39:53 Gullwing doors yeah so they rotate
0:39:57 upwards but it tries to open the door
0:39:59 and notices that her grip is a little
0:40:01 bit wrong and adjusts
0:40:03 I'm just gonna make a few phone calls
0:40:05 and then we'll be ready to go all right
0:40:07 you get into the futuristic work of art
0:40:09 and Miles begins making calls to
0:40:12 contacts contacts okay what information
0:40:14 are you looking for I am looking for
0:40:16 either Suarez's Suarez's phone number
0:40:19 would be good and also if a current
0:40:21 location of where I can find him at
0:40:22 besides the police station would
0:40:24 probably be best uh they get back to you
0:40:26 by the time you're hitting the road and
0:40:28 starting to kind of peel out you do
0:40:30 notice this thing goes pretty quick
0:40:32 pretty fast
0:40:34 and has this like very faint per to it
0:40:38 while you're getting out your car phone
0:40:40 goes off and your contacts get back to
0:40:43 you letting you know that detective
0:40:45 Suarez has apparently been investigating
0:40:47 into Joey's death along with a handful
0:40:49 of other cases and he is currently at a
0:40:53 place called uh Sherwood Cafe meeting
0:40:56 with a woman by the name of Sheila
0:40:57 Mendes what does Sherwood Cafe sound
0:40:59 familiar they respond that they don't
0:41:01 know oh right thank you I hang up then I
0:41:05 say out loud again why does Sherwood
0:41:07 Cafe seem familiar um
0:41:09 I mean I don't remember it but that
0:41:11 doesn't really say much
0:41:13 I don't know it'll come to me when we
0:41:15 get there all right how do you want to
0:41:16 approach this he's apparently
0:41:18 interviewing a person named Sheila
0:41:20 um I'm kind of tempted to Brute Force
0:41:22 this because I don't have time I mean if
0:41:26 it's if he's smart well he just kind of
0:41:28 get back on the trail there are ways to
0:41:31 make him turn away from it every time he
0:41:33 decides to try to do it all right but I
0:41:36 don't think he's going to give it up
0:41:37 with normal persuasion so there's two
0:41:40 methods we can do here we can either use
0:41:43 the powers that we have to try to
0:41:46 permanently dissuade him in various ways
0:41:47 without killing him or we introduce him
0:41:50 introduce him and Theory we could make
0:41:53 him a ghoul might he still be a risk
0:41:55 then less so after the blood bone takes
0:41:57 place well one thing that we could do is
0:42:00 I could listen in on the interview that
0:42:03 he's having
0:42:04 it'd be best not to approach him in a
0:42:06 crowd
0:42:07 though I'm going to stick out that's
0:42:09 kind of a known factor and since I don't
0:42:10 know the name of this place I assume
0:42:12 it's not a place that I would normally
0:42:13 be a normal patron of sure what part of
0:42:18 town is the Sherwood Cafe in well it's
0:42:20 actually Downtown New Haven uh not
0:42:22 overly far from like Yale and that whole
0:42:25 area so it's a college bottom most
0:42:28 likely ton of college kids yeah you
0:42:29 might fit in quite well all right is
0:42:31 that something that we could use yeah we
0:42:33 could possibly use that to at least do
0:42:36 an approach go from there you could
0:42:39 possibly just see what he why he's doing
0:42:42 this what his motivation is
0:42:43 responsibility of the job and such but
0:42:46 he's starting to go behind his superiors
0:42:48 backs which speaks to another motive all
0:42:51 right what would I say listen in on him
0:42:53 and maybe just try to get a grasp of
0:42:56 wise there maybe approach him with
0:42:58 information what could I give him that
0:43:00 wouldn't be a problem make something up
0:43:03 I mean you were there for this about
0:43:05 attack it isn't too hard to say you may
0:43:07 have saw something hell the report of
0:43:09 this incident seems to be something that
0:43:11 you mentioned before yeah it sounds like
0:43:14 a grand girl on the street killing
0:43:16 someone right around the day that the
0:43:18 they hit Elysium yeah it does sound
0:43:20 familiar all right you can say that a
0:43:24 friend of a friend told them that he was
0:43:26 looking into this all right and
0:43:29 then I'll get back to you yeah I'll be
0:43:31 around
0:43:32 okay let's head to the show
0:43:37 [Music]
0:43:43 not exactly where the money is in New
0:43:46 Haven but it does have it looks to have
0:43:49 a pretty strong presence uh a good chunk
0:43:52 of The Nightlife is in the area having a
0:43:54 good time a lot of people outside
0:43:55 smoking cigarettes kinda gathered in
0:43:58 like huddled circles to protect against
0:44:01 the cold
0:44:03 when you pull up there is a [ __ ] ton of
0:44:06 gawking that happens in response to the
0:44:09 car
0:44:09 you know there's some quick cat calls
0:44:12 and people make some ever so slightly
0:44:14 lewd gestures directed at Britta and you
0:44:18 kind of make your way towards uh into
0:44:21 the bar kind of past these like idiot
0:44:23 Meat Heads that are partying and
0:44:24 drinking all night but ignores the cat
0:44:26 calls and slips away from Miles as soon
0:44:29 as she gets any understanding of where
0:44:31 the [ __ ] someone who looks like a
0:44:34 detective someone who looks out of place
0:44:35 if there's anything that would tip her
0:44:37 off to that besides myself
0:44:39 uh when you get inside uh it's a bit
0:44:44 dinging kind of smells of uh cigarette
0:44:46 smoke
0:44:47 you come to the site of uh definitely a
0:44:52 young woman who's been bartending she's
0:44:54 kind of got like a little bit of like a
0:44:55 punk Fielder and she is sitting across a
0:45:00 table in a booth talking to an older
0:45:04 Spanish man who's got like a lot of gray
0:45:06 hair uh and a very kind of
0:45:09 tired expression but there's this like
0:45:12 dogged determination to a Molly talk
0:45:14 star and it looks like they're having a
0:45:15 conspiratorial conversation all right my
0:45:18 intention is to it's the first Love of
0:45:21 All specs to listen in with heightened
0:45:24 senses right yes alrighty that is my
0:45:26 intention to maybe if the next Booth
0:45:29 over is empty or if there's somewhere I
0:45:32 could stand depending on the music level
0:45:34 or the noise level in here taking those
0:45:36 factors into account to try to stand
0:45:38 somewhere where people are less likely
0:45:40 to bother me and I can hear them so it
0:45:43 looks like they're seated rather close
0:45:45 to some speakers so it's very hard to
0:45:48 clearly make out what's being said
0:45:50 between them okay all right you're gonna
0:45:52 have to get pretty close uh and avoid uh
0:45:55 being in the path of where the speakers
0:45:58 are projecting all right so trying to
0:46:00 figure out seeing where the speakers are
0:46:02 pointed if there's a better vantage
0:46:04 point maybe on the other side of their
0:46:06 Booth yeah okay pull out my note book
0:46:09 pull out some of the art supplies she's
0:46:11 been working with maybe a set of chalks
0:46:14 and pretend to be doing something while
0:46:17 trying to listen in okay you relax and
0:46:20 start listening into the conversation
0:46:23 Sheila kind of explains that there was
0:46:26 this guy Eddie that she was very close
0:46:28 with who recently disappeared after some
0:46:31 stuff went on in New York he asks her
0:46:34 you know what she saw the night that day
0:46:37 was uh the big attack downtown and she
0:46:41 kind of goes on to explain that she
0:46:44 mostly saw the rush of panic that
0:46:47 happened in the crowd and had gotten out
0:46:51 of there before she really saw anything
0:46:52 huge but she did see uh some or hear
0:46:55 rather a like a very very loud
0:46:58 animalistic noise he kind of asked like
0:47:01 you know hey um
0:47:03 uh can you clarify that somebody are you
0:47:06 referring to like uh like a big cat like
0:47:09 a Roar and she's like no this was this
0:47:11 was the sound of a wolf
0:47:14 he gives a nod to not actually seeming
0:47:17 very surprised with such a strange
0:47:20 description and goes ahead and takes
0:47:23 down some notes
0:47:25 meanwhile uh miles what's going on with
0:47:27 you I'm gonna head towards the middle of
0:47:29 the bar since I've been very conspicuous
0:47:31 anyways uh spend the blood to look
0:47:35 human okay be friendly with those around
0:47:37 me possibly buy some drinks in there
0:47:40 engage the bartender just chit chatting
0:47:43 whatnot and kind of keep an eye on
0:47:45 Suarez and Britto from because they're I
0:47:48 imagine they're down to my left
0:47:49 somewhere uh the bartender a guy named
0:47:51 uh Paul uh or other sorry Phil
0:47:55 um you know he provides you with your
0:47:56 drink pretty quickly he's friendly guy
0:47:58 and seems to not overly engage you uh
0:48:02 kind of picking up on you being
0:48:04 interested in something else
0:48:05 young women and detective Suarez uh seem
0:48:08 to wrap up their conversation she gets
0:48:11 up and she returns to the bar and uh
0:48:15 pretty quickly actually uh checks in on
0:48:17 you she's like hey is there anything
0:48:19 else I can get you
0:48:21 I order an expensive ass drink drop some
0:48:23 money on it large tip at this point just
0:48:26 paying for them as I go along okay she
0:48:28 accepts and uh we'll go ahead and start
0:48:30 preparing your drink Britta what are you
0:48:32 doing as uh she goes over starts
0:48:35 interacting with Miles Britta is gonna
0:48:38 hover a little bit before she approaches
0:48:40 the detective and kind of holding the
0:48:44 art supplies that she was messing with
0:48:45 to her chest come up to him slowly and
0:48:48 say
0:48:50 um I'm sorry sir I
0:48:52 I heard a little bit about the wolf
0:48:55 noise are you an investigator
0:48:57 he makes a point of showing you his
0:48:59 badge oh yes ma'am I am
0:49:03 um
0:49:04 well I am
0:49:07 look I saw something strange that night
0:49:09 and I
0:49:11 didn't know who I could talk to about it
0:49:14 I I know it's gonna sound
0:49:17 ridiculous but
0:49:19 um I'm just kind of looking down taking
0:49:21 notes
0:49:22 there was this fight in the street and
0:49:26 um
0:49:27 well it looked like kind of like a fight
0:49:30 between people but
0:49:32 one of them had red eyes
0:49:35 like like really red eyes
0:49:38 I raises an eyebrow Antics look at you I
0:49:40 don't suppose you're open to more of a
0:49:42 conversation on this
0:49:44 um
0:49:44 she kind of shifts her weight
0:49:47 and like stops to look at him and then
0:49:50 slowly knots are you looking to make a
0:49:52 report
0:49:53 I don't know if this is
0:49:56 Sometimes some stuff doesn't go well
0:49:59 under report
0:50:01 he kind of looks at you for a long
0:50:02 moment I don't know if maybe the Red Ice
0:50:04 thing would help or maybe it would just
0:50:06 make someone else not sound crazy but
0:50:09 look whatever was going on that night
0:50:13 you seem like you really want to help
0:50:16 were you listening to my conversation
0:50:19 when I heard the thing about the wolf
0:50:21 noise I came over here because uh she
0:50:24 kind of points out like the guys who are
0:50:25 white wolf whistling I just seemed like
0:50:28 a better corner
0:50:30 I'm sorry I didn't mean to but no it's
0:50:33 quite okay
0:50:34 so you wanted to talk about this or you
0:50:37 simply wanted to let me know about the
0:50:38 red eyes I guess I kind of wanted to
0:50:41 hear anyone else
0:50:44 it made me feel crazy too
0:50:47 you're definitely not crazy and you're
0:50:49 not the only one who's made reference to
0:50:50 that sort of thing
0:50:52 all right so if there's anything else
0:50:54 you want to let me know I'll take
0:50:58 anything you have to say very seriously
0:51:01 um could I take your number down
0:51:02 he goes into his wallet pulls out a card
0:51:05 and offers it to you she takes it and
0:51:08 she thanks him and Retreats if he seems
0:51:12 all right with that uh to a different
0:51:13 corner of the bar than miles is that it
0:51:16 kind of like watches you go
0:51:19 and write something down I do not drop
0:51:23 heightened senses uh for a bit so long
0:51:26 as he seems like he might like until his
0:51:29 attention turns is when I drop
0:51:31 heightened senses as far as I'm aware I
0:51:33 know I don't have a great grasp on that
0:51:35 so and once I kind of like set the card
0:51:39 away tuck it carefully into the thing
0:51:41 that I wasn't really drawing take a
0:51:43 second and if I don't really look at
0:51:46 Miles I just kind of take my own time
0:51:48 for him to do whatever he's going to do
0:51:50 about that as I see her start moving
0:51:52 away I sent her a quick text to see if
0:51:55 she can check to make sure he's human or
0:51:57 not if she can do that thing then curse
0:52:00 for not having Gail here
0:52:03 I only have I have heightened senses I
0:52:06 don't think I have anything else so how
0:52:07 much prospects yeah it's got one level
0:52:09 that is not something you can do uh
0:52:12 there's a confuse pause uh she kind of
0:52:15 stares in front of her at the bar for a
0:52:16 second uh then she texts you back and
0:52:19 says I don't think I can do that sorry
0:52:21 Roger and then I will wait for the
0:52:23 detective to leave the bar so that I can
0:52:25 follow him because it sounds like and I
0:52:27 I basically send you a text is there
0:52:29 anything I should know I send a text
0:52:31 letting you know that uh he's gotten a
0:52:33 lot of reports that match what I saw of
0:52:35 the fight and that he seems heavily
0:52:38 invested and like he knows much more
0:52:41 than he say that he does seem like he
0:52:43 wants to help it's like a serious
0:52:44 attacks Britta is being careful uh not to
0:52:48 type too fast there's sort of that
0:52:49 temptation to like is there a word for
0:52:52 that pressing the button over again so
0:52:54 that you get the letter T9 T9 okay yeah
0:52:57 she she's with even without the Celerity
0:53:00 and she's a Fast Tax there Youth
0:53:04 and uh basically at this point I'll eat
0:53:06 first of all is to leave the bar and
0:53:08 then make an approach once he breaks out
0:53:10 of these crowds okay yeah he lights a
0:53:13 cigarette heads over to Sheila I'll let
0:53:17 you know that he's gonna be heading out
0:53:18 for the night if she has any questions
0:53:19 she can feel free to call him if she
0:53:21 remembers anything that she hadn't
0:53:23 thought to say before or wants to amend
0:53:25 the story that she told he she's more
0:53:27 than welcome to do that and to just drop
0:53:30 on the line
0:53:31 he turns and he's like he's getting this
0:53:34 like dingy white button-up shirt he's
0:53:36 got like the tie he's got like the long
0:53:38 coat he's got all of like it's a classic
0:53:40 Noir detective okay has it hit me yet
0:53:43 that this place is related to Johnny no
0:53:45 no okay
0:53:47 apparently I've never paid enough to
0:53:48 know where he lives
0:53:51 I'm sorry Johnny it's all right
0:53:54 and uh he heads outside I texted I'll be
0:53:58 like stay nearby but don't expose
0:54:00 yourself and I'm going to follow Suarez
0:54:02 out as far as outside uh he's got this
0:54:05 like shitty little sedan that he owns
0:54:08 but you do notice something else why
0:54:10 don't you give me a perception plus a
0:54:11 learness rule [ __ ]
0:54:13 you will notice something no matter what
0:54:15 just simply lets you know what you
0:54:17 notice laughs
0:54:20 all right I will take two successes
0:54:23 okay Suarez uh seems to notice the
0:54:27 Lamborghini and gives like a like a what
0:54:29 the hell face and he looks and there is
0:54:33 definitely this guy leaning on it with a
0:54:37 young woman kind of like pulled to him
0:54:39 in his arms and he's kind of kissing up
0:54:41 on her and flirting with her and asking
0:54:45 her if she wants to go for a ride in his
0:54:47 car like gesturing to uh Diablo as
0:54:51 though it belongs to him I will deal
0:54:53 with him in a minute permanently
0:54:58 or remove him from the face of the Earth
0:55:01 not really that seems so extreme but
0:55:04 what's your Humanity yeah
0:55:05 [Laughter]
0:55:07 six
0:55:09 on a good day
0:55:11 um so I I'll basically wait till Suarez
0:55:13 gets to his car I assume it's a little
0:55:14 bit farther away from the bar uh no no
0:55:17 it's right there right in front of the
0:55:19 bar it looks like he has shortened the
0:55:22 distance between his car and the bar as
0:55:25 much as possible there is a very clear
0:55:26 deliberate Choice there I'll call out to
0:55:28 him at that point detective Suarez
0:55:30 pauses uh yes can I speak to you for a
0:55:33 minute of course it kind of like reaches
0:55:34 into his coat like kind of tucking his
0:55:36 hand in and then he takes his hand out
0:55:38 and heads over to speak with you good
0:55:39 evening detective good evening
0:55:42 so I guess we should just start this off
0:55:44 what are you recording us are we having
0:55:47 a conversation because I I record all of
0:55:49 my conversations I hope that's not a
0:55:51 problem
0:55:51 but there's a problem you may opt out of
0:55:53 the conversation if you wish sir you can
0:55:56 opt out of recording all the
0:55:57 conversations because that's not
0:55:58 necessarily legal
0:56:00 of course it is oh so long as I let them
0:56:02 know they have to agree it's a double
0:56:03 consent State and they can opt out if
0:56:05 they don't agree right nods
0:56:08 very good
0:56:09 I figure you've been looking into a
0:56:11 series of things going on in New Haven I
0:56:14 have what interest of this is yours I'm
0:56:17 a member of the New Haven Police
0:56:19 Department and I am specifically
0:56:23 employed to do so sir oh and I kind of
0:56:27 protect my voice down it's like then why
0:56:30 are you leaving off some of your things
0:56:32 from your reports
0:56:34 that seems rather suspicious of you do
0:56:37 you mean to imply that you have access
0:56:38 to privileged information
0:56:40 that's not answering the question is it
0:56:42 you're not able to and ask me questions
0:56:44 and demand answers but now I have reason
0:56:47 to suspect that you are accessing
0:56:50 privileged information without actual uh
0:56:52 access to it are you sure I am
0:56:56 how do you know I don't have access to
0:56:58 it you don't know who I am I bet you
0:57:00 would not take much to find out who owns
0:57:02 a car like that and he points at the uh
0:57:04 Lamborghini
0:57:06 that's not exactly a long list so I'm
0:57:09 going to ask you a question why is
0:57:11 anything I do any business of yours
0:57:13 because it's a drawing interest of who
0:57:16 individuals
0:57:17 I see
0:57:19 and I want to know why because it's my
0:57:21 job it's more than your job
0:57:24 that's the answer you're getting
0:57:26 so who are these individuals
0:57:29 they're not getting that he just kind of
0:57:31 takes a step back pulls out a phone and
0:57:34 just
0:57:35 takes a picture of you flips the phone
0:57:37 closed tucks it into his pocket I make a
0:57:40 few phone calls
0:57:41 a port that there's some weirdo and a
0:57:43 Lamborghini harassing young women get
0:57:45 your face on the newspaper I'll keep you
0:57:47 busy for a long time if I need to so I'm
0:57:49 going to make this very clear whoever
0:57:51 these individuals are does it stay in
0:57:53 their corner I'll stay in mine and I'm
0:57:55 going to keep doing my job
0:57:57 why don't you follow me roll it so
0:58:00 amusing watching you do some Sheriff
0:58:04 Johnny's So Satisfied getting to see it
0:58:08 in a mirror
0:58:10 difficulty
0:58:12 nine minus whatever uh your mods are
0:58:15 yeah
0:58:20 Suarez
0:58:23 yeah too bad my tongues explode
0:58:26 so that would be seven
0:58:29 oh God what's the time frame that gives
0:58:32 that seven rounds seven rounds okay to
0:58:34 reading them I am leading him he
0:58:36 definitely seems to like
0:58:39 and I wanted to get him in around out of
0:58:43 the general view site okay yeah you take
0:58:45 them run back there's uh there's a
0:58:47 couple doors there dumpster I'm gonna
0:58:49 start off with the mesmerism just to try
0:58:51 to get him in a state basically I want
0:58:54 him to be in a supplicant State no no
0:58:56 compliant yes thank you so the mesmerism
0:58:58 you can give him right an extended set
0:59:01 of orders right so I need to know what
0:59:02 those are and then they're gonna roll
0:59:03 okay he meets your eyes uh is kind of
0:59:07 like unblinking people's dilated Mr
0:59:10 Suarez every time you continue to look
0:59:12 into The Oddities happening in and
0:59:14 around New Haven I want you to instead
0:59:16 go do your paperwork possibly other
0:59:18 people's paperwork roll
0:59:21 yeah
0:59:22 so that'll be three successes okay uh
0:59:25 successful uh mesmerism while he's in
0:59:27 that state can I still do the forgetful
0:59:30 mind part of this yes all right just do
0:59:33 you want to just roll it or I need
0:59:34 anything else involved with it uh you
0:59:36 have to specifically instruct him on
0:59:37 what he's going to forget
0:59:39 um and and what the memory is replaced
0:59:41 with okay so I should probably roll
0:59:43 first because to see what what I can do
0:59:45 because it's it's kind of specific yeah
0:59:49 two successes
0:59:51 says may remove but not alter memory
0:59:54 permanently so I'm going to tell him to
0:59:57 forget our conversation and seeing me
1:00:00 after leaving the bar okay and then I
1:00:03 will leave all right you leave him in
1:00:05 the alley and head around front and
1:00:08 there's this guy who is flirting with a
1:00:12 girl kissing up on one of his friends uh
1:00:16 rather in decently expose himself starts
1:00:18 pissing on the back tire of your car uh
1:00:21 the guy's like yeah get the [ __ ] off my
1:00:22 car bro what the [ __ ] are you doing and
1:00:24 they start having this like little
1:00:25 bickering and they're starting to like
1:00:28 argue around your car uh the guy pissing
1:00:30 in my car he's going to get a I'm going
1:00:33 to look at him as I'm coming into my car
1:00:36 and go run okay uh give me a roll yes uh
1:00:40 he has a power rating of two
1:00:43 I'm assuming you haven't told me to come
1:00:45 out so I assume you're nearby oh tell me
1:00:48 when you you instructed me to come out
1:00:50 I'm pretty sure he doesn't have time to
1:00:52 zip his pants
1:00:55 miles handling [ __ ] oh what'd you get
1:00:58 that's seven seven he starts running uh
1:01:01 starts tripping his pants end up around
1:01:03 his ankles they were already very baggy
1:01:05 so it's just right down he takes off the
1:01:09 other guy uh who is rocking this like
1:01:12 again a bright red New York Yankees
1:01:17 baseball cap and a big puffy coat and
1:01:19 has been making out with this young
1:01:20 woman kind of like gives you an up nod
1:01:22 like the two of you are fellow cool guys
1:01:26 sir you're on my property
1:01:29 the woman gives you an indignant look
1:01:31 she's like I ain't nobody's property not
1:01:34 you you ill mannered Harlot
1:01:41 wench was actually the word that I
1:01:43 wanted to come out
1:01:45 catch these hands wench
1:01:49 when she was my first thought but I'm
1:01:51 also not from that time period but just
1:01:53 like I feel like it might be like
1:01:56 miles went to a ren Fair one time and it
1:01:59 was stuck in his brain first of all he
1:02:02 wields the most archaic weapon from a
1:02:04 more civilized time than any of you also
1:02:07 my sire is like 500 years old so those
1:02:10 hands those hands ain't that old they're
1:02:11 from like the 60s so you're trying to
1:02:13 play 40s thank you that's when they were
1:02:15 they're vintage
1:02:20 I'm sorry so what are we doing how that
1:02:22 do I really don't want him to mess up my
1:02:24 car but I also feel like Dread gaze is
1:02:27 terrible because it does all that weird
1:02:28 hissing and stuff so it Greggy
1:02:30 specifically says you Reveal Your
1:02:33 vampiric continents yeah that's a bad
1:02:35 plan so you have exactly three seconds
1:02:38 to get off my car
1:02:41 just kind of go wide with the
1:02:42 realization it's like oh this thing I
1:02:45 was uh uh I I parked cars for the bar
1:02:48 here and it kind of like gestures to it
1:02:51 this bar does not have a valet well
1:02:54 you're looking at him so I don't really
1:02:55 know what to tell you guy I
1:02:57 just uh the young woman's like [ __ ] off
1:03:00 bro this isn't your car it's his and she
1:03:03 like I look at her chewing some violence
1:03:06 I am done with these [ __ ] already
1:03:09 I want to know am I in the bar I assumed
1:03:12 you would be out I didn't want you to be
1:03:13 far so I assumed you'd be outside the
1:03:15 bar at this point okay so I get to
1:03:16 spectate me yeah
1:03:17 neat what's this willpower uh hurl power
1:03:21 yeah four all right miles passing out if
1:03:24 I could dominate like it's candy she
1:03:27 will take seven okay uh she gets this
1:03:30 terrified looking rise as she finds
1:03:33 herself unable to speak and argue with
1:03:36 you the way that she wanted to so uh the
1:03:39 guy like Ash Ketchum tilts his hat so
1:03:42 it's facing backwards and he is going to
1:03:45 attempt to Sucker Punch you are we an
1:03:47 initiative yeah all right oh God I
1:03:49 really wish the audience could see Tim's
1:03:51 face yeah black said that oh my God all
1:03:54 right so initially mine is 11th I'm at
1:03:56 20. she rolled a lot better than uh okay
1:03:59 yeah you [ __ ] maxed out I'm not using
1:04:00 any celebrities there's people around
1:04:02 okay he just rolled the dice
1:04:05 it's going on a seven uh 20.
1:04:09 fairly exciting I'm walking regular fast
1:04:12 towards the situation you walking
1:04:14 regular or fast
1:04:16 regular human Fest okay so you start
1:04:19 jogging over to the situation yeah uh
1:04:22 the look in Miles eyes very clearly
1:04:26 indicates that he's about to Fringe
1:04:27 Hannah crowd of people
1:04:29 um he's right there
1:04:31 what is an action that I can do about
1:04:34 that is talking him down like you can't
1:04:36 preemptively cannot preemptively talk
1:04:38 someone down yes that's the it's the
1:04:40 Brujah life right there yeah I guess what
1:04:42 I'm thinking of here when I'm trying to
1:04:44 get like the attention of ideally miles
1:04:47 but you know it's just sort of it's not
1:04:50 really a Baywatch walk over if it's not
1:04:53 in a bathing suit but
1:04:56 your plan is to slow jog no my kids are
1:04:59 gonna hassle off your way into the
1:05:01 situation Pamela Anderson this is the
1:05:03 time
1:05:05 like to jog over and just say hey to
1:05:09 Miles and assumably anyone hearing the
1:05:12 hay would

1:05:56 the quotation marks uh you jog over and
1:06:00 what do you say I just say hey let's go
1:06:03 that's honestly just very plain okay so
1:06:05 you're like hey let's go and then
1:06:07 everyone including everyone across the
1:06:09 street people who are like at the stop
1:06:12 lot at the red light or everyone turns
1:06:15 to look directly at you uh miles what
1:06:19 are you doing other than looking at her
1:06:20 apparently
1:06:22 yeah you start there yeah uh I will hold
1:06:26 my action to see if this guy is still
1:06:28 planning on decking me and then I will
1:06:30 uh I guess I will spend the willpower
1:06:32 and give him a still command he is not
1:06:35 looking at you I still do I can't talk
1:06:38 no you need eye contact
1:06:40 and she had specifically created
1:06:42 scenario where you do not have it
1:06:44 I will give her a nod and get in the car
1:06:47 gracefully okay uh you get in the car
1:06:50 guy the Red Cab is like I ain't afraid
1:06:52 no girl any turns and swings on brother
1:06:55 no that's cute he has two successes and
1:07:00 with an open Palm slaps the torreidor in
1:07:02 the mouth
1:07:03 I'm gonna need a self-control check
1:07:08 Britta I need you to roll soak against
1:07:12 one level of bashing damage he cannot
1:07:14 physically hurt you you do not have to
1:07:15 roll
1:07:17 it's halved and rounded down nothing
1:07:19 happens but you do feel his hand connect
1:07:22 against your face uh due to public
1:07:24 humiliation I do need a self-control
1:07:27 check
1:07:29 I yes I assume it's regular difficult
1:07:31 yeah you're not a bro yeah okay I will
1:07:34 spend a willpower he's in the car like
1:07:36 God give me the strength
1:07:38 Lambo give me strength Lambo give me the
1:07:41 strength I mean we are counting down
1:07:42 rounds until the [ __ ] Sheriff not
1:07:44 Sheriff uh detective detective shows up
1:07:47 the mesmerism will
1:07:51 one success including the willpower that
1:07:53 means that you are not in frenzy we go
1:07:55 to you brother he is in your face and
1:07:57 he's like I will choke the [ __ ] out of
1:07:59 you can I just get in the car yeah then
1:08:01 I'd like to open that ridiculous door
1:08:03 and look out to the crowd that is
1:08:06 looking at me just with like her puppy
1:08:09 dog eyes as I step into the car what the
1:08:12 [ __ ] bro yeah crowd starts getting real
1:08:15 mad on your behalf I'll get us out of
1:08:16 there I'll let the crowd deal with him
1:08:18 okay uh you get out uh in your rear view
1:08:20 mirror you can definitely see a bit of a
1:08:23 brawl outside of the bar escalate sure
1:08:25 what's taking off trash detective Suarez
1:08:29 makes his way out back you see him kind
1:08:31 of like lighting a cigarette he looks
1:08:32 tilts his head to the side at the sudden
1:08:35 crowd and missing Lamborghini and just
1:08:37 kind of heads off to do paperwork
1:08:40 foreign
1:08:45 as they're back in the car flips down
1:08:47 the car mirror and takes out like a tube
1:08:50 of what's probably a brown lipstick like
1:08:52 a light brown fixes what the guy smudged
1:08:55 off her oh that was entertaining that go
1:08:57 okay when as well as it could have been
1:08:59 for my first time out glad to hear it I
1:09:01 think it'll hold for now but I don't
1:09:03 know he seems fairly strong-willed well
1:09:06 maybe that's something to check back in
1:09:08 on later
1:09:09 hmm
1:09:10 he might be a good convert I don't did
1:09:13 you figure out any reason why he's doing
1:09:14 this he
1:09:17 didn't get anything specific
1:09:19 but he seemed very very motivated oh
1:09:22 Marco's digging to him and
1:09:24 maybe if you could
1:09:28 you think he's that strong-willed maybe
1:09:30 he'll find a way around what you've told
1:09:33 him I'm sure at this point all right I
1:09:36 don't think he's going to forget my face
1:09:37 we have a little breathing room right
1:09:39 now
