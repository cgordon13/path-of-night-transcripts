0:00:00 path of night is an actual play vampire
0:00:01 the masquerade podcast set in the
0:00:03 classic world of darkness we're all
0:00:04 friends we're here to have fun but our
0:00:06 story can include graphic violence drug
0:00:08 use sexual content and other mature
0:00:10 themes we've talked at our table about
0:00:11 safety comfort and consent both as
0:00:13 players and storytellers we know what to
0:00:15 expect we're all excited to be here we
0:00:17 want you to feel the same so listener
0:00:18 discretion is advised
0:00:20 now let's walk the path of knight
0:00:23 last time on path of night
0:00:26 in order to save Britta the quartery
0:00:28 traded boons and made deals with Brujahs
0:00:30 sheriff earl weathers torridor primigen
0:00:32 elsa linden and nosferatu primogen shaw
0:00:35 defined the political capital they
0:00:37 needed to place her under miles's
0:00:38 accounting
0:00:39 all too familiar with the importance of
0:00:41 first impressions the quarterly also
0:00:43 tried to prepare Britta for imminent
0:00:45 presentation to prince upton new orleans
0:00:48 [Music]
0:00:50 so when we last left off the group of
0:00:52 you were being led back into the elysium
0:00:54 by arabella Rowlands
0:00:57 when the group of you follow her in
0:01:00 already you can see all of the disparate
0:01:02 conversations that are being held by
0:01:04 kindred throughout the elysium
0:01:06 are
0:01:08 coming to an end
0:01:09 and everyone is starting to kind of
0:01:11 gather where they expect the prince to
0:01:14 make his presence known
0:01:16 there is
0:01:17 already that tension in the air you're
0:01:20 starting to kind of get a feel as to
0:01:23 as to what the rest of the court thinks
0:01:25 your odds might be based entirely on how
0:01:27 many of them look your way and
0:01:30 sneer or
0:01:31 give amused expressions like like folk
0:01:34 getting ready to watch an execution
0:01:37 once you're actually inside that's when
0:01:40 you notice that one of the bully boys
0:01:43 makes his way to the door
0:01:45 of where you just came in from and they
0:01:48 just kind of post up
0:01:51 in case
0:01:52 the kindred who have started to get to
0:01:53 know you start having second thoughts
0:01:55 about the enforcement of the traditions
0:01:58 and here you are uh we're going to take
0:01:59 a five boys ladies time bathroom come on
0:02:02 britta um
0:02:04 yeah no no it's all right she's she's
0:02:06 gonna come help me with stuff miles if
0:02:07 you just stand outside the door it'll
0:02:08 it'll be okay i guess that'll be fine do
0:02:10 we have to use that or
0:02:13 right now yes
0:02:14 all right
0:02:15 just make it quick
0:02:17 uh we are always quick all right we got
0:02:19 guys watching us so everything we're
0:02:21 doing right now is under high scrutiny
0:02:24 wind kind of takes britta
0:02:26 a little rougher than she intended by
0:02:28 the elbow and drags her into the
0:02:29 bathroom she's going
0:02:31 easy it's all right i'm sorry i'm very
0:02:32 rough
0:02:33 um a handful of kindred look down their
0:02:35 noses
0:02:36 in your direction saying you you roughly
0:02:39 handle this this individual who is about
0:02:41 to be executed but they don't really
0:02:44 move to give you a hard time or
0:02:46 kind of raises an eyebrow is though
0:02:49 yeah that's the attitude you're going to
0:02:50 take
0:02:51 they continue about their business yep
0:02:54 you go now the door shuts behind them
0:02:57 okay we don't have a lot of time but i
0:02:59 want you to have a we don't to answer
0:03:02 your question no we don't use the
0:03:03 bathroom okay all right we are just in
0:03:05 here because
0:03:07 i need to
0:03:08 get some stuff clear to you because i
0:03:10 think it's important that you know
0:03:12 do you know anything about maslow's
0:03:14 hierarchy of needs
0:03:16 um what
0:03:18 um okay so you're
0:03:22 you're at a point where you have no
0:03:23 sense of self and in order to find
0:03:24 self-actualization you need to have
0:03:26 basic needs met in order to get to here
0:03:28 you need to start here and you are
0:03:30 starting down here wins hands are a
0:03:32 flurry of explanations um that make very
0:03:35 little sense
0:03:37 she looks at Britta and says okay
0:03:39 if has any point
0:03:41 in this evening led the conversation to
0:03:43 people telling you what a kindred is
0:03:46 i'm sorry this hierarchy is this
0:03:48 something i'm going to need to talk to
0:03:50 the prince about no
0:03:53 no other question first
0:03:56 what a kindred is yes has anyone told
0:03:58 you what that is not really okay
0:04:02 i need you to look at me
0:04:04 and i need you to understand
0:04:06 that what i'm gonna tell you is scary
0:04:08 but i'm not telling you this because i
0:04:10 don't think you can handle it Britta
0:04:12 looks back
0:04:13 kindred means vampire
0:04:15 everyone out there
0:04:16 including yourself
0:04:18 is a vampire
0:04:19 what happened to you today
0:04:21 made you a vampire
0:04:23 and you are now part of a world that we
0:04:25 have fought to keep hidden for years is
0:04:28 that why there was
0:04:30 the blood and yes
0:04:32 there are different kinds of us
0:04:34 and every single one of us uses those
0:04:36 abilities to
0:04:39 hunt
0:04:40 you are now part of a society of
0:04:42 predators
0:04:43 but
0:04:44 i don't think you're as powerless as
0:04:45 they're treating you i think you are a
0:04:47 lot stronger than they are giving you
0:04:49 credit for
0:04:51 everyone here monsters all of us
0:04:54 and i'm
0:04:56 one of
0:04:58 i'm a monster too yup
0:05:01 but the thing is
0:05:03 monster is just a word used to describe
0:05:05 things that humans can't explain
0:05:08 do we all
0:05:10 kill
0:05:11 like i did
0:05:13 usually all of us do at least once just
0:05:15 once
0:05:17 no
0:05:17 not usually we live a very long time
0:05:21 how long
0:05:22 unless it's been interrupted
0:05:24 there's there's no real limit
0:05:26 you're saying that
0:05:29 everyone here
0:05:30 me included were
0:05:32 were a mortal word like like
0:05:36 like a
0:05:37 movie or something yeah
0:05:40 yeah darling we are
0:05:41 and i don't know that's part of the
0:05:43 problem is we don't know
0:05:45 what kind of monster you are
0:05:47 and that scares all the people out there
0:05:49 that live on control and that's part of
0:05:51 the reason this is a problem is because
0:05:53 they don't know how to classify you
0:05:55 and this accounting that's so that you
0:05:57 know how to keep our world hidden from
0:06:00 what you used to be
0:06:02 to uphold the rules yes
0:06:06 i am part of a group a clan this ain't
0:06:09 our shtick
0:06:10 this whole ordered society thing you can
0:06:13 probably tell just by my general me ness
0:06:16 but
0:06:17 i think you're gonna do a lot better in
0:06:19 this world
0:06:21 but kind of like you i got my start by
0:06:23 just kind of being you know dropped in
0:06:26 the middle of it and seeing who could
0:06:27 survive
0:06:29 dropped you mean you
0:06:31 weren't brought in on purpose
0:06:33 i really don't know i know that i was at
0:06:36 woodstock
0:06:37 and um
0:06:39 i went off
0:06:40 somewhere this guy something rugged
0:06:42 about him he was really enticing and
0:06:44 then
0:06:45 i'll spare you the details
0:06:47 i um would suck
0:06:49 how
0:06:51 old are you
0:06:53 59
0:06:54 but you don't look
0:06:56 you stop looking like you age at the
0:07:00 at the time you were
0:07:01 made
0:07:02 they say embrace because it sounds a lot
0:07:04 nicer than what it actually is it's an
0:07:07 act of predation
0:07:08 so as i am
0:07:11 this monster that i am i'm gonna be
0:07:14 exactly this way
0:07:18 forever
0:07:19 that's up to you
0:07:21 your physical appearance won't change
0:07:23 but you
0:07:24 you still have the capacity to change
0:07:27 you can grow
0:07:29 and if you weren't meant to survive then
0:07:32 you wouldn't have survived
0:07:34 it's not a gentle thing that they do to
0:07:36 make us into these things
0:07:38 but you survived
0:07:41 and i've seen you tonight i saw you
0:07:43 stand up to shaw and you
0:07:45 god damn girl
0:07:47 there's a reason i don't come to court
0:07:49 because i can't hold that sort of poise
0:07:51 that you have
0:07:53 i
0:07:54 i don't know how i
0:07:58 thank you
0:07:58 i
0:08:00 i don't want you
0:08:02 to come in with the same disadvantages
0:08:04 that i have
0:08:05 you needed to know in my opinion and
0:08:07 miles will probably read me the riot act
0:08:09 for it you needed to know what you are
0:08:11 before you can look them in the eye and
0:08:13 know that really at the end of the day
0:08:16 they're not better than you
0:08:17 they think they are they establish these
0:08:19 rules because they think that they have
0:08:21 a right to control you and you got to
0:08:23 play the game when
0:08:25 i met with shaw
0:08:28 look neil seems to like him for whatever
0:08:31 reason but
0:08:34 from the little that i can understand of
0:08:36 accounting and all of this
0:08:39 whatever this is i am
0:08:41 not willing to be
0:08:43 used
0:08:44 i can't remember who i am but i could i
0:08:47 can determine who i will be and
0:08:50 that won't be a part of it
0:08:53 so here's what
0:08:54 you need to know to be able to hold to
0:08:56 that
0:08:57 the accounting means that someone else
0:08:59 until you've proven yourself is
0:09:01 responsible for your successes and your
0:09:03 failures
0:09:04 your successes are their successes your
0:09:07 failures are their failures
0:09:09 taking you under the accounting is a
0:09:11 risk on their part someone like shaw
0:09:13 knows that you've got potential and he
0:09:15 wants those successes that you are going
0:09:17 to accrue
0:09:18 to be his
0:09:20 but he also has the right to say no
0:09:23 she's she's not ready to be part of
0:09:24 society a responsible teacher
0:09:28 isn't going to do that to you and that's
0:09:30 why we're working hard to get you under
0:09:31 the right person
0:09:34 but i'm never going to be
0:09:38 a part of
0:09:41 well i guess i can't really remember
0:09:43 what human society was like but
0:09:47 that perspective is going to need some
0:09:49 adjustment there are some of us who
0:09:51 still manage to maintain some
0:09:53 sense of
0:09:54 humanity
0:09:56 i'm a
0:09:58 i still technically find myself to be
0:10:00 more human but
0:10:03 i
0:10:06 that was never a huge part of my life
0:10:07 even when i was alive
0:10:09 the other world's always held a lot more
0:10:11 appeal for me
0:10:14 we don't have a whole lot of time left
0:10:16 what i want you to remember
0:10:19 monsters aren't all bad
0:10:21 and you can hold your head high
0:10:23 and know that one day you're going to be
0:10:24 able to hang with these folks and you
0:10:26 have value don't mouth off still follow
0:10:29 miles advice because i am not someone
0:10:31 who should be giving social advice but
0:10:33 be proud be strong head high
0:10:37 don't flinch
0:10:38 hey win yeah
0:10:41 thank you for
0:10:43 telling me the truth
0:10:46 someone had to
0:10:49 the door creaks open a little bit hey we
0:10:51 ain't got much time left the prince is
0:10:53 just about to come out wind grabs a
0:10:55 handful of potpourri and starts rubbing
0:10:56 it on her clothes and just drops it on
0:10:58 the floor
0:10:59 yeah i need a minute or two to prep her
0:11:01 before she actually goes out there all
0:11:03 right

0:11:24 of you and right now your ignorance is
0:11:27 your armor no one expects you to know
0:11:30 anything don't try and lie though that's
0:11:32 usually a good policy well just in
0:11:34 general that's like good life advice but
0:11:36 guys like the prince can smell it when
0:11:37 you're lying
0:11:38 i think i'm looking for specific advice
0:11:41 right now right
0:11:43 other than that i'm not sure what's
0:11:44 gonna happen

0:11:56 position

0:11:59 just a refresher and i know miles
0:12:00 already told you but uh it's your grace
0:12:03 yeah and and nothing else
0:12:05 disgrace just your grace
0:12:07 just madrid of new haven his grace opt
0:12:11 in Rowlands
0:12:12 is prepared to begin court for this
0:12:14 evening
0:12:16 everyone please come to your seats
0:12:19 and the kindred began filing
0:12:22 actually now sitting down
0:12:24 there have all that kind of motions for
0:12:25 the group of you to head over and take a
0:12:27 seat way up towards the front so that
0:12:29 all these kinder is sitting behind you
0:12:31 assigned seating front of the class
0:12:34 you're going to do fine find the
0:12:35 strength that you showed with shaw
0:12:37 okay neil kind of gives her a thumbs up
0:12:40 right out looks really bewild i'm bill
0:12:42 bolder at that
0:12:43 so as you head over
0:12:45 and presumably take seats does anyone no
0:12:48 it's okay
0:12:50 sit down making sure that just when i
0:12:53 sit down that british sitting next to
0:12:56 miles so when you sit there's two
0:12:57 sections
0:12:59 and then an aisle right down the middle
0:13:01 in front of all of the seating positions
0:13:04 there is a
0:13:07 rather nice looking chair with tall back
0:13:10 and no other seats beside it
0:13:12 it absolutely gives you the feeling that
0:13:16 you are you have been brought before a
0:13:17 throne
0:13:19 then as the kindred begin to quiet down
0:13:22 to almost completely inaudible whispers
0:13:26 the door opens
0:13:27 and
0:13:28 three individuals come out of the back
0:13:30 room
0:13:31 the first one
0:13:33 you recognize as the nosferatu shaw
0:13:36 the second one
0:13:38 is the
0:13:39 kind of hawk nosed honestly a dweeby
0:13:43 looking individual with the tweed coat
0:13:45 the
0:13:46 seneschal Reiss
0:13:49 he comes out
0:13:50 and then finally as as the third comes
0:13:53 out all the kindred stand up all at once
0:13:56 and his grace often Rowlands enters the
0:13:59 room
0:14:01 probably not as tall
0:14:03 as you expected him to be
0:14:05 and he's a little husky he's got blonde
0:14:08 hair that's cut really like short by the
0:14:11 ears
0:14:12 and uh he actually looks um a little
0:14:15 older probably around
0:14:17 maybe 40 50.
0:14:19 he
0:14:20 does not look your way
0:14:22 he seems almost blissfully unaware that
0:14:25 there are kindred in the room at all and
0:14:27 he simply slaunters over to his throne
0:14:30 he sits down
0:14:33 and he looks
0:14:35 to the cenotrol Reiss
0:14:37 Reiss
0:14:38 clear sister
0:14:41 it has been brought to the attention of
0:14:43 the court that there is an individual
0:14:45 who has been embraced
0:14:48 without
0:14:49 the right of progeny
0:14:52 miles of clan ventrue
0:14:56 can you please bring this individual
0:14:57 forward so that we might see the matter
0:14:59 resolved
0:15:00 uh bully boys please ensure that there
0:15:03 is no
0:15:04 misconduct during this conversation
0:15:07 johnny gives a hard stare at the other
0:15:09 bully boys to like
0:15:11 give him his space
0:15:14 some of the other oily boys
0:15:16 hesitate
0:15:18 but they do head over to this you know

0:15:35 distance and i will make a small battle
0:15:38 okay i miles yes uh i would like a
0:15:43 charisma plus etiquette rule

0:16:15 soup jacket is alright
0:16:18 as you are led to the throne
0:16:21 you find yourself at ease
0:16:24 as
0:16:25 miles demonstrates himself to be a
0:16:29 refined master of protocol as he simply
0:16:32 approaches
0:16:34 bounds and like with this perfect
0:16:36 economy of motion gestures to you and
0:16:39 like the light catches the right way and
0:16:40 you actually kind of feel you feel like
0:16:42 this might work
0:16:44 he's capable he really knows how to
0:16:46 navigate all of this
0:16:48 somehow upton on the other hand gives
0:16:52 kind of
0:16:53 an expressionless look like the kind of
0:16:55 look that that someone gives to uh
0:16:59 a sandwich that they're just
0:17:00 disinterested in
0:17:02 it's you're just kind of there to him
0:17:04 it's awful and and it feels awful
0:17:07 and then he looks to miles and actually
0:17:10 smiles
0:17:11 miles
0:17:12 digress
0:17:14 i understand that you've
0:17:16 had a bit of a difficult evening
0:17:18 nothing unexpected

0:17:58 forthcoming
0:18:00 during this investigation into the
0:18:01 matter you don't even know who your sire
0:18:03 is and why they would make
0:18:05 the
0:18:06 the drastic decision to bring you into
0:18:09 the kindred society
0:18:11 your grace i don't know
0:18:14 why
0:18:15 my sire would have acted in that way
0:18:18 and
0:18:19 i have been as forthcoming as i can i
0:18:23 um your grace i seem to have
0:18:26 lost my memory you seem to they're great
0:18:29 if i may interject yes miles by all
0:18:31 means
0:18:32 like
0:18:33 i believe that
0:18:35 during the process of her embrace
0:18:38 there was an after effect that has
0:18:40 caused
0:18:41 the memory loss that she's
0:18:42 it's currently happening to her central
0:18:44 Reiss heads over to the throne and
0:18:48 very unobtrusively
0:18:50 leans into upton Rowlands
0:18:53 and whispers
0:18:54 so low that only really the two of you
0:18:57 can make out what's being said
0:18:59 and he says
0:19:01 your your grace this is actually
0:19:03 something that can happen and
0:19:05 does take place from time to time
0:19:08 uh
0:19:09 it is
0:19:11 been recommended
0:19:12 i should be given the opportunity to
0:19:16 pursue existence among us
0:19:19 often looks a little surprised by that
0:19:22 and and the the expression on upton is
0:19:25 is almost uh
0:19:26 disappointed
0:19:28 that things aren't going to get as
0:19:30 interesting as perhaps he thought and
0:19:32 again his eyes shift over to Britta
0:19:34 young lady it has been it has been
0:19:36 brought to my attention by the center
0:19:38 stroll of this domain that
0:19:40 uh
0:19:41 you
0:19:43 seek hospitality within this domain
0:19:47 yes your grace
0:19:49 do you understand what that entails
0:19:51 no your grace
0:19:53 allow me to explain to you
0:19:55 as i understand you've had many teachers
0:19:56 this evening
0:19:57 but none such as i
0:20:00 and uh
0:20:01 brother you actually noticed that
0:20:03 virtually no one is impressed by the
0:20:05 prince's
0:20:07 vainglorious claim
0:20:09 uh and like even Reiss kind of just does
0:20:12 this the slightest role of his eyes
0:20:14 often goes on to say the most powerful
0:20:17 influential most dangerous kindred of
0:20:19 any domain
0:20:21 rules as its prince with an iron
0:20:23 fist
0:20:24 you're like old episode
0:20:26 and
0:20:27 any who anger this prince
0:20:30 and earn the prince's aya are destroyed
0:20:34 and only the kindred who have been
0:20:36 granted the right of hospitality
0:20:39 are allowed to exist within the prince's
0:20:42 reach
0:20:44 to be allowed to hunt
0:20:47 and thrive within that prince's domain
0:20:51 you
0:20:52 seek to
0:20:53 [Music]
0:20:55 have a continued unlife
0:20:58 and
0:20:59 intend to be seen as a valuable member
0:21:02 of my domain is that correct
0:21:05 i do your grace
0:21:07 this is what hospitality entails
0:21:09 are you seeking my hospitality child
0:21:13 i am your grace
0:21:14 i see well
0:21:17 normally
0:21:19 you would need to undergo the accounting
0:21:22 be taught the traditions and how to
0:21:25 succeed in a complex society
0:21:29 i'm looking to do such a thing as her
0:21:31 escort tonight
0:21:32 i figured i would continue the process
0:21:34 of her education
0:21:36 and bring her up to speed about kindred
0:21:38 society
0:21:40 miles you are
0:21:43 an individual who has undergone a proper
0:21:46 introduction to kindred society i have
0:21:48 no doubt that you would be capable of
0:21:49 doing this
0:21:51 and i understand you are saying
0:21:53 that you are willing to teach her
0:21:56 but i must know miles
0:21:59 what are you willing to do if she fails
0:22:02 i will take responsibility for that
0:22:04 hmm
0:22:07 i'm ready you will submit
0:22:10 of course your grace his nose kind of
0:22:12 goes up into the air as he
0:22:15 takes his time mulling over whether or
0:22:17 not he wants you to survive the night
0:22:22 miles
0:22:23 grace
0:22:25 i'm going to give you
0:22:27 a responsibility
0:22:29 very well
0:22:31 you are
0:22:33 going to have this kindred under your
0:22:35 accounting
0:22:36 but
0:22:38 her time learning is is going to be
0:22:41 i don't want to say rushed what's the
0:22:43 word what's the word he ponders and like
0:22:46 kind of like looks at Reiss for like
0:22:48 the word
0:22:51 our instruction will be expedited in
0:22:53 your grace
0:22:55 so
0:22:57 you will teach her quickly and uh
0:23:00 while you are teaching her you are going
0:23:01 to assist
0:23:03 the sheriff and sing to a handful of
0:23:05 matters that are brought to our
0:23:06 attention due to the absence
0:23:09 of the gangrel
0:23:10 of course you guys
0:23:12 very good
0:23:13 uh what is the next order of business
0:23:15 who looks to race and Reiss kind of
0:23:16 starts like
0:23:18 gives like a tired expression to the
0:23:19 prince and recaps again the agenda for
0:23:22 the evening
0:23:24 what matters done the prince nods uh you
0:23:26 two um sit uh
0:23:30 thank you
0:23:32 thank you here chris welcome to the
0:23:34 remain of new haven do not fail me
0:23:36 of course your grace very good a little
0:23:38 exit bow before you go
0:23:39 [Laughter]
0:23:44 but there is one thing um
0:23:47 your sire is still at large
0:23:49 and i cannot have you
0:23:52 as a pawn
0:23:53 to this individual especially if you do
0:23:54 know who they are do not know who they
0:23:56 are do you understand
0:23:58 i know nothing of where my sire is your
0:24:00 grace but if you do not understand that
0:24:03 i cannot allow this
0:24:04 i'm afraid we may need to readdress my
0:24:08 decision regarding miles do you
0:24:09 understand that i cannot allow you to be
0:24:11 a spawn yes your grace very good i would
0:24:13 like to please come closer to the throne
0:24:16 Britta walks up have you been taught how
0:24:19 to
0:24:20 reveal your fangs
0:24:22 no your grace ah it has been a moment of
0:24:25 concentration
0:24:26 like stretching your fingers
0:24:28 and he holds out his wrist
0:24:31 seeing this exchange johnny's uh the arm
0:24:33 to giant chair cracks as it splinters a
0:24:36 little bit winds eyes take on a very
0:24:39 predatory glare to them
0:24:41 you're not interested you are swearing
0:24:44 feel to you to my domain and so
0:24:48 you will demonstrate your loyalty
0:24:51 you will drink of my vitae
0:24:53 is there any way i can intercede without
0:24:56 it being
0:24:58 wicked awful
0:24:59 uh
0:25:01 i'm willing to let you think up stuff
0:25:07 okay i need a question how i mean this
0:25:09 is a thing he can demand because he's
0:25:11 offsetting the whole not killing her
0:25:13 kind of deal oh yeah right
0:25:15 um
0:25:15 is there a
0:25:17 but how how unusual is this this is
0:25:20 for the prince to uh force the blood
0:25:22 bond yeah so uh why don't do you have
0:25:24 law i
0:25:26 don't have any law i have politics i
0:25:29 will allow for a politics role on an
0:25:31 increased difficulty okay give me a
0:25:33 intelligence politics difficulty seven
0:25:38 you're only confident in this one uh
0:25:42 one success okay
0:25:44 so with one success you know that a
0:25:47 punishment for
0:25:48 offending elders
0:25:50 and or upsetting the prince or what have
0:25:53 you it can be
0:25:55 the blood bond
0:25:56 even though
0:25:58 she
0:25:59 uh isn't actually the one that did the
0:26:02 embracing right she still is considered
0:26:04 part of the crime okay so instead of
0:26:06 having her destroyed
0:26:08 he is reduced the punishment to a mere
0:26:12 blood bond
0:26:13 okay now as far as multiple steps it's
0:26:16 going to be harder for you to interject
0:26:17 right now
0:26:19 but it may be more possible for you to
0:26:21 prevent additional steps against when
0:26:24 she's no longer like right on the spot
0:26:26 and deciding whether or not she's going
0:26:27 to like yeah i can't make the prince
0:26:29 look bad right now and unfortunately he
0:26:31 moved too fast
0:26:33 i will
0:26:35 keep the same expression pasted on my
0:26:37 face and we will go through this
0:26:39 he holds his hand out his his skin is
0:26:43 very very very pale and now that you're
0:26:46 kind of closer to her him
0:26:48 you can sense that
0:26:50 he probably more than the number of the
0:26:53 kindred in the room actually has a lot
0:26:55 of the telltale signs of
0:26:57 you know being a vampire uh there's no
0:26:59 warmth that comes from him his his
0:27:01 exposed veins are like a little dark his
0:27:04 skin a bit pale but the pronounced veins
0:27:07 catch your attention
0:27:09 britta
0:27:10 attempts to extend her fangs it
0:27:13 takes a couple tries she isn't quite
0:27:16 sure what muscles to pull
0:27:18 but they come out
0:27:20 and
0:27:21 she looks at him
0:27:23 trying to see if he's
0:27:25 at all
0:27:27 willing to give but
0:27:30 she's not willing to hesitate to be seen
0:27:32 as hesitating to follow
0:27:35 his demand
0:27:37 well he seems to have he's all in
0:27:41 he uh he he simply waits
0:27:44 for you to drink
0:27:45 what do you do
0:27:47 it may be that the talk in the bathroom
0:27:49 echoes through Britta's mind
0:27:52 and wins words of for now
0:27:54 you just have to survive
0:27:57 british stars had the veins in his arms
0:27:59 and the absence of uh
0:28:02 color
0:28:03 that lack of humanity
0:28:06 she slowly
0:28:08 puts her hand on his forearm and leans
0:28:11 down
0:28:12 to take a drink
0:28:14 when you drink from him you were
0:28:15 reminded
0:28:17 of
0:28:18 the way blood tasted in your mouth after
0:28:22 that poor soul you found in the alley
0:28:24 and
0:28:25 that blood
0:28:26 does not compare to this
0:28:29 this is it is is rich
0:28:32 it is filled with nuanced tastes that
0:28:36 just feel invigorating to experience
0:28:39 and you find that you want more
0:28:43 and
0:28:44 whatever opinions you may have had of
0:28:46 the prince
0:28:48 by the time his wrist is pulling back
0:28:51 and he has decided you have had enough
0:28:54 your feelings towards him
0:28:57 begin to shift
0:28:59 until you do admittedly find him to be
0:29:02 more favorable in your eyes
0:29:05 he let me live
0:29:07 he didn't have to do that
0:29:09 he sits back
0:29:11 and
0:29:12 while the rest of your quarters looking
0:29:14 in and like some in horror some some
0:29:16 stern
0:29:17 he seems to have already moved on and
0:29:18 he's kind of a ways for the two you head
0:29:21 on your way small bow and i will lead
0:29:23 you back thank you miles
0:29:25 hand you a little handkerchief
0:29:27 she takes the handkerchief and
0:29:30 licks her lips before trying to get rid
0:29:32 of the residue of the blood and she
0:29:35 mimics his bow and follows him back
0:29:37 as you begin to head off the center
0:29:38 shell approaches and holds out his hand
0:29:41 for the handkerchief i'll take care of
0:29:42 that she hands over the handkerchief
0:29:45 thank you
0:29:46 he tucks that away and heads back to go
0:29:48 stand next to
0:29:50 the prince
0:29:51 and
0:29:53 that is when his grace turns his
0:29:55 attention
0:29:56 to win
0:30:00 when
0:30:02 the Gangrel primogen has decided that it
0:30:04 will be you who explains to us the
0:30:06 situation regarding your clan and
0:30:09 their lack of presence amongst the
0:30:11 camarilla today why is this happening

0:30:16 win is
0:30:17 visibly trying not to look directly
0:30:20 pissed off um

0:30:42 etiquette oh boy

0:30:46 willpower for an auto success
0:30:49 they ain't worth your will power
0:30:51 oh no this is exactly what is worth my
0:30:53 willpower
0:30:56 i feel like johnny might not be here to
0:30:58 help you
0:30:59 in this moment
0:31:00 hey seven and ten don't worry i'll take
0:31:02 this two successes three successes uh
0:31:05 i'll take the heat off you okay
0:31:08 you approach
0:31:10 you seem composed or they stay
0:31:12 everyone's reacting to you like you're
0:31:14 composed
0:31:15 inside win is just just tearing the room
0:31:19 apart
0:31:20 we need to see the understanding of this
0:31:22 court that xavier
0:31:24 former gangrel justicar
0:31:27 has
0:31:30 stepped away from the camarilla and has
0:31:32 taken
0:31:34 numerous members of your clan with him
0:31:36 what
0:31:38 what
0:31:39 why why would why would he leave the
0:31:40 camarilla exactly
0:31:42 i believe he has issued a statement
0:31:45 from the justicariat your grace
0:31:48 what is that statement statement is i am
0:31:50 leaving
0:31:52 any of my clan who wish to join me are
0:31:54 welcome
0:31:57 he gave a much longer explanation
0:31:59 where is raven
0:32:01 she has gone
0:32:02 on her way
0:32:05 raven has debts that have not yet been
0:32:07 settled
0:32:10 raven's simply leaving the domain to do
0:32:14 whatever it is that you gangrel do
0:32:17 is honestly wins eyes again predatory
0:32:20 glare that seems to flash and be gone
0:32:23 she's gonna spend her evenings in
0:32:24 backyards there's work to be done
0:32:27 it is my expectation that she will be
0:32:30 found and there will be
0:32:32 a proper explanation for for why this is
0:32:35 happening
0:32:35 your grace
0:32:37 i believe she has named rusty
0:32:40 as our permign
0:32:42 perhaps your questions should be
0:32:43 directed at him
0:32:45 rusty has the fertile inquiries to you
0:32:47 of course your grace
0:32:49 there's like
0:32:51 muffled laughter coming from among the
0:32:54 corn as everyone kind of
0:32:55 seems to take great pleasure
0:32:58 in
0:32:59 in the situation regarding the Gangrel
0:33:01 when
0:33:03 i understand
0:33:05 your situation
0:33:06 i too have had to
0:33:09 bear the weight of leadership on my
0:33:10 shoulders when when others are not
0:33:12 prepared for the task
0:33:16 but you must see to it that the Gangrel
0:33:18 will continue to
0:33:20 provide for the domain with whatever it
0:33:22 is that they did and
0:33:25 the gangrel will perform as they always
0:33:28 have your grace
0:33:30 very very good um
0:33:32 and new and uh good
0:33:36 will that be all your grace that is all
0:33:39 for now if i have any further inquiries
0:33:41 regarding this matter i will be sending
0:33:43 senator Reiss
0:33:45 i'm probably gonna need a self-control
0:33:47 check
0:33:51 again
0:33:52 auto success
0:33:56 bringing when the court is rough yeah
0:33:58 it's like she's been saying this whole
0:34:01 time
0:34:05 uh three successes
0:34:06 there is a pregnant pause
0:34:10 as the bully boys
0:34:12 kind of size you up figuring about
0:34:14 whether or not this entire discussion is
0:34:16 about to go way south
0:34:18 but then everything seems okay
0:34:21 and everyone becomes at ease the
0:34:23 whispers among the
0:34:25 gossips and the harpies
0:34:28 that seems to die right down at this
0:34:30 point
0:34:34 yes well that's very good i'll send
0:34:35 Reiss when he's needed he might need to
0:34:37 call first your grace
0:34:40 gangrel don't use phones i'll summon you
0:34:42 to me be on your way
0:34:45 win

0:34:51 how tight her muscles are

0:37:28 and she kicks the door open not to break

0:37:32 but she has got to unleash her muscle

0:38:08 sort of hurdle one yeah that's you made

0:38:15 hospitality
0:38:17 and you're under uh miles is accounting
0:38:19 yeah that [ __ ] made you blood
0:38:21 bond to him
0:38:22 well me what hey you guys explain it
0:38:25 while i get her out of your shot because
0:38:27 i feel like am i reading you right when
0:38:30 this is not gonna let's go beat up a
0:38:32 dumpster kindred blood we're gonna go
0:38:33 beat up a dumpster neal
0:38:35 well you will i don't wanna hurt my
0:38:36 hands kendra is addictive
0:38:38 it's like
0:38:39 really addictive
0:38:41 you guys are coming back soon right yes
0:38:43 she's gonna go punch a dumpster and then
0:38:44 we're gonna come right back in i'm gonna
0:38:46 go punch a dumpster so they don't end up
0:38:48 executing something don't worry it's not
0:38:49 gonna cause a freak out like johnny
0:38:52 punch and dumpsters don't but that's not
0:38:53 against what the prince said right no
0:38:56 stepping out on the curb for a smoke
0:38:58 neil makes air quotes it's fine yeah
0:39:01 it's that's fine we're not leaving the
0:39:03 party okay you did good get
0:39:06 bolts out the door neil sort of like
0:39:08 shuffle like hustles after
0:39:10 we you might as well start experiencing
0:39:12 some of this but yes the blood bond is
0:39:15 addictive and can change your emotional
0:39:18 state to the person that bonded you
0:39:20 blood bond
0:39:21 it means drinking the blood of a kindred
0:39:24 that's not usually part of getting
0:39:27 hospitality correct it's usually
0:39:30 a formality
0:39:31 something you show up it is necessary
0:39:34 but usually it's almost
0:39:36 rubber stamped your case was unusual but
0:39:39 his
0:39:40 reaction was also not
0:39:42 normal well but he let me live isn't
0:39:46 that worth something maybe he has
0:39:49 to a certain degree yes
0:39:52 but some of these things look the point
0:39:54 is
0:39:56 with a blood bond
0:39:58 it's
0:40:00 it's like he's the drug dealer he's the
0:40:02 drug supplier and he just got you the
0:40:05 first taste
0:40:07 and he's gonna do everything he can to
0:40:09 get you hooked
0:40:10 and then
0:40:12 you're one of his pawns the important
0:40:14 note is three times is when it becomes
0:40:18 essentially permanent
0:40:20 and you become very much under his
0:40:22 control and we will do everything in our
0:40:23 effort to prevent
0:40:25 the next two times he
0:40:28 surprised us
0:40:30 when does it get out of my system that's
0:40:32 a great question
0:40:34 time i don't know if it ever does
0:40:36 time can lessen it how much time depends
0:40:39 on the individual
0:40:41 yes me just don't just make sure you
0:40:42 never let it happen again
0:40:45 let it happen johnny i don't what would
0:40:47 have happened if i didn't
0:40:49 there wasn't a good way to get you out
0:40:51 of that otherwise i would have
0:40:54 johnny makes kind of a frowny face
0:40:58 any of us would have
0:40:59 did i have
0:41:00 a choice there i just wanted to live
0:41:03 really
0:41:04 you did have a choice but the choice was
0:41:06 to die but the blood
0:41:08 it
0:41:09 was
0:41:10 better than
0:41:12 when i
0:41:13 that's the addictive part
0:41:16 oh
0:41:17 you really think you would try to get me
0:41:20 it's best to discuss this somewhere else
0:41:23 in detail
0:41:25 yeah he absolutely would these old
0:41:28 vampires do whatever the [ __ ] they want
0:41:31 he gives a nasty stare around the room
0:41:33 you're not helping
0:41:37 [Music]
0:41:40 when is outside just laying into the
0:41:43 dumpster
0:41:44 just this is good you gotta really work
0:41:46 everything out here okay he made her
0:41:48 asleep yeah well okay
0:41:51 we're gonna work on that just lower your
0:41:52 tone okay you're like a red purple i
0:41:56 need you to dial back to a vermillion
0:42:02 wind continues laying into the dumpster
0:42:04 i get it
0:42:06 okay
0:42:07 you think i don't have empathy you don't
0:42:09 think i have compassion here i get it i
0:42:11 know you do but it's better than the
0:42:13 alternative i know
0:42:17 there was nothing i could do
0:42:19 you did a lot
0:42:20 okay
0:42:22 you did a lot and he's sending that did
0:42:24 a lot okay and he's sending that trash
0:42:27 to my home he's not gonna show up at
0:42:30 your home he's not an idiot
0:42:32 okay
0:42:33 and look i don't know what you see
0:42:36 with Reiss i don't know
0:42:39 clearly we don't see the same things
0:42:40 when we look at him
0:42:42 in every sense of the word okay but it's
0:42:45 okay
0:42:46 all right you don't have to answer
0:42:48 nothing you don't have to talk to us
0:42:50 about it we're here if you want to talk
0:42:52 about it okay
0:42:53 right now
0:42:54 we need to get through to midnight wait
0:42:56 until the ball drops because that's what
0:42:58 the prince wants
0:42:59 so
0:43:00 hit that [ __ ] until your knuckles bleed
0:43:02 all right you can punch me around if you
0:43:04 really want to oh no
0:43:05 i'm just saying
0:43:08 you're a red purple and you need to be a
0:43:10 vermillion
0:43:16 okay
0:43:18 i should have gone you should have gone
0:43:20 gone what no no okay look i mean
0:43:24 you want to i'm glad you didn't leave
0:43:27 okay
0:43:29 i'm glad you didn't
0:43:33 because you know who would have had to
0:43:34 answer those questions if you weren't
0:43:36 here
0:43:37 you're
0:43:38 friends and you know who wouldn't be
0:43:40 around
0:43:42 you
0:43:43 and you know who wouldn't be alive right
0:43:45 now if you had gone
0:43:47 britta
0:43:49 okay
0:43:51 don't pretend like you're not a link in
0:43:52 the chain here like a like a linchpin
0:43:54 keeping everybody together
0:43:56 okay
0:43:58 i'm quiet and i look and i listen and i
0:44:00 see the effect that you have on me
0:44:03 and miles
0:44:04 and johnny
0:44:05 and i clearly see the effect you had on
0:44:07 that girl you walked into that bathroom
0:44:08 she was a ball of nerves and i don't
0:44:10 know what you said because i'm
0:44:11 discreet
0:44:13 gwen lets out a small chuckle through
0:44:15 her nostrils
0:44:17 but whatever happened in there
0:44:20 she walked back out ready to talk to the
0:44:22 prince and not a damn thing that me or
0:44:24 johnny or miles said helped
0:44:27 okay
0:44:28 not in the same way
0:44:31 so you want to take it out on somebody
0:44:33 i mean we got strings to pull
0:44:37 but i'm glad that we're not going to be
0:44:38 pulling those strings without you
0:44:40 because if you had walked away it would
0:44:42 have just been me
0:44:43 and johnny and miles
0:44:46 and me and miles try and restrain johnny
0:44:50 and that was not gonna go that would
0:44:52 have gone really that would have gone
0:44:54 really bad
0:44:55 okay
0:44:57 are you okay let's go back inside we
0:44:58 should go back inside go back inside
0:45:00 [Music]
0:45:06 so we have a couple things to do before
0:45:07 we leave tonight so you might as well
0:45:09 experience it we need to go find
0:45:12 arabella Rowlands
0:45:13 and
0:45:15 tally up all those boons that we were
0:45:18 dispending and creating for johnny if
0:45:20 you want to come witness this too we
0:45:22 need to go
0:45:23 establish that major boon to weathers
0:45:25 wait
0:45:26 Rowlands like
0:45:29 of the same line yes sometimes these
0:45:32 vampires change their name after the
0:45:34 fact
0:45:35 a lot to do it's easier to beat sorry
0:45:39 did i offend you
0:45:40 no
0:45:41 it's an explanation arabella owens is
0:45:43 the harpy of the court and she tracks
0:45:45 these boons so you must
0:45:48 uh go to them for accounting
0:45:51 what's a harpy a harpy is a position of
0:45:54 the court um
0:45:56 that you arrive back in after yeah walk
0:45:59 back in your
0:46:00 knuckles are probably a little yeah her
0:46:02 knuckles are nice and vermillion
0:46:04 um
0:46:06 when
0:46:06 uh
0:46:07 neil when walks in a harpy it's an
0:46:10 accountant
0:46:12 i mean there's more to it but like a
0:46:14 social accountant accountant like
0:46:16 accounting or
0:46:19 no yes and no
0:46:20 accountant like keeps track of
0:46:23 stats boons
0:46:25 debts
0:46:26 social debts
0:46:28 so of all the things that you will
0:46:29 witness to it tonight we need to go
0:46:32 give that information to the hobby
0:46:35 all right
0:46:36 let's move on over there it should be
0:46:38 rather quick
0:46:39 i mean you're the one who's got the pole
0:46:40 with herself right and you guys can
0:46:42 stand nearby if you would like thanks
0:46:44 buddy no problem
0:46:45 so
0:46:47 arabella
0:46:49 has a glass in her hand and she is
0:46:52 relaxed leaning against a balcony that
0:46:54 overlooks the elysium
0:46:57 and
0:46:58 she seems to be having a little bit of a
0:47:01 discussion
0:47:02 uh with
0:47:03 the young man that you had seen earlier
0:47:06 in the evening romeo
0:47:07 again he's got like a neat sharp haircut
0:47:11 dark skin
0:47:12 he's very like
0:47:14 dapperly put together
0:47:16 and the two of them seem to be flirting
0:47:20 back and forth
0:47:21 what they're actually discussing is
0:47:23 unclear
0:47:25 we'll stand
0:47:27 just out of a
0:47:28 polite earshot
0:47:30 as miles approaches
0:47:33 arabella kind of dismisses romeo very
0:47:36 quickly and he seems to say some some
0:47:40 witty quippy comment to her and kind of
0:47:42 gives like the sly half smirk but then
0:47:45 he's on his way and she takes a moment
0:47:47 to compose herself and
0:47:49 gestures for the group of you to join
0:47:51 her for a conversation
0:47:53 arabella
0:47:54 miles
0:47:55 we're here for
0:47:57 business yes of course what is this
0:47:59 business a couple of the balloons were
0:48:00 traded tonight
0:48:03 well let's hear it
0:48:04 uh weathers traded his major
0:48:07 for to elsa
0:48:09 so he cashed in on it yes
0:48:11 or
0:48:13 so that is owed to
0:48:16 the sheriff has been repaid correct very
0:48:18 good and uh i know oh a major boon to
0:48:23 mr weathers understood
0:48:26 very good uh i should
0:48:28 inform you that there seems to be a
0:48:31 number of rumors going around regarding
0:48:34 some phone call and
0:48:36 involvement with the mysterious gemini
0:48:39 league have you heard anything about
0:48:40 this i've heard nothing about gemini
0:48:42 league no
0:48:44 well enjoy your evening thank you
0:48:46 the girl is being documented as having
0:48:48 hospitality correct at this time she is
0:48:50 tolerated
0:48:52 now once she is formally recognized as a
0:48:54 member of kindred society then she will
0:48:57 enjoy all that hospitality has to offer
0:49:00 until then
0:49:01 person she says not even like
0:49:04 truly acknowledging the presence of
0:49:07 brutal
0:49:09 and the crime she commits is a crime
0:49:11 committed by miles
0:49:13 uh miles has
0:49:16 a bit of a reputation amongst the domain
0:49:18 for
0:49:19 for being
0:49:20 an intellectually savvy individual and
0:49:23 it would be a terrible shame
0:49:26 if this um
0:49:28 sad case of heroism were to be what
0:49:30 brought him low i'm sure there will be
0:49:32 no shame in this case
0:49:34 i'm willing to better mind everyone for
0:49:36 that
0:49:38 i see
0:49:39 neil chuckles there are no visitors to
0:49:41 the hobby they don't end in some sort of
0:49:42 entertainment
0:49:44 that's true miles
0:49:46 what have you defeated hmm
0:49:49 one minor wound sure let's do it okay
0:49:52 i will record
0:49:54 this game as well
0:49:57 with that said um
0:49:59 i wish you well
0:50:02 and then that is when you hear the
0:50:04 sounds of this uproar
0:50:08 among the kindred as they all begin to
0:50:10 celebrate the new year and they're
0:50:11 kindred kissing each other and
0:50:14 uh everyone seems to be having just this
0:50:17 this raucous have a good time that's the
0:50:19 bell i think we can go now i think a
0:50:22 happy new year all around is welcome i
0:50:24 mean yeah happy 1999 everybody yeah we
0:50:28 have successfully
0:50:30 made it through this night we can

0:50:40 i
0:50:41 would love to go for a walk we can just
0:50:44 leave now yes there's nothing more that
0:50:48 i can not tonight i would rather not
0:50:51 walk
0:50:52 well you want to piggyback right let's
0:50:54 actually go somewhere where we can
0:50:55 actually celebrate the new year there's
0:50:57 plenty of bars in new haven

0:51:16 i
0:51:18 can't believe i made it i
0:51:21 i don't even think i've really realized
0:51:23 that
0:51:25 it happened
0:51:28 self-actualization starts now kiddo
0:51:30 hey yeah
0:51:32 happy new year britta
0:51:34 happy
0:51:35 new year

0:51:38 cigarettes pops one out welcome to the
0:51:40 Coterie and what's that she takes one us
0:51:46 a
0:51:48 formalized group of individuals that

0:52:10 miles has an agenda i think that trumps
0:52:12 it yeah we need to a go to a place where
0:52:15 we can discuss all these things openly
0:52:17 which discounts being around mortals as
0:52:19 this conversation kind of progresses out
0:52:21 the bill yeah yeah he holds the door
0:52:23 open and why don't we down to the street
0:52:25 back to my place
0:52:27 it has everything that we need and also
0:52:29 privacy miles this place is nicer than
0:52:31 the rest of our places probably nicer
0:52:33 than my place it's pretty sure nicer
0:52:35 than your place okay that's a mask
0:52:38 sorry you guys headed to

0:55:27 scuffing the midnight blue
0:55:31 okay so first i'm going to need a quick
0:55:34 perception plus alertness
0:55:37 okay
0:55:44 fifth
0:55:46 the difficulty of this role is eight
0:55:49 one success okay with one success
0:55:53 you notice that there is
0:55:56 at least one suv that is following you
0:56:00 as you begin driving around
0:56:03 is it a known suv or is it this is like
0:56:07 a black suv yep
0:56:10 with tinted windows
0:56:13 a very plain looking individual behind
0:56:15 the wheel
0:56:17 and they are being rather nonchalant
0:56:19 about their approach
0:56:21 my domain is registered so i'm a little
0:56:24 i'm not terribly worried about that but
0:56:28 we'll see what happens we'll keep moving
0:56:30 forward and keep an eye on it okay um
0:56:32 quick question do three of you have a
0:56:34 cell phone at all i have a pager pager
0:56:37 pager
0:56:38 uh i can't remember if you bought me one
0:56:40 or not i'm pretty sure both win and i
0:56:42 definitely break oh you guys definitely
0:56:44 don't so they they just give up to be
0:56:45 fair the nokia is a phone at this time
0:56:47 so god
0:56:49 unless you bought me one i don't have um
0:56:52 i legitimately can't remember if you
0:56:53 bought me one or not let's see yes
0:56:55 because that is a very minor expenditure
0:56:56 of resources
0:56:58 for you
0:57:01 uh and he's part of my family plan
0:57:05 i get nice weekends minutes
0:57:08 uh and i will call up neil
0:57:11 hey bud
0:57:12 yes i seem to have somebody it's miles
0:57:16 hi miles behind me when says hi as soon
0:57:19 as you're done saying that i need a dex
0:57:22 plus drive roll as well you're pulling
0:57:24 up to a red light and there's just
0:57:26 traffic racing in front because everyone
0:57:28 drives like [ __ ] yep um the suv
0:57:30 pulls up behind you and simply doesn't
0:57:32 stop
0:57:33 oh do i have time to spend blood
0:57:36 yes okay
0:57:38 let's do so you could spend one two
0:57:40 around three three oh
0:57:43 you and your fancy generation
0:57:45 difficulty
0:57:48 the difficulty for this roll is seven
0:57:51 okay
0:57:52 actually no you've got like a crazy
0:57:55 sports car right
0:57:57 all right cool i'm gonna drop you down
0:57:58 to difficulty six
0:58:00 two the suv slams into the back of your
0:58:04 car
0:58:05 and your car does not weigh very much so
0:58:08 it just continues right on into traffic
0:58:11 and as traffic is heading towards you
0:58:13 people are trying to swerve out of the
0:58:15 way and you manage to right the car in
0:58:18 such a way that people are more easily
0:58:19 able to get around you and you manage to
0:58:21 avoid
0:58:22 being clipped by this huge truck rolling
0:58:25 back
0:58:26 great miles what was that i didn't catch
