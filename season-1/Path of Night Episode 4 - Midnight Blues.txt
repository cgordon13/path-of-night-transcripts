0:00:00 path of night is an actual play vampire
0:00:02 the masquerade podcast set in the
0:00:04 classic world of darkness
0:00:06 we're all friends we're here to have fun
0:00:08 but our story can include graphic
0:00:10 violence drug use sexual content and
0:00:13 other mature themes we've talked at our
0:00:15 table about safety comfort and consent
0:00:17 both as players and storytellers we know
0:00:20 what to expect we're all excited to be
0:00:22 here and we want you to feel the same so
0:00:24 listener discretion is advised
0:00:27 now
0:00:28 let's walk the path of night
0:00:30 last time on path of night wind pulled
0:00:33 Britta aside and in black and white
0:00:35 detail explained just what becoming
0:00:37 kindred means for the backing of the
0:00:39 power players on the premises council
0:00:41 miles made his case before prince upton
0:00:43 Rowlands to allow Britta to continue her
0:00:46 own life under his accounting Britta
0:00:47 managed to weather her first night as a
0:00:49 kindred in elysium though not without
0:00:51 being blood bound to the prince wynn was
0:00:53 questioned by the prince about the
0:00:55 recent mass exodus of her clan from the
0:00:57 camera alone and then the quarters
0:00:58 celebrated surviving to the new year and
0:01:00 headed to miles's haven to continue by
0:01:02 his education miles and britta drive off
0:01:05 miles notices an ominous black suv
0:01:07 tailing the two of them just before it
0:01:09 deliberately slams into the midnight
0:01:11 blue ferrari shoving it into a deadly
0:01:13 intersection
0:01:15 miles and britta if two of you are
0:01:16 entering combat right now i need 1d10
0:01:19 adding the total of your dexterity and
0:01:21 wits
0:01:22 Britta you have to decide how much
0:01:24 celerity if any you are using on this
0:01:26 round for every point of Celerity that
0:01:28 you don't use
0:01:30 your initiative will be considered one
0:01:32 higher
0:01:33 i will not use Celerity go ahead and
0:01:35 roll and give me your totals miles what
0:01:37 do you have 13. bretta 17. Britta is
0:01:40 going to go first followed by the
0:01:43 attackers in the suv and then miles
0:01:47 there's a loud crash and you can hear
0:01:50 the sounds of
0:01:52 metal and glass crunching under the
0:01:54 weight of the vehicle
0:01:55 and you're jostled forward there are
0:01:58 lights whizzing past you as various cars
0:02:01 kind of drive by making loud swerving
0:02:03 noises miles do you have anything in the
0:02:06 car uh
0:02:07 something to fight back with or
0:02:09 under your seat grab with your left hand
0:02:12 there should be a pistol
0:02:14 i bend down and reach around looking for
0:02:17 something that seems like a gun it's
0:02:18 attached to the bottom of the seat
0:02:19 you're just underneath and you find a
0:02:22 holster that is like specifically
0:02:24 screwed into the bottom of the seat and
0:02:26 with a click you pull out what looks to
0:02:28 be some sort of like a glock a light
0:02:30 pistol
0:02:31 i can't remember holding a gun before
0:02:33 but
0:02:34 i pretty automatically turn the safety
0:02:36 off without thinking you drop the mag
0:02:39 slightly out snap it shut and then turn
0:02:42 the safety off
0:02:43 and you're ready to go miles what are
0:02:46 you doing just kidding the uh guys
0:02:52 why is everyone somewhat fascinating
0:02:54 the two individuals that are in the suv
0:02:56 the passenger drawer and the driver side
0:02:58 door both open you can hear the ding
0:03:00 ding ding ding ding coming from inside
0:03:02 of it and you're bang as two guns are
0:03:05 opened up on the two of you one of them
0:03:07 gives this loud thundering boom and uh
0:03:10 miles actually Britta too you recognize
0:03:13 the unmistakable sound of a shotgun
0:03:14 great i love shotguns
0:03:17 they like you too you're spending a
0:03:19 point of willpower for an additional
0:03:20 greatest success against miles sure
0:03:24 miles has four successes to hit you um
0:03:27 i'm soaking it so what is that this is
0:03:28 this is ferrari getting any cover the
0:03:30 ferrari no it's ferrari
0:03:32 hey man that's worth asking i appreciate
0:03:34 it um
0:03:36 so what is that just straight stamina
0:03:40 stamina fortitude and your body armor
0:03:43 that you have
0:03:44 you're probably not wearing body armor
0:03:45 because you just left deal easy but you
0:03:48 do have your fortitude and stamina yep
0:03:51 four soak
0:03:53 with four successes you resist all of
0:03:56 the damage put out by the shotgun as the
0:03:59 jacket that you wore to the elysium is
0:04:02 shredded by the shotgun fire the other
0:04:04 one opens up with a heavy pistol loud
0:04:07 bangs as shots are fired towards Britta
0:04:11 britta they have four successes to hit
0:04:13 you i need a stamina check
0:04:17 difficulty six one six you're one
0:04:20 success and you can feel this round
0:04:23 puncture your skin maybe it's the
0:04:25 adrenaline
0:04:27 but it doesn't seem to be
0:04:29 as much of a terrible experience as you
0:04:31 probably would have imagined before
0:04:33 being shot because of your your kindred
0:04:36 nature it's four successes on damage
0:04:39 versus your one and that means three
0:04:40 levels of damage carry over because you
0:04:43 are a vampire all of the damage is
0:04:45 converted into bashing damage also
0:04:47 because you're a vampire all of your
0:04:49 bashing damage is
0:04:51 halved rounded down instead of three
0:04:53 levels of bastion damage it will take
0:04:55 one
0:04:56 what the
0:04:57 it
0:04:58 it doesn't look like it's bleeding yeah
0:05:00 that's not gonna do that unless you
0:05:01 wanted to why would i
0:05:03 we're getting out of here miles quick
0:05:05 look around you see two individuals
0:05:07 walking around they're dressed in like
0:05:10 stereotypical hitman black suits they're
0:05:13 wearing sunglasses at night both of them
0:05:16 are balding or bald and they just kind
0:05:19 of creep around determined to kill the
0:05:22 two of you
0:05:23 uh i think it is time to hit the gas
0:05:25 pedal as hard as i can and get the [ __ ]
0:05:27 out of here that's way too much
0:05:28 firepower okay you kind of like step on
0:05:30 the gas
0:05:31 roll one d10 okay
0:05:34 and nine you hit on the gas and at first
0:05:37 you start to it starts to feel like
0:05:38 you're having a little bit of mechanical
0:05:40 trouble but after a couple of revs give
0:05:42 me a decimal strike check difficulty of
0:05:43 rule is going to be eat and drop to
0:05:45 seven because this is sports go
0:05:48 single success
0:05:50 six would have been great six would have
0:05:52 been fantastic
0:05:54 with one success you swerve into the
0:05:58 oncoming traffic and manage to write
0:06:00 yourself and cross the street keep your
0:06:02 head down and take shots where you can
0:06:04 what the hell are these guys here for
0:06:06 most likely me
0:06:07 too you go you can kind of hear the
0:06:08 sounds of what seems to be like a
0:06:10 muffler dragging your midnight blue car
0:06:13 isn't doing so great right now go go go
0:06:15 go go
0:06:17 are you still on your phone call yeah

0:07:00 and the difficulty is seven
0:07:03 two successes did you ever bear us get
0:07:05 it ramirez
0:07:06 ramirez puts the pedal to the metal and

0:07:59 goes past it and so far so good
0:08:03 wind sticks her head out the back window
0:08:05 was i need a perception of this
0:08:07 alertness check
0:08:09 uh that'll be three successes with three
0:08:11 successes you
0:08:13 check the rear view mirror at a certain
0:08:15 point and you can see the suv following
0:08:18 again they mounted up quick oh yeah they
0:08:19 were getting out of the car and shooting
0:08:21 at you and they got back in the car now
0:08:23 let's see if they can keep up and
0:08:24 hopefully maybe this thing will hold
0:08:25 together
0:08:26 hurt my car okay so uh we're gonna go
0:08:28 into the next round of combat Britta
0:08:31 europe first again what do you want to
0:08:32 do i'm gonna try to shoot back probably
0:08:34 turn around try to use the seat as what
0:08:37 little cover i can it's this like really
0:08:39 little ergonomic seat that you're
0:08:42 ducked down in and uh see that fighting
0:08:44 back celebrity i knew she was a bruja
0:08:48 why don't you give me a dexless firearms
0:08:50 check
0:08:52 two successes
0:08:54 the suv swerves as like a spider web
0:08:58 kind of appears across the windshield
0:09:00 but they manage to stay on course [ __ ]
0:09:02 uh should i aim for the tires or the
0:09:04 people what affects
0:09:07 as the us starts to close the distance
0:09:09 between the two of you miles
0:09:11 what do these look like what the suvs
0:09:13 the people so first off does that class
0:09:15 look armored or whatever it is not
0:09:17 really not really okay did i get the
0:09:18 impression that these were
0:09:20 ghouls or anything or just normal people
0:09:22 in this one do i have no impression
0:09:23 right now you notice what i've described
0:09:25 cool that said
0:09:27 miles
0:09:28 you're stricken blind
0:09:31 what you feel the power of dark magics
0:09:34 and develop you and
0:09:36 experience the presence of duat and when
0:09:39 this happens you go blind
0:09:42 you may spend a point of willpower to
0:09:43 resist this effect and must do so every
0:09:45 round or be blinded like permanently
0:09:48 you're not sure oh good good neil ask
0:09:51 him what's what's attacking him what
0:09:53 does he see
0:09:54 i'm just putting that point at willpower
0:09:55 miles uh uh what what what do you got
0:09:57 eyes on man not much they've used
0:09:59 something on me i don't know i can't i'm

0:10:20 difficulty for this rule of seven as i'm
0:10:23 doing this vampire is kind of a fight or
0:10:26 flight reflex still you should be able
0:10:28 to
0:10:28 tap into something and use that utilize
0:10:31 that to make yourself stronger and
0:10:32 faster and such this would be a good
0:10:34 time
0:10:36 you're on the job training
0:10:39 that'll be
0:10:40 four successes four successes you take a
0:10:43 tight corner the suv is having some
0:10:45 trouble keeping up with the agility of
0:10:48 your ridiculous midnight blue sports car
0:10:50 i'm uh i'm keeping this up but i don't
0:10:52 know how long i'm going to retain my
0:10:53 vision for well should i start driving

0:11:40 head towards some sort of landmark so we
0:11:43 can meet you what what am i heading
0:11:45 towards like right now i'm kind of
0:11:46 dodging is there any of this familiar at
0:11:48 this point you look around give me a
0:11:50 whisper street wise check oh boy what's
0:11:52 the negative on not having talents
0:11:54 talents yeah talent is no penalty if
0:11:56 it's a skill let's plus one okay
0:11:58 one success okay is he by the dixwell
0:12:00 fire station you've just gone past the
0:12:03 papa john's
0:12:06 i needed a roll for that you're not even
0:12:08 sure what a papa john's is ventrue
0:12:12 99 that's like brand new isn't it yeah i
0:12:15 passed by some sort of restaurant uh
0:12:17 papa john's or some such oh that's not a
0:12:19 pizza i don't know if that's a just
0:12:21 [ __ ] all
0:12:22 right papa john's all right
0:12:25 that is a really bad idea guys what are
0:12:27 you near that
0:12:28 yeah Britta wants to know what we're near
0:12:30 put her on speaker yeah i kind of mess
0:12:32 around with the phone a little bit
0:12:34 hangs up here a lot of ketones
0:12:37 your action i'm going to
0:12:39 try to shoot out the tire behind me and
0:12:43 i'm not sure if bretta will be
0:12:44 successful but she'll attempt with that
0:12:46 very vague description to
0:12:48 access topic or to uh to double action
0:12:52 oh all right i don't know that she
0:12:54 understands how to do that though just
0:12:56 letting you decide on that one the
0:12:57 second she's giving it a try even even
0:13:00 thinking about it she can feel blood
0:13:03 pulsate from her heart and everything
0:13:06 around her seems to slow down just a bit
0:13:09 she becomes more precise and much much
0:13:12 much faster so this round you'll be
0:13:15 taking how many additional actions only
0:13:17 one just one sounds good
0:13:21 difficulty so this is a called shot i'm
0:13:24 calling your difficulty eat no success
0:13:26 jack goes wide the suv you can hear its
0:13:29 engine roar again as the suv starts to
0:13:32 draw close again this time the passenger
0:13:34 windows you can see someone starting to
0:13:36 lean out of it they fire something at
0:13:39 the two of you it has a bright flash of
0:13:41 light as a flare gets sent towards the
0:13:44 car
0:13:45 this bounces off of the car pretty
0:13:47 easily however i need a courage test
0:13:50 from the both of you the difficulty of
0:13:51 this courage rule is diff six
0:13:56 three successes one success all right
0:13:59 you feel your beast rattle at its cage
0:14:01 inside of you desperately demanding that
0:14:03 you flee but you
0:14:05 suppress it and maintain control of
0:14:07 yourself because i prepped her with a
0:14:08 lighter before
0:14:10 miles you must be over on dick's well or
0:14:11 something
0:14:12 take a left head towards uh you know

0:14:42 i'm going to relax my hearing a little
0:14:44 bit and try and put a listen out for the
0:14:47 sound of gunshots to try and guide us
0:14:49 there roll your off specs rating at
0:14:51 difficulty four
0:14:54 two successes okay with two successes
0:14:57 you actually get a very specific
0:15:00 sensation of the two of them being
0:15:01 chased down by a black suv it's like you
0:15:03 can hear that it is a black suv and from
0:15:07 here you feel confident that you can
0:15:08 direct the group towards where the
0:15:10 fighting is happening okay guys guys i
0:15:13 can hear the paint job we can um they're
0:15:15 going hey ramirez uh don't take a left
0:15:18 take her right up here uh oh okay i need
0:15:20 a next plus drive check for ramirez
0:15:24 one success okay uh this time he kind of
0:15:26 ends up on the curb you can hear someone
0:15:28 shouting and jumping out of the way of
0:15:30 the car and
0:15:31 he manages the turn i will continue to
0:15:34 just point him where we need to go when
0:15:36 i think they're doing something to me
0:15:37 from a distance i don't know if you can
0:15:38 identify it but it's definitely taking
0:15:40 my vision out and i don't think i met
0:15:41 any of their eyes all right is this
0:15:43 anything i've ever heard of or is there
0:15:45 anything going on it is interesting that
0:15:47 you are the one ruling this rule
0:15:48 intelligence political yeah well she
0:15:50 knows strange [ __ ] that's why i asked
0:15:51 her
0:15:52 but by the way uh while we're kind of
0:15:55 careening it through the back streets of
0:15:56 new haven here johnny is gonna grab his
0:15:59 wallet grab whatever cash he has in
0:16:01 there and reach up front and slap it
0:16:03 down next to ramirez and just be like
0:16:05 you're the right man for this job man
0:16:07 six dollars and forty cents
0:16:10 what's your resources rating my resource
0:16:11 is a one cool so you slap 150 bucks
0:16:15 right down on the dashboard the money
0:16:16 seems to instill courage into your
0:16:19 driver
0:16:22 and he will spend a point of willpower
0:16:24 on his next drive check i'll let you
0:16:25 know when that when it's time for that
0:16:26 what did you get when you're a cold
0:16:28 check this is difficult to eat oh then
0:16:30 one success this is very obscure
0:16:31 information with one success you would
0:16:33 know that the followers of set are
0:16:36 rumored to have the ability to channel
0:16:39 the realm of the dead into the living
0:16:42 world cursing their enemy miles it's
0:16:45 gonna take a long time to explain but uh
0:16:47 your old friends are back hang in there
0:16:49 can i fix it we're working on it his old
0:16:52 friends time to put some snakes and
0:16:53 baskets it's saint patrick's day i still
0:16:56 don't think that's a good phrase shut up
0:16:58 say patrick's day
0:17:00 no we're on our way ramirez hit it
0:17:02 take your additional action sorry uh tim
0:17:04 wouldn't i haven't made a drive checker
0:17:06 anymore
0:17:06 give me your drive checklist
0:17:08 is the guy still hanging out the window
0:17:10 uh yes he will be then he's the new
0:17:13 target instead of a tire
0:17:18 i have three success as well you will
0:17:20 hit you're gonna roll six dice of damage
0:17:24 three success you hit center mass he
0:17:27 seems to stagger for a moment but you
0:17:29 quickly get the impression that he's
0:17:31 wearing some sort of body armor that is
0:17:33 helping to protect him from the wounds
0:17:35 of your clean shot miles they have vests
0:17:38 or something it's a good shot um nothing
0:17:41 else start just pinging off the vehicle
0:17:43 front maybe you can damage something to
0:17:44 slow them down all right new round right
0:17:46 up you're up again are you spending any
0:17:48 blood for
0:17:50 celerity actions spend one more blood
0:17:52 for one more extra action i will listen
0:17:55 to miles and i will shoot for the tires
0:17:57 sounds good
0:18:00 difficulty eat no success shot goes wide
0:18:02 the individual that's hanging out of the
0:18:04 passenger window this time they open up
0:18:07 with a different weapon
0:18:08 and you hear the staccato sound of a
0:18:11 scorpion firing on the two of you he's
0:18:14 going full auto yeah guys it's new wave
0:18:18 come on yeah it's like roll the darkness
0:18:20 new haven in the 90s oh
0:18:23 right
0:18:24 there's still scorpions and you know
0:18:25 vending machines yeah basically
0:18:28 all right miles has one success state of
0:18:31 him Britta two successes to hit you
0:18:36 and that is a stamina world yep i have
0:18:38 two successes one success
0:18:41 you just got those clothes
0:18:43 okay uh your clothes are pretty much
0:18:46 completely ruined at this point but the
0:18:48 two of you absorb all the damage that
0:18:50 they're putting out the shirt is gone
0:18:52 but i think i can do stuff with this
0:18:53 jacket
0:18:56 i guess that's its point of willpower to
0:18:58 continue to see
0:18:59 which is starting to get expensive i
0:19:01 thought that was your shtick though
0:19:03 i mean you could always take where to
0:19:04 take the wheel can't either
0:19:07 that's a good point that's a good point
0:19:09 i'm gonna see if i can start like
0:19:11 some evasive here hopefully they're
0:19:13 getting closer but i'm gonna lose the
0:19:14 ability to see soon so i need to like
0:19:16 ditch them somehow put some distance
0:19:19 between us until these guys catch up
0:19:21 okay uh so in terms of a risky maneuver
0:19:24 yeah you're
0:19:25 now approaching dixon lav and there is a
0:19:28 lot of traffic
0:19:30 as usual and if you're quick enough
0:19:33 you can weave between a couple of cars
0:19:36 and get to the other side of the street
0:19:39 but it's dangerous okay and there's a
0:19:41 secondary thought can i use dominate to
0:19:44 take a car across the way and direct it
0:19:46 into the car behind me no no okay i want
0:19:49 to check it's a thought no you're going
0:19:50 too fast okay that's fair i am probably
0:19:53 going way too fast yeah okay
0:19:56 uh 59 i will spawn a success i will
0:20:00 power on this i need the space you need
0:20:02 those i'm going to need them later when
0:20:04 i need them
0:20:06 uh that'll be two successes three
0:20:08 successes with willpower says the group
0:20:10 of you are riding on dick swell and this
0:20:12 guy is like hugging the curb and
0:20:16 narrowly avoiding a couple of parked
0:20:18 cars earning that tip from here
0:20:21 you see a midnight blue i was a ferrari
0:20:26 you see a midnight blue frog
0:20:28 swerve into traffic weaving between a
0:20:32 pair of cars
0:20:33 and sliding out onto the other side of
0:20:36 the main street with the suv having to
0:20:38 slam the brakes
0:20:40 and allow for other cars to pass or else
0:20:43 crash
0:20:45 is there an opportunity for us to get
0:20:46 out and mount up in the suv here
0:20:49 now this is a pretty much a ways down
0:20:51 the street okay fair enough
0:20:53 hey ramirez uh
0:20:55 follow that ferrari
0:20:57 uh i i think it's getting shot at
0:20:59 scratch that follow the suv
0:21:02 i think that's the car that's shooting
0:21:05 that's why you're following it not
0:21:06 getting in front of it guys all right
0:21:07 let's do it all right
0:21:09 he'll spread point of a power yep all
0:21:11 right so that he is another or just an
0:21:13 auto success auto success uh you're
0:21:14 gonna dexter's drive death eight
0:21:17 uh no success is here but he did spend
0:21:18 the will power so that's the one so he
0:21:21 manages to keep up with the the and
0:21:24 start heading for the suv wynn starts
0:21:26 like curl she rolls down the window all
0:21:28 the way with the hand crank because i
0:21:29 assume the cab has one and she kind of
0:21:31 like perches in the window almost like a
0:21:33 bird of prey perching on something she's
0:21:35 got one leg still in the car the one is
0:21:37 pulled up on the window so like she's
0:21:39 looking for an opportunity to jump out
0:21:40 which one of us is sitting in the front
0:21:42 i assumed it was neil who needs the air
0:21:44 bag
0:21:46 i'd argue but i i can't
0:21:49 if you want if you want to be in back
0:21:50 i'll i'll be up in front with ramirez no
0:21:52 i got it everybody likes an airbag
0:21:54 we're good they they kill more people
0:21:56 than they save
0:21:57 no
0:21:58 that's true at all no but that's wyn's
0:22:00 perspective on this
0:22:02 i turn over to ramirez uh we work uh
0:22:05 security for a very protect for a very
0:22:07 important person this guy this kind of
0:22:09 stuff happens a lot you uh you perform
0:22:11 well tonight and we'll be thinking of
0:22:12 thinking of you uh ramirez okay i'm
0:22:14 gonna need a manipulation
0:22:16 oh yeah i'll uh i'll actually spin for
0:22:18 awe actually uh yeah oh yeah
0:22:21 yeah manipulation plus one is difficulty
0:22:23 seven sub-refuge subterfuge i don't have
0:22:26 that so that's a minus one because it's
0:22:28 a it's a talent okay cool cool cool and
0:22:30 uh first level of awe we'll do what okay
0:22:33 so all allows you to get people's
0:22:35 attention okay so that's not gonna help
0:22:37 me here never mind
0:22:39 you know what i'm going to spend the
0:22:40 willpower on this [ __ ] it yeah i think
0:22:42 you're thinking of it
0:22:43 worthy
0:22:44 difficulty
0:22:45 seven three successes three
0:22:47 that sounds great i'm done with this
0:22:49 taxi gift
0:22:51 and you got a future in this city
0:22:53 ramirez and he steps on the gas uh going
0:22:56 straight for that suv
0:22:58 britto
0:23:00 is the one hanging out with a window the
0:23:02 same one that's driving no the one
0:23:05 hanging out of the window is out of the
0:23:07 passenger side window
0:23:09 hanging out the passenger side of the
0:23:10 best friend's ride could be it could be
0:23:12 a better question
0:23:14 [Laughter]
0:23:15 do i have an idea of whether the driver
0:23:19 is looking at me or not at a quick
0:23:22 glance the driver seems pretty focused
0:23:25 on the midnight blue easily tracked
0:23:29 vehicle that it's currently chasing uh
0:23:31 you do notice one thing however
0:23:33 in the back seat there is an individual
0:23:36 who has a pendulum in their hand that is
0:23:39 kind of like waving and jostling around
0:23:42 as the suv gives chase and the pendulum
0:23:46 is moving in tandem with sensical
0:23:48 movement like of the car yeah okay well
0:23:51 um then i will use that extra action and
0:23:55 i will spend a point of willpower for an
0:23:57 auto success sounds good
0:24:00 [ __ ] up that sneak wizard today conan
0:24:01 and be
0:24:02 proud that pendulum seems awful
0:24:05 important no you're totally right so
0:24:07 you're uh gunning for the the guy in the
0:24:09 back seat when i see that pendulum that
0:24:12 seems like something that would have to
0:24:13 do with the blindness magic or whatever
0:24:16 so
0:24:16 yeah she's gonna try to shoot him sounds
0:24:18 good him or the pendulum pendulum
0:24:20 probably pretty small right that is a
0:24:22 very difficult shot
0:24:24 also you're in a moving vehicle firing
0:24:26 at a moving vehicle at someone who's the
0:24:28 back seat behind the windshields
0:24:31 specifically not even them but they're
0:24:33 pendulum which is also bouncing around
0:24:37 it's like a moving object and a moving
0:24:39 object on a moving object i'm just
0:24:40 looking for him
0:24:42 it's just a moving object
0:24:45 this is my extra action yes but if you
0:24:47 think really hard
0:24:49 johnny doesn't do that
0:24:53 difficulty difficulty eat i have four
0:24:55 successes counting the uh willpower all
0:24:58 right okay cool so three successes are
0:25:00 gonna roll over into damage
0:25:04 four successes and that seems to hurt
0:25:08 and the individual in the back seat
0:25:10 loses their patience completely with the
0:25:13 situation
0:25:14 their fangs bare and they're like long
0:25:18 cobra like fangs yellow snake eyes
0:25:20 reveal themselves and they go ballistic
0:25:23 on the two individuals that are in the
0:25:24 front seat of the suv the suv starts to
0:25:27 swerve wildly
0:25:29 miles i i think i shot the wrong one i
0:25:32 miles you can see nope you shot the
0:25:33 right one oh god this is so much better
0:25:36 what is happening back there you guys
0:25:37 okay sounds like a girl's a warrior
0:25:39 britta you're up again at the top of the
0:25:42 round um how many additional actions
0:25:44 would you like to take with Celerity one
0:25:46 Britta what do you want to do again you
0:25:47 seem to be just outpacing everything
0:25:49 around you during the course of this
0:25:51 fight and it's almost uncomfortable how
0:25:54 how natural it seems to to be for you
0:25:57 i
0:25:58 let alone knowing how to use a gun how
0:26:00 much else do i know how to do but
0:26:03 there's no time to think about that i'm
0:26:04 gonna shoot the guy again
0:26:07 the difficulty of this attack role is
0:26:09 going to be eat three successes okay
0:26:11 give me six types of damage i'll sleep
0:26:13 on Britta damn yeah ready
0:26:16 for successes okay
0:26:19 this continues i'm going to need to
0:26:21 upgrade my personal arsenal and vehicles
0:26:23 you should already upgrade your vehicle
0:26:24 this vehicle is very upgraded
0:26:27 upgrade it correctly upgraded with
0:26:29 bullets at the time okay well all of us
0:26:31 want to drive in a box i don't want to
0:26:33 drive in this at all right now i don't
0:26:35 want to die in a box either the suv the
0:26:38 person driving it manages to semi
0:26:41 maintain control
0:26:42 as it grinds along the side of parked
0:26:46 cars and you can hear this loud
0:26:48 screeching noise
0:26:50 it's so loud that neil yep i need a will
0:26:54 power check to
0:26:56 not be deafened by the experience
0:26:58 meanwhile the individual that is the
0:27:00 passenger seat
0:27:01 is
0:27:02 hanging out of the car on the side that
0:27:04 is being grinded against those cars so
0:27:08 after a moment
0:27:09 they're simply gone
0:27:11 somewhere amongst uh
0:27:13 the wreckage
0:27:15 uh we lost visual on the one with the
0:27:16 automatic did you guys see him
0:27:19 were we close enough that did ramirez
0:27:21 come through for us
0:27:27 yep found him no one searches his
0:27:29 remarks bounces over him ramirez his
0:27:32 eyes go wide is that a body nope ramirez
0:27:34 no one's going to say nothing keep
0:27:36 driving
0:27:37 i got a three by the way on successes
0:27:40 good is he goner
0:27:42 probably he's sleeping brutal don't
0:27:44 worry about it yeah pretty bad feeling
0:27:46 that he's not being complete i'm gonna
0:27:47 go take him to a farm upstate
0:27:49 miles do you know where we are now is
0:27:51 there some direction i should be leading
0:27:52 them i think there's a pissed off
0:27:54 vampire behind us now well it sounded
0:27:56 like we started there but uh no no full
0:27:58 on pissed off
0:28:00 pull behind monterey place should it
0:28:02 should be coming up on your uh on your
0:28:04 left there sounds good i'll try to do
0:28:06 that and hopefully get off this main
0:28:08 thoroughfare
0:28:10 your other left take the right and then
0:28:11 the left did you get that yeah i got it
0:28:13 okay
0:28:14 i'm gonna make a mental note of where
0:28:16 the
0:28:17 uh speed bump has landed
0:28:20 so we can go back and get it later five
0:28:22 sounds good drive check
0:28:24 difficulty
0:28:26 of course
0:28:27 which reflects my dice with five
0:28:28 successes nice
0:28:31 at this point things seem to be
0:28:32 more smoothly sailing as the only person
0:28:35 now giving chase is the driver who is
0:28:37 being mauled
0:28:39 by
0:28:40 someone in the backseat that said well
0:28:42 they are being mauled Britta you find
0:28:45 yourself
0:28:46 with more uh opportunities to strike so
0:28:49 what are you gonna do uh not spending
0:28:51 blood oh you still have an action this
0:28:53 year i have
0:28:55 yes
0:28:56 all right
0:28:57 well celery is a hell of a drug i'm
0:28:58 gonna shoot the guy sounds good uh the
0:29:01 driver or the person in the backseat
0:29:03 shooting the guy in the back seat has
0:29:05 led to
0:29:07 some form of success here
0:29:14 the difficulty of your attack role is
0:29:16 eight two successes one carries over to
0:29:18 damage or five best damage
0:29:21 two uh he seems to absorb the impact of
0:29:23 this shot uh that said the driver was
0:29:26 suffering some wound penalties at this
0:29:28 point
0:29:29 will
0:29:30 drive check
0:29:32 the suv takes far too sharp of a turn
0:29:35 and an attempt to chase the sports car
0:29:38 and flips over onto its side with a very
0:29:42 loud crunch
0:29:43 there's people out on the sidewalk
0:29:45 there's they're glancing out and you can
0:29:48 hear
0:29:49 the sounds of what's what comes across
0:29:51 as a savage animal
0:29:53 inside of the suv and very slowly people
0:29:56 are kind of starting to want to approach
0:29:59 and take a peek at what's now
0:30:01 close behind yes
0:30:03 so i'm going to
0:30:05 pull a card out of my wallet with the
0:30:08 150. i'm assuming like i probably have
0:30:11 some kind of business card even though
0:30:12 it might be like pretty
0:30:14 blank as far as information right but
0:30:16 like the offices of carl weather is you
0:30:18 know securities consultant johnny saxon
0:30:20 or something like that right now or some
0:30:22 kind of alias
0:30:23 i'm gonna slap it down onto uh um the
0:30:26 seat next to um
0:30:28 ramirez and be like thanks thanks for
0:30:31 this uh this ride ramirez give me a call
0:30:33 later
0:30:34 when
0:30:35 you pacify what's in back i'm driving
0:30:37 that suv somewhere safe yep
0:30:39 can you get it it is on its side johnny
0:30:42 there's something really wrong with the
0:30:43 guy in the back
0:30:46 i'm going to try to make a stop and try
0:30:48 to help contain this now problematic
0:30:50 scene so we'll both head out yep um wind
0:30:53 just kind of ducks out the window
0:30:55 like she's been prepped to do i will
0:30:57 spend a uh
0:30:59 a
0:31:00 point of awe
0:31:02 to shout to all the people uh clear out
0:31:04 of the area there's a fire it's gonna
0:31:06 blow give me a presence check so that's
0:31:09 a performance plus charisma yes sir
0:31:12 well i don't have performance
0:31:14 uh so that's a minus one or if it is a
0:31:16 skill you're at plus one difficulty it
0:31:18 is a skill so i'm at plus one difficulty
0:31:20 yes sir cool so what is the difficulty
0:31:23 so it's b6 a6 so it'll be a seven yep
0:31:26 cool
0:31:26 um i'll spend the wool power
0:31:28 sounds good
0:31:30 and i have uh two successes all together
0:31:32 okay with two successes people start to
0:31:35 back away and disperse nervously no one
0:31:37 wants to be
0:31:38 blasphemous for that and you hear this
0:31:40 loud banging at the inside window as
0:31:43 something
0:31:44 is ravenously trying to escape
0:31:47 i am
0:31:48 going to
0:31:49 step into it we've gotten out of the car
0:31:51 listen yeah well we bolted out i don't
0:31:53 know what you're doing i'm just gonna
0:31:55 slip out of the front like okay ramirez
0:31:57 you can you can bail thanks man and i'm
0:32:00 gonna give him more money as a tip
0:32:03 on top of what johnny gave him and then
0:32:05 just sort of walk into an alley and
0:32:07 disappear okay so you're you're in the
0:32:09 midst of creeping off it's gonna take a
0:32:10 moment yeah yeah all the way there is
0:32:13 there a moon roof or a sunroof on the
0:32:15 suv there is uh how intact is it
0:32:18 or open it's actually looking pretty
0:32:19 good all right is it open by any chance
0:32:21 uh no it's winter i'll get that thing
0:32:23 outside you get ready to pacify
0:32:25 whatever's inside got it over the phone
0:32:28 johnny i had some kind of pendulum does
0:32:30 that sound uh johnny's um
0:32:33 johnny's a little busy right now i

0:32:38 it's just me they they walked they
0:32:40 walked off a pendulum can you talk to me
0:32:42 about that a little bit uh yeah it was
0:32:45 moving normally but
0:32:47 when something happened when i shot him
0:32:49 when i shot him
0:32:50 his eyes went yellow
0:32:52 and the noises started
0:32:54 we're pulling back around we need to
0:32:55 contain the scene
0:32:57 blood surges into johnny as potent three
0:33:00 he lifts the suv and pushes it onto its
0:33:03 side there's a crowd of people watching
0:33:05 uh i thought i'd disperse some of them
0:33:07 with my with my shoutout you got them to
0:33:08 get away they're not leaving
0:33:13 yeah there's there's traffic yeah for
0:33:15 logistics

0:33:18 the passenger side is down at the
0:33:20 driver's side okay so the window on the
0:33:22 passenger side is open yes so i could
0:33:24 pull myself up onto the side of onto the
0:33:27 roof and go in through the window yes
0:33:30 okay
0:33:30 i'm gonna do that and as i'm going up
0:33:33 there i'm gonna be pulling out the stake
0:33:35 that i brought just in case i was gonna
0:33:36 need to pacify someone in elysium
0:33:39 okay miles uh the car pulls up and
0:33:42 you're starting to
0:33:44 get a feel for how bad this might be oh

0:33:58 out of here working on it yeah i'm just
0:34:00 gonna try to
0:34:02 similar trick
0:34:03 and such and try to disperse and try to
0:34:05 move them away and seem official like
0:34:08 turkey mural as this charisma instead of
0:34:10 manipulation yes it is a charisma role
0:34:12 okay
0:34:14 will win time to spend blood before she
0:34:15 actually acts
0:34:18 uh one success yeah you start helping uh
0:34:20 disperse the crowd uh but there's
0:34:22 there's a lot of them this is a very
0:34:25 room okay dixon avenue is kind of like a
0:34:27 place where there's a lot of foot
0:34:29 traffic there's a lot of cars
0:34:31 it's a very busy busy area keep it in
0:34:33 the car before Britta gets out of the car
0:34:36 she will reach back down for the holster
0:34:38 for the gun uh with her left hand trying
0:34:41 to put it
0:34:42 back it's pretty easy and like one
0:34:45 single motion you casually holster the
0:34:47 weapon lots of people probably have to
0:34:49 practice in order to do it but for you
0:34:51 you just
0:34:52 oh that's so weird as wyn is going in
0:34:55 she kind of forces the blood into her
0:34:57 muscles to make her a bit stronger and
0:35:00 into the tips of her fingers um once she
0:35:03 is inside the car and out of sight to
0:35:05 bring out her protean claws okay and she
0:35:08 just goes right for the frenzying
0:35:10 initiative
0:35:12 16.
0:35:13 you're up first what are you doing i'm
0:35:15 staking this [ __ ]
0:35:16 uh give me dexter smelly difficulty nine
0:35:19 uh we're gonna raise the difficulty by
0:35:20 one uh yeah because it's a skill
0:35:22 melee is a skill okay i'm gonna spend a
0:35:24 willpower for an auto success okay
0:35:27 so
0:35:29 dexterity div ten
0:35:32 one success you're gonna roll strength
0:35:34 plus one die he has to suffer three
0:35:38 levels of damage in order for the stake
0:35:40 to be considered successful
0:35:44 almost a fancy word for didn't man
0:35:47 it has two successes on silk and will
0:35:51 resist the lethal damage that you were
0:35:52 dealing with its action it will attempt
0:35:54 to initiate a gravel actually uh no it's
0:35:57 not
0:35:58 um am i able in the meantime to attempt
0:36:01 to mimic what i see miles and johnny
0:36:04 doing
0:36:05 and to
0:36:06 use my
0:36:08 sense of all that i don't know about
0:36:10 you have a chanting voice too right
0:36:12 i have some relevant things i believe
0:36:14 [Laughter]
0:36:16 i have blush of health and enchanting
0:36:18 voices
0:36:20 oh miles
0:36:22 uh yeah yeah it's easy to imagine that
0:36:24 you didn't uh use your your
0:36:27 your professional voice you're still in
0:36:29 grieving about your car
0:36:31 your sky blew ferrari midnight
0:36:35 okay it goes down to a difficulty three
0:36:38 though i believe that's five successes
0:36:41 okay uh
0:36:43 with ease you disperse the crap
0:36:46 everyone it's dangerous you should
0:36:48 go
0:36:49 okay okay
0:36:51 upon seeing that yeah
0:36:54 johnny will once the crowd starts kind
0:36:56 of like leaving and and paying attention
0:36:58 to other things johnny will take an
0:37:00 opportunity
0:37:01 to
0:37:02 right the suv let me resolve the round
0:37:04 of course go straight to that win let
0:37:06 that happen at the opportune time that
0:37:08 you want in the dark you can see now
0:37:10 that it's got the eyes of a cobra
0:37:13 long like
0:37:14 snake like fangs there are scales on its
0:37:17 skin and it flicks along tongue towards
0:37:20 your throat buy me dinner first jesus
0:37:24 has four successes to hit three carry
0:37:26 over
0:37:28 do i get to dodge or soak or anything
0:37:30 you will be rolling
0:37:32 this is aggravated damage all right give
0:37:34 me a 42 rule
0:37:37 two successes okay you feel the caress
0:37:40 of this razor sharp tongue against your
0:37:42 skin but you do not suffer any levels of
0:37:44 aggravated damage
0:37:46 while it's sticking out of me can i
0:37:48 swipe at it with my claws on your action
0:37:50 you can swipe hot while this is going on
0:37:52 if i have been able to slip out of sight
0:37:54 for a second uh while they're trying to
0:37:55 disperse the crowd i want to just walk
0:37:58 amongst the crowd and obfuscate and keep
0:38:00 an ear out for anyone who
0:38:03 may be thinking they saw too much okay
0:38:06 uh give me a perception bliss
0:38:08 investigation win
0:38:10 why don't you go ahead and give me your
0:38:11 tackle okay it sounds like you're
0:38:12 rolling into this combat too so
0:38:17 i got four successes on an investigation
0:38:19 okay two successes for when
0:38:22 uh
0:38:23 five seven ten ten so you're gonna go
0:38:25 after a win here win
0:38:27 with two successes you're gonna be
0:38:29 rolling strength plus two dice of damage
0:38:32 [Music]
0:38:33 one success the scales
0:38:36 of its form actually seem resistant to
0:38:38 the claws
0:38:39 and it resists your attack then
0:38:42 the suv
0:38:44 gets chipped right side up do we need to
0:38:46 make any kind of like athletics check to
0:38:48 stay you're jostled a bit but the two of
0:38:50 you are just entangled with each other
0:38:52 clawing and licking awkward yeah that's
0:38:55 kind of their role johnny what are you
0:38:56 doing so i just wrote uh righted the
0:38:59 thing i imagine some of the windows are
0:39:01 smashed can i see what's inside
0:39:03 most of the windows are smashed at this
0:39:05 point okay so the the fact that they're
0:39:07 tinted isn't really right in their way
0:39:08 at this point you can see a bold scaled
0:39:13 cobra-like figure tussling in the suv
0:39:17 with wind are any of the other figures
0:39:19 moving no i will
0:39:22 try to reach inside to grapple down
0:39:26 this bald snake guy
0:39:29 to give win a clear shot okay give me
0:39:32 dex plus brawl i'm gonna give you a plus
0:39:34 one difficulty because you're trying to
0:39:35 reach through and over absolutely
0:39:37 all right here we go
0:39:40 those are pretty i've got two successes
0:39:44 you establish a firm grasp on the the
0:39:47 apparent follower of set [ __ ] snake
0:39:50 guy
0:39:51 it will actually spend its action
0:39:52 attempting to escape your grasp
0:39:55 not today cobra commander
0:39:57 wind takes several
0:39:59 near feral growling breaths
0:40:02 and it's not really super clear whether
0:40:04 she is
0:40:05 struggling or really enjoying this
0:40:08 the glint in her eye would suggest that
0:40:09 she is enjoying the thrill of the hunt
0:40:11 johnny
0:40:12 while you're holding on to it it it's
0:40:15 like almost slithering
0:40:17 out of your fingertips and it's very
0:40:19 difficult to maintain a grasp on this i
0:40:21 need you to make a resisted strength
0:40:24 plus brawl check sounds good
0:40:31 cool
0:40:32 well four successes okay you maintain a
0:40:35 hold on it end of round
0:40:37 miles what do you do i need to know if
0:40:39 this thing is acknowledged in the domain
0:40:41 or not and if we have to care about if
0:40:43 it dies because we just can't straight
0:40:45 up kill somebody another vampire if it
0:40:47 is acknowledged
0:40:48 it is a member of an independent clan if
0:40:52 it is a follower of set what does that
0:40:54 mean to me independent claims are not
0:40:56 acknowledged members of the camera cool
0:40:58 just wanted to check before we happen to
0:41:00 by accident do sitters always kill them
0:41:02 later
0:41:03 johnny what are you doing with your
0:41:04 celebrity action i am punching him right
0:41:06 in the face trying to break some fangs
0:41:08 and make him a little bit less effective
0:41:10 soften them up for uh for win
0:41:12 okay
0:41:13 tenderizing
0:41:14 i'm assuming i can do that in a grapple
0:41:16 right yep cool
0:41:18 [Music]
0:41:19 well um one success hit roll strength
0:41:29 well baby um that's one two three four
0:41:32 six successes i had six dice
0:41:36 it was soaked one
0:41:38 taking five levels of bashing damage
0:41:40 which is then halved in favor of the
0:41:43 follower of set so it'll take two levels
0:41:44 of damage sounds good to me you punch it
0:41:47 win yeah give me a rake
0:41:52 uh two successes great
0:41:54 uh roll strength plus two dice of
0:41:56 aggravated damage
0:41:57 [Music]
0:41:59 one success okay it will suffer a level
0:42:02 of aggravated damage as your claws dig
0:42:04 deep into its flesh
0:42:06 when grins a little bit johnny yo what
0:42:09 are you doing top of the rum at this
0:42:10 point it's starting to look hurt but
0:42:12 it's relentless it's lost to this
0:42:14 berserk frenzy and it does not seem to
0:42:16 be experiencing pain from anything the
0:42:19 two of you are doing to it
0:42:21 johnny do you have a steak no
0:42:23 oh god damn it
0:42:25 i'm gonna then basically just keep on
0:42:28 wailing on them hoping that i can
0:42:30 actually put them down at some point do
0:42:32 you still have my gun
0:42:34 yeah but i'm holding on to him is it
0:42:36 i'll try and reach back i'll use my
0:42:39 action to reach back and pull out a gun
0:42:41 to give her the gun no you used the gun
0:42:43 i'm holding it onto him
0:42:45 shouldn't the stake still be in him it
0:42:47 just wasn't effective no yeah i assume
0:42:50 it fell down you're basically just
0:42:51 having someone with a knife there's a
0:42:52 stake in the in the suv
0:42:54 got it oh there's a stake in the suv
0:42:56 somewhere it's since been flipped you

0:43:01 smash it in let me just hold on to this
0:43:04 guy
0:43:05 i'll grab the steak
0:43:07 uh it's actually its turn okay so it's
0:43:09 going to attempt to
0:43:11 break free
0:43:12 i will spend the point of blood of my
0:43:14 strength at this point if that's okay
0:43:18 that spot and you can spend
0:43:20 one once one blood for one strength
0:43:22 right yep cool on my turn i'm gonna
0:43:24 spend one two three for my decks so
0:43:26 there's been a number of turns
0:43:27 struggling with this thing now yeah yeah
0:43:30 you can hear the sounds of um
0:43:34 the suvs are rocking because otherwise i
0:43:36 will i will move into this and try to uh
0:43:39 assist with the dominating you are aware
0:43:41 that it is very difficult to dominate uh
0:43:43 a vampire that's crazy yeah but why
0:43:46 don't you give me a an initiative rule
0:43:48 sure i'll have your role in the next
0:43:49 round
0:43:50 ah 13 again
0:43:51 i like that by you moving into the
0:43:53 combat for all intents and purposes
0:43:54 since i have disappeared you've just

0:43:58 successes to hold on to him it's going
0:44:00 bad i don't know what's happening hair's
0:44:02 free from your grasp with
0:44:04 six successes on its role damn

0:44:13 johnny yep you're up again
0:44:16 grab him johnny i will uh
0:44:19 grab the top of the suv jump up and
0:44:22 actually slide into the back seat with
0:44:24 the two of them
0:44:25 to try and actually get on top of him
0:44:27 and force him down onto the seat so give
0:44:29 me decks with that plus athletics dex
0:44:32 athletics you got it
0:44:36 uh one success
0:44:37 you're in cool top of the round is win
0:44:41 by looking for the stake uh am i giving
0:44:44 him an opportunity to attack me uh there
0:44:46 are no attacks of opportunity yeah i
0:44:48 know there's there's no like attacks of
0:44:49 opportunities here but is it tactically
0:44:51 action okay um
0:44:54 all right i only get the one i'm still
0:44:55 gonna claw this thing sure
0:45:00 three successes so you're going to roll
0:45:02 strength plus three dice of aggravated
0:45:04 damage
0:45:09 no successes i was like maybe this could
0:45:11 end it now
0:45:12 uh it could have if i had literally
0:45:14 rolled anything
0:45:16 except the one thing and one the suv is
0:45:19 rocking side to side you're swiping it's
0:45:22 rolling it's being grabbed and people on
0:45:24 the other side is just turning into a
0:45:26 mess horrible animal noises and stuff
0:45:29 just like reminds me of woodstock man
0:45:31 it's a slippery stick guy i mean it's
0:45:33 just all sorts of awful miles
0:45:36 uh you're standing outside of the suv
0:45:39 and everything looks appears rather to
0:45:41 have gone to [ __ ] so what do you do is
0:45:43 this side broken also so like am i or do
0:45:46 i have to open a door to like all of the
0:45:47 doors are actually intact well i'm at
0:45:49 the window on this all of the windows
0:45:51 are busted okay good i will uh i will
0:45:54 establish as best as i can and be like
0:45:56 be still okay give me a roll for
0:45:58 dominique it's a plus two difficulty
0:45:59 because the vampire's in frenzy sure i
0:46:01 will take a minus two difficulty so i
0:46:03 need to know it's willpower
0:46:04 all right it's baseball power is seven
0:46:06 okay cool uh what is that sorcerer
0:46:10 cool
0:46:13 one success and that's uh rounds of
0:46:15 effect yep so you will take its next
0:46:17 action
0:46:18 and force it to be still after that it
0:46:21 is on you johnny all right um you've
0:46:24 grabbed the steak nope no no no i only
0:46:26 had the one action so i was going to do
0:46:28 damage okay gotcha uh johnny will reach
0:46:31 down and grab the stake and put it where
0:46:33 it needs to be great give me a
0:46:34 perception plus alertness rule to find
0:46:37 the stake
0:46:39 uh perception plus alertness huh yep um
0:46:43 cool i'm gonna spend the willpower
0:46:47 i want to find it real bad uh that's uh
0:46:50 that's not johnny's specialty
0:46:52 man seeing stuff uh we leave that up for
0:46:54 like one person oh but look at that two
0:46:57 on the roll so three successes fabulous
0:46:59 uh
0:47:00 like a charm you reach down feel around
0:47:03 there's a lot of blood down here but a
0:47:05 month i miss it you find a steak cool
0:47:08 i'll put that where it needs to be and
0:47:10 on my celerity action i'm going to
0:47:12 freaking power drive that into his heart
0:47:15 with potence sounds good it
0:47:18 remains still your action awesome uh
0:47:22 he was just talking about i'm going to
0:47:23 drive that in as hard as i can give me a
0:47:26 dex plus melee at difficulty nine now
0:47:29 spending blood and Celerity actions is
0:47:31 in addition to other blood expenditures
0:47:33 yep can i spend the blood to get auto
0:47:35 successes with my potents uh not an
0:47:37 attackable no okay oh on the attack
0:47:40 right right um i'm could i do that on
0:47:41 the damage yes okay so first the attack
0:47:44 roll uh dex plus melee difficulty nine
0:47:48 let's get a small steakhouse really hard
0:47:50 it is very difficult to use a stake but
0:47:52 it's an auto win condition so obviously
0:47:55 right
0:47:56 the ideas usually do it from surprise
0:47:58 just from surprise you can it's very
0:48:01 very plausible hey a success
0:48:04 great
0:48:04 you may roll damage
0:48:06 cool
0:48:07 um this can i spend bullet on yes okay
0:48:10 um so
0:48:12 when i spend blood on potence that'll be
0:48:14 auto successes and i will instead of
0:48:16 instead of dice cool i like that
0:48:18 i like that a lot and so the damage of
0:48:21 the weapon is strength plus one strength
0:48:23 plus one
0:48:27 well baby baby we got two ones but i got
0:48:30 three of the successes so we're looking
0:48:32 at four successes all together
0:48:34 it will soak two and take two levels of
0:48:36 lethal damage and not be staked
0:48:40 that much
0:48:41 this turn by the way being still uh some
0:48:44 of its wounds close we go to the top of
0:48:47 the round when i'm gonna finish what
0:48:49 johnny started and just smack that stake
0:48:51 in give me dex plus melee difficulty
0:48:53 nine we're gonna get this stake
0:48:56 does it have to be three damage with one
0:48:57 attack it sure does
0:49:00 give it up and rip his face off
0:49:02 yeah you keep working the steak i'll rip
0:49:04 the face
0:49:06 i don't think we're supposed to crazy
0:49:08 that way like
0:49:10 go for the face look you're the
0:49:11 etiquette guy that's not me she's gonna
0:49:13 go for the face got real [ __ ] friends
0:49:15 miles
0:49:17 not a friend
0:49:21 as obvious my car
0:49:23 the real tragedy here
0:49:25 the biggest run success
0:49:27 hit give me strength plus one dive
0:49:29 aggravated damage followed by this shirt
0:49:34 [ __ ] everything botch
0:49:36 okay
0:49:37 or no there is no botching on uh soaking
0:49:40 or damage rolls so it just means that
0:49:42 you you don't put out any damage on this
0:49:44 claw attack
0:49:45 it's uh it's scaly hide is just rolling
0:49:50 in the back and your claws are just kind
0:49:52 of raking alongside oh my god
0:49:54 a kingdom for ricky ticky tavi
0:49:57 miles uh with all of the rolling around
0:49:59 and trying to stake you do not have a
0:50:00 clear shot on him
0:50:02 for the same thing yeah
0:50:04 they're they're literally both leveraged
0:50:06 over him uh you can barely see him at
0:50:08 all start the car and get us off the
0:50:10 rain road
0:50:12 you too good to drive me i'm thinking
0:50:14 about it
0:50:15 [Laughter]
0:50:19 uh does this car look like it's going to
0:50:21 be drivable or what's like
0:50:23 no
0:50:24 i don't the car is going anywhere i'm
0:50:26 going to call weathers
0:50:30 whatever do it all right yeah your
0:50:32 combat action is spent dialing on a
0:50:33 phone yep johnny we just need to shut
0:50:35 this down
0:50:36 i
0:50:38 know johnny
0:50:41 your action all right uh i'm going to
0:50:44 try out how many vampires does it take
0:50:49 technically at this point i haven't been
0:50:50 in grapple though right
0:50:52 i have them in grapple though right yeah
0:50:53 okay so so he'd have to escape the
0:50:55 grapple on his action yes yeah cool so i
0:50:59 will try and jam the stake in again i'm
0:51:01 not i'm not going to reestablish
0:51:02 grappling like that because i've already
0:51:03 got it that's that's all i'm thinking
0:51:05 so i do want a round of oh [ __ ] if he
0:51:08 does break the grappler
0:51:10 is now watching us trying to do a
0:51:12 [ __ ]
0:51:13 angry ass vampire that's yakity saks
0:51:15 well baby i got uh four successes on
0:51:19 staking
0:51:20 on the attack rule
0:51:22 um very good so i will spend another
0:51:25 point of blood to uh potence this stake
0:51:28 into his chest
0:51:30 but that means i will be um
0:51:33 i said i had three successes or four
0:51:34 four four so that's three x for dice of
0:51:37 damage right yes cool so one plus my
0:51:40 strength of
0:51:41 now four
0:51:42 uh
0:51:43 plus three cool
0:51:47 that would be gross and my old enemy
0:51:50 ones
0:51:51 if ones are rolling come on buddy
0:51:54 what do you got
0:51:55 five
0:51:56 it will take three levels of damage

0:55:34 the front seats okay i uh the keys are
0:55:38 still in the ignition right yeah i pull
0:55:40 them back to turn the car off there's
0:55:42 actually still a hand holding on to the
0:55:44 wheel just the hand just the hand you
0:55:46 just pop that off yeah just kind of tap
0:55:48 that off the the guys in the front seat
0:55:50 are they just dead ghouls they are
0:55:52 they it seems that they were alive heavy
0:55:55 on the past tense
0:55:57 is this this thing is still continuing
0:55:59 to decay and such uh it hits a point
0:56:02 where once it looks like the body is
0:56:04 very soft and about 10 years old it
0:56:08 stops the kang all right do i need to
0:56:10 take a humanity chop to pull the head
0:56:12 off and make sure it does not do
0:56:13 something freaky we'll get to your
0:56:15 humanity checks uh once when we take
0:56:17 both of us
0:56:19 i'm uh um gonna grab like probably some
0:56:23 a tarp and some
0:56:24 towel extra claws that i keep in the
0:56:26 trunk can you get your trunk open yeah i
0:56:28 could probably handle that it's crushed
0:56:30 i'm a trucker i could probably still do
0:56:32 that
0:56:33 i'm i'm used to actually making vehicles
0:56:36 run oh when they shouldn't
0:56:38 i'm gonna try and get this thing to
0:56:39 sucker to run or at least listen to what
0:56:41 i might need to do
0:56:43 to get it to actually just limp off the
0:56:46 road here give me a perception plus
0:56:48 drive difficulty
0:56:50 you got it how obviously messed up are
0:56:53 miles and i having been shot at if i go
0:56:55 to try to direct people will it be very
0:56:57 notable that i am covered in shredded
0:56:59 fabric how many levels of actual damage
0:57:01 do you have i have one level of damage
0:57:04 okay so you don't actually look too bad
0:57:06 uh but your clothes are
0:57:09 rags one success okay yeah you think you
0:57:12 can
0:57:13 you can force it all right
0:57:16 i'll get the sucker to turn over you
0:57:18 hear the sounds of it
0:57:19 trying to turn over this happens a few
0:57:21 times
0:57:23 come on baby
0:57:26 it starts i guess
0:57:29 better than me man distribute whatever
0:57:31 crap i have and if they pull it off
0:57:33 we'll get weathers to come down this way
0:57:35 okay
0:57:36 uh you get on the phone with
0:57:38 the sheriff's office and
0:57:40 they have a handful of people that are
0:57:42 on their way you are warned to not take
0:57:45 any overt actions
0:57:48 any more overt actions yes
0:57:51 right right we're we're gonna stay here
0:57:53 and we're going to
0:57:55 get out of the way so that
0:57:57 things go onwards normally miles let
0:57:59 them know that there's a body
0:58:01 i have an open road do i know somewhere
0:58:04 in town where i can limp this off the
0:58:06 road where i'm that i've worked with
0:58:08 least resistance
0:58:10 you know
0:58:11 that if you were to take uh a turn down
0:58:15 uh
0:58:16 wooden street because you're like almost
0:58:18 going into hampden at this point yeah
0:58:19 absolutely if you go down wooden street
0:58:20 far enough the neighborhoods there get
0:58:22 really bad
0:58:24 and if no one's paying attention to this
0:58:26 suv it's going to be picked clean within
0:58:29 an hour or two by the way uh weather
0:58:31 says not to take any more overt actions
0:58:34 yeah i know the drill i'm just saying
0:58:37 yeah
0:58:37 and if
0:58:38 normally i'd be the guy he'd be sending
0:58:40 to take care of this [ __ ]

0:58:44 oh yeah don't worry
0:58:46 hop in
0:58:46 nice i get in the car maybe maybe no you
0:58:49 get in uh you have to kind of like

0:58:55 out of the way
0:58:57 johnny grabs the head and puts in the
0:58:59 back seat
0:59:00 sorry sorry about that

0:59:29 all right uh what's next is we gotta uh
0:59:31 take a few turns and head over uh to
0:59:33 some of the
0:59:35 more questionable neighborhoods i guess

0:59:38 off yeah yeah yeah in about 10 minutes
0:59:40 or so the cops should be there so you

1:00:50 crawling with dirt and muck all over him
1:00:55 towards an alley he's bald does it look
1:00:58 like he got run over by an suv he looks
1:01:00 pretty bad and he makes it
1:01:04 to the alley or he sits with his back to
1:01:08 brick grimy grime covered wall
1:01:11 and starts to rifle through his pockets
1:01:13 and he takes out a cell phone i'm uh
1:01:18 can i just take it out of his hands as
1:01:20 soon as he
1:01:22 just pop you've got surprise appear in
1:01:24 reality and be like no i'm gonna take

1:01:43 i will roll stealth check first sounds
1:01:44 good um next stealth
1:01:49 that's
1:01:50 two successes stupid ones okay so that's
1:01:52 two successes in your textbook stealth
1:01:54 there's two extra dice yep for your
1:01:56 attack rule
1:01:59 that's two successes you join this point
1:02:01 out of his hand and sort of appear
1:02:03 because obviously
1:02:06 hey
1:02:07 um
1:02:08 [ __ ] i can kind of forget that i saw you
1:02:10 here
1:02:12 uh i just want to know what's up
1:02:15 you just [ __ ] see what happened out
1:02:17 there
1:02:18 yeah no i totally saw what happened out
1:02:20 there so what do you want then
1:02:22 uh
1:02:23 here's what i want
1:02:25 as i'm talking to this guy i want to uh
1:02:28 when he's order perception and just i'm
1:02:30 looking for whether or not this is just
1:02:32 a mortal who's out of place or whether
1:02:34 this is a ghoul i want to know what i
1:02:36 have to worry about so
1:02:37 i'm going to try and sure
1:02:39 thank you look at his aura as i'm
1:02:40 talking to him sounds good this [ __ ]
1:02:42 guy with his auras and stuff i'm sorry
1:02:45 mister there's some value i have
1:02:47 physical disciplines
1:02:50 there are other kind of disciplines
1:02:52 uh you have one of them perception
1:02:55 empathy difficulty okay
1:02:58 and finger guns
1:03:01 presence just makes me for more
1:03:02 physically appearing
1:03:05 uh that is six successes nice oh shoot
1:03:08 no it's not that's a height that's a
1:03:09 higher difficulty uh that is three
1:03:11 successes
1:03:12 sounds good with three successes you
1:03:14 know that he is afraid
1:03:17 frustrated
1:03:18 and he his aura is slightly muted
1:03:22 no okay gotcha
1:03:25 so uh
1:03:27 who sent you after miles
1:03:31 all right
1:03:32 look i have some cash
1:03:35 believe me when i tell you take the cash
1:03:38 do not
1:03:39 do not cross with this person you don't
1:03:41 want to know
1:03:42 no i i you're gonna end up dressed like
1:03:44 miles
1:03:47 see
1:03:48 i think that's gonna happen anyways just
1:03:51 i mean i have
1:03:52 a feeling
1:03:54 so i really want a name and
1:03:58 it's going to determine whether i walk
1:03:59 away from here or not
1:04:00 i could just look through your contacts
1:04:02 i hold the phone up he kind of gets an
1:04:04 oh [ __ ] look in his face
1:04:07 norford
1:04:09 norford the harrophon
1:04:11 okay uh
1:04:13 if you want me to leave the phone tell
1:04:14 me to tell me
1:04:17 followers set all over the east coast
1:04:19 are gonna come looking for him
1:04:21 there's nowhere he's gonna be safe okay
1:04:24 sounds good
1:04:26 tell you what i'm gonna put my number in
1:04:28 your phone if like i flip his phone open
1:04:31 and i'm gonna leave the phone here and
1:04:33 as a favor for that
1:04:35 and me
1:04:36 not finding you
1:04:38 because i clearly can
1:04:41 next time you get word that someone's
1:04:43 come after miles you're gonna give me a
1:04:45 call just a little text message i'm
1:04:47 gonna put it under
1:04:49 pawn shop
1:04:50 okay
1:04:52 and i do that and i close the phone and
1:04:53 i hand it back to him
1:04:56 he hesitates kind of
1:04:58 thinking over the potential consequences
1:05:00 of this agreement but he takes the phone
1:05:03 good
1:05:04 because i'm not gonna i'm not gonna kill
1:05:06 i think i mean we can both see i'm not a
1:05:08 killer but um
1:05:11 things could get really
1:05:13 really unfortunate
1:05:15 you know i'll just
1:05:17 i'm gonna go i'm gonna go
1:05:19 uh but i'm just gonna leave you with a
1:05:22 little idea
1:05:24 okay
1:05:25 if you don't follow through
1:05:27 and i'm gonna look right in his eyes and
1:05:29 inflict him with the haunting
1:05:32 give me a roll
1:05:34 gross
1:05:35 also can phones text in 98. yeah you can
1:05:38 text yeah um but you have just nine yeah
1:05:41 yeah
1:05:43 very much so i just
1:05:44 he's gonna have to spend like five
1:05:46 minutes cycling through numbers to text
1:05:48 me
1:05:51 it costs money too
1:05:53 it sure does that's his problem not mine
1:05:56 it's like 10 cents a text or something
1:05:59 all right the difficulty is his
1:06:01 perception plus his self-control so i
1:06:03 don't i don't know what that is the
1:06:04 difficulty of your role is going to be
1:06:06 six okay
1:06:09 that is one two three
1:06:11 four successes so this will last for a
1:06:14 month okay he's haunted for the next
1:06:16 month
1:06:18 nothing happens right now i don't know
1:06:19 what's going on but
1:06:21 i just i want him to remember what i
1:06:23 said as he starts having nightmares for
1:06:26 the next month
1:06:27 and
1:06:28 lives in
1:06:29 waking hell
1:06:31 okay uh
1:06:32 let's just i'll see you around okay i
1:06:35 don't know i mean say anything i mean i
1:06:36 never see it start scampering okay
1:06:39 bye bye and as soon as his back is
1:06:41 turned i'm gonna disappear again just in
1:06:43 case he looks over his shoulder to be
1:06:45 he does and you're not there
1:06:47 and you can see the look in his eyes
1:06:49 that this was uh
1:06:51 a very unsettling experience for him
1:06:53 then he takes off
1:06:55 and then i'm going to fade back into the
1:06:57 crowd
1:06:58 just keep half an ear open to see if
1:07:01 anyone else
1:07:03 was talking about stuff that might be a
1:07:05 masquerade breach for if everybody else
1:07:08 took care of it everyone seems pretty
1:07:09 pissed off that they were massively
1:07:11 inconvenienced by 10 minutes of traffic
1:07:13 good and uh i mean sad to say uh most of
1:07:17 these people are way too wrapped up in
1:07:19 their own lives to really give a [ __ ]
1:07:21 good even when there are gunshots
1:07:25 there's no sense of empathy no concern
1:07:28 nothing from these people
1:07:30 and then i will walk back towards the
1:07:32 crash site
1:07:33 and see there's no cars there
1:07:37 hey
1:07:41 [Music]
1:07:44 with that we cut back
1:07:45 to
1:07:46 johnny when Britta and miles
1:07:49 who
1:07:50 pull up and
1:07:51 it looks like a pretty bad neighborhood
1:07:54 one of the street lamps are out there's
1:07:56 a pair of tennis shoes
1:07:58 wrapped around a phone line and
1:08:01 the group of you are alone
1:08:03 so not that i have any particular
1:08:05 objections to leaving the car
1:08:08 but the passengers
1:08:10 where are we going to put them they're
1:08:12 regular
1:08:13 carl's people are showing up soon
1:08:15 all right are we just leaving until then
1:08:17 or are we waiting until they get here
1:08:19 that's what weather's indicated we
1:08:20 should do so you think maybe we should
1:08:22 check and see if they
1:08:25 have anything on them a hint or the
1:08:27 pendulum thing i was going to say let's
1:08:29 see if they have anything on them that
1:08:31 could have caused them he's going to ask
1:08:33 neil to do that but apparently he
1:08:35 neil where would he be
1:08:37 the neil thing should we call him
1:08:39 no that would be a bad idea the hell
1:08:41 would be a bad idea give him a call
1:08:43 because he might be doing something that
1:08:45 calling him would be he's problematic he
1:08:47 might be doing his thing that's fine
1:08:49 i'm sure it'll be all right if he
1:08:51 doesn't have it on silent that's his
1:08:52 fault which one of us has a cell phone
1:08:54 which one of us has a pager
1:08:56 look either way
1:08:58 first of all i have the power are you
1:08:59 just allergic to taking my ideas
1:09:02 no
1:09:03 i don't seem to get any hives or
1:09:05 sneezing or whatnot by the way uh he
1:09:07 pulls out the gun
1:09:08 uh wins pistol and hands it in the back
1:09:11 seat thank you
1:09:13 oh i definitely do
1:09:15 i mean i guess we could all squeeze into
1:09:16 this car to get out of here and then
1:09:17 we'll figure out where he is
1:09:21 i think this is hold on one second
1:09:25 miles
1:09:27 man you answer every the same way every
1:09:29 time it's polite where are you guys you

1:09:37 where down wooden street
1:09:40 okay uh
1:09:41 hey the name nofrit mean anything to you
1:09:44 you why why does why is that name coming
1:09:47 up
1:09:49 wait
1:09:50 well uh
1:09:52 i don't know just uh
1:09:55 they may have
1:09:57 tagged every setting on the east coast
1:09:59 to come out for your blood
1:10:01 i've got a
1:10:02 like a 50 50 on having an early warning
1:10:04 system here but uh yeah not for it is um
1:10:08 behind a lot of the satellite activity
1:10:10 in the east coast including all of the
1:10:12 bad stuff but that's pretty much all i
1:10:14 know okay well all of the bad stuff is
1:10:16 pointed directly at you then apparently
1:10:18 well i mean we probably should have saw
1:10:20 this coming after the whole deal with
1:10:22 you know
1:10:24 okay
1:10:25 still though i took the blame for that
1:10:27 we were all there we know what happened
1:10:29 is there like an emergency kit in the
1:10:31 back or anything like that yeah this is
1:10:33 mostly for selling drugs yeah i figured
1:10:35 um are the guns still in the car yes
1:10:38 all right uh wind's gonna kind of shove
1:10:40 the bodies and the requisite parts just
1:10:42 kind of out of ready view in case the
1:10:44 looters do get here before weathers does
1:10:46 grab anything she's gonna take a look
1:10:48 around for the the pendulum
1:10:50 give me a perception plus investigation
1:10:52 goal
1:10:54 anyways you guys stay safe i guess i'll
1:10:56 see in a couple of minutes i think we're
1:10:58 gathering up and moving back so if
1:11:00 you're visible
1:11:01 [Laughter]
1:11:04 for an auto success here guys all these
1:11:06 perception checks when i'm not here or
1:11:08 maybe you could
1:11:10 get a taxi no [ __ ] that up yeah i can
1:11:12 sure yeah i can take a taxi i mean
1:11:15 because my car does not fit what are you
1:11:16 doing back there what i don't know
1:11:18 something smells really good though
1:11:20 stop looking around yeah i got no
1:11:22 successes and definitely a one in there
1:11:23 i think i found an air freshener and it
1:11:25 smells really good
1:11:26 nope you found a lot of blood oh there's
1:11:29 that too
1:11:30 if i i assume lex uh i would have turned
1:11:34 on my aspects in order to be listening
1:11:36 in on their conversation
1:11:38 i totally support that all right uh am i
1:11:40 then able
1:11:41 to when she's looking around uh use that
1:11:44 aspect to assist me if i try to look
1:11:46 around the car absolutely so that would
1:11:48 be what kind of role then i will allow
1:11:50 you to reduce the difficulty of your
1:11:52 perception and investigation rule by
1:11:54 your aspects rating
1:11:58 one success uh you dig around you think
1:12:01 you found it but it is kind of in a pile
1:12:05 of entrails
1:12:06 breto winces but she
1:12:08 digs her hand into the pile
1:12:11 you hear
1:12:12 an audible squish
1:12:15 and the entire experience is heightened
1:12:18 because of the benefit of your
1:12:19 discipline and you pull out a
1:12:23 metal pendant
1:12:24 that is on a slick
1:12:27 blood-crusted thong
1:12:29 when when when is this is this johnny's
1:12:32 seeing seeing the pendulum in her hands
1:12:34 he slaps it out of her hands into like
1:12:36 the like the front seat where her feet
1:12:38 are and it's like that's a that's
1:12:40 something used for blood magic don't
1:12:41 touch that kabir tells me never touch
1:12:44 blood magic [ __ ] okay i'm sorry can we
