0:00:00 path of night is an actual play of
0:00:02 vampire the Masquerade podcast set in
0:00:03 the classic world of Darkness we're all
0:00:06 friends we're to have fun but our story
0:00:07 can include graphic violence drug use
0:00:10 sexual content and other mature themes
0:00:12 we've talked at our table about safety
0:00:14 comfort and consent both as players and
0:00:17 storytellers we know what to expect
0:00:19 we're all excited to be here and we want
0:00:21 you to feel the same so listener
0:00:23 discretion is advised now let's walk the
0:00:26 path of night
0:00:29 last time on path of night your quarter
0:00:32 you regrouped finally making some time
0:00:34 to get cleaned up and changed out of
0:00:36 their bloody clothes together they had a
0:00:38 long conversation about the Clans sects
0:00:40 the Traditions the power of Vitae and
0:00:43 the basics of being a kindred of the
0:00:45 camera with Brita now it's time to teach
0:00:48 the neonate how to feed and this time
0:00:50 they hope
0:00:51 without her killing anyone
0:00:53 [Music]
0:00:56 Marco seems to have uh be acquiring some
0:01:00 people to come by to help us
0:01:02 feed tonight some of the things we
0:01:04 should explain we do we did inform you
0:01:06 about the blood but I am able to get
0:01:08 some people to come more willingly
0:01:10 sometimes when you're out there you have
0:01:11 to hunt on your own and use some of your
0:01:14 own powers to do such things the people
0:01:16 that you get to come willingly they like
0:01:19 being fed off or yes usually there are
0:01:24 sometimes outliers who are not really
0:01:26 sure where you sit on that but I'm
0:01:29 fairly confident that you won't have any
0:01:31 of those particular flaws well kid miles
0:01:34 knows how to throw a party it gets
0:01:36 people to come have a good time and
0:01:39 maybe a few of them leave with maybe a
0:01:41 pint of blood less they watch it watch
0:01:44 the way he moves around and talks to him
0:01:46 they they know what's going on and if
0:01:48 you act like he's doing you're not going
0:01:51 to have a situation like you had the
0:01:53 other night they get paid for the
0:01:54 services among other things also just be
0:01:57 a little bit careful uh
0:01:59 sometimes at miles's parties these are
0:02:01 musicians they they do some drugs get a
0:02:03 little drunk
0:02:05 feeding off of them can be kind of a
0:02:07 trip either way once once we're done
0:02:10 here it's going to be bedtime for us I
0:02:12 don't know if anyone explained this to
0:02:14 you but we gotta watch out for the Sun
0:02:17 it's not uh a pleasant experience so
0:02:21 once we're done here like they said be
0:02:24 careful about
0:02:25 feeding off anybody that's looking a
0:02:27 little bit uh squirrely I might transfer
0:02:30 over to you
0:02:31 well they are easier marks and once
0:02:34 we're done
0:02:35 we're going to want to get some rest so
0:02:37 you know avoid anybody who's taking any
0:02:39 uppers but so okay if I'm understanding
0:02:44 this if I feed off of someone who's
0:02:46 taken something I'll feel that effect
0:02:49 sometimes and
0:02:52 why are we not sleeping during the night
0:02:55 time well I'm sure uh I'm sure you
0:02:58 probably know a couple of things about
0:03:00 vampires from stories and movies one
0:03:04 thing that they don't mess around with
0:03:05 is the sun that's that's straight up the
0:03:08 way it is if you see the sun it's gonna
0:03:12 be bad like skin bursting into flames
0:03:15 that thing inside you that you can
0:03:18 already hear scratching around is going
0:03:20 to be freaking out it's gonna take over
0:03:22 the thing that freaks out
0:03:25 when fires around and you got a kid fire
0:03:28 is also bad they call it the beasts
0:03:31 sometimes not really a bigger fire than
0:03:33 the Sun but never like never Sunset not
0:03:37 Sunrise you got a hard Dawn curfew in
0:03:41 fact I I even know a couple of them that
0:03:43 are uh that'll that'll see a video or a
0:03:46 picture of the Sun and freak out yeah
0:03:48 you're probably not that bad but
0:03:50 just you're gonna want to go to bed
0:03:53 anyways you'll probably be tired it'll
0:03:55 feel natural yeah you'll be okay I don't
0:03:57 believe you'll be able to resist there's
0:03:59 there's a pretty strong instinctual
0:04:01 drive to fall asleep at once the Sun
0:04:04 starts to Peak the important lesson here
0:04:07 just keep an eye on what time it is and
0:04:10 make sure whatever you're doing you got
0:04:12 an exit strategy to get somewhere like
0:04:14 miles place for now since you're under
0:04:16 my accounting this will be until you
0:04:18 establish your own place where you'll be
0:04:19 staying for the most part situations
0:04:22 buying otherwise the worst places to
0:04:24 stay my fridge okay well that's you
0:04:28 could keep bringing it up it's just
0:04:29 weird I'm very proud how often have you
0:04:32 slept in your own fridge I'm gonna guess
0:04:34 once or twice at least but half a dozen
0:04:37 times over the years that's more than I
0:04:38 expected is that good does the cold
0:04:40 prevent no no no it's just a weird thing
0:04:43 that wind does yeah yes eventually
0:04:45 you'll start parsing out it's just
0:04:47 weirdo behavior and what's regular
0:04:49 sometimes when you're moving around the
0:04:50 road the best the best place to to uh
0:04:53 hide is in like a walk-in or one of
0:04:55 those big uh freezer cap chests
0:05:00 the sun proof people don't tend to look
0:05:02 at them if it's one that's been sitting
0:05:04 in a basement somewhere I will
0:05:05 definitely take your word on that one I
0:05:07 mean Johnny moves along a lot better
0:05:08 than I do it's also another barrier
0:05:10 between ghosts and if I really have had
0:05:13 enough of them do fridges keep ghosts
0:05:16 out there's not enough room for them to
0:05:17 come in and bother me they're limited
0:05:19 okay space sometimes you know what I'm
0:05:21 not gonna argue
0:05:23 Windows a lot more about ghosts than I
0:05:25 do but so the people that are coming
0:05:27 they're all right with being fed off
0:05:29 they they're they're being paid they
0:05:32 they understand or they don't they don't
0:05:34 understand almost on cue miles your
0:05:38 guests arrive
0:05:40 they gather over in the Parlor space
0:05:42 they start relaxing this music playing
0:05:44 have a few drinks it looks like they're
0:05:47 already making themselves comfortable
0:05:49 here's the deal kid I'm one of these
0:05:51 suckers that wants some attention from a
0:05:55 girl give them just enough attention to
0:05:57 get them get them somewhere private and
0:05:59 then just be real gentle about it one of
0:06:02 us will keep an eye on you to make sure
0:06:03 things don't get out of hand
0:06:05 you just mean gentle about just sip it
0:06:09 your drinks don't take shots
0:06:11 you get me I I think I understand take
0:06:15 less than you feel like you can
0:06:17 okay
0:06:18 and if you feel that thing inside you
0:06:20 start crawling up
0:06:22 you stop immediately okay so come and go
0:06:26 for a little bit and see how it goes
0:06:28 We're not gonna let anything happen to
0:06:29 you this time they'll probably play some
0:06:31 music too it'll keep the noise up and
0:06:33 there'll be some activity Johnny's
0:06:35 definitely giving her a hard like
0:06:36 nervous glance because he knows how this
0:06:38 can go won't they remember not typically
0:06:43 there is a process to it when you're
0:06:46 done feeding you should
0:06:48 lick the area lick it it will
0:06:52 for all intents and purposes make the
0:06:54 marks disappear the puncture wounds not
0:06:57 like the general area around you good
0:07:00 good clarification then I mean I don't
0:07:02 want to take anything for granted that's
0:07:04 fair enough take your time I'm gonna go
0:07:06 make some introductions and get them
0:07:07 feeling good about this okay
0:07:11 if you want someone to just kind of have
0:07:14 your back
0:07:15 when you're ready to go just wink at me
0:07:17 and I'll just make sure
0:07:19 right someone's with you ready to go
0:07:22 ready to set ready ready to sip thank
0:07:26 you thank you one yeah it's it's a
0:07:29 little scary given what you've already
0:07:30 been through but you're this is going to
0:07:32 be a very different experience this time
0:07:33 when while you're talking to Bretta and
0:07:37 giving her advice and when you say just
0:07:40 give me a wink
0:07:41 her eyes start to dilate and as she's
0:07:45 done kind of saying her bit
0:07:47 she just
0:07:48 speaks us out completely from the
0:07:50 conversation
0:07:52 brother
0:07:53 [Music]
0:07:57 Brita
0:07:59 you come to sing an individual give you
0:08:02 a quick wink and a smile and the two of
0:08:06 you are relaxed together at what looks
0:08:10 to be some sort of uh space that has
0:08:12 been created to serve as a firing range
0:08:14 what is unusual about this
0:08:17 is that here in this place there is no
0:08:20 color
0:08:21 everything is in Grays and blacks and
0:08:24 the figures that are set up in the
0:08:27 distance for you to take aim at largely
0:08:30 consists of like Stone busts that have
0:08:33 been prepared
0:08:34 there's no color in the place which is
0:08:38 without color and your vision oh but I
0:08:41 will immediately look to her hands do
0:08:43 they move within her you look at your
0:08:46 hands and you find that you're wearing
0:08:47 these fingerless gloves and in your hand
0:08:51 is like a very simple Glock you kind of
0:08:54 like make some quick adjustments you
0:08:56 check the weapon it's all like a very
0:08:58 natural flow to you and the individual
0:09:00 that's next to you gives a nod of
0:09:02 approval this person has completely Eben
0:09:07 skin very short crop hair a thick beard
0:09:11 after he gives you that knot of approval
0:09:13 it's like very good no you must exhale
0:09:17 and squeeze the trigger rather than
0:09:19 pulling it take your time
0:09:21 you're unnatural at this do I find that
0:09:23 I had any control over my actions or was
0:09:26 this mother looked at your hands but
0:09:29 beyond that it it has a very dreamlike
0:09:33 sensation to it and then you return to
0:09:37 your conversation with win who's staring
0:09:39 at you wide-eyed and Confused
0:09:42 foreign
0:09:45 [Music]
0:09:51 what happened hon
0:09:53 you didn't see that
0:09:55 I'm gonna have to say no
0:09:57 what did you see
0:10:00 um maybe this is a thing that happens
0:10:02 sometimes um everything went
0:10:05 everything went gray and um
0:10:08 I could kind of look around uh there was
0:10:11 a man there I I didn't recognize him
0:10:14 and um
0:10:16 I was going to a shooting range
0:10:20 like for for guns yeah I was holding I
0:10:23 was holding a Glock and
0:10:26 he seemed
0:10:28 happy
0:10:30 about that okay I might
0:10:33 this this is part of
0:10:36 part of the night right
0:10:38 there's a lot of individualized
0:10:40 experiences that we have that's not one
0:10:42 I think I've heard of maybe uh doesn't
0:10:46 come to mind immediately you know
0:10:49 I have heard tell that uh some of the
0:10:52 older ones a lot of time a lot of times
0:10:54 of uh miles Clan
0:10:56 you can mess around with uh people's
0:10:59 memories get inside your head and strip
0:11:02 things out did it feel like a memory it
0:11:05 felt like a dream I don't know I don't
0:11:07 know if uh the torreador can do that is
0:11:09 that a known ability for The Toreador
0:11:12 like I said I I don't have too much uh
0:11:16 interaction with your bloodline it might
0:11:19 be able to do that as well what
0:11:22 did I look like did was I I was still
0:11:26 here you're you were still here you're
0:11:30 pupils blew and uh you just didn't seem
0:11:33 like you were here anymore you were
0:11:35 physically here I think you're gonna
0:11:36 start to see to have moments like that
0:11:38 more and more often good
0:11:40 um just try to roll the punches on those
0:11:42 yeah I um I try to keep and I have them
0:11:46 I guess yeah
0:11:49 is this something I could make an occult
0:11:50 role to investigate
0:11:53 yes just you okay this age should draw
0:11:58 the connection two successes with two
0:12:01 successes you know that the underworld
0:12:03 is a place for that color the underworld
0:12:06 is in organized or shadowlands okay so
0:12:09 I'll come back over
0:12:10 oh you seem to be ready
0:12:13 yeah flamingling and such and uh
0:12:15 if you're feeling well let them play a
0:12:17 couple songs or two and then they'll go
0:12:18 from there did something happen
0:12:21 I think so we can we could talk about it
0:12:24 now or we can put it off till later
0:12:26 that's your flashbacks
0:12:28 you shaking kid or are you with us I'm
0:12:31 I'm here I just uh well if we have to
0:12:34 wait for them to play a couple songs
0:12:37 anyway should we not talk about it or is
0:12:38 this something that I'm gonna feel free
0:12:40 but good flashbacks makes me confident
0:12:43 that possibly your memory will come back
0:12:45 before I wasn't sure if that had just
0:12:47 splintered I'm not even sure if it was a
0:12:51 memory I mean
0:12:52 it felt like me but it felt like a dream
0:12:56 the um
0:13:00 when it starts breaking the reports for
0:13:04 what experiences can be like when they
0:13:06 when when that can change uh it varies
0:13:09 okay the fact that you said it was black
0:13:11 and white yes
0:13:14 indicates
0:13:15 um underworld Shadowland involvement
0:13:19 like ghosts yeah
0:13:21 possibly look it's like I said these
0:13:25 things don't happen more and more often
0:13:26 and we got a party that's going on out
0:13:28 there and you're starting to sound like
0:13:30 you're trying to get out of this so I'm
0:13:32 gonna push you in the deep end kid let's
0:13:33 move
0:13:35 wait just a minute Neil reaches into his
0:13:38 pocket and pulls out like a little
0:13:40 nylon zip up coin purse and pulls out
0:13:43 like a 1969 quarter
0:13:46 um and hands it over
0:13:48 she takes it uh there's like a little
0:13:49 scratch mark across the front sometimes
0:13:52 uh
0:13:53 I don't know what you guys are really
0:13:55 talking about here with Channel lens and
0:13:57 stuff but sometimes when you sort of
0:13:59 freak out sometimes when you start
0:14:01 seeing things that aren't there
0:14:02 it helps to keep you grounded
0:14:05 uh keep you in the moment so if if
0:14:08 Johnny's right and this kind of stuff
0:14:09 does keep happening more often just
0:14:13 try and try and maintain your sense of
0:14:15 reality as much as possible it's these
0:14:18 little little tokens of of grounding
0:14:21 they can they can help keep you in the
0:14:24 real world focusing on the coin when
0:14:27 things get bad
0:14:28 yeah
0:14:29 or just
0:14:31 if you ever hit a point where you're not
0:14:34 sure what's real and what's not you know
0:14:36 having these objects that ground you in
0:14:38 the real
0:14:40 take a note
0:14:41 thank you Neil I'll I'll keep this with
0:14:44 me sure yeah yeah uh but Johnny's right
0:14:46 you you gotta go feed no Johnny Johnny
0:14:49 you are yep um oh I'll go try it's
0:14:53 better to do it before you're hungry
0:14:57 okay everybody's made that mistake and
0:15:00 can make sure that that doesn't happen
0:15:01 to you that'd be great
0:15:04 okay you guys uh you guys have fun
0:15:07 and Neil opens the door to the porch and
0:15:10 walks outside
0:15:12 he's not much of a people person
0:15:17 [Music]
0:15:20 Neil
0:15:21 outside he kind of hear miles is
0:15:24 commentary on your way out don't really
0:15:27 argue it I like to think of myself as a
0:15:29 people person
0:15:31 but outside it's kind of quiet starry
0:15:33 night it's cold clouds have largely
0:15:35 power parted the there isn't really much
0:15:38 in the way of traffic out this way I'm
0:15:40 gonna walk out into the yard I know that
0:15:42 Miles has a private yard with a lot of
0:15:45 trees sort of open up in the sky I'm
0:15:47 just gonna walk out and as I'm walking
0:15:48 I'm gonna do that awkward thing where
0:15:50 you take your shoes off while you're
0:15:51 still walking uh and then strip my socks
0:15:54 off and just stand in the yard with my
0:15:57 bare feet in the dirt it is very cold
0:15:59 they're like kind of clumps of kind of
0:16:02 soggy snow
0:16:03 that cling between your toes but it
0:16:06 feels like this is this is what you need
0:16:07 it's working I open up the same coin
0:16:10 purse that I took out and it has one of
0:16:12 those inside zippers
0:16:14 and I open the inside zipper and pull
0:16:16 out a uh Susan B Anthony uh coin it has
0:16:21 sort of a reddish tint to it like it's
0:16:23 dirty Neil just puts it into his mouth
0:16:26 looks up in the stars and his cheeks
0:16:29 swell for a second this small trickle of
0:16:32 blood comes out of one Corner's mouth
0:16:34 and kind of wipes it away and his eyes
0:16:36 dilate to the point where you can't see
0:16:38 the whites anymore it's just all black
0:16:41 and he looks directly up at the sky
0:16:44 tell me what's gonna happen huh what do
0:16:48 you have to show me give me a roll all
0:16:51 right and I will blow a little power for
0:16:53 this uh that is five successes which is
0:16:58 um I mean technically any potential
0:17:01 future within a century but uh feel free
0:17:04 to narrow that down I'm asking for the
0:17:06 next year or so okay you get a lot all
0:17:08 at once yeah and as you parse through
0:17:13 this barrage of possible Futures you see
0:17:17 a handful of things that stand out to
0:17:19 you
0:17:20 you have a vision of Johnny holding a
0:17:24 girl sobbing
0:17:26 broken who the girl is though is unclear
0:17:29 the next thing you see is a group of you
0:17:32 walking into Elysium Elsa Linden's
0:17:35 beautiful eyes go wide with panic
0:17:39 as
0:17:40 someone is unceremoniously tossed into
0:17:44 the Elysium who threw them in it's
0:17:46 unclear but this person lands in coughs
0:17:50 Breathing heavily as if sedated and as
0:17:54 he starts to Rouse with a circle of
0:17:57 Kindred confused concerned Kindred
0:17:59 gathering around him his body jerks and
0:18:02 spasms as muscle expands and Bone cracks
0:18:08 and then
0:18:10 you see
0:18:12 three Scions
0:18:14 individuals with a third glowing eye
0:18:16 like a pearl more than an actual like
0:18:19 human eye battling against a many faced
0:18:23 demon over a raging Storm
0:18:27 and then you see a great red baleful eye
0:18:33 and then you come to
0:18:35 Neil continues to stand for a while
0:18:38 looking at the stars
0:18:41 hearing the secrets that whisper to him
0:18:43 and even though he doesn't have to
0:18:44 breathe he takes a calming breath
0:18:47 forcing air into his dead lungs and
0:18:50 expelling it he's been out here long
0:18:52 enough that his body is the same
0:18:53 temperature as the air so there's not
0:18:55 even a hint of steam he blinks his eyes
0:18:58 trying to Blink away the two bright
0:19:01 night slowly the world starts to come
0:19:03 back into focus and he can hear the
0:19:05 music coming from inside and then we'll
0:19:08 turn around and just sort of Walk In A
0:19:11 Daze back into the house forgetting his
0:19:14 shoes outside just leave them out there
0:19:16 just not even considering that he took
0:19:18 them off in the first place definitely
0:19:20 not considering that miles is probably
0:19:22 gonna be mad when he just tracks mud
0:19:23 straight through his house and walks
0:19:25 down there and gets into the shower
0:19:27 every so many steps you find yourself
0:19:31 reminded of the many-faced demon and
0:19:33 when you turn on the shower you'd
0:19:35 hear the water start to go and you see
0:19:39 it again and again and again
0:19:43 and though the power of Heaven and Earth
0:19:46 has already flown through you and moved
0:19:48 on
0:19:49 you still find yourself a tomb of the
0:19:52 heavens
0:19:53 this connection you feel something pull
0:19:56 on it as it starts to stir and you find
0:19:59 yourself pondering a cave far far far
0:20:02 away reaching up from this this tomb is
0:20:06 the decrepit black Shard hand of a child
0:20:10 and then you take a shower
0:20:13 thinking about a tiny black charred hand
0:20:17 rising out of a tomb Neil lays down in
0:20:20 the shower and scoots as far away from
0:20:22 the drain as he possibly can and just
0:20:25 curls up in the fetal position and lets
0:20:28 the water hit him
0:20:30 trying not to see patterns in the water
0:20:32 and closes his eyes as much as he's
0:20:35 capable you find it very difficult to
0:20:38 turn it off yeah
0:20:42 [Music]
0:20:45 miles
0:20:46 you are approached by your man's servant
0:20:51 who informs you that your guest has
0:20:54 ruined the floor completely
0:20:57 and wishes to know how you would like
0:20:59 this result uh keep an eye on him he
0:21:02 went to do something that Mercy has
0:21:05 wandered off to the shower I don't know
0:21:06 if that would necessarily be appropriate
0:21:09 well I meant if he stays in there a long
0:21:11 period of time Neil is odd so
0:21:15 how long should I wait before I watch
0:21:16 him shower
0:21:18 if it's still running by Sun
0:21:20 up ah she gets understood otherwise
0:21:23 please just do what you can about the
0:21:25 floor yes I will berate him later
0:21:27 thank you he turns
0:21:30 and heads off to take care so if you
0:21:33 want I can check on him that's
0:21:35 that's not a problem
0:21:36 you don't have to watch him shower it's
0:21:38 two of you do with your free time is
0:21:40 entirely up to you I will see to the
0:21:42 floor
0:21:45 [Laughter]
0:21:51 as an aside do you do you worry about
0:21:53 your water bill no okay sorry about
0:21:56 bills
0:21:58 some people have bills I don't
0:22:01 [ __ ] bedroom
0:22:02 [Laughter]
0:22:05 come on let's go
0:22:12 miles
0:22:13 you're relaxing you're chatting with
0:22:15 everyone it looks like there are a
0:22:17 couple of bottles of wine into the night
0:22:19 and everyone's having a great time
0:22:21 fantastic I will I mean I'll keep an eye
0:22:24 out but I need to start feeding myself
0:22:25 yeah honestly they're not even
0:22:27 interested in the weird mud tracks that
0:22:29 have gone through the location so
0:22:31 they're they're definitely at a point
0:22:33 now where they're probably ready for
0:22:34 feeding right good good I will start
0:22:37 myself you know use a little bit of I
0:22:40 mean basically just John moving away
0:22:41 normal like and if it ever comes up to
0:22:44 being a problem I will then use a form
0:22:47 of dominate on them okay why don't you
0:22:49 just give me uh a quick manipulation and
0:22:52 Leadership start to guide them along
0:22:56 the difficulty is normally five so
0:22:59 that's six seven dice seven successes
0:23:02 fabulous you're like this one and You
0:23:04 Begin leading them off but as you're
0:23:07 watching this mouse very quickly and
0:23:09 casually just kind of Scoops up his Mark
0:23:12 and they wander off for more of a
0:23:15 private chat away from everyone else
0:23:16 Roberta watches this happen uh sort of
0:23:19 unconsciously flipping the coin over and
0:23:22 her fingers and rubbing along the the
0:23:24 scratch in it she is trying to not
0:23:29 stare but she's watching his process and
0:23:33 staring she is just I think I'll throw a
0:23:36 wink at her on the way through and yeah
0:23:38 as you're going by buddy you can
0:23:39 definitely tell she's gawking and
0:23:40 uncomfortable right just like
0:23:42 essentially like the thumbs up like
0:23:44 Johnny will sneak up behind Britta and
0:23:46 kind of like elbow her uh and lean in
0:23:50 and be like hey middle part and
0:23:52 cardigan's been staring at you all night
0:23:54 it's gonna be easy that guy over there
0:23:56 yeah okay yeah
0:23:59 um thanks Johnny I I'll I'll give it a
0:24:01 go he just kind of like casually like
0:24:04 just turns stop stops looking at her and
0:24:06 moves off somewhere else when uh kind of
0:24:09 sizes up which one of them is most
0:24:10 likely to have weed on them I'm assuming
0:24:12 she finds the drummer
0:24:14 um
0:24:14 okay first of all
0:24:18 your drummer senses are tingling yep
0:24:21 um she just kind of
0:24:25 get outside
0:24:28 encouraging smile and she stays closer
0:24:30 to a window so Brenna can call for her
0:24:32 if need be the guy that win approaches
0:24:34 halfway through her suggestion they go
0:24:36 outside he's like checking his pockets
0:24:38 to remember where he keeps it and is
0:24:41 getting up to follow her out it looks
0:24:43 like your friend miles
0:24:45 has taken great many steps to ensuring
0:24:48 that this this controlled area is has
0:24:53 The Mortals that are present the kind
0:24:55 primed for feeding Brita tries to smile
0:24:58 back to win but it is uh just not
0:25:01 reaching the eyes she she starts
0:25:04 realizing all right
0:25:05 uh it's time it's time to do something
0:25:09 she tries to fix her hair nothing is
0:25:12 right it starts pacing kind of towards
0:25:16 middle part and cardigan but chicken's
0:25:19 out halfway through and uh walks back to
0:25:21 the other end of the room
0:25:23 question
0:25:24 I have for appearance uh for appearance
0:25:28 I have doe eyed as in deer in headlights
0:25:31 I imagine that's super relevant at the
0:25:34 moment yeah yeah
0:25:36 uh give me
0:25:39 um an appearance and do you have uh do
0:25:43 you have leadership there I have two
0:25:44 leadership yeah sure so you have an
0:25:46 appearance rating of four you have
0:25:48 leadership two you're gonna go ahead and
0:25:49 roll six dice your difficulty is five
0:25:52 and because your specialty is
0:25:54 appropriate you will your specialty will
0:25:57 apply
0:26:01 successes and then the cardigan that
0:26:03 you've targeted gives a very confident
0:26:06 smile and as though he were in control
0:26:09 of the situation and not pray himself
0:26:12 he approaches you leans one elbow up
0:26:15 against the doorway and says to you I am
0:26:18 Keith Brita tries to match his posture
0:26:21 she uh puts her elbow on the doorway but
0:26:23 kind of Misses yeah he like adjusts his
0:26:25 elbow when your elbow gets too close to
0:26:27 his elbow as you encroach on his elbow
0:26:30 space uh she sees him kind of move back
0:26:33 and she makes eye contact with him he
0:26:37 makes eye contact with her
0:26:38 hi I'm
0:26:40 leaving what uh he kind of like
0:26:44 very subtly smells himself as you wander
0:26:48 off
0:26:57 whichever bottle of wine is hidden in
0:27:00 the least accessible Corner she's
0:27:02 definitely trying to avoid the rest of
0:27:04 her kind and uh
0:27:06 try to support herself a drink you very
0:27:10 easily pour yourself a a nice glass of
0:27:13 wine
0:27:15 hard to miss the fact that Johnny who
0:27:17 was sitting on the couch talking to the
0:27:18 girl in leather in the leather jacket is
0:27:20 sitting there like with this angry
0:27:22 expression of what the [ __ ] dude do I
0:27:25 see that
0:27:26 you see it but it doesn't count uh
0:27:31 brought her into seeing the fact that I
0:27:33 am upset
0:27:35 offensive off
0:27:38 um what's a role on that
0:27:42 is it like performance Charisma
0:27:44 something like that sure sounds no one
0:27:47 told me
0:27:50 it's true
0:27:51 so many black spots I love it
0:27:54 if you don't have performances what is a
0:27:56 minus one plus one diff plus one diff
0:27:58 okay uh difficulty this feels exactly
0:28:02 like how a feed scene would go for me no
0:28:06 he just waves his arms to no avail as
0:28:10 you with dogged determination stare at
0:28:14 your glass of wine
0:28:15 I'm gonna take a set all right you take
0:28:18 a sip can I take a look at your
0:28:19 character sheet please are you looking
0:28:21 for the mirror eat food because it's not
0:28:22 there
0:28:25 that's what I'm looking for
0:28:28 for the rest of you for those who are in
0:28:31 the room and not in the shower so
0:28:35 um you see her gulp down wine as as the
0:28:39 wine comes up Johnny leans back in the
0:28:41 chair and puts his boot up wind kind of
0:28:43 catches catches a glimpse of this
0:28:46 through the window and her eyes just get
0:28:47 real white oh no Marcos just looks
0:28:50 panicked if it's possible for wind to
0:28:53 wrap on the window in time too late and
0:28:58 you feel you drink the wine and it
0:29:02 tastes like soot in your mouth as you
0:29:06 swallow it and then your innards
0:29:10 tremble violently and you spew this mess
0:29:15 out of your mouth onto the couch onto
0:29:19 Keith who is attempting to salvage the
0:29:21 situation and approaching you
0:29:23 hello and the room goes quiet you hear
0:29:27 the music cut and everyone is just very
0:29:32 quiet and awkward except for Johnny who
0:29:35 has his boots up
0:29:38 uh as everyone's staring what came out
0:29:43 you're not sure it looks like more wine
0:29:47 came out than went in
0:29:50 I like can you lose blood traits by
0:29:52 throwing up find out
0:29:55 you haven't done this in a while
0:29:57 so I I looked at Keith first since uh
0:30:01 that's who I got with this you see him
0:30:04 wiping this wine from his eyes with a
0:30:09 semi-frightened bewildered yet curious
0:30:13 expression on him Keith I'm so sorry
0:30:15 that's why I had to go I'm gonna go
0:30:18 right now I'm and I just the way he says
0:30:22 as you flee I
0:30:25 what's the nearest like is there a
0:30:27 closet of some sort like like ideal like
0:30:30 I imagine I'm opening
0:30:32 miles
0:30:37 or they start getting a little woozy you
0:30:40 lay them down on the love seat in there
0:30:44 in the hallway just someone is rattling
0:30:47 every doorknob as they're like going
0:30:50 down this hallway I open it up Brita
0:30:52 describe what he sees so you see Bretta
0:30:55 and she probably she would have tried to
0:30:59 wipe her mouth but you should probably
0:31:00 miss something she's still holding uh
0:31:03 the wine glass it's probably has Spilled
0:31:06 Out a little bit at this point I imagine
0:31:08 she's still holding the bottle as well
0:31:10 kind of just starts when you open the
0:31:12 door she wasn't expecting
0:31:14 she didn't know she didn't know what she
0:31:16 was expecting she just wanted to leave
0:31:17 and so you open the door I'm I'm sorry
0:31:21 stop
0:31:25 get a hold of yourself
0:31:26 okay
0:31:28 okay
0:31:29 um
0:31:30 what has gone wrong
0:31:31 I don't think I'm feeling well I must
0:31:34 have gotten
0:31:35 did you try to drink that
0:31:38 wine yeah well we did forget to warn you
0:31:42 well I I closed the door
0:31:45 we can't eat or drink normal things
0:31:48 our body rejects it unless you make
0:31:51 special effort to take it in and even
0:31:53 then you will later reject it
0:31:56 just know
0:31:58 food ever we all try it at least once
0:32:02 and you notice that it suffered from not
0:32:04 having taste or tasted awful it tasted
0:32:07 like
0:32:09 that's kind of a safety mechanism to
0:32:11 sell it
0:32:13 makes you not want to keep trying it
0:32:16 yeah no I am I really am I I could take
0:32:20 the bottle from her I take the wine
0:32:23 glass
0:32:24 I assume you were not successful so far
0:32:26 no look miles
0:32:28 um I think I can just stop I think we
0:32:30 could do this later I sent to yourself
0:32:33 it is control it's Paramount I'm
0:32:36 centered miles it's just that I don't
0:32:38 think that we should do this right now
0:32:40 if I can just skip a night or something
0:32:42 like that do you remember why you were
0:32:45 brought in
0:32:47 yes do you want that to happen again
0:32:52 no then you need to do these under
0:32:54 controlled circumstances when you're not
0:32:56 starving
0:32:58 otherwise you will kill again
0:33:02 is the guy still in the room no you you
0:33:05 bailed no sorry his guy I closed the
0:33:08 door yeah okay
0:33:11 okay
0:33:13 look
0:33:15 this is tough but it is also necessary
0:33:18 this is the most controlled circumstance
0:33:21 that I can put you under most don't get
0:33:23 it to the same degree so much is left
0:33:25 offended to themselves to a certain
0:33:26 amount
0:33:27 you need in this Paramount you need to
0:33:32 master this it is one of the most basic
0:33:34 things
0:33:35 okay
0:33:37 all right I'm
0:33:40 I'm gonna go change shirts and I'll be
0:33:44 right back I'm sure Marcos will help you
0:33:46 once he has done cleaning up wherever
0:33:49 that originally happened
0:33:51 Greta puts her hands over her face uh
0:33:54 but is it a good lesson
0:33:56 you can yet again Focus that blood to
0:33:59 your system if you do need to pose like
0:34:01 you're eating or drinking something like
0:34:03 it is another effect the blood can do
0:34:06 just in case
0:34:08 what do you mean
0:34:09 sometimes you have to pose like you're
0:34:11 eating in like a normal person and what
0:34:14 just keep it in it no you can keep it
0:34:18 it'll stay inside you for
0:34:20 a little while
0:34:22 okay
0:34:24 all right um thank you nope these things
0:34:27 happen
0:34:28 just remember don't let it defeat you
0:34:31 send to yourself come back in I'm sure
0:34:33 whoever it is we'll forgive you
0:34:36 and she turns away sort of squares her
0:34:40 shoulders and uh
0:34:42 looks for Marcos to find another shirt
0:34:45 you find Marcos I'm sure the party move
0:34:49 to a different room after that yeah
0:34:50 Johnny Johnny actually tries to push the
0:34:52 party to move out into the Porsche for
0:34:54 cigarettes or something like that yeah
0:34:55 they go out uh wind wanders off and is
0:34:58 like LED away from this guy that's still
0:35:00 trying to get her high and Marcos is
0:35:04 down there like just dabbing and trying
0:35:07 to clean as as much as he can uh their
0:35:11 Keith is still there next to him saying
0:35:14 hey do you think she's okay I'm kind of
0:35:16 worried about her Berta will come in and
0:35:19 she'll see first Marcos trying to clean
0:35:21 it up but she'll notice Keith after but
0:35:24 I have to have a first immediate impulse
0:35:26 of
0:35:27 Marcos I'm I'm so sorry uh hi hi Keith
0:35:32 I'm I'm really uh
0:35:36 um maybe we could put it through the
0:35:37 washing machine or um
0:35:39 Brenda this is a couch
0:35:42 ah yes of course
0:35:45 long suffering cool
0:35:48 well uh where did that bottle of wine go
0:35:51 um I think it's about my cue to come in
0:35:53 with the glass in the line yeah thank
0:35:55 you Marcos I know it is a lot but she
0:35:58 needs another shirt uh sir why don't you
0:36:01 move out Keith Keith why don't you move
0:36:03 out to your friends for now just let
0:36:05 things settle down yeah if you need
0:36:07 anything
0:36:08 he goes and he starts wandering off I
0:36:11 put a hand on Marcus Jordan I said thank
0:36:13 you very much to help her out first
0:36:15 night gym and we'll do everything I can
0:36:16 Mouse thank you so um I didn't ruin the
0:36:20 couch
0:36:21 okay I'll just give her own are we
0:36:23 giving up on this couch then I'll leave
0:36:25 it up to your professional opinion
0:36:28 uh he grumbles and he just kind of goes
0:36:30 back to
0:36:31 trying to see should first we'll save
0:36:32 the capsules
0:36:34 we can always replace it all right he
0:36:36 heads off to go get a shirt I put the
0:36:38 bottle back there I'm like
0:36:40 it's no savings account
0:36:43 the couch actually does not look that
0:36:45 bad
0:36:47 it's just imperfect oh I don't think I
0:36:49 noticed that there's no way like the
0:36:52 couch is ruined to me
0:36:54 it doesn't matter if it's like
0:36:56 impeccable I have done this
0:37:00 uh there's no going back to that couch
0:37:02 yeah once I you know I got I change I uh
0:37:07 take a deep breath once again do some
0:37:09 pacing yeah you got like a nice I love
0:37:11 New York t-shirt
0:37:14 I'm running out of Good t-shirts
0:37:16 like try to tie it up on the side knot
0:37:19 it make it look a little cute but um all
0:37:23 right I looked where the party has moved
0:37:25 to the porch and I will drag my feet out
0:37:30 there as you head out the crowd of
0:37:33 people that have been chatting and
0:37:36 talking about who knows what suddenly
0:37:38 gets very quiet the moment you step
0:37:40 outside
0:37:41 kind of look around at that and uh
0:37:44 try to smile
0:37:46 kind of Nod at a couple people and walk
0:37:49 across to something is wind still uh can
0:37:53 she see her come out and the party die
0:37:55 she just yells puff puff pass
0:37:58 [ __ ] and to try and draw
0:38:00 attention away from her
0:38:02 yeah honestly a couple of people kind of
0:38:04 make their way over they start they're
0:38:06 smelling what's going on they're curious
0:38:08 they're musicians and by the time you
0:38:10 get back onto the porch Johnny is is
0:38:12 absent with the uh the woman in the
0:38:14 leather jacket that he was chatting up
0:38:16 no no Safe Haven with a Johnny out there
0:38:21 you gotta mingle now
0:38:22 so I make my way over to one of the uh
0:38:27 corners of the porch and try to scope
0:38:31 out like all right who looks the least
0:38:34 judgmental is basically her thought here
0:38:38 it is not a good scene for that right
0:38:41 now no I think we're gonna move the
0:38:43 party in and try to soften the overall
0:38:44 experience we'll move it to another room
0:38:46 yeah it's just it's like from outside
0:38:48 it's like a range between amusement and
0:38:50 pity
0:38:51 and it's unclear as to which of those
0:38:54 feels better yeah well if we soften up a
0:38:56 bit but I need to buy another person too
0:38:58 I don't have forever smoking happens
0:39:02 now that everyone is kind of going
0:39:03 outside it's really cold they start to
0:39:06 disperse and all of the shifting around
0:39:09 has the evening winding down at this
0:39:11 point no I gotta grab another one before
0:39:13 is when able to get a decent meal out of
0:39:16 this guy absolutely all right is he
0:39:18 conscious enough to notice if I take his
0:39:20 weed no okay she just kind of takes it
0:39:23 Pockets it I'll try to talk to someone
0:39:25 who's expressing uh more Amusement is
0:39:29 there someone who in particular struck
0:39:31 me as like
0:39:32 not really uh
0:39:35 maybe just pitying me Keith yeah
0:39:41 okay he's committed now oh he's
0:39:43 committed now so how's this going am I
0:39:46 like trying to talk to people and is he
0:39:48 like is he following me or how's he
0:39:51 how's he doing
0:39:53 yeah he's definitely doing like the uh
0:39:56 he he seems to have nominated himself as
0:39:59 your designated caretaker for the
0:40:01 evening and it keeps kind of like
0:40:03 insinuating his way into conversations
0:40:05 very subtly checking on you kind of
0:40:08 nagging
0:40:09 well Britta will try to talk to a couple
0:40:12 people she'll find it very discouraging
0:40:14 when people uh
0:40:16 when people act like amuse she tries to
0:40:20 laugh along with them kind of fails but
0:40:23 when people are more towards the scared
0:40:26 side that sets off her own fear and she
0:40:30 gets more and more tense and just less
0:40:35 socially capable to the point where she
0:40:38 has a couple of these conversations I
0:40:39 imagine
0:40:40 and
0:40:41 Keith butts in
0:40:43 and uh she circles all the way back
0:40:46 around to being willing to try to talk
0:40:47 to him so I imagine maybe maybe he cuts
0:40:51 in after someone walks away from her
0:40:53 when I think I feel like someone is is
0:40:57 being a little derisive about your
0:41:01 um incident and he actually kind of cuts
0:41:05 into the conversation so he can save you
0:41:08 and be like your social protector uh
0:41:11 when he does that
0:41:12 um thank him
0:41:14 thank you Keith I am really appreciate
0:41:17 that you um
0:41:19 don't think I'm gross
0:41:21 what in a way I don't think you're gross
0:41:23 at all really even after
0:41:26 fat that happens
0:41:29 sometimes
0:41:32 never happened to me before I don't
0:41:34 think
0:41:35 no I mean I don't really think it'd be
0:41:37 something that happens to you very much
0:41:39 you know
0:41:41 um
0:41:43 yeah
0:41:44 well what did how did you want your
0:41:47 night to go
0:41:48 uh he kind of like laughs awkwardly and
0:41:52 gives like a very bashful smile you know
0:41:54 I just I kind of wanted to meet someone
0:41:55 nice and I feel like I've done that you
0:41:58 know all in all this is pretty
0:42:00 this is you know
0:42:02 a pretty sick night
0:42:05 yeah I need to I need to go away from
0:42:07 being able to hear this at all
0:42:10 I just I just find someone it just pull
0:42:14 them away again Brita sort of does the
0:42:18 uncomfortable ditzy laugh that you do
0:42:20 like
0:42:23 yeah yeah
0:42:25 I think I know that one I think you're
0:42:27 cool uh thanks uh you you too
0:42:33 you like New York
0:42:35 um
0:42:37 I
0:42:39 um I love New York I'll move into
0:42:41 britta's ice eye line so that way if she
0:42:44 needs an extraction
0:42:46 this is so uncomfortable I'm so glad
0:42:48 that I'm in a like demon fetal position
0:42:51 coma right now it is a much more tenable
0:42:53 place to be the second one knows what
0:42:56 happens to young girls at parties
0:42:57 sometimes and she her alert is kind of
0:42:59 high at this point
0:43:10 um
0:43:11 you know
0:43:13 hey yo
0:43:15 you know I'm really
0:43:17 um don't really want to be around
0:43:19 you know people are being kind of mean
0:43:21 maybe we could just it's pretty sucks
0:43:24 they already said it
0:43:27 um do you want to just maybe go go to we
0:43:31 could talk for a bit in another room and
0:43:32 uh yeah yeah sure yeah okay okay
0:43:35 yeah lead the way um yeah you gotta hear
0:43:38 miles murmur his complaints about this
0:43:41 guy I I I probably walk by as I'm trying
0:43:44 to bring him to probably the same room
0:43:48 that I ran it into because I know that's
0:43:51 like safe it's deemed by miles to be an
0:43:53 acceptable feeding place
0:43:56 unconscious person
0:43:58 well the door opens and uh you find
0:44:02 someone napping on the couch
0:44:04 that makes Brita just too uncomfortable
0:44:07 and she closes the door and moves to
0:44:09 another room are small rooms
0:44:11 is everything okay oh there's just some
0:44:14 someone sleeping I don't I don't want to
0:44:16 wake them up oh you want like more
0:44:18 private okay Brita is just going wider
0:44:22 and wider eyes every time that she says
0:44:24 something unintentional and every time
0:44:26 she just
0:44:28 drop silent stares at him upstairs back
0:44:33 tries the ditzy laugh and continues to
0:44:37 find a room and you're actually finding
0:44:39 the ditzy laugh to be extremely
0:44:41 effective like whenever you think
0:44:43 something unusual is happening maybe he
0:44:44 might like have some self-doubt the
0:44:46 ditchy laugh puts him right back on
0:44:48 course that's Kryptonite that just makes
0:44:51 her worse
0:44:53 in my van
0:45:18 so much
0:45:20 everyone just feel it
0:45:26 belt so uh every time that it works she
0:45:29 just gets worse but I I eventually she
0:45:31 finds a room right yeah uh when that
0:45:34 Mom's old van pretty much the moment you
0:45:37 [Music]
0:45:39 lead him into a room
0:45:41 kind of like leans back shutting the
0:45:45 door
0:45:46 behind the two of you yeah yep and then
0:45:49 he locks it no
0:45:54 hey just you know don't want to be
0:45:56 interrupted
0:46:01 okay I don't
0:46:03 I don't want to make you uncomfortable
0:46:04 oh
0:46:05 if we could we could leave uh the door's
0:46:09 probably fine I think everyone's like
0:46:10 yeah it's fine
0:46:11 um so if we could and she will move to
0:46:14 unlock it he does not seem to understand
0:46:17 the the social cue that you were giving
0:46:19 him and he instead sees us this
0:46:22 opportunity to kind of like put hands on
0:46:25 her hips and try to kiss you
0:46:27 she will let him try to kiss her and
0:46:32 she'll try to kiss back but try to angle
0:46:36 for the neck and yeah he's like stops
0:46:40 and like there's like a bit of blood in
0:46:41 his life what the hell
0:46:43 oh
0:46:44 um
0:46:51 uh she looks back to him and she
0:46:55 pushes by him to try to unlock the door
0:46:57 Leaf he puts his hand up against the
0:46:59 door hey what the hell what's your
0:47:01 problem when starts running up the
0:47:03 stairs at hearing this like this is no
0:47:06 we're done
0:47:07 um I let me know when she can kick the
0:47:09 door okay
0:47:10 miles yeah when running through your
0:47:13 house
0:47:14 it is not a good sound I'm moving in
0:47:17 that general direction I hate replacing
0:47:20 doors and door frames I'm sorry
0:47:24 um no it's fine he goes to kiss you
0:47:25 again she'll tolerate it if he seems
0:47:30 like he'll let her try to again she'll
0:47:32 try to move for the neck
0:47:34 although I feel like yeah he kind of
0:47:36 he's very pushy so it's actually kind of
0:47:39 hard to like maneuver for the throat but
0:47:43 it does ultimately happen and the moment
0:47:46 you your fangs make contact against his
0:47:50 throat and like you can kind of feel his
0:47:52 his flesh give
0:47:55 he goes a little like limp again soon
0:47:58 kind of makes like a like uncomfortable
0:48:00 sounds and
0:48:01 just like leans into your bite oh no no
0:48:05 she takes her teeth out you're like cool
0:48:07 some blood like spatters and uh when you
0:48:11 make it to the door
0:48:13 um if I get tired enough to if she
0:48:15 starts I'm gonna listen real quick okay
0:48:17 and make sure that this this turned into
0:48:18 something successful I hear her go uh
0:48:22 she is limp how how is he uh well when
0:48:26 you stop he starts to kind of regain his
0:48:30 sense of self but in that moment when
0:48:32 you when you bit him he's kind of like
0:48:34 leaned in and gave himself over to the
0:48:36 sensation you were causing I will as if
0:48:39 I see him again sensation I will try to
0:48:42 lick the wound so when your fangs are in
0:48:44 him he's very like linguine at first
0:48:46 just like leaning into it and enjoying
0:48:48 it and then when you take the things off
0:48:50 of his neck there's this local
0:48:53 frustration
0:48:55 comes over him and he's like it's it's
0:48:58 something wrong and he does not seem to
0:49:00 have noticed but your incident has uh
0:49:03 smeared blood straight down his neck
0:49:05 onto his collar
0:49:07 successful looking know it yes okay
0:49:11 um I'm so sorry I think I'm gonna puke
0:49:13 again and I I should I it's okay what

0:53:30 when you feed
0:53:32 they just kind of give into it you gotta
0:53:34 understand that

0:54:11 what do we say we uh we put a pin in
0:54:14 this tonight
0:54:15 tomorrow night you gotta promise me
0:54:18 though
0:54:19 that you're gonna feed because we can't
0:54:21 have you running out of control
0:54:23 I I promise Johnny I I'll try I I will
0:54:28 feed tomorrow night wind comes and Taps
0:54:32 on the door and kind of looks out like
0:54:34 is this a good time you can't do it
0:54:36 gently
0:54:38 I'm gonna smash somebody's face in and
0:54:41 force feed you the blood
0:54:43 okay so if you want this to go well
0:54:47 you keep your promise
0:54:49 yeah he kind of waves to win it's good
0:54:55 big night
0:54:57 come here huh
0:54:58 and she just kind of puts an arm out
0:55:00 like for you to come
0:55:01 Greta does so hesitant hesitantly it's
0:55:04 all right that guy was an [ __ ] and
0:55:07 you showed a lot more self-control than
0:55:09 I would have
0:55:10 are you okay
0:55:12 yeah I'm okay
0:55:15 okay
0:55:17 we should have
0:55:18 figured out some way to do this with
0:55:21 someone else with you so that way we
0:55:23 could talk you through these hard
0:55:24 moments
0:55:25 I'm not always gonna have someone you're
0:55:30 not but you that's an option now and you
0:55:33 might be directly under miles's
0:55:35 accounting but we are all signed on for
0:55:37 this
0:55:39 and we want to see you succeed I always
0:55:41 figured you'd be more tough love with a
0:55:43 young one when
0:55:44 you're awfully awfully uh soft I
0:55:48 wouldn't Peg you to be someone to coddle
0:55:49 somebody
0:55:51 this isn't coddling so much you've never
0:55:53 been a woman vampire Johnny
0:55:56 ain't that the truth
0:55:58 this is a tough world and you are gonna
0:56:00 have to feed
0:56:01 I'll do it tomorrow yep well it's not
0:56:04 going to be an option after tomorrow
0:56:07 because you're going to get into
0:56:08 yourself into a rough place
0:56:10 but we will be there to make sure it
0:56:12 goes and then you can learn all the
0:56:14 sensations at once
0:56:16 they always go limp like that yeah
0:56:19 it's actually a really good sign that he
0:56:21 went limp there are some people who
0:56:23 fight it
0:56:24 some Kindred who have this quality to
0:56:27 them that makes them fight and if you
0:56:29 don't have that that's that's really
0:56:31 good
0:56:32 it means that ultimately they
0:56:35 they're cool with it
0:56:37 they feel something that draws them
0:56:39 towards it you are taking from them
0:56:42 but I don't think you're causing them
0:56:44 pain
0:56:46 does that make it any easier
0:56:49 I'll try to think of it that way if that
0:56:52 doesn't work
0:56:53 think of it as
0:56:55 I don't know if this is going to help
0:56:56 it's you or them or both of you
0:56:59 it can still be both of you
0:57:02 okay
0:57:03 all right
0:57:05 I kind of just
0:57:08 want to go to bed
0:57:10 yeah it's about that time
0:57:13 as the night's really just about done
0:57:16 those who are fed from kind of gathered
0:57:19 Keith's a little confused with the new
0:57:21 shirt but whatever uh when asked about
0:57:24 why he's in a different shirt from one
0:57:26 of his friends as they leave he tells a
0:57:28 very different story about what got him
0:57:32 to that point
0:57:33 and the musicians wander off into the
0:57:37 night stumbling little drunk a little
0:57:40 anemic anemic
0:57:43 and
0:57:44 you're now at a point where the the
0:57:48 night the sky isn't quite as dark as it
0:57:52 was and the Sun is well on its way
0:57:55 let's find some places for you to sleep
0:57:58 uh when Johnny you're already starting
0:58:00 to kind of feel
0:58:02 the pull of the sun wait where's Neil I
0:58:06 will deal with him in a few minutes
0:58:08 let's get you guys situated I was gonna
0:58:10 head down to the basement for the night
0:58:11 anyway I the basement is where we're all
0:58:14 hitting okay and I will see what's going
0:58:17 on with that and if we need help we'll
0:58:19 go from there

0:58:23 super long shower who knows
