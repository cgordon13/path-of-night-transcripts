0:00:22 we want you to feel the same so listener
0:00:25 discretion is advised now let's walk the
0:00:29 path of night
0:00:31 last time on path of night at a gas
0:00:34 station near miles's Haven where it is
0:00:36 successfully fed for the very first time
0:00:38 wind led the Coterie through the woods
0:00:41 to deal with the monster in her fridge
0:00:42 opening up to her allies about the
0:00:44 troubling news that Clan Gangrel has
0:00:46 been dealing with in the dark
0:00:48 the former Gangrel primogen Raven
0:00:50 warned the Coterie of the return of the
0:00:53 Weeping bear a monstrous Savant War bull
0:00:55 that has stalked Kindred in the area for
0:00:57 years the coming Sabbat Crusade and the
0:00:59 looming threat of a Revenant in New
0:01:01 Haven named Davido zantosa at winds
0:01:04 Haven the Corduroy is attacked by the
0:01:06 Weeping bear and Johnny the first line
0:01:07 of defense in a fight falls under its
0:01:10 massive claws
0:01:13 of course over oh my God I'm gonna need
0:01:17 a self-control chat it's Johnny uh he
0:01:21 attempts to get out of the way uh when
0:01:23 it connects he crumbles to the ground
0:01:26 and you will notice
0:01:28 uh and you will notice those surviving
0:01:31 senses up but his body enters a
0:01:33 death-like state his skin becomes tight
0:01:35 to his flesh and he is just a corpse
0:01:38 lying on the ground my hair instances is
0:01:40 off unfortunately uh those of you who
0:01:42 are tight with Johnny I need a
0:01:43 self-control chain yep yep oh that is
0:01:46 not a good role for me
0:01:48 okay
0:01:49 or the difficulty what's success eight
0:01:52 I have no success yes okay I have one
0:01:55 success one success one success
0:01:57 okay
0:01:58 when
0:02:00 we go to friends go to bear I mean
0:02:03 seeing your friends
0:02:05 yeah by the Weeping bear uh all
0:02:09 rationale
0:02:10 is ejected from your thoughts and you
0:02:13 fly into a berserk frenzy uh I would
0:02:15 like you to choose a beast preacher
0:02:17 right now
0:02:18 because it is manifesting as you fly
0:02:20 into your Bible verse so as wind watches
0:02:23 Johnny fall to the ground
0:02:26 um there's nothing left of wind left in
0:02:29 her eyes it is all just beast and
0:02:32 feralness and she opens her mouth and to
0:02:36 let out a Roar and as she does her fangs
0:02:40 are long and seem to be dripping with
0:02:43 some kind of viscous
0:02:45 this and the pattern of a copperhead
0:02:47 sort of appears on her forehead and
0:02:49 works its way back over the skin the
0:02:51 bare skin on the side of her head
0:02:53 but when lets out a Roar and without any
0:02:56 regard for safety or uh
0:02:58 self-preservation she charges at the
0:03:00 bear and leaps at it with both hands and
0:03:03 since she is not wearing shoes it can be
0:03:06 plainly seen that claws are extending
0:03:07 from her toes as well it's not usually a
0:03:10 useful thing that happens but we're not
0:03:11 going by useful we're going by rage
0:03:13 and wind just leaps into this thing and
0:03:16 starts raking as hard and
0:03:19 as she can toward the face the head the
0:03:22 most vulnerable Parts okay let's have uh
0:03:26 miles go yep I'm going to as a turn to
0:03:29 attack Johnny just go in there and try
0:03:30 to
0:03:31 hit at this vulnerable neck part ish
0:03:35 thing I don't have an idea yeah where
0:03:40 the head okay yeah the neck ish it's a
0:03:43 weird neck yes okay okay thanks guys
0:03:46 it's a weird being it has weird music
0:03:48 but it still doesn't Rock You just
0:03:50 pulled the bust on you anyways yeah I
0:03:52 spent blood to increase my strength for
0:03:53 this attack
0:03:56 oh yeah actually those are all successes
0:03:58 yes they are eight to hit uh yeah you
0:04:01 hit okay seven roll over
0:04:05 so strength is currently four and then I
0:04:09 get three yeah 14 days
0:04:10 [Music]
0:04:11 because when I'm in frenzy do I
0:04:16 do I okay
0:04:18 quite the attack roll my friend Beast so
0:04:21 that's seven damage it will take two
0:04:23 lethal
0:04:25 as you cut into it I think it's good so
0:04:27 growing like it's my role but that's a
0:04:29 rose yep
0:04:32 Last Ride was good for us this is a bad
0:04:34 round for us
0:04:36 oh sorry it's not a bad bad round just
0:04:39 you know it's a very geared around but
0:04:43 for those of us who aren't Garrett this
0:04:44 is
0:04:47 fundament but it didn't seem to have
0:04:49 done it very long yeah it's a horrible
0:04:52 yeah okay so it doesn't matter uh we are
0:04:54 on Twitter shooting it
0:04:57 is
0:04:58 dead plus
0:05:00 fireworks correct
0:05:01 [Music]
0:05:05 four successes to hit nice neat Neato
0:05:11 foreign
0:05:14 you fire and you can see very clearly
0:05:18 that you struck true
0:05:20 um but it gets the the round is buried
0:05:24 in this thick height of like uh
0:05:27 fat and Bone and just whatever it is
0:05:30 that it's covered in after that it is on
0:05:34 Neil okay uh I'm still hustling
0:05:38 or I was still hustling to the show
0:05:42 there yeah those Point okay I'm going to
0:05:45 duck inside and grab her shotgun done uh
0:05:49 and then
0:05:50 try and get around behind the bear
0:05:52 probably not there not quite there okay
0:05:55 so then I'm gonna go inside like and
0:05:57 just check to make sure that it's
0:05:58 actually loaded it is loaded okay
0:06:01 that'll be me additional actions that
0:06:03 would be me
0:06:05 we're gonna try shooting it again ready
0:06:07 to take a shot get it girl
0:06:10 spend the gold power or anything bad
0:06:12 maybe my regular mattress
0:06:18 think that equals a zero yes oh
0:06:24 having a good time over there I am
0:06:26 having a wonderful no but this is our
0:06:28 round now guys this is our time this is
0:06:31 our time to shine nope new around six
0:06:36 miles oh sorry wait I spoke to wall
0:06:39 power there is one success there oh so
0:06:42 yeah
0:06:45 okay it kills him
0:06:50 okay so one success you also yep yep
0:06:55 all right miles I will follow it up with
0:06:59 an upward slash following in the same
0:07:01 park I mean it basically hasn't moved
0:07:02 some type of tag so
0:07:04 go for it yeah
0:07:08 you've not this time I don't think zero
0:07:11 successes oh your sword clangs against
0:07:14 fake Titan's bone and it seems to shrug
0:07:18 off the blow is that you win
0:07:22 rewarding my next turn to defend so I
0:07:25 can are we we're still limited by how
0:07:27 much blood we can spend when in forensic
0:07:29 correct yes okay
0:07:31 so she does spend one to be for strength
0:07:33 she's spending a willpower for an auto
0:07:35 success
0:07:36 to hit this [ __ ] uh she's using
0:07:39 both hands because this is a both hands
0:07:41 job you wanna take that again
0:07:43 no no I'm really happy
0:07:46 I was gonna say with what just came out

0:08:49 lot of red please stop one two three

0:09:41 four successes nice the hulking
0:09:45 monstrosity Will Roll soak it will take
0:09:47 two levels of lethal damage uh it seems
0:09:50 to stagger and is in pain is it made a
0:09:55 meal
0:09:57 I hate this part and Neil will create
0:10:01 with the shotgun creep out of the thing
0:10:03 and go behind this Bear yeah adjust
0:10:08 like hunting an alligator put the barrel
0:10:10 right up to the base of the skull pull
0:10:13 the trigger sounds good I can't Ambush
0:10:15 because it's already fighting but uh I'm
0:10:18 behind it so I get a bonus and it can't
0:10:20 see me so his account is like blinded
0:10:22 against me or I have no idea no that's
0:10:25 fine okay I'm gonna go with that and I
0:10:26 will spend one extra one more blood
0:10:30 uh I'll deal with that in a minute
0:10:34 drop screaming
0:10:37 ears bleeding oh man you got a double
0:10:39 barrel this thing I would yes yeah oh
0:10:41 yeah he's gonna Double Wear all this
0:10:43 yeah Good Old Coach gun and I am going
0:10:45 to spend the willpower anyways just
0:10:46 because
0:10:48 uh and it's point blank with a shotgun
0:10:51 so it's diff4 right
0:10:55 I usually like to aim but I don't have
0:10:58 the time it's also a shotgun you can aim
0:11:01 shotgun pop culture has lied to me
0:11:05 there's a whole report three success
0:11:08 three successes that's it uh four
0:11:10 successes I spent a willpower yeah all
0:11:11 right three dice roll over base eight on
0:11:13 a shotgun I don't know what both barrels
0:11:15 is that does for me for damage uh roll
0:11:18 it twice
0:11:21 so that's four damage of the first
0:11:24 barrel and
0:11:27 okay
0:11:28 six damage on the second Barrel so
0:11:31 forward so 10 between the two barrels it
0:11:34 seems to eat a lot of damage and
0:11:37 is effectively crippled
0:11:40 The Remains on its feet
0:11:43 this is the part I hate so much is this
0:11:46 point really you got a celebrity action
0:11:48 still right I got two celebrities oh my
0:11:50 God
0:11:56 I'm gonna go really Neil looks totally
0:11:59 panicked that it is not dead
0:12:01 also totally different the first out of
0:12:04 the two swear the actions shoot it

0:12:11 that is one success five deaths of
0:12:13 damage
0:12:16 there's two success
0:12:21 and the second uh time to shoot it I
0:12:24 will spend the willpower for one
0:12:25 automatic success sounds good
0:12:28 so that will be one success then with
0:12:31 the willpower yes all right why are we
0:12:35 rolling so bad you guys
0:12:38 I think Lex is the one who's just
0:12:40 rolling out of control
0:12:42 two successes six Jesus
0:12:50 so we pick up with the Weeping bears at
0:12:54 the top of no no no no no no no no
0:12:57 I'm gonna try to cheat
0:12:59 um I have spent another Blood to beef my
0:13:02 dexterity again I have spent a willpower
0:13:04 for an automatic success okay
0:13:07 um I am going to hit this thing let's do
0:13:10 it
0:13:13 five successes great for carry over nice
0:13:16 yes so that's going to be strength plus
0:13:19 five dice of aggravated damage strength
0:13:22 and you've beefed your strength by one
0:13:25 right yes which brings it to a four
0:13:32 five damage egg I have no dice of
0:13:37 successes for this rule uh it'll take
0:13:40 five volts of aggravated damage and die
0:13:45 and wind kind of goes down with her
0:13:48 claws embedded in this thing's back
0:13:51 it shakes staggers
0:13:54 slumps and drops dead right beside miles

0:15:02 her claws she does not retract them back
0:15:04 into herself and she
0:15:06 moves toward the hose just kind of like
0:15:09 still
0:15:10 visibly shaking as her muscles are
0:15:13 refusing to leave the fight form but her
0:15:15 brain is just like no we are we are done
0:15:17 better well run over uh the claws look
0:15:20 like they'll be in the way to turn it on
0:15:21 so she'll quickly turn on the water to
0:15:24 heat and
0:15:27 move out of out of the way
0:15:31 Neil
0:15:32 what's the the thing the blood the cell
0:15:36 the very everything about it you could
0:15:38 just see it the the malevolence inside

0:15:43 get them over to the house are they dead
0:15:45 they're
0:15:46 I mean we're all dead what is wrong with
0:15:48 them they're they will be they will be
0:15:52 okay okay so long as we get the blood
0:15:54 off of them and we get them away from
0:15:55 this thing okay okay okay that's that's
0:15:58 the important part here uh ready to walk
0:16:01 away and start trying to drag uh Johnny
0:16:04 to over to water uh soap
0:16:08 yeah you have some yes okay get it sink
0:16:12 good where do you uh yeah we'll take
0:16:15 showers later we'll clean them off but
0:16:17 right now just everything we're gonna
0:16:19 get get
0:16:21 soap oh okay yeah uh
0:16:26 uh yeah
0:16:29 uh deal goes inside for a second and it
0:16:31 goes back out I was gonna presume that
0:16:34 it was one of those big lava soap like
0:16:36 orange yeah containers uh
0:16:39 breaks it out it's like okay it's gonna
0:16:41 get real cold uh but we're not gonna die
0:16:44 from the cold
0:16:45 okay so everybody who's touched the
0:16:47 blood everybody's everything did you get
0:16:49 it in your mouth
0:16:50 okay when shakes her head I have no idea
0:16:53 if this is even gonna work but it's
0:16:55 Gotta we have to try I just oh man this
0:16:59 is not
0:17:00 no this is not good Neil yeah you good
0:17:03 oh yeah I didn't get anything to be okay
0:17:07 bill says to you face covered in blood
0:17:11 Neil what
0:17:13 soap hose yeah I know we gotta get it
0:17:17 you deal stops it sort of touches his
0:17:20 own face I wasn't even thinking about me
0:17:22 wind just kind of holds up the hose and
0:17:25 starts like slapping his face very
0:17:27 roughly with the soap oh it's so cold uh
0:17:30 and this is lava soap so it's it's
0:17:33 exfoliating uh
0:17:36 uh spa day do you don't have any like
0:17:38 spare clothes or anything in there
0:17:40 enough for okay uh oh this could be bad
0:17:43 with my two strength am I able to drag
0:17:46 Johnny over and then theoretically mile
0:17:48 yeah okay if you if you put a little
0:17:51 blood into your strength it's quite easy
0:17:53 don't I got it
0:17:57 because she is also now just a beefcake
0:18:04 with your facility
0:18:06 and it's uh is there a way to drive a
0:18:08 truck here can we get the car and drive
0:18:10 it here is that possible yes I know we
0:18:12 want to leave tracks but I think now
0:18:14 that's not really the biggest issue
0:18:15 there are worse tracks we could be
0:18:17 leaving all right you guys take care of
0:18:20 yourselves and clean up as best as you
0:18:22 can I'm gonna go with the car can you
0:18:24 drive
0:18:25 yes don't let's not tell miles that I
0:18:28 drove his car through the woods he's
0:18:31 better okay he's if he just got it he'll
0:18:33 be real bad
0:18:43 uh and I start running into the woods
0:18:46 back towards the car realize that I'm
0:18:49 not 100 sure where I am so stop
0:18:53 and I will spend blood
0:18:54 and look at the sky to get my exact
0:18:57 position on the Earth
0:18:59 to help me fixate because I know where
0:19:01 East Rock Park is compared to New Haven
0:19:03 commune with the heavens and you know
0:19:05 exactly where you are in relation to the
0:19:08 vehicle and I will start going you make
0:19:10 it to the vehicle with great ease
0:19:17 foreign
0:19:19 the shed there's a wooden box with
0:19:22 extra clothes okay whatever we've got
0:19:25 there should be some shoes
0:19:29 okay
0:19:30 if you don't want to wear mine anymore
0:19:32 they're gross
0:19:33 I'm more worried about getting the blood
0:19:36 and everything off those too
0:19:38 she's starts hosing them down and sits
0:19:41 down and starts scrubbing the blood off
0:19:45 and you know periodically uses the lava
0:19:47 soap on herself to scrub off whatever
0:19:48 has gotten on there
0:19:50 and continues this until at least they
0:19:53 are clean having seen that that's
0:19:55 handled Britta will go inside the house
0:19:57 drag out the box what's in it stuff that
0:20:00 looks like maybe got left behind when
0:20:03 teenagers went camping and suddenly ran
0:20:05 away how much of it there's a pretty
0:20:08 good collection of stuff here uh stuff a
0:20:12 lot of it from like the mid 90s some
0:20:15 even early 90s there's like bell bottoms
0:20:19 if I look through the pile and try to
0:20:21 match Johnny and miles and win to
0:20:25 corresponding clothing items how well
0:20:28 does that go well
0:20:30 generic khaki shorts and camping gear
0:20:34 clothes they're both going to look
0:20:35 terrible in them but despite being a
0:20:38 little baggy it'll fit
0:20:40 if there's a pair of polyester bell
0:20:42 bottoms please put them on Miles I don't
0:20:44 care how bad they fit we didn't leave
0:20:46 him his dignity
0:20:55 will lay out the best corresponding
0:20:59 outfits that she can out of the
0:21:01 selection available
0:21:03 uh this is an important factor you
0:21:06 should all pay attention
0:21:08 so this is also that was that was when
0:21:12 that thing
0:21:13 inside you
0:21:16 that's when that gets out that's that's
0:21:18 what happened to me yeah okay
0:21:22 the Circ rage thing yeah
0:21:25 and what's wrong with them they're
0:21:28 unconscious they're they're unconscious
0:21:31 because they took a lot of damage but
0:21:35 we're already dead and our bodies have a
0:21:37 very hard time dying
0:21:39 so that should have killed any
0:21:41 normal people but it that thing could
0:21:44 have actually killed any of us
0:21:47 are you okay
0:21:48 have you I'm not gonna keep asking you
0:21:51 that have you taken any injuries
0:21:53 no I was out of range good you don't
0:21:56 have to worry about me and we have to
0:21:57 worry about getting them back somewhere
0:21:59 safe that's Neil's getting the car
0:22:04 [Music]
0:22:07 when I get to the car I will start
0:22:09 driving carefully
0:22:11 uh through like the trail like the paths
0:22:14 it's a big ass car so it's gonna be a
0:22:15 pain in the ass give me a deck stretch
0:22:17 all right well I don't have any drives
0:22:19 so that plus what difficulty liar
0:22:34 you crashed my [ __ ] new car all right
0:22:37 I got one success all right thank God to
0:22:41 avoid uh a couple of the traps that are
0:22:44 still in the woods yep and
0:22:47 you'll arrive to win
0:22:50 hey everybody uh let's load them into
0:22:52 the car there's a couple tarps
0:22:55 underneath the bookshelves oh there's
0:22:58 some Hefty bags let's at least not get
0:23:00 as new interior stained yeah
0:23:03 yeah absolutely do these seats come out
0:23:06 or fold down or anything there's a big
0:23:07 back section like this I was looking at
0:23:09 no idea was there's a back seat and
0:23:11 there's there's the
0:23:14 no it's not a trunk it's it's like a the
0:23:17 interior storage it's not a truck bed
0:23:19 either this thing's weird
0:23:20 yeah let's let's worry about this later
0:23:23 there's plenty of space for a body or
0:23:24 two all right um when will still riding
0:23:27 the coattails of her frenzy
0:23:30 um Scoops up Johnny and waits for
0:23:34 someone to put a tarp down in the back
0:23:36 of the car yeah level put stuff down
0:23:38 yeah and kind of drops him gently
0:23:42 lovingly
0:23:45 slaps him onto the table like a slab of
0:23:47 meat he would have wanted it that way
0:23:50 uh does the same for Miles
0:23:53 um she doesn't stack them like cord wood
0:23:55 because that feels undignified even
0:23:57 though it's more space efficient
0:23:59 um and unlike the creature in the fridge
0:24:01 she doesn't like push them in to make
0:24:03 more room the only time Johnny's easy is
0:24:05 when he's killed by death that's what
0:24:07 I've read on the bathroom walls at
0:24:08 Elysium what else do you get kill so
0:24:11 it's it's a Motorhead song
0:24:13 Johnny loves the Motorhead he does
0:24:15 that's his baby
0:24:17 um did you find clothes
0:24:20 um yes I have them here okay
0:24:23 so uh we should get out of here yeah uh
0:24:26 Raven just pieced out for that
0:24:30 um
0:24:30 yeah she at least help
0:24:32 get rid of this I think she might be
0:24:35 willing to do that or are we just gonna
0:24:37 like soak it in kerosene to burn it
0:24:41 or gasoline we got it the wind seems to
0:24:45 think
0:24:46 two options we roll it into my shed uh
0:24:49 and we leave it there until we have a
0:24:51 better plan
0:24:52 or or we burn it or we set it on fire
0:24:55 and hope no one finds it
0:24:57 not that this wouldn't stop someone
0:24:59 really curious but do you have any more
0:25:02 tarps
0:25:04 um you can check onto the bookshelf I
0:25:06 knew I had to but there might be I don't
0:25:09 know as much as I'm not a particularly
0:25:11 Brave man I don't wanna really be too
0:25:14 close to fire or this thing leaving its
0:25:16 blood and body out here
0:25:19 I will burn again you were saying
0:25:21 earlier I'm sorry I thought they weren't
0:25:24 I thought Johnny and Miles were
0:25:26 sorry you were saying that you thought
0:25:28 it was infectious
0:25:30 I think you were right what you were
0:25:32 talking about how it was
0:25:34 communicable I
0:25:36 I think you're right down to the
0:25:38 cellular level there's a a thing an
0:25:41 intelligence of a level that's that was
0:25:43 driving this bear the bear was trapped
0:25:45 inside its flesh the flesh
0:25:47 was the traffic force not the mind I
0:25:51 don't like that I don't either that's
0:25:53 why I wanted the blood off I have no
0:25:54 idea if that would even work or if that
0:25:56 was a useless gesture or if it didn't
0:25:58 need anything but it's not something I
0:26:00 wanted to yeah me neither you sound
0:26:03 so certain I mean it matched with my
0:26:06 knowledge but you know how miles is
0:26:09 talking about gifts of the blood
0:26:10 honestly yes
0:26:12 my clad people don't take it seriously
0:26:15 very often but
0:26:17 everything there's a pattern to
0:26:18 everything in the world
0:26:21 just look at look at how Roots grow and
0:26:24 branches grow like fractals they they
0:26:28 mirror each other and then if you
0:26:30 compare them to how rivers flow down
0:26:33 mountains how blood vessels grow out
0:26:34 it's all it's all linked
0:26:37 uh it's all the same there are patterns
0:26:40 to places if you look at them long
0:26:42 enough and
0:26:43 if you learn how to
0:26:46 sort of look at those kind of patterns
0:26:48 and people and beings in things you can
0:26:53 learn things about the understand them a
0:26:55 little bit better than you might
0:26:56 otherwise and that thing was being very
0:26:59 driven
0:27:00 by
0:27:02 it's flesh that's it wasn't a Belgium of
0:27:06 chaotic Parts there was a pattern to
0:27:08 that chaos
0:27:11 that's incredible
0:27:14 that's
0:27:15 trick you got to learn how to do it's
0:27:17 it's not too bad uh anyways
0:27:21 I can try and send a message and we'll
0:27:23 see who comes in the me time uh
0:27:26 you got like a rubber hose or something
0:27:28 somewhere
0:27:29 yeah
0:27:30 we have a literal rubber hose right I've
0:27:33 been a I'm gonna sex with some gas and
0:27:35 soak this thing all right and I will
0:27:38 Neil has some dirty underworld skills uh
0:27:41 and I've got a siphon gas out of the
0:27:43 tank and just onto the bear sounds good
0:27:47 Neil yeah if we burn this thing and it
0:27:50 is full of contagious parts
0:27:53 are they going to be airborne
0:27:56 I don't have a way of knowing one way or
0:27:59 the other definitively
0:28:01 it's probably a good idea to get you the
0:28:03 car before we light things up
0:28:05 what's it going to do to the area
0:28:07 fire
0:28:09 metaphysically speaking is a kledzingu
0:28:12 force
0:28:13 so metaphysically I think it would be
0:28:17 okay but I I I don't know for a fact I
0:28:20 would say I know you can't burn giant
0:28:22 hogweed without that kind of risk true
0:28:25 but giant Halloween's Natural Science
0:28:30 or whether the question of
0:28:32 fire would be a problem yeah okay fire
0:28:35 good fire bad who knows
0:28:39 metaphysically speaking it cleanses but
0:28:42 naturally speaking it might spread
0:28:44 scientifically it's okay but in Return
0:28:47 of the Walking Dead that's what started
0:28:49 the whole thing hey stop stealing my
0:28:50 stick
0:28:51 this is science plus um plus anything
0:28:54 other signs
0:28:56 the intelligence for science okay
0:29:00 in the meantime wind takes a minute to
0:29:03 go inside and change nothing unless uh
0:29:05 what's the difficulty six nope you're
0:29:08 not sure
0:29:10 fire kills disease right fire kills
0:29:13 natural someone is spelled like disease
0:29:17 I'm gonna call Weathers
0:29:19 no uh let's wait I think it's a good
0:29:22 idea to call weathers I want to call
0:29:24 weathers but I also want to look out for
0:29:26 you at your interests and weathers is
0:29:30 going to have a lot of questions about
0:29:31 Raven and
0:29:34 that's a whole heap of political trouble
0:29:36 I don't know if you know if you need
0:29:39 right now
0:29:40 miles can't defend himself or us miles
0:29:43 is the one who gets us out of that kind
0:29:44 of problem
0:29:45 and
0:29:47 she doesn't need that kind of problem I
0:29:48 don't even know what it means if you're
0:29:51 uh uh he's not your sire what do you
0:29:54 call somebody who's deterred to your
0:29:55 accounting when he's not your sire or
0:29:58 your accounting buddy well your
0:30:00 accountability isn't I don't know what
0:30:03 that
0:30:04 it's your first night I just I think
0:30:06 you're right I just want to bring up the
0:30:09 problems we might
0:30:10 I can appreciate that this is this is
0:30:13 beyond what I think we can safely deal
0:30:14 with right just
0:30:16 Let's Dance Around The Raven Dominic if
0:30:18 you don't want to get in trouble and I
0:30:21 don't want you to get in trouble now
0:30:23 I we were asking whether
0:30:26 fire would be safe
0:30:27 wrong question if we don't get rid of
0:30:32 this bear we're in the middle of the
0:30:34 woods full of scavengers full of
0:30:38 lots of things that'll spread it if it's
0:30:40 available
0:30:43 we have to do something everything we do
0:30:46 it might have some element of danger but
0:30:50 I don't think it's right to just not
0:30:52 touch it no I don't I don't think we
0:30:54 were leaning that way
0:30:56 I think you are correct it we drive away
0:30:58 from here because we are three Kindred
0:31:00 next to a bonfire and uh accurate get
0:31:05 that out of here and then yeah maybe we
0:31:06 could call weathers but let's call
0:31:08 weathers maybe we're back on the road
0:31:09 yeah we can stop off at a paper or
0:31:12 something yeah
0:31:13 Let's uh you guys want to get in the car
0:31:16 yeah let's go uh and I'll I'll drive
0:31:20 are you sure yes
0:31:22 fine okay get uh you guys get the car
0:31:24 I'm gonna reach you to Johnny's pocket
0:31:25 because I know he's got matches
0:31:27 he does not what he does have a lighter
0:31:30 do you have a lighter he has a Zippo
0:31:32 uh I have a crappy disposable one do you
0:31:36 yeah give me uh intelligent survival I'm
0:31:40 not gonna light it when the tube is
0:31:42 still in there I understand all right
0:31:44 I'm gonna say you're gonna blow up the
0:31:46 truck I'm assuming they take all our
0:31:47 stuff too
0:31:48 yeah yeah yeah yeah it's important
0:31:51 they're not annihilated
0:31:54 nope that is awesome no we also we also
0:31:56 hosted off uh you can't quite get uh
0:31:59 intricate yeah Trail guy forget it just
0:32:01 go and I'm gonna
0:32:03 there's paper inside yeah there's
0:32:04 there's a couple notebooks
0:32:06 are you okay birded books
0:32:09 they're notebooks most of them are only
0:32:11 half used my notebooks are full uh I he
0:32:16 he goes uh a deal rolls of paper add
0:32:18 light it up and just
0:32:21 toss the burning paper Neil close my
0:32:23 door all right no are you encouraged oh
0:32:26 yeah 57 in order to even start the fire
0:32:28 I'm gonna blow up here on this because
0:32:30 Neil is not a brave man
0:32:33 yeah cool I spill I spent the willpower
0:32:36 so I get one success nailed it
0:32:40 okay Start the Fire and you turn and run
0:32:44 yep
0:32:46 bad bolt uh okay let's let's drive
0:32:49 before it gets bigger the fire smells so
0:32:53 bad maybe you get in you got your
0:32:57 friends secured you have their stuff
0:33:00 with your friends secured
0:33:03 you make your way out of the woods
0:33:07 [Music]
0:33:10 uh when kind of takes it as close to the
0:33:13 road as she can get it and finds like
0:33:15 the uh Park Rangers pads for their
0:33:18 vehicles and gets them out back out to
0:33:20 the main road sounds good okay you
0:33:22 definitely know these Woods better than
0:33:23 I do I think I I think it was going
0:33:25 off-road for a little while on this
0:33:26 thing you probably were but I think this
0:33:28 is a car that can handle it for the most
0:33:30 part where are we going uh so I
0:33:33 we need to get somewhere safe with them
0:33:35 until we can figure out what we're going
0:33:37 to do what are we gonna do
0:33:39 I I don't know uh they're
0:33:43 they're in torp right now where are we
0:33:46 going
0:33:48 let's go to my place okay Point me
0:33:50 directions okay uh it's it's over
0:33:52 towards the hill do you know where that
0:33:53 is do you know where to go okay
0:33:55 and Neil will direct win as they're
0:33:57 driving towards uh North Star Pawn in
0:34:01 the hill in New Haven okay
0:34:05 um as Wayne is driving she kind of
0:34:06 glances in the rear view
0:34:08 um at Britta
0:34:10 so
0:34:12 this is new
0:34:13 what's new the um
0:34:16 them in the back this is not something
0:34:18 you've seen before Britta has kind of
0:34:21 sat them up and like clipped them in uh
0:34:25 awesome oh Jesus
0:34:30 safety first I was not expecting Safety
0:34:33 First are they not gonna wake up or they
0:34:36 are it depends
0:34:39 well it depends on what how do we fix
0:34:41 this
0:34:42 so what they're what they're dealing
0:34:44 with now is called torpor
0:34:46 um functionally dead
0:34:48 what they need now is they need to be
0:34:50 woken up with blood
0:34:54 mortal blood no no
0:34:57 won't that make them blood bound like I
0:35:00 am
0:35:01 yeah it's not great
0:35:03 yes or no will it do what was done to me
0:35:08 yeah yeah it will
0:35:10 um but the choices that I found are not
0:35:13 waking up time might do it or trading in
0:35:16 favors with the premiere maybe nope
0:35:19 I didn't say it was a good idea but if
0:35:21 you want to run down the options of
0:35:23 things to do that's not on the table I I
0:35:26 understand that I'm just is it Premier
0:35:29 blood that wakes you up no they're blood
0:35:31 Sorcerers they have ways
0:35:34 um
0:35:35 it also depends on not any Kindred Vitae
0:35:38 will do it it depends on
0:35:41 the potency of their blood
0:35:45 um
0:35:45 what which way am I turning uh just take
0:35:47 it right up here okay wait neom we could
0:35:51 wake them up just with our blood it
0:35:53 depends on the potency of their blood
0:35:55 and your blood someone like me
0:36:01 my blood's weak
0:36:03 comparatively I have no idea with Johnny
0:36:06 and miles and I've not I mean there's
0:36:08 tests that which way I like what
0:36:10 Premiere can do
0:36:12 and we have no idea what mine would do
0:36:15 no not a clue which also is a weird
0:36:18 question because the trainer can do
0:36:20 things like that and if both Romeo and
0:36:22 you have shown up and the cynical was
0:36:25 Premiere and hasn't offered to check who
0:36:28 your sire is or what your blood is it
0:36:31 that
0:36:31 wait they can just
0:36:33 do that some of them
0:36:36 that is strange then that they wouldn't
0:36:39 if this has happened before
0:36:42 I don't know if Reissr or any of the
0:36:44 local Premiere could do that but it's
0:36:47 it is a basic tenet of blood sorcery
0:36:50 and Johnny do we know what we need for
0:36:52 him we don't not a clue that's why we're
0:36:55 going to call weathers because I suspect
0:36:56 he knows how to wake up his bully voice
0:36:58 I hope so
0:37:00 all right
0:37:01 um
0:37:02 it's just it's up here all right
0:37:05 um and as you guys as we the group
0:37:08 drives closer they drive into a very
0:37:11 shitty neighborhood
0:37:13 particularly in the late 90s in the
0:37:15 world of Darkness
0:37:16 it is a bad area to a small cement store
0:37:22 it looks like a little prison uh with
0:37:25 metal Shutters on the windows and a
0:37:27 heavy barge like cage door over the main
0:37:31 door
0:37:32 and like a little parking lot with a
0:37:34 sign that says North Star Pond there's
0:37:36 graffiti all over the side of the of the
0:37:38 building uh this is me all right
0:37:42 uh all right I'm assuming I'm gonna need
0:37:44 to carry
0:37:46 [Music]
0:37:47 all right so you just pull around the
0:37:49 back because bringing bodies in
0:37:52 uh is there anybody around right now I
0:37:55 know it's like in the middle of the
0:37:56 night but this doesn't always someone
0:37:58 around
0:37:59 um is there a loading dog I don't know
0:38:00 if people are really paying attention
0:38:01 probably not yeah like you definitely
0:38:04 see some people kind of walking around
0:38:05 hoodies up headphones going minding
0:38:08 their own business but it's it's cold
0:38:10 it's night they're not they don't care
0:38:11 no there's not really like a loading
0:38:13 dock people just you know it's small
0:38:15 Goods trade okay um we'll just go on the
0:38:17 front door okay all right and Neil pulls
0:38:20 it like a big key like set of keys out
0:38:23 of his pocket unlocks the front door
0:38:24 opens it and ushers you guys inside puts
0:38:26 the light on wind grabs whoever's
0:38:28 sitting most accessibly
0:38:31 um and kind of wraps them up to make
0:38:32 sure that it's not obvious she's
0:38:34 carrying
0:38:36 essentially it did essentially a
0:38:37 mummified corpse brittle will stay in
0:38:39 the car with the person who's left yep
0:38:42 all right so we're just gonna we're
0:38:43 gonna say that she grabs miles and she
0:38:46 kind of have some
0:38:47 over her shoulder like a rug and starts
0:38:50 following meal the inside of Neil's pawn
0:38:54 shop is cramped with stuff there's like
0:38:58 an entire wall of guitars and Casio
0:39:01 keyboards and [ __ ] old TVs and VCRs
0:39:04 books there's a display case behind a
0:39:07 locked cabinet with jewelry old phones
0:39:10 it looks like just anything you would
0:39:13 see in a typical pawn shop but way
0:39:15 overstuffed uh and along the back wall
0:39:19 behind which there is a series of guns
0:39:22 for sale
0:39:24 is a uh like a cage
0:39:27 that with a register and everything is
0:39:29 Neil unlocks it brings it in unlocks a
0:39:33 door like a heavy steel door that leads
0:39:37 to a staircase that goes downstairs uh
0:39:40 clicks on a little like overhead hanging
0:39:42 bulbs like I just go downstairs that's
0:39:43 that's where my place is okay and we'll
0:39:47 we'll just go down there all right um
0:39:52 miles downstairs
0:39:54 um she looks for
0:39:55 maybe not even Furniture to put them on
0:39:57 just but just a place that's
0:39:59 somewhat respectful of the fact that
0:40:01 this is a person the only place down
0:40:03 there that would be anything available
0:40:06 is a small like twin bed the rest of the
0:40:11 space down here is packed with stuff
0:40:15 just
0:40:17 Tupperware and
0:40:20 stacks of old newspapers that yellow
0:40:22 towards the bottom that hit the ceiling
0:40:26 plastic baggies filled with essentially
0:40:29 garbage there's a small walking path
0:40:32 from the staircase directly towards the
0:40:35 back where there's kind of a space
0:40:37 carved out for like a little shitty cot
0:40:40 and that is it Jesus Christ Neil this is
0:40:44 like a fire hazard waiting to happen no
0:40:46 it's not it's it's all my stuff yeah I'm
0:40:48 gonna make sure Brit is okay okay just
0:40:50 get them on the thing
0:40:51 don't touch anything I have a system
0:40:53 okay when
0:40:55 a lawyer perusing this chaos
0:40:59 you start to notice that this place
0:41:01 seems to be some sort of hub for enigma
0:41:05 spirits that are drawn to this area
0:41:08 and they just kind of move
0:41:10 undulate slightly and then wander off
0:41:14 but something about this place seems to
0:41:16 draw them wind just kind of assume
0:41:18 resumes putting miles down probably as
0:41:22 close to a sitting position on the cot
0:41:23 as possible don't worry about getting
0:41:25 too comfortable we're going someplace
0:41:26 safer in a second okay
0:41:28 and she jogs back up the stairs back out
0:41:31 to the car uh on the way up I'm gonna
0:41:33 grab a slip of paper like a Sharpie and
0:41:35 just write please don't touch love Neil
0:41:38 on like a scrap of paper and put it
0:41:40 under the windshield wiper because we're
0:41:42 parked in a car here for now yeah all
0:41:45 right when uh comes back up uh grabs
0:41:48 Johnny
0:41:49 um
0:41:50 clicks the the remote lock for the car
0:41:52 it's kind of a Fool's errand at this
0:41:54 point probably but
0:41:56 and tosses Neil the keys okay thanks uh
0:42:00 right down inside and then I'm going to
0:42:02 need help I mean I can do it myself but
0:42:04 it's easier to with some help okay what
0:42:05 do you need uh come on downstairs and
0:42:07 I'll
0:42:09 uh and Neil leads both of you downstairs
0:42:12 to the same place
0:42:14 whoa this is where you live yeah yeah
0:42:18 this is my place
0:42:19 uh these this is all my stuff
0:42:22 um did you know you have a bunch of
0:42:23 spirits living around here I was
0:42:26 concerned and I see stuff out of the
0:42:27 corner of my eye sometimes if I'm
0:42:29 looking yeah yeah uh they seem harmless
0:42:31 they're just interested good they're not
0:42:33 enthralled to anyone right
0:42:35 not as far as I can tell okay can you
0:42:37 like get rid of them for a second
0:42:40 uh they're looking or are they still
0:42:42 around or have they kind of gone away
0:42:43 they kind of come in and out when it
0:42:47 does when whatever it is that they're
0:42:48 looking for isn't readily apparently
0:42:50 here they start to wander off all on
0:42:53 their own do they seem like they're
0:42:55 bound or anything no okay
0:42:57 no they're they're not interested in
0:42:59 staying okay good um
0:43:01 here move move them off the bed for a
0:43:04 second and then help me lift the bed up
0:43:06 okay uh can you help him Britta show off
0:43:09 the bed all right and so she just kind
0:43:11 of leans down grabs both of them over
0:43:13 her shoulders and stands up
0:43:16 Neil uh when he's not happy to help me
0:43:19 uh right here just help me help me lift
0:43:21 this and sort of the two of you lift the
0:43:23 cot a little bit and then he kind of
0:43:26 puts it on his back over under his
0:43:27 shoulder like buckling out of the way a
0:43:29 little bit it's not heavy it's a shitty
0:43:31 frame but I was so rich to try to ease
0:43:34 the pressure and then as soon as he you
0:43:36 guys lift it both of you can see there's
0:43:38 like a hatch
0:43:40 or some sort of door underneath on the
0:43:43 floor
0:43:44 and he
0:43:45 turns the handle gets another key out
0:43:49 and opens it and then
0:43:51 so uh
0:43:53 there's some things I need to tell you
0:43:54 guys
0:43:56 um okay I'm letting you in on a huge
0:43:58 trust here but I I this has to happen
0:44:02 and if anyone finds out about this
0:44:05 anyone I'm gonna die
0:44:08 just I will be killed
0:44:11 Neil let's get the bed off you first
0:44:14 okay
0:44:15 I
0:44:17 I'm serious Neil we'll listen to you
0:44:20 just let's sit down this sounds
0:44:22 Neil we're not going to do anything to
0:44:24 get you killed not on purpose yeah it's
0:44:26 the accident part I've been working
0:44:27 decades to make sure the accident part
0:44:29 doesn't happen I'm like [ __ ] it all up
0:44:31 right now and he opens the hatch and
0:44:34 there's like a little ladder down okay
0:44:37 and
0:44:38 just sort of leave it flipped and kind
0:44:41 of shimmy under so that it falls back
0:44:43 down on top so nobody who comes down
0:44:44 will see it okay okay I'm gonna need one
0:44:47 of you to go down first and catch Neil
0:44:49 starts climbing down
0:44:51 terms of you you hear a
0:44:53 uh like a kerosene lantern start okay
0:44:58 all right I'm sending miles down first
0:45:00 okay I I got him okay uh Bruno you want
0:45:04 to go down there and just make sure yep
0:45:06 thank you all right Bruno's coming down
0:45:08 first oh oh okay sure yeah that way I
0:45:11 can just shut the door after I lower
0:45:12 both of them I trust you okay one spirit
0:45:15 is down she will gradually start like
0:45:18 easing miles through the hole she'll
0:45:20 hold on as long as she can and then
0:45:21 she'll eventually have to drop right and
0:45:24 then once miles is down she'll do the
0:45:25 same thing for Johnny
0:45:27 and that Neil is there a latch I need to
0:45:29 turn when I'm coming down uh once you're
0:45:32 down just turn the handle back uh
0:45:34 horizontal okay
0:45:36 uh she starts descending cranks the
0:45:38 lever to make sure that the latches shut
0:45:40 behind her you hear a Clank and when you
0:45:43 get down everyone's together again you
0:45:46 seem you were Ginger enough when
0:45:49 handling your your two quarterly
0:45:52 companions that they don't seem to have
0:45:54 sustained any damage they're not
0:45:57 particularly dirty they're actually
0:45:58 pretty well taken care of if you you
0:46:01 know discounting the trauma of just what
0:46:04 happened beforehand yeah down in the
0:46:06 room Neil looks around with kerosene
0:46:07 lantern pulls like a little lever or
0:46:10 hits a circuit and some lights flicker
0:46:14 on uh the other side of the room
0:46:16 actually there were lights already on
0:46:19 and this looks like it used to be part
0:46:22 of the sewer system like an old cistern
0:46:24 or something with everything shut down
0:46:26 unlike the chaos upstairs it is insanely
0:46:30 Immaculate down here there is a writing
0:46:33 desk there uh are Scrolls and books you
0:46:39 see maps and star charts and all sorts
0:46:42 of things all over the desk there's an
0:46:45 old tub against like a far wall like an
0:46:48 iron tub that's half covered in like a
0:46:51 red clay it looks like it's an ongoing
0:46:54 project for Neil the clay has
0:46:56 all sorts of like
0:46:58 symbols or something carved into it
0:47:01 which you may recognize as Arabic just
0:47:05 from looking at it or from seeing the
0:47:08 Arabic to English translation dictionary
0:47:11 uh nearby
0:47:13 there's a bunch of different
0:47:15 blood vials and just weird [ __ ] on the
0:47:18 table
0:47:19 and against the other wall just taking
0:47:22 up the whole wall is a large planter
0:47:26 that looks straight up I mean wind would
0:47:28 probably recognize a grow lab if she'd
0:47:30 ever seen one with a bunch of
0:47:32 Hydroponics and like reddish soil and
0:47:35 growing out of them
0:47:37 kind of looks like pot but it is a deep
0:47:40 crimson red all right I have questions
0:47:43 yeah I assume but I'm gonna give you a
0:47:46 chance to explain yourself before I
0:47:48 start asking uh just just prop them up
0:47:51 in the tub though it's probably the most
0:47:53 safe place this is the safest place I
0:47:55 could think of right now because nobody
0:47:57 knows about it
0:47:58 all right except for you two now
0:48:00 okay well we're not gonna betray that uh
0:48:03 yeah I hope not because if anyone
0:48:05 particularly the premier find out about
0:48:07 this no we won't tell anyone
0:48:11 okay
0:48:13 I needed to tell somebody
0:48:15 because I've seen some things recently
0:48:18 and I I need help I can't keep it to
0:48:20 myself
0:48:21 but I need you to take me seriously
0:48:25 we want to help you what's wrong Neil I
0:48:28 think you're nuts but I don't think that
0:48:29 you're stupid and I think that when you
0:48:31 come across information like this I do
0:48:33 believe you good
0:48:35 um
0:48:36 I just really need to hammer home
0:48:38 that this isn't just
0:48:42 moltavian [ __ ] which I know a lot of
0:48:45 people think
0:48:46 and it has suited my purpose for
0:48:49 30 years for people to think that
0:48:52 but it's not all mulcavian [ __ ] and
0:48:54 there's a reason I know about blood
0:48:55 sorcery and Neil
0:48:59 shut up
0:49:00 you're our Coterie mate you saved my life
0:49:04 and I trust you
0:49:06 okay I I where do we want to start
0:49:09 I mean we got away from Marcos we
0:49:13 I'll send a text message to
0:49:16 Weathers
0:49:18 oh he's got a pager yeah shoot we'll
0:49:21 have to call weathers I'll I'll go back
0:49:23 out and I'll go to a pay phone call well
0:49:27 you can use my phone it's fine all right
0:49:28 well I'll take just do you want to just
0:49:30 go back out and I'll do that but let's
0:49:32 talk because I think that it's taken you
0:49:34 a lot to get to this point
0:49:36 so let's keep this trainer going
0:49:38 something's coming
0:49:41 I've felt it for a while now most of my
0:49:43 client has and
0:49:46 I have other ways besides
0:49:49 pattern recognition like we were talking
0:49:50 about Britta um yes
0:49:53 there are other ways to get information
0:49:55 other
0:49:57 paths to Mastery what other ways
0:50:01 Magic
0:50:04 what kind of magic
0:50:09 Mastery of Heaven and Earth
0:50:12 durangi
0:50:14 the you might know it when as as it
0:50:17 might sources yeah that's what I thought
0:50:19 it might be
0:50:21 I mean you know about my sire right
0:50:24 why he's not in the camarilla anymore
0:50:27 no no I don't
0:50:30 I'm pretty sure miles knows Johnny might
0:50:32 know he's not allowed
0:50:34 in the city anymore in the camera
0:50:36 anymore but about 15 years or so ago or
0:50:40 so
0:50:41 my my sire
0:50:43 we were found out he was found out
0:50:47 for doing what
0:50:49 practicing
0:50:51 um
0:50:52 having relationships with the Assamites
0:50:54 he and I did some things for them with
0:50:59 them
0:51:00 the assemites are
0:51:02 disliked by the camera they're not part
0:51:05 of the camarilla they're like the
0:51:06 sedites and honestly like the Gangrel
0:51:08 for the most part
0:51:09 we don't deal with the Assamites they're
0:51:11 the boogeyman they're
0:51:13 it's not even like the settings they're
0:51:15 Independence and they can be in the city
0:51:16 asamites don't just come to the city
0:51:19 but my sire had a relationship and so he
0:51:23 taught me
0:51:24 and I had a relationship
0:51:26 and
0:51:27 he told me never to tell anyone that it
0:51:30 was a secret and then one day
0:51:32 after our teachings
0:51:34 he started talking more and more about
0:51:38 concepts of justice and
0:51:40 how old Kendra he started referring to
0:51:43 Kindred as the get of Cain he felt
0:51:45 disgusted and then he left
0:51:48 what does that mean the get of coin I
0:51:50 don't know she didn't teach me anything
0:51:52 or everything he he just taught me
0:51:55 that and my dealings with the Assamites
0:51:59 individually were not
0:52:02 I didn't it wasn't a tutorial
0:52:05 relationship that I had with one what
0:52:07 was it
0:52:09 um
0:52:10 Neil why is it personal it's we don't
0:52:12 have to
0:52:13 is it relevant
0:52:16 if it was found out that I had a
0:52:19 personal relationship yeah I mean it
0:52:22 would put me in danger
0:52:24 um if this and he sort of waves around
0:52:27 at the star charts and the Scrolls and
0:52:29 the clay tub it was found out uh the
0:52:32 premiere would come and either kill me
0:52:34 or try and rip Secrets out of my brain
0:52:36 and then kill me and since a
0:52:39 Premier is essential of this city
0:52:42 anyways the reason I'm telling you all
0:52:44 this is one this is the safest place I
0:52:46 could think to stash both of them right
0:52:47 now and two
0:52:48 the path that I walk is a path of
0:52:51 Mastery over Heaven the heavens whisper
0:52:53 to us they hold secrets of the past the
0:52:56 future the things I found out reading
0:52:58 about your horoscope
0:53:00 that wasn't just mulcavian pattern
0:53:03 recognition and nonsense that was
0:53:06 literally reading your horoscope in the
0:53:10 Stars
0:53:11 it's not just me being crazy or
0:53:13 unreliable or some mulcavian I I have
0:53:17 worked so hard over the last two decades
0:53:20 to just craft this Persona of Neil as oh
0:53:24 bumbling Neil oh harmless Neil oh Neil
0:53:28 doesn't know that Shaw is a monster oh
0:53:30 Neil doesn't know Eugene you have to
0:53:31 live it you have to live those lies
0:53:33 every day because any piece of
0:53:36 information can be found out and you
0:53:37 don't keep something like this secret if
0:53:39 you just aren't willing to live those
0:53:41 truths no
0:53:43 we won't tell anyone it sounds like you
0:53:47 don't currently talk to the esomites
0:53:50 right
0:53:51 they're not around here
0:53:54 well it doesn't matter this is something
0:53:57 that
0:53:58 would protect you from
0:54:00 look Neil
0:54:02 last night
0:54:04 when the band was playing and everyone
0:54:06 was feeding and whatever I I went
0:54:08 outside and I consulted with the Stars
0:54:11 something bad has been coming
0:54:14 I've known it for a while I've felt it
0:54:16 for a while and I saw things and I need
0:54:19 you to at least to understand and be
0:54:22 able to convince Johnny and miles
0:54:25 that it's serious
0:54:28 because I don't think they always take
0:54:30 me seriously but I saw Johnny cradling a
0:54:36 girl's body and sobbing hysterically
0:54:39 I don't know who it was I don't know if
0:54:41 it was his daughters I don't know if it
0:54:42 was you Britta I I don't know does
0:54:45 Johnny have a daughter yes
0:54:47 yes he does [ __ ] and I saw I saw all of
0:54:53 us at Elysium and a man or woman or
0:54:57 someone being thrown through the doors
0:55:00 of the Elysium and I saw Elsa Linden
0:55:01 start to freak out and then this person
0:55:05 just they were drugged and they were in
0:55:06 handcuffs and they started to crack and
0:55:09 change and
0:55:12 death was and I saw
0:55:16 three faces Scions with
0:55:20 luminescent third eyes like pearls doing
0:55:23 battle over a raging Storm against a
0:55:26 many-faced demon and I saw a baleful red
0:55:31 eye open and stare
0:55:33 and ordinarily when I look at these
0:55:35 kinds of things they're not that strong
0:55:37 and they're not that clear
0:55:40 I know it may not sound clear but
0:55:43 yeah and then I couldn't turn it off
0:55:45 when when I went I curled up in the
0:55:48 shower and I was freaking out and I was
0:55:50 trying to get away from the train
0:55:51 because I could just see it it was like
0:55:53 something wrote it back like it wouldn't
0:55:55 let me turn it off whatever connection
0:55:57 to the heavens whatever Mastery over
0:55:58 Heaven and Earth I might claim to even
0:56:01 claw my way towards
0:56:04 yeah Neil stop
0:56:09 something's coming
0:56:11 I don't think it's coincidence that
0:56:13 Xavier has his Revelation at the same
0:56:16 time that you're seeing this
0:56:19 I don't think it's coincidence
0:56:21 I don't know
0:56:23 if this zantosa is part of the problem
0:56:25 or a distraction to the problem but we
0:56:28 need to deal with it and we need to deal
0:56:29 with it now there are santosa
0:56:33 the the guy the guy making the war
0:56:37 beasts
0:56:41 I don't know but either way he needs to
0:56:44 be dealt with because he's either a
0:56:46 distraction
0:56:47 or he's part of it or I know you are
0:56:50 going to win either way
0:56:52 yeah but
0:56:54 I just we need to get Johnny and Miles
0:56:57 up and we need to deal with this and I
0:56:59 needed to tell someone what was
0:57:01 happening to take me seriously and also
0:57:03 to help because
0:57:06 my sire took me on what he said was an
0:57:09 auspicious night
0:57:10 and
0:57:12 for everything there is a season
0:57:15 turn turn turn
0:57:17 and I want to know what the season is
0:57:19 for us to move against the zentosa but
0:57:22 to do it I need
0:57:24 I need your help
0:57:28 I need
0:57:30 I mean I have buckets and I have a knife
0:57:34 I need a bowl
0:57:37 and eight uninterrupted hours with it
0:57:40 under the stars
0:57:42 and then I need
0:57:44 both of you to bleed into a bowl for me
0:57:47 I've never tried it for more people than
0:57:49 just myself that's not a huge selling
0:57:51 point I have to be honest with you but
0:57:54 I don't try it often my crop is
0:57:58 limited and he waves a hand at like the
0:58:00 red plants that he's got growing in this
0:58:05 weird sewer basement
0:58:07 are you what is this what are you
0:58:10 growing Khalif
0:58:12 that's just another word for leader no I
0:58:15 don't call it Khalif on the surface the
0:58:17 people around here sometimes come by
0:58:18 trying to find King Crimson or uh
0:58:22 redweed or Crimson devil
0:58:26 they've got a lot of names for it
0:58:27 Dario's the one who Brands it he's
0:58:29 usually the one that sells it and then I
0:58:32 Harvest
0:58:33 from those who take of it
0:58:35 those who take of it
0:58:37 it's like
0:58:40 pot and
0:58:42 heroin and LSD all rolled into one if
0:58:46 you're mortal it'll kill you
0:58:48 but
0:58:50 pretty quick that's who the blood is
0:58:52 from the folks who have taken of it yeah
0:58:55 but I need it for my studies what are
0:58:59 you studying
0:59:00 guys the paths the mastery
0:59:04 there's something there there's
0:59:07 something Beyond
0:59:09 but that's what I need from all of you
0:59:13 to try and give us the best chance
0:59:14 against the zentos of how much blood do
0:59:16 you need in a bowl
0:59:18 from us it's like a pint at the at the
0:59:21 moment that it happens
0:59:22 um and I need the time with the bowl
0:59:24 that's going to take me about eight
0:59:25 hours
0:59:26 to try to send the ladder but
0:59:29 I don't want you to look at me
0:59:31 differently after this no
0:59:34 do we do this first or do we get them we
0:59:37 get them fixed first let's get them wake
0:59:39 and try and find a bowl
0:59:41 I think we can find a ball somewhere
0:59:43 upstairs snail no a bull b-u-l-l
0:59:47 oh
0:59:48 a verse why

1:00:48 um and she goes back through the Maze
1:00:50 and climbs up and goes out the fire
1:00:53 hazard of a pawn shop yeah there are a
1:00:54 few moments where you think some of the

1:01:09 Coterie mates make I love that that's the
1:01:11 one that you're
1:01:12 oh the other is just Camry and vampire

1:01:30 can already see that from across the
1:01:31 street there's some kids playing outside
1:01:33 in the middle of winter uh occasionally
1:01:36 eyeing the Hummer that's there and has
1:01:39 no business being there I go in so far
1:01:41 the Hummer's intact I go and I lean up
1:01:43 against the Hummer okay
1:01:46 um to make my phone call and I dial in
1:01:49 uh the number for the sheriff
1:01:52 all right so uh the first time you call
1:01:55 it it goes to voicemail and it's like a
1:01:57 very generic thing kind of it's full not

1:02:32 this is probably not a thing that should
1:02:34 be explained over the phone but we do
