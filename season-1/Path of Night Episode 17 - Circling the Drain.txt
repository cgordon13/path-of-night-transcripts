0:05:17 in the city more in the sewage systems
0:05:20 in the underworld just basically like
0:05:21 new haven's underworld yeah
0:05:23 looking around to see hey
0:05:26 there was like a weird daytime raid on
0:05:28 some place a place where roland's was
0:05:31 that
0:05:32 miles was talking about what do you know
0:05:34 what can you give me okay this is going

0:05:40 don't have time for them to like wait
0:05:41 around right now i got to get back okay
0:05:43 but i just want to put the feelers out
0:05:45 so they can hopefully call something in
0:05:47 absolutely uh you do arrive back to the
0:05:49 group it looks like everyone's kind of
0:05:51 like brooding in the midst of some dark
0:05:53 [ __ ]
0:05:54 neil sort of hurries in like holding his
0:05:56 phone putting it away like clearly just
0:05:58 hanging up with somebody who do we have
0:06:00 that we trust inside the elysium right
0:06:01 now we have you know look he pulls out
0:06:03 the four minutes i got four minutes left
0:06:06 weathers
0:06:07 jane jane okay
0:06:09 you're sure do we trust the lease
0:06:12 police is also would be on our side but
0:06:15 somebody somebody who can go who can
0:06:16 just grab and go
0:06:18 elise is gonna
0:06:19 lyndon lyndon would be missed jane or
0:06:21 weathers
0:06:22 whether we missed jane jane jane do you
0:06:25 want a number for jane
0:06:26 yes i i give no it doesn't matter i
0:06:29 don't need a number for jane uh and he
0:06:31 steps out of like the back room into the
0:06:34 the main area but you can still clearly
0:06:35 hear him and he pulls the phone out and
0:06:37 calls fester back
0:06:39 pick up pick up pick up pick up pick up
0:06:41 hey yeah what's up jane
0:06:43 it's jane jane okay all right got it got

0:06:54 doing it now
0:06:55 you got two minutes
0:06:57 i bought you a one minute window jane
0:06:59 can hopefully get her out
0:07:00 we'll know in a few minutes i guess call
0:07:02 jane and tell her no she hasn't don't
0:07:04 time contact her don't talk to her how
0:07:06 is she supposed to know how is she going
0:07:08 to notice i already talked to oh i got i
0:07:10 called it
0:07:11 okay okay i'll trust you on that uh it's
0:07:14 starting it's worth a shot i guess we'll
0:07:16 find out in a few minutes
0:07:20 [Music]
0:07:22 we pick up with a group of you gathered
0:07:25 uh bunkering down at british secret cafe
0:07:28 in your possession mr zantosa
0:07:31 remains present and actually seems
0:07:33 rather docile mostly focusing on paying
0:07:37 brita attention but but he certainly
0:07:39 seems wary about her now that she's
0:07:41 going to kill him at least once
0:07:44 there's this long silence that kind of
0:07:45 sits between the group of you as you
0:07:47 wait for phone calls back or decide what
0:07:50 it is that needs to be done next and
0:07:52 this
0:07:53 old kind of quiet cafe kind of
0:07:56 it seems to have the resonance of like a
0:07:58 graveyard
0:08:00 like the two like the group of you
0:08:01 rather are just kind of in solid silence
0:08:06 at this point if jane is to succeed or
0:08:10 fail to save your daughter johnny it's
0:08:13 likely already happened
0:08:15 i think um
0:08:16 i gotta go
0:08:18 take a lap around the uh the area of
0:08:20 elysium if uh
0:08:22 if jane made it out she might need pick
0:08:24 up and then you need to be there
0:08:26 shouldn't someone be with you i don't
0:08:28 think so i think we got too many things
0:08:30 to accomplish tonight i think we gotta
0:08:32 split up
0:08:33 speaking of which
0:08:35 zantosa yes
0:08:37 johnny sticks a finger out pointing over
0:08:39 it neil
0:08:41 can you fix that the zantos kind of
0:08:43 turns and gives an eerie smile regarding
0:08:45 his handiwork just bone spurs and like a
0:08:48 ruined rib cage poking out of meal
0:08:53 yes i can
0:08:54 if that is what you wish of course
0:08:57 yeah
0:08:58 very good
0:08:59 you tonight come close
0:09:01 neil you can't be walking around looking
0:09:04 like that you know you can't and you
0:09:06 definitely can't show up to elysium
0:09:08 looking like that yeah i get it i just
0:09:10 don't
0:09:11 feel comfortable with
0:09:14 him touching me once or twice what's
0:09:16 going to make the difference
0:09:18 i don't know the answer to that question
0:09:19 which no one does hesitation yeah see
0:09:23 like that's it we'll be fine i'll attend
0:09:26 to you neil and i'll make you handsome
0:09:29 again
0:09:30 oh just the ribs what um adjust whatever
0:09:33 part of him you
0:09:34 like am
0:09:36 now if i'm if i get out on the road and
0:09:39 jane contacts one of you can you send me
0:09:42 a message on my beeper yeah
0:09:45 it can happen i do not know how it
0:09:47 or just you pretend
0:09:52 if it is your wish
0:09:54 we can find
0:09:56 ways okay no we're done talking about
0:09:58 this
0:09:59 now
0:10:00 um if you would just
0:10:02 put his ribs back where they were before
0:10:05 you moved them that would be very very
0:10:08 helpful so this is thank you we're just
0:10:09 going to do this then neil neil you can
0:10:12 see what's the other option do not be
0:10:13 afraid neil i will take care of you you
0:10:15 guys didn't
0:10:16 see that thing the same way it's not
0:10:22 it's it's intelligent it's it's
0:10:25 it is all things yeah and i don't want
0:10:27 it in me any more than is necessary neil
0:10:30 my friend look it's neil's body we know
0:10:32 each other very well at this point i
0:10:33 like to think and
0:10:35 sadly you must understand as
0:10:38 it is all things
0:10:40 so long as you carry the curse of cain
0:10:42 within your blood it is part of you look
0:10:45 santosa i asked you to fix this not say
0:10:47 a bunch of crazy [ __ ] so knock it off do
0:10:50 what i asked and shut up
0:10:52 yes johnny of course
0:10:53 neil if you want to say no you can say
0:10:55 no kind of creeps over to deal
0:10:58 neo gets to choose
0:11:01 at this point uh zantosa smarms his way
0:11:04 up to you with his like hands extended
0:11:06 and ready to go but he does
0:11:08 halt
0:11:09 right before beginning to make
0:11:10 modifications
0:11:12 neil
0:11:13 has this really like
0:11:15 conflicted
0:11:17 kind of sickened look on his face like
0:11:20 he clearly wants his chest to be fixed
0:11:23 having a big hole in your chest when
0:11:24 your heart is your weight point is not
0:11:26 cool
0:11:27 if he was mortal he would probably be
0:11:29 throwing up right now he's the look on
0:11:31 his face neil
0:11:33 i saw it too
0:11:34 i get it so you okay i get it i do
0:11:37 we can't fix it
0:11:39 until you're fixed you
0:11:42 you can't do anything about this if you
0:11:44 are not whole
0:11:46 okay okay okay do you want me to stand
0:11:49 next to you while this happens uh if i
0:11:51 start to turn into a big monster can you
0:11:53 put a fist through my head yes you want
0:11:55 to turn into a big monster but it does
0:11:57 help to sink
0:11:58 it takes your mind away from the pain
0:12:01 when you just kind of stand inside i
0:12:03 will need a bit of um
0:12:05 blood if i'm going to perform the
0:12:08 surgery
0:12:10 didn't i already feed you last night yes
0:12:13 the odd division dude is quite taxing
0:12:16 all right fine
0:12:17 johnny puts out his uh
0:12:19 his arm again he pretty happily goes to
0:12:21 the tap and sinks his fangs into
0:12:23 johnny's wrist
0:12:25 just slurps down just enough blood to do
0:12:27 what it is that he needs to do which is
0:12:29 one trait and then uh kind of like
0:12:32 licking his lips
0:12:34 he heads over to neil that is two uh two
0:12:38 steps three steps now all right nothing
0:12:40 that kneel
0:12:41 just the ribs
0:12:43 just just fix it just fix it
0:12:46 fix it
0:12:47 my friend neil you have many flaws but i
0:12:50 understand you just want the ribs
0:12:51 adjusted if you know what i mean is undo
0:12:54 what you did the the people who matter
0:12:56 don't think so and he kind of like
0:12:59 starts unbuttoning the ruins of his
0:13:00 shirt yeah i'm right now why is wood
0:13:03 said he's wearing a cardigan he starts
0:13:05 pulling a cardigan wise words said by
0:13:07 many a mother yeah
0:13:09 we'll adjust you wind stands by and puts
0:13:11 a hand on neil's shoulder does he have
0:13:13 any weird features on his skin that we
0:13:15 don't know about
0:13:16 unless
0:13:18 my teaching would have done something
0:13:20 which i don't think so there's no like
0:13:22 scarification or anything as part of the
0:13:24 process pain is actually one of the
0:13:26 methods of the latter feminists climbed
0:13:28 however you do not scar very much
0:13:30 because you are true i'm just wondering
0:13:32 like in the early nights there was
0:13:34 anything scarring doesn't happen to
0:13:36 vampires cool so then uh then no neil
0:13:39 like winces and starts to shudder as
0:13:41 soon as the zantos touches him i just
0:13:43 like sort of softly under his breath
0:13:46 starts uh mumble humming
0:13:49 moon child by king crimson
0:13:52 there you are
0:13:54 everything is going to be okay you have
0:13:56 nice ribs i drank a lot of milk in the
0:13:58 60s
0:13:59 all right
0:14:00 i'm heading out to see if i can get to
0:14:02 where jane's going hopefully i can meet
0:14:04 up with her
0:14:05 vito
0:14:06 anything that comes out of uh miles
0:14:09 mouth
0:14:10 comes out of mind understood i think so
0:14:13 whatever he says is what i want you to
0:14:16 take as if i had said it to you yes and
0:14:18 i understand though
0:14:20 johnny kind of gives him a glance
0:14:22 glances over a miles to say as if to say
0:14:24 i'm sorry and then starts walking out
0:14:29 uh he kind of takes his time and uh it
0:14:31 is a grotesque
0:14:33 ordeal
0:14:35 he adjusts the organs he lines up
0:14:40 [Music]
0:14:42 this like
0:14:43 membrane that kind of is put back
0:14:45 together and then the ribs start being
0:14:47 snapped back into place one at a time i
0:14:49 cover his ears neal's ears when the ribs
0:14:52 start snapping yes it's very good to
0:14:53 sing loud i can hear it on the inside it
0:14:56 doesn't do anything and he like plucks
0:14:58 bone from neil's heart uh which is why
0:15:00 it caused the fountain of gore in the
0:15:02 first place
0:15:03 it's almost over
0:15:06 britain is watching this like a hawk
0:15:08 just waiting for something to not look
0:15:11 right
0:15:12 uh before long everything's actually
0:15:15 locked into place and
0:15:17 uh though he's got like
0:15:19 blood staining on his skin he largely
0:15:22 actually looks okay oh so upsetting
0:15:25 you did good buddy you feel all right
0:15:27 no it's over i know i don't feel all
0:15:30 right i kind of pat you on the belly
0:15:32 okay
0:15:33 you did good okay uh oh guys there's a
0:15:36 mirror in the bathroom
0:15:38 i think so neil's gonna go wander over
0:15:40 to the mirror um
0:15:42 and look at himself in the mirror in
0:15:45 like this little
0:15:46 crack bathroom mirror through eyes of
0:15:48 chaos to see if there's anything wrong
0:15:50 that he can tell i have no idea if that
0:15:51 would actually work but this is what
0:15:52 neil does okay while he's wandering off
0:15:55 is anyone doing anything else miles has
0:15:57 been kind of looking out the back out
0:15:59 into like essentially the main room into
0:16:01 the
0:16:02 street kind of thinking when johnny
0:16:04 leaves and all that happens he grabs his
0:16:06 phone he goes towards the front
0:16:09 and starts uh making a call for
0:16:12 in regards to the subtitles i don't know
0:16:14 who i have do i have no freedom or do i
0:16:16 have the
0:16:17 her her underlying there you have
0:16:20 i cannot
0:16:26 is this
0:16:27 um the wrong number

0:16:34 i am
0:16:36 are you not happy to hear from me i'm
0:16:38 very happy to hear from you miles
0:16:41 dare i say i've
0:16:43 i expected you might one day
0:16:45 how can i help you
0:16:47 i'm looking to talk to norfolk
0:16:49 many seek the wisdom of norfolk
0:16:52 how can i help you
0:16:54 well
0:16:55 there is
0:16:56 some
0:16:58 not so great things happening in the
0:17:00 city of new haven
0:17:01 i find myself
0:17:04 enjoying
0:17:05 our continued
0:17:06 enmity but i'm stalled out by these
0:17:09 individuals and the
0:17:12 uh i want to say
0:17:14 dishonorable cowardice acts that they
0:17:16 are performing
0:17:18 miles
0:17:19 our enmity has expressed itself in so
0:17:22 few ways
0:17:24 it would be a shame
0:17:26 if you and i never quite went all the
0:17:27 way
0:17:28 that's true
0:17:30 it is uh
0:17:31 been an enjoyable discourse so far and i
0:17:34 imagine that for many nights to come
0:17:36 we'll continue to test ourselves and our
0:17:39 what's called the minions against each
0:17:41 other
0:17:42 oof hearing you say it out loud is bad
0:17:46 but miles what if i want to test you
0:17:47 directly well then i'm going to need to
0:17:50 make it through tonight
0:17:53 that's true
0:17:54 i don't really have time for that right
0:17:56 now with the
0:17:58 individuals in the city causing issues
0:18:00 that repercussions will pretty much bury
0:18:03 me
0:18:04 miles we are immortal
0:18:06 time's all we have true we're immortal
0:18:08 but we're not
0:18:09 unkillable i don't know if that's true
0:18:11 about you miles
0:18:13 well we can continue to keep testing
0:18:15 that theory
0:18:16 i have a different test in mind
0:18:18 are you familiar with the gates
0:18:21 no
0:18:22 i see
0:18:23 i will make arrangements to help you and
0:18:26 your minions
0:18:28 and in exchange
0:18:30 when i call upon you
0:18:32 you will join me willingly for one
0:18:35 evening
0:18:36 and i will take you through one of the
0:18:38 gates
0:18:40 it does not involve the murder of
0:18:42 innocence or anything at that
0:18:44 touch
0:18:45 it involves um
0:18:47 you don't have to go into detail but i
0:18:48 do not want to be
0:18:50 no no monster you see this is all about
0:18:51 detail fine
0:18:53 i didn't know if you wanted to keep it a
0:18:54 surprise
0:18:55 it involves um
0:18:58 a bit of freedom from your inhibitions
0:19:01 and that can take many forms
0:19:03 much like our conflict
0:19:05 but everything will be my choice
0:19:07 in terms of inhibitions miles the gates
0:19:11 are all about your choices
0:19:13 so that sounds like you're agreeing with
0:19:15 me yes of course
0:19:17 i have no intentions of making you a
0:19:19 slave
0:19:20 that is the way the venture
0:19:22 the way in the settings is freedom
0:19:24 most likely a slavery in a different way
0:19:28 we can make games of that
0:19:30 but i'm no slaver
0:19:33 i will agree to it very well and it just
0:19:36 so happens then because i am taking to
0:19:38 one of the gates
0:19:39 you will have an opportunity to meet
0:19:41 great norfolk as a priestess she prefers
0:19:44 to keep an eye on such things
0:19:47 so what about in helping tonight what am
0:19:49 i getting out of that you define the
0:19:51 help that you need and i will let you
0:19:53 know as to whether or not we can
0:19:54 acquiesce
0:19:56 at the bare minimum i need muscle
0:19:58 anything that can counteract the tremier
0:20:00 would be fantastic you seem to have
0:20:02 bodies of plenty over there there are
0:20:04 bodies of plenty everywhere miles yes
0:20:06 not all of them come as full-blooded
0:20:08 kindred though i can if you want them to
0:20:11 but yes of course
0:20:13 muscle is easy what about the premiere
0:20:15 the tramier i
0:20:17 have
0:20:18 a curious history with the followers of
0:20:20 set you see
0:20:22 when they
0:20:23 became kindred the magic they had
0:20:25 possessed in life was lost to them
0:20:28 and they had to develop new means of
0:20:31 applying their hermetic philosophies so
0:20:33 that they would be able to perform
0:20:34 miracles again and when they could not
0:20:37 they came to the followers of set
0:20:39 the truth is
0:20:41 that premier might and the ceres likes
0:20:44 to flaunt was made by settites
0:20:47 so it sounds like you have an answer
0:20:48 there is nothing he can do that we do
0:20:50 not have an answer for that's what i
0:20:52 like to hear
0:20:53 we plan on being in elysium in the next
0:20:55 within the next two hours
0:20:57 i will make a point of having a number
0:20:59 of agents there and
0:21:02 if
0:21:03 things escalate to the point of violence
0:21:06 you will have their support if you
0:21:08 intend to brandish them as a threat to
0:21:10 your enemies
0:21:11 they will not in support of whatever
0:21:13 threat you intend to make are you coming
0:21:15 is there going to be a fight it's a
0:21:17 possibility then no
0:21:19 fair enough but you won't need me to be
0:21:21 there for in order for my presence to be
0:21:23 felt i heard that i was just hoping to
0:21:25 see you you will just not tonight fair
0:21:28 enough she hangs up did you call us
0:21:30 minions
0:21:31 yeah that's what she understood brita
0:21:33 has been listening but has resisted the
0:21:35 temptation to be listening with all
0:21:37 specs
0:21:39 barely barely look
0:21:42 you have to talk to individuals as they
0:21:44 like to be understood and yes i called
0:21:46 people minions have you not called me
0:21:48 names i didn't imply that you were under
0:21:51 me oh so we're being technical now from
0:21:54 you yep
0:21:56 every so often i reveal that i spent two
0:21:58 semesters at community college so you're
0:22:00 technical when it's convenient yes
0:22:02 exactly i'm more worried about what's
0:22:05 what's a gate i don't know
0:22:07 find out when that happens but i wasn't
0:22:10 really in a position to say no it's a
0:22:12 said magic thing that's a pretty good
0:22:14 guess probably has to do with sex drugs
0:22:16 or rock and roll so
0:22:18 i'm a fan of some of those things neil
0:22:20 pokes his head out of the bathroom are
0:22:21 you you guys talking about magic stuff
0:22:23 as miles walks back yes i think we are
0:22:26 or could just be some sort of ritual i'm
0:22:28 not entirely sure rituals are magic
0:22:30 stuff
0:22:31 not always
0:22:33 i feel like the catholic religion has
0:22:34 been operating for a while without
0:22:36 casting magic every single time there
0:22:37 are well they have a ritual there's
0:22:40 probably catholic sources so all rituals
0:22:42 aren't magic neil
0:22:45 do you know anything about
0:22:46 said stuff uh
0:22:48 as a generality
0:22:51 maybe i know about sorcery she said
0:22:53 something about going through a gate is
0:22:55 there any bells in there give me
0:22:57 intelligence plus the cults difficulty
0:22:59 eat
0:23:00 any sorcery spec
0:23:02 apply to this yes it does all right can
0:23:04 i make that roll too
0:23:07 intelligence
0:23:09 seven but i'm still down two dice for
0:23:10 being mauled back down to a five
0:23:14 hey
0:23:15 three successes
0:23:18 no successes okay neil
0:23:21 you know they're not farming surgical in
0:23:23 nature but the followers of set perform
0:23:25 rituals intended to open the mind of
0:23:28 would-be members of their cult and what
0:23:32 it does
0:23:33 the intent is to overload
0:23:36 their senses regarding one's aspect of
0:23:39 morality to the point where it no longer
0:23:42 directs their choices and they believe
0:23:45 this as an act that liberates them from
0:23:48 slavery to the aeons
0:23:50 so i'm thinking about how i would put
0:23:52 that through the rocky philippines it's
0:23:53 like uh it's it's kind of like taking an
0:23:55 addiction right it's like say like
0:23:57 they're addicted to like say smoking
0:23:58 cigarettes it's a very very simplified
0:24:00 version sure but it's the equivalent of
0:24:02 making you smoke and smoke and smoke and
0:24:05 smoke and smoke until you've smoked so
0:24:08 much at the call of nicotine
0:24:10 is just meaningless to you and
0:24:13 you're so revolted by it that it no
0:24:16 longer holds power over you catching a
0:24:18 kid smoking a cigarette it's like all
0:24:19 right we're smoking a curtain exactly
0:24:22 so that's next step in this case they'll
0:24:25 do it in the form of something that is
0:24:26 like ecstasy
0:24:28 and they'll overload you to the point
0:24:31 where like no one's beauty or no carnal
0:24:34 desire really [ __ ] matters to you
0:24:36 anymore because you're so like numb to
0:24:38 it through it directly it's like a shifu
0:24:40 who get lost on the second level of the
0:24:42 ladder and then just never come back
0:24:44 right okay uh
0:24:47 oh okay
0:24:48 why wha what about the gates i have to
0:24:50 go through a gayten oh
0:24:53 okay or she will take me to a gate yeah
0:24:55 sure we'll take you through a gate sure
0:24:57 yeah okay
0:24:58 uh she's trying to indoctrinate you into
0:25:00 the settings this wouldn't be the first
0:25:02 organization no but this one's sort of
0:25:05 okay wow how do i think about this
0:25:07 without without referencing the letter
0:25:10 um
0:25:11 think about it like this you um
0:25:13 what's it what's a driving what's
0:25:15 driving force for you miles what's
0:25:16 what's a driving moral principle they're
0:25:18 like
0:25:19 you don't have to tell me okay but think
0:25:21 of one of your internal driving morals
0:25:23 i've i've imagined it okay
0:25:26 they're gonna sort of overload that
0:25:29 moral principle
0:25:30 of your life
0:25:32 so much so hard and so often that you're
0:25:35 you're overwhelmed by it and then it no
0:25:37 longer matters to you not information
0:25:39 and sensory overload yeah but yeah isn't
0:25:42 that part of like brainwashing
0:25:42 techniques yeah but like spiritually
0:25:45 magically
0:25:46 got it so if you want to
0:25:49 if you want to stay yourself you know go
0:25:52 go into that with
0:25:53 i don't even know of a strong will and a
0:25:54 sense of caution don't even do anything
0:25:56 but
0:25:57 we can we can cross if you know when
0:25:58 you're going you and i can try and cross
0:26:00 that bridge sure that's try and maintain
0:26:03 your sense of humor that's a tomorrow
0:26:04 night problem yeah
0:26:06 and you got out of it what some muscle
0:26:09 i've seen you've gotten a counter action
0:26:11 to the chameleon and a whole bunch of
0:26:13 full-blooded septic kindred yeah
0:26:15 political leverage to buy his time
0:26:17 people to counteract the bruha and
0:26:18 support currently leverage yeah not
0:26:20 necessarily
0:26:22 well no but to put things back on an
0:26:23 even playing field in elysium correct
0:26:25 tobias time okay and possibly if i can
0:26:28 earn us some favors there give me a
0:26:30 chance to talk to some of the brew hop
0:26:31 we'll see what i can do i'm a little
0:26:32 surprised you reached out to the satites
0:26:34 if i'm being totally honest i i thought
0:26:36 they wanted to kill you they were yes
0:26:38 but and that didn't sound like an
0:26:41 unfriendly conversation no very good
0:26:44 enemies are
0:26:46 it's hard to
0:26:48 having
0:26:49 the worth of a man is shown by the
0:26:50 enemies that he keeps
0:26:54 such a venture thing to say
0:26:56 okay
0:26:58 so she has shown herself so far
0:27:00 to be an honorable and
0:27:03 straightforward enemy versus shaw and
0:27:07 others that we're dealing with i would
0:27:08 caution you
0:27:10 that enemies who look straight forward
0:27:12 and who you assume are acting
0:27:14 straightforward are those who are most
0:27:17 capable of catching you off guard sure
0:27:20 but right now one she has muscle and two
0:27:22 i'm not saying you made a bad call i'm
0:27:24 just saying
0:27:25 it's probably the only call that we've
0:27:26 got and and kudos to you for even
0:27:28 thinking of it but i
0:27:30 i'm just worried about your
0:27:32 i know this is going to sound weird
0:27:33 coming from me of all people right now
0:27:35 but i'm worried about your soul i mean
0:27:38 i'm generally worried about my soul but
0:27:40 no but like in a more immediate and
0:27:42 understandable sense every night
0:27:44 if you say so well sure okay so what's
0:27:47 the next what's the next move
0:27:49 we gotta go to the daily gym i bought us
0:27:50 a little time we can't bring him i'm
0:27:53 debating important neil points out
0:27:56 i understand that i don't i'm not sure
0:27:59 it's an elysium if they take an action
0:28:01 against him he's
0:28:02 i don't know no he's not protected why
0:28:04 would he be protected isn't johnny's
0:28:06 child he's not acknowledged yet that's
0:28:08 the issue but there's no violence on
0:28:10 elysium
0:28:12 that's a i mean it's a pretty great goal
0:28:14 that you are technically 100 accurate
0:28:17 but if like i don't know
0:28:20 some sort of monster or something shows
0:28:21 up and starts wrecking elysium people
0:28:23 are going to fight back and then brush
0:28:24 it under the rug and and yes having us
0:28:27 and and the settings on our side helps
0:28:29 to counteract their ability to sweep
0:28:30 stuff under the rug but that doesn't
0:28:32 mean you know they could make it seem
0:28:34 very reasonable and shaw and race are
0:28:36 both very good at disappearing people
0:28:38 you know
0:28:39 you currently the cenotal is in power
0:28:41 which means he can make determinations
0:28:42 like destruction exactly that is true
0:28:45 and so
0:28:46 we we can't bring the zentos he's our
0:28:48 he's our only i mean miles just bought
0:28:50 us another chip but what if he doesn't
0:28:52 look like him they're expecting it and
0:28:53 they know we have him so if some other
0:28:55 rando shows up with us you know they
0:28:57 don't i don't even know if most of them
0:28:59 except for shawn know what he looks like
0:29:00 so on top of that it's getting more or
0:29:02 more blood and we're not exactly over
0:29:04 flowing without it no so let's talk
0:29:07 about the recess that we do okay so so
0:29:08 so somebody needs to go to the elise and
0:29:10 it has to happen now right yes johnny's
0:29:13 on his way
0:29:14 my
0:29:15 suggestion
0:29:16 is i mean wind's
0:29:18 not wrong you're not wrong about the
0:29:20 potential for violence uh having me
0:29:21 there with you is not gonna be as
0:29:23 helpful
0:29:24 i would stick you know johnny is
0:29:26 understandably going for a walk or a
0:29:28 drive or whatever johnny he's going to
0:29:30 elysium okay so he'll be in the area but
0:29:32 if he's
0:29:34 acting in a way that i anticipate he
0:29:35 might act you know he might not actually
0:29:38 be there depending on how successful
0:29:40 jane is yeah which means you need to win
0:29:44 yeah but only if you can keep yourself
0:29:46 in check i can keep myself in check or
0:29:47 reese is gonna be there he's gonna push
0:29:48 buttons he is
0:29:50 you can be okay with that i will do a
0:29:53 lot to protect you guys okay
0:29:55 straight from the moment reese's time
0:29:57 was not not up but
0:30:00 i don't leaning i don't like his stay at
0:30:02 least in this particular domain vito has
0:30:05 to stay here or has to say not there and
0:30:08 brilliant you kind of have to stay with
0:30:09 vito what about with marcos i'm not
0:30:12 leaving him with marcos but we're going
0:30:14 to stop by
0:30:15 my dress
0:30:17 what i'm saying is if he is going to
0:30:20 listen to brita he has to be with brita
0:30:22 but we have seen that
0:30:24 no offense predator please don't be
0:30:26 upset that i'm mentioning this but
0:30:28 you but i tried to shoot him yeah you
0:30:30 can't necessarily be trusted 100 alone
0:30:32 with him so one of us needs to stay here
0:30:34 with you with him that leads me to my
0:30:37 next thing before i go and i also i am
0:30:39 the only one left and i need to have a
0:30:41 discussion with britta by herself
0:30:44 okay i need to eat
0:30:47 so if you need to have that discussion
0:30:48 before we go to elysium i'll take that
0:30:51 time and go be quick yeah when and i can
0:30:53 be quick you want to go out and we'll
0:30:55 just we'll leave you guys along yeah is
0:30:57 that miles is that that should be fine
0:31:00 i'm just i'm also storming
0:31:03 but i
0:31:04 you're waiting
0:31:05 if you'd rather me be here no you're the
0:31:07 boss
0:31:08 go eat okay now that i have permission
0:31:11 come on buddy let's go get some scumbags
0:31:13 neil not stores the door walks out with
0:31:16 leaving brita and miles alone
0:31:21 [Music]
0:31:24 then it was just the two of you and azam
0:31:26 and
0:31:28 uh i assume he's locked in a
0:31:31 kind of quietly minding his own business
0:31:34 while the two of you
0:31:37 sit together in awkward silence just
0:31:40 miles
0:31:41 in brita first is there like a like a
0:31:44 bathroom or something that we can lock
0:31:45 zantosa into for right now i was just in
0:31:47 there it was established that there was
0:31:48 a bathroom there is indeed a bathroom is
0:31:50 there a window in the bathroom my point
0:31:52 of point of clarification on all of this
0:31:54 so he was a ghoul oh i'm just saying who
0:31:57 had already had like disciplines i also
0:31:59 embraced him brouha which means that he
0:32:01 probably has potence oh yeah it just
0:32:03 makes me feel better
0:32:05 it means that he's going
0:32:07 you know that bruja break things yeah
0:32:10 and it'll make noise at that point
0:32:11 that's really all i'm looking for
0:32:13 i don't want him to like creeping around
0:32:15 the corner i just like
0:32:17 yeah
0:32:19 yeah
0:32:20 that's that's exactly what i'm going to
0:32:21 try talking to him yeah yes i would like
0:32:23 to have a private conversation with
0:32:24 britta can you like [ __ ] off
0:32:27 but i don't want him to like leave i was
0:32:29 given permission to go
0:32:32 dominate people i could i could i've
0:32:35 been not doing that in life like i don't
0:32:37 know if you know that's a seal he can't
0:32:40 he's going through that later anyway
0:32:43 like he's going through that gate later
0:32:44 anyways
0:32:46 and that's basically been one of the few
0:32:48 people i've mesmerized
0:32:51 and that's because i was afraid she was
0:32:52 going to start shooting
0:32:56 just draw a chocolate and chalk outline
0:32:58 around him just be like don't leave the
0:32:59 circle
0:33:01 okay this seems childish
0:33:03 so good to lock him in the bathroom
0:33:07 all right
0:33:08 i look over at the zentos i'm like can
0:33:09 you give us some room just go behind a
0:33:12 closed door but stay nearby yes of
0:33:14 course thank you
0:33:15 where did johnny go does he want to go
0:33:18 check on something
0:33:20 what is he checking on
0:33:21 is it
0:33:22 important yes
0:33:25 he's gone to check on
0:33:28 that's the word i'm looking for here um
0:33:29 someone under his care yeah someone
0:33:31 underscore
0:33:33 okay he kind of wanders off
0:33:36 please stay inside the building
0:33:38 miles
0:33:40 please sit brita does find a seat and uh
0:33:43 sits kind of gingerly crossing her legs
0:33:45 and her arms over herself
0:33:47 so you have a choice to make and i'm not
0:33:49 even guaranteeing that i can do anything
0:33:50 at this point but right now you have
0:33:52 both a blessing and a curse right now
0:33:55 you can choose
0:33:57 what you're doing
0:33:58 you know who you are currently and
0:34:01 you have a relatively blank slate
0:34:05 but it's starting to show something that
0:34:08 what you were showed up with the zantosa
0:34:11 and has slowly been showing up since you
0:34:13 started being more comfortable it may be
0:34:16 a discipline of the mind and i might be
0:34:18 able to break through and see your
0:34:20 memories prior
0:34:22 you
0:34:23 want to use the mind control thing the
0:34:26 discipline on me
0:34:27 it's a possibility
0:34:29 one it might not work for various
0:34:31 reasons
0:34:32 and two you might not want it to work
0:34:36 neil was saying
0:34:37 something like that too like
0:34:40 like maybe i don't want to know my past
0:34:42 like maybe
0:34:44 i want to leave some things in the dark
0:34:46 and
0:34:46 the more that i do that i don't
0:34:48 want to do that i don't even know that
0:34:50 i'm doing
0:34:52 i don't
0:34:53 know if you or if neil or anyone is
0:34:56 right about that maybe i don't want it
0:34:58 to work but
0:34:59 i only
0:35:01 have who i am now
0:35:03 and
0:35:04 who i am now
0:35:08 i
0:35:10 i think you should try it miles
0:35:12 if you
0:35:14 if you think you
0:35:15 if you think it would help i
0:35:17 do not phrase it in those ways
0:35:19 you need to make a choice
0:35:22 do you want to know what is in your past
0:35:25 and it may come with a whole slew of new
0:35:28 complications or do you want to keep
0:35:31 keep it locked up do you want to keep
0:35:32 being
0:35:34 you that you know now
0:35:36 not about helping
0:35:37 this is a choice you need to make
0:35:40 and this has been a choice that i've
0:35:41 been telling you that you're probably
0:35:43 going to need to make since we first
0:35:44 started this
0:35:46 yes
0:35:48 there's only one option to me
0:35:52 to unlock it
0:35:53 all right
0:35:54 [Music]
0:36:00 you still don't have any weapons
0:36:01 sorry well i'm pretty sure we disarmed
0:36:03 you right but do you have any other
0:36:05 weapons on you i'd really rather not get
0:36:07 stabbed brita passed herself down as if
0:36:11 like not sure if she would have
0:36:12 forgotten that she had like a pistol or
0:36:15 something on her she she doesn't she
0:36:17 doesn't carry any weapons and
0:36:19 she shows her empty hands five minutes
0:36:21 later there's just a [ __ ] pile of
0:36:24 guns
0:36:25 [Laughter]
0:36:31 how do you even get one under the rib
0:36:33 cage
0:36:38 right so he gets up he stands over and
0:36:41 kind of puts his hands like around the
0:36:43 eyes
0:36:44 and like looks directly to them and goes
0:36:47 let's see what they buried in here
0:36:49 okay miles
0:36:51 then i will try
0:36:52 a forgetful mind and see if it's even
0:36:54 even something that this is
0:36:57 let's roll it
0:36:58 brett is sitting very still very much
0:37:01 allowing miles to do this and sitting
0:37:03 almost like trying to help him with her
0:37:05 own posture and the openness of her
0:37:07 expression
0:37:08 it is probably also the closest
0:37:10 he's ever been
0:37:12 yeah because what was it you had your
0:37:14 hands on her temples basically around
0:37:16 like my hands are framing your eyes
0:37:18 almost because i'm basically looking
0:37:20 directly into them yeah this close you
0:37:22 can really see how light bretta's eyes
0:37:24 are uh
0:37:26 wide because of the circumstance
0:37:28 but she's looking back at you
0:37:29 it's the abyss addressing me
0:37:32 that's when you know she has mouths for
0:37:34 eyes
0:37:39 i need you to make a wood sub cathedral
0:37:43 the difficulty of this role is 10.
0:37:46 do you mean with empathy sorry what's
0:37:48 empathy yep i am spending a little power
0:37:51 different you said yes
0:37:53 that is factoring in your minus two
0:37:54 difficulties
0:37:58 three successes
0:38:00 that's included willpower yep
0:38:02 okay so
0:38:04 the process for using this this one
0:38:07 requires you to speak to her as though
0:38:10 you're a hypnotist
0:38:12 evoking memories so you lock eyes with
0:38:14 her
0:38:15 and
0:38:16 and what do you say
0:38:18 listen to the sound of my voice
0:38:22 become
0:38:24 as we go back
0:38:26 i need you to tell me
0:38:29 about
0:38:31 who
0:38:33 trained you to use a gun
0:38:37 who trained you to deal with kindred
0:38:41 i
0:38:42 remember the man from that vision
0:38:47 that i had
0:38:48 as you kind of like
0:38:50 try to think back to that vision
0:38:53 you feel as though you're splashed
0:38:56 with like cold cold ocean water
0:39:02 [Music]
0:39:06 when you open your eyes you no longer
0:39:08 feel or see or hear the conversation
0:39:10 that you're having with miles
0:39:12 and instead you feel the sensation of
0:39:15 you
0:39:17 that odd weightlessness that kind of
0:39:18 comes with being on like on a small boat
0:39:21 you are in an ashen gray world
0:39:25 on this little boat
0:39:26 is yourself
0:39:29 three others uh young children you don't
0:39:32 know their names
0:39:33 you never really met them and however
0:39:36 you do know that the individual that is
0:39:38 leading you this person that is clad in
0:39:42 this black cowl with
0:39:44 strange silver and yellow like trimming
0:39:48 adorning it kind of detailing all these
0:39:50 like strange occult symbols symbols that
0:39:52 would be important to you one day
0:39:55 but are just bizarre and meaningless to
0:39:57 you in this moment
0:39:59 it gets off the boat and it turns to
0:40:01 each of you extending a cold dead hand
0:40:05 and one at a time you take its hand and
0:40:07 it leads you unsure and this person
0:40:12 they look to be of kind of like a like a
0:40:15 eastern descent
0:40:17 with kind of receding thinning hair
0:40:20 and
0:40:21 when it's well as it helps you and kind
0:40:23 of takes your little hand
0:40:24 it gives you this eerie smile
0:40:27 with teeth like sharp teeth
0:40:30 that kind of go from ear to ear and
0:40:32 extend a little longer than it should
0:40:35 strangely like
0:40:36 very similar to
0:40:38 to like how you remember shaw
0:40:40 and and for a moment you can kind of
0:40:41 you're like aware of present day but
0:40:43 then you know you're firmly back there
0:40:44 again this broad smile
0:40:47 uh smiled figure kind of takes you
0:40:50 onto land and
0:40:53 it whispers to you
0:40:55 you are chosen child
0:40:58 and you will do the work of those who
0:41:00 sleep
0:41:02 you
0:41:03 you will come with me and you will learn
0:41:06 and i will make you more than you are
0:41:09 more than you could have been
0:41:11 it is
0:41:12 a fair trade
0:41:14 for the gift of flesh that your parents
0:41:16 have provided me
0:41:18 for their sustenance
0:41:21 i will give you a new life
0:41:24 and that kind of like leads you along
0:41:25 and at first you're not
0:41:27 completely sure but then there are these
0:41:29 other fragments of memories of this
0:41:32 this creature that has you eating
0:41:35 the flesh of your newly dead parents
0:41:38 you don't remember their names you don't
0:41:40 even remember well what they look like
0:41:41 but you do remember
0:41:43 the way
0:41:44 their flesh looked being like gnawed and
0:41:47 chewed on by this thing with razor sharp
0:41:50 teeth and then leads you in and
0:41:53 remember it kind of fades again and you
0:41:56 find yourself
0:41:57 at
0:41:58 what's kind of a classic firing range
0:42:01 but again the world is action gray and
0:42:03 dark and there is a man with
0:42:06 evan's skin
0:42:08 who
0:42:09 is very difficult to keep track of he's
0:42:10 very like light in his feet you never
0:42:12 quite hear him while he's moving around
0:42:15 just this very elegant and skilled man
0:42:19 and you you're at this firing range and
0:42:21 he just has you assembling and
0:42:23 disassembling a gun over and over and
0:42:25 over again running drills
0:42:28 to the point where like your knuckles
0:42:29 have gone numb and you don't know how
0:42:32 long you've been here at this point
0:42:34 because you're staying a little taller
0:42:36 you're a little more mature
0:42:38 and then time passes
0:42:41 again
0:42:42 and
0:42:43 you find yourself
0:42:44 kind of moving through these streets
0:42:47 cobblestone somewhere in europe you're
0:42:50 not completely sure and it's just this
0:42:52 series of flashes of
0:42:55 of memories of assembling and
0:42:56 disassembling guns over and over and
0:42:58 over and over again
0:43:04 [Music]
0:43:08 miles you're not completely sure it
0:43:09 worked like you talked to her for a
0:43:10 moment and
0:43:13 she looks back at you
0:43:15 and just kind of gives this
0:43:17 wide
0:43:18 eerie toothy smile
0:43:21 and then the effect of the dominate
0:43:23 fades
0:43:26 you come to again
0:43:28 blocking eyes with with miles with these
0:43:31 very strange memories fresh in your mind
0:43:35 she raises a hand to her face and can
0:43:37 feel that she was
0:43:39 smiling
0:43:40 she doesn't remember doing
0:43:43 no you just know that you were smiling
0:43:44 just like he smiled at you
0:43:46 and her fingers sort of linger along
0:43:50 the line of her mouth and where a very
0:43:53 wide mouth would connect from ear to ear
0:43:56 almost as if she's checking that there's
0:43:58 still flesh there that her lips don't
0:44:01 open that wide
0:44:03 once that sort of tactile conformation
0:44:06 goes through in her brain she'll take
0:44:08 her hand back put it back in her lap and
0:44:10 um look at you
0:44:12 and say
0:44:13 i
0:44:14 remember some things
0:44:16 no
0:44:18 that's good
0:44:20 something i can do something about
0:44:22 um
0:44:23 a man
0:44:25 with
0:44:26 a man with a
0:44:28 wide smile not just a wide smile a smile
0:44:31 like
0:44:32 almost like like like a
0:44:34 like his mouth is too big for his face
0:44:39 eating
0:44:40 my parents
0:44:42 hold a sec
0:44:43 i go behind the counter something like
0:44:45 that and grab a pencil
0:44:48 i don't want you to lose this and i'm
0:44:50 pretty much useless in this kind of
0:44:52 information please write this down while
0:44:53 you're still fresh brita takes the pen
0:44:56 and paper and just starts writing
0:45:00 and
0:45:01 way more than she was telling you uh she
0:45:04 seems to be starting from the beginning
0:45:06 but as you can see while she's taking
0:45:07 the notes they're very quick
0:45:09 and
0:45:10 they sort of uh almost have a circuitous
0:45:12 nature to them like she's kind of
0:45:13 panicking while writing it down you see
0:45:16 big hesitations however points where
0:45:19 her eyes fill up with tears
0:45:21 points where
0:45:23 somewhere along the way i will tell you
0:45:25 to calm down
0:45:26 and once you remember that you're still
0:45:28 under mesmerism you will see sort of a
0:45:30 hand flick so something that looks
0:45:32 familiar to you that the first movement
0:45:35 of her resetting a gun and that might be
0:45:37 a point that you would notice that she's
0:45:41 iffy
0:45:42 keep writing for a second let me go
0:45:44 check on santosa okay
0:45:46 let's go make sure he's still here he's
0:45:48 not awesome
0:45:51 awesome
