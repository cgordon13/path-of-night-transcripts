0:00:00 path of night is an actual play vampire
0:00:02 the masquerade podcast set in the
0:00:03 classic world of darkness we're all
0:00:05 friends we're to have fun but our story
0:00:07 can include graphic violence drug use
0:00:10 sexual content and other mature themes
0:00:12 we've talked at our table about safety
0:00:14 comfort and consent both as players and
0:00:16 storytellers we know what to expect
0:00:19 we're all excited to be here and we want
0:00:21 you to feel the same so listener
0:00:23 discretion is advised
0:00:24 now let's walk the path of night
0:00:28 last time on path of night mccordrey met
0:00:30 at the royale a bar where miles finds
0:00:32 ample feeding opportunities wynn
0:00:34 revealed the physical consequences of
0:00:36 losing her cold during the fight with
0:00:37 the weeping bear cobra patterns on her
0:00:39 skin and unseemly fangs in her mouth
0:00:41 after being forewarned by neal the
0:00:43 quartering discussed plans to ambush the
0:00:45 setai hit squad coming to kill miles as
0:00:47 well as the coming sabah crusade at a
0:00:49 farm outside the city wynn and the
0:00:51 predator helped neal procure a bull the
0:00:53 malkavians sacrificed the animal in a
0:00:55 bloody ritual drinking of its drug blood
0:00:57 and ascending the ladder of heaven where
0:00:59 he was confronted with visions exhausted
0:01:01 and traumatized after the unexpectedly
0:01:03 harrowing evening the members of the
0:01:05 quarter returned to new haven to prepare
0:01:07 for the nights to come
0:01:08 [Music]
0:01:10 johnny in the dead of the night you find
0:01:12 yourself headed towards downtown new
0:01:14 haven and there you come upon toad's
0:01:16 place this is
0:01:18 a world of darkness reflection so the
0:01:20 building is much taller than it would be
0:01:22 in the real world and it is bedecked
0:01:26 with
0:01:27 those classic gargoyles that kind of
0:01:29 rest their chins on their fists and
0:01:31 stare down over the city itself at its
0:01:33 flanks our other buildings a lot of them
0:01:35 kind of shaped much more like
0:01:38 gothic-styled cathedrals than
0:01:40 modern era buildings when you get into
0:01:43 toad's place you're welcomed pretty
0:01:44 quickly some of jane's goals kind of
0:01:47 show you along the way and they take you
0:01:49 to the emergency stairwell is there
0:01:51 anyone playing at the at the it's like
0:01:53 it's dead it was rented nobody's really
0:01:55 doing anything so she got some music
0:01:57 playing over the exactly yeah uh the bar
0:02:00 is moving so there is some hunting
0:02:02 available if you find yourself needing
0:02:03 it but for the most part they usher you
0:02:05 up the stairs out the the rooftop exit
0:02:09 and you find yourself amidst a crowd of
0:02:12 your clan mate uh you immediately see a
0:02:14 couple of faces that you recognize jane
0:02:16 is there and she's mostly kind of
0:02:18 operating as something of like fun
0:02:20 police when bruha get a little too rowdy
0:02:22 she kind of tones things down she never
0:02:24 does it overtly she's never like you
0:02:26 know shut up she kind of uh very deftly
0:02:29 pivots the conversation more towards
0:02:31 agreeable topics to keep people from
0:02:33 boiling out of control this early on in
0:02:35 the meeting yeah weathers is
0:02:38 has got like a little bit of a gloomy
0:02:39 look to him he definitely seems to have
0:02:41 this this pens of expression you get the
0:02:43 idea that he might be having some second
0:02:46 thoughts about some of the things that
0:02:47 you're concerned with as well yep and
0:02:49 then there's amaya who is the baron of
0:02:52 new haven county what does amaya look
0:02:54 like important thing about amaya is that
0:02:56 her appearance isn't actually incredibly
0:02:58 consistent a lot of
0:02:59 kindred tend to keep the same haircut
0:03:02 same general look that they had during
0:03:04 their embrace
0:03:05 she does not do that she has a pretty
0:03:07 dark skin she tends to keep it like in
0:03:08 cornrows sometimes she has like a weave
0:03:12 done into her hair right now she's got
0:03:14 like big hoop earrings leather jacket
0:03:16 jeans she's kind of in Brujahh uniform
0:03:18 what kind of reputation does she have
0:03:19 you're actually not terribly familiar
0:03:21 with her a lot of your interactions have
0:03:23 been with weathers right in the camera
0:03:25 you do know that she's appeared at
0:03:27 elysium on occasion but that's pretty
0:03:29 much the extent of it right now she
0:03:31 seems to have a pretty friendly
0:03:32 relationship with weather's though right
0:03:33 now and she is kind of giving some
0:03:37 younger brouha the pitch maybe instead
0:03:39 of working for
0:03:41 shaw like they have been maybe they can
0:03:43 take that step walk away from the camera
0:03:46 and not be forced to do some of the
0:03:47 things that are going on so people are
0:03:48 kind of like getting ahead of themselves
0:03:50 a little bit and trying to sway opinions
0:03:53 but once you arrive
0:03:55 weathers cause am i over the Brujah start
0:03:58 to kind of quiet down and
0:04:00 a rant begins to come underway so once
0:04:03 everything kinda starts to get quiet
0:04:05 weathers speaks up over
0:04:07 those who are still kind of whispering
0:04:08 in hush tones
0:04:10 all right
0:04:11 i think it's time we just get this over
0:04:12 and done with i know there's been a lot
0:04:14 going on and
0:04:16 some of it's got a lot of us rubbed the
0:04:17 wrong way immediately a couple of bra
0:04:20 are like yeah rub the wrong way and get
0:04:23 it and like you know stupid like finger
0:04:25 guns and johnny nasty looks probably
0:04:29 along with quite a few other Brujah at
0:04:31 the uh assembled on the roof yeah the
0:04:32 the idiots kind of get quieted down
0:04:35 pretty quick it's it's pretty clear that
0:04:36 they're there for for laughs and not to
0:04:38 really get anything important
0:04:39 accomplished there's always a few but
0:04:41 when you
0:04:42 kind of give that look weathers casts
0:04:45 his gaze on you
0:04:47 johnny yeah
0:04:49 there are stories going around about
0:04:52 Brujah killing settites
0:04:55 what do you know about this
0:04:57 Brujah killing settites yeah alex there's
0:04:59 some sort of escalation happening
0:05:01 yeah i don't know anything uh
0:05:03 about escalation or not but uh i may
0:05:07 have defended myself against a couple of
0:05:10 uh
0:05:11 outsiders from the sect whether they
0:05:13 were settings or not never stopped to
0:05:15 ask you think this is something that the
0:05:17 bureau needs to look out for
0:05:19 what's your thoughts on it
0:05:21 lay it on me
0:05:22 i think the settings business is is
0:05:24 personal with me and my Coterie i don't
0:05:26 think that it's anything to do with the
0:05:27 clan
0:05:28 but
0:05:29 i can guarantee you that if uh
0:05:32 the Setites start
0:05:34 acting up more
0:05:35 it's probably gonna fall on the clan to
0:05:37 have to deal with it
0:05:38 amaya interjects what do you consider
0:05:40 acting up then because last i checked
0:05:43 they've been picking up arms all over
0:05:44 the place and they're trying to hire
0:05:46 thugs
0:05:47 subtitles picking up arms that's right
0:05:49 from what i know the settites are
0:05:51 selling arms
0:05:52 i know the camarilla is buying
0:05:54 morgan a cadif associated with the
0:05:56 settites he's the one that ran them guns
0:05:59 satites want a lot of guns they want a
0:06:01 lot of goons and we don't really know
0:06:03 why so for all we know is that they're
0:06:06 apparently cruising around for Brujah to
0:06:08 try and pick bruh up
0:06:10 don't know you're the only one that's
0:06:12 gotten into a fight with them what
0:06:13 happened why why is this
0:06:15 do we need to look out i don't think the
0:06:18 uh
0:06:19 i don't think the Setites are going
0:06:20 to be a problem for the clan like i said
0:06:23 i think they're mostly uh coming after
0:06:25 my Coterie because of business that
0:06:27 miles has with them you all know miles
0:06:30 you remember why he uh
0:06:32 he pissed off the settights
0:06:34 the couple seemed to like oh yeah yeah
0:06:36 yeah that weird animal thing
0:06:38 the killer goat right like a like what
0:06:40 was it it was a cat
0:06:42 something kind of weird kill the steak
0:06:45 desert cat
0:06:46 who knows look the point is
0:06:48 that's personal business
0:06:50 i think all of the weird moves they're
0:06:52 making are more in reaction to how the
0:06:54 camarilla is reacting to what's going on
0:06:56 with sabbat speaking of which quiet
0:06:59 i think we need to start talking about
0:07:00 what's going on with the sabbat because
0:07:02 i don't like what people are doing in
0:07:05 response
0:07:07 namely telling us we should be making
0:07:08 children
0:07:10 you gotta hear some chatter among them
0:07:12 the prince
0:07:13 the prince
0:07:14 oversteps but we're in a society where
0:07:16 there aren't really many consequences
0:07:18 that aren't permanent
0:07:19 and if he's right this problem is coming
0:07:22 what happens if a praxis kicks off
0:07:26 right before a sabbat attack
0:07:28 practice on Rowlands i don't know i don't
0:07:31 think that'll be too much of a blip on
0:07:32 the radar if it was maybe a strong
0:07:34 prince then maybe something would happen
0:07:37 some Brujah raised their hands like yo we
0:07:38 can help
0:07:40 shaw
0:07:42 he'll take it
0:07:43 and a bunch of broad start kind of i
0:07:45 didn't realize we were letting nosferatu
0:07:47 in this rant
0:07:49 shaw page is better than any of the
0:07:51 clans
0:07:53 Brujah included but like i said this is a
0:07:55 this rant is for Brujahs you can take
0:07:57 your ugly mugs out of here oh no no
0:07:59 those are brass oh i i realize okay
0:08:03 yeah no you could take your ugly mugs
0:08:05 out of here and go back to your boot
0:08:06 looking clan warren's like yeah guys
0:08:08 calm down obviously johnny wants to be
0:08:10 prince he's got what it takes right
0:08:13 you're a problem solver looks like
0:08:14 shaw's the choice and they're kind of
0:08:16 like yeah yeah yeah and they like kind
0:08:18 of hype each other up to be perfectly
0:08:20 honest johnny will actually like get up
0:08:23 and and go towards the center they
0:08:25 actually kind of part to give you space
0:08:27 even the ones that are passed at you
0:08:29 we've got a lot of problems with the
0:08:31 clan right now we're being told that we
0:08:33 got to make soldiers for a ventrue army
0:08:36 that's going to somehow defeat the
0:08:38 sabbat it was a Brujah in charge of this
0:08:41 force maybe i'd be a little bit more
0:08:42 inclined to provide them with with
0:08:44 children to actually save us but instead
0:08:48 we got what's his name looks kind of at
0:08:50 weathers this guy who's raising an army
0:08:52 he gives you like a look
0:08:55 the main force that they'd be joining up
0:08:56 with is roman pendragon's army
0:08:59 pendragon
0:09:00 he is a Brujah
0:09:01 is he yeah
0:09:03 why is he not here i don't think it's a
0:09:05 bad thing that he's not here roman
0:09:07 pendragon is cold-blooded
0:09:11 monstrous comes from the old world he
0:09:13 does not give a [ __ ] about anything that
0:09:15 happens to us
0:09:16 and who does he work for
0:09:18 himself yeah
0:09:20 yeah
0:09:21 all right gather up
0:09:23 you kind of like motions for the bra to
0:09:24 kind of get a little closer johnny
0:09:27 you kind of you struck a really old
0:09:29 nerve just now
0:09:31 you see
0:09:32 roman pendragon was part of a
0:09:34 three-point operation
0:09:36 three very powerful elders came from
0:09:39 europe with the intentions of seizing
0:09:41 control of new england roman pendragon
0:09:43 was one of them he's one of the most
0:09:45 overt members of this group or the
0:09:48 others
0:09:48 i think that might be a conversation for
0:09:50 another night kind of looks around at
0:09:52 the rest of the bravo to see if they're
0:09:53 accepting that they're kind of like
0:09:55 not but no one's like ready to punch
0:09:58 whether it's for it you know what i mean
0:10:00 yeah they're like dick move but like
0:10:02 they don't want to step
0:10:04 it's called operation longbow
0:10:06 longbow yup pendragon's been up north
0:10:11 warring with the sabbah for years
0:10:13 and the tactics he uses
0:10:16 are cruel
0:10:17 he fights like sabbat so raising
0:10:20 shovelheads and throwing them at their
0:10:22 territories that's right without care
0:10:23 about who's survival and when a prince
0:10:25 gets nervous
0:10:27 isn't sure they're going to be able to
0:10:28 hold their territory
0:10:30 he comes along to help them and in
0:10:32 exchange all he wants
0:10:34 is their quiet compliance
0:10:36 and meat for the meat grinder so this
0:10:38 guy doesn't give a [ __ ] about the clan
0:10:40 then does he he cares in so much that he
0:10:42 thinks we're good weapons
0:10:44 but he's the one that's got Pendragon
0:10:47 making this move
0:10:48 him
0:10:49 and shaw
0:10:50 shaw
0:10:51 shaw's got ties to Pendragon's army
0:10:54 when these Brujah are embraced he looks
0:10:56 among the brah that are there some of
0:10:58 you already know this
0:11:00 shaw's gonna be this their handler
0:11:02 within the city well that gets me to my
0:11:04 second problem the fact that we've got
0:11:06 traitors in this clan that are sucking
0:11:09 shaw's dick we got brouhaha they don't
0:11:11 give a [ __ ] about the rest of their clan
0:11:13 mates just because this one nosferatu
0:11:16 can pay better i think these dumb shits
0:11:18 should be ejected out of the clan one of
0:11:21 the Brujahs kind of gets a guy named joey
0:11:23 you see him right he's the one that kind
0:11:25 of tried to shoulder check you yeah uh
0:11:27 that other night in elysium doesn't go
0:11:28 so great for him johnny most Brujah work
0:11:31 for shaw
0:11:33 you're the odd man now i kind of look
0:11:35 over at amaya and uh and her people i
0:11:38 don't know you any of you anarchs work
0:11:40 for shaw apparently he pays real well
0:11:42 amaya smiles
0:11:45 hey johnny you know if this camarilla
0:11:47 thing's not working out you don't have
0:11:49 to work for shaw
0:11:51 you don't have to embrace against your
0:11:52 will the prince doesn't own you he can't
0:11:54 make you do these things you're a person
0:11:57 no but i i got loyalty to people who've
0:11:59 had my back in the past clan mates i
0:12:02 look over at weathers it kind of gives
0:12:04 you a nod of solidarity as you
0:12:06 reject amaya's
0:12:08 advance am i i respect your people
0:12:11 because they owe loyalty to you but i'll
0:12:13 loyalty to weathers the primogen of our
0:12:16 clan
0:12:17 and then he starts kind of giving real
0:12:19 mean eyes to some of the guys in the at
0:12:21 the rant that he knows are working for
0:12:23 uh for shaw
0:12:25 joey stares daggers back at you
0:12:27 weathers is primitive so long as your
0:12:30 boy is still prince
0:12:32 when he's not prince anymore
0:12:35 there's going to be a new primitive you
0:12:38 my friend
0:12:39 are preaching from a sinking ship a ship
0:12:41 that you just said yourself needs to go
0:12:43 down
0:12:44 you need some perspective
0:12:46 oh yeah yeah
0:12:48 and what kind of perspective do i need i
0:12:50 think you need to understand that shaw
0:12:53 is the future johnny starts taking steps
0:12:56 closer towards joey he kind of like does
0:12:58 the same but like one of his boys holds
0:13:00 him back for your sake
0:13:03 he's the future and this this uh
0:13:07 family
0:13:08 nonsense this this loyalty
0:13:11 to whether
0:13:12 doesn't do [ __ ] for you doesn't do [ __ ]
0:13:14 for any of us that's the past
0:13:17 let it go you know there's a lot of a
0:13:19 lot of benefits to being part of the
0:13:21 clan Brujah i get to come to rants
0:13:25 it like makes a big show of like
0:13:26 breathing in the the night air you get
0:13:29 to breathe this nice air up here you
0:13:32 want to hang out with shaw on the sewers
0:13:34 let me show you the door and he will
0:13:36 celerity over this guy grab him by his
0:13:39 shirt and toss him off the roof all
0:13:40 right so it sounds like we're going into
0:13:42 combat oh yeah
0:13:43 it wasn't an if it was a win
0:13:46 so joey and two of his boys are going to
0:13:49 be rolling into combat against you
0:13:51 all right
0:13:52 so again you're rolling 1d10
0:13:55 that's a 10. adding your decks plus
0:13:57 widths to the total and unspent Celerity
0:14:00 so i want to spend probably one celerity
0:14:02 so that i can grapple and throw right
0:14:06 16 17. 17 for an ish yup initiative 19
0:14:10 and 16. amaya and weathers kind of hold
0:14:14 and are watching to see
0:14:16 what kind of a fair fight you're given
0:14:18 all right so johnny is going to we're
0:14:21 just going to grab him so i'll spend a
0:14:22 point of blood to increase my strength
0:14:24 [Music]
0:14:27 so we're looking at four successes you
0:14:28 reach out you snatch him up by his neck
0:14:31 his feet dangle off the ground
0:14:33 as you get a hold of him joey acting on
0:14:36 a 15 initiative is going to attempt to
0:14:37 break free of your hold absolutely
0:14:41 there's two
0:14:42 successes all right well um i do have
0:14:46 powerful arms nine successes with uh
0:14:49 nine successes against his two you're
0:14:51 just kind of holding him with one hand
0:14:54 at that point and you can hear the pop
0:14:56 of his jaw as you squeeze tighter while
0:14:58 he tries to escape the next Brujah one of
0:15:00 the guys the one that specifically
0:15:02 actually held him back
0:15:03 he comes running at you with fangs baird
0:15:07 and uh in his hand he's got these like
0:15:11 brass knocks that are
0:15:13 that are kind of like glinting in the
0:15:14 dark and he swings pretty wild for you
0:15:17 all right
0:15:19 and whiffs right over your head
0:15:22 another one comes up from behind
0:15:25 and they have four successes to stab you
0:15:27 in the back with a knife
0:15:30 so i guess i'm just soaking here right
0:15:32 right you're gonna roll your stamina
0:15:34 plus
0:15:35 uh one die for your jacket yep unless i
0:15:38 want to use my other slave reaction to
0:15:40 try and dodge that right yes you can
0:15:42 abort your celery action to dodge yeah
0:15:44 i'll give that a shot
0:15:46 i figure i'm going at the top of the rim
0:15:48 they might be can i see whether these
0:15:49 guys are also moving the celerity i mean
0:15:50 everyone's moving a little quick yeah
0:15:52 these guys don't have extractions but
0:15:55 it's not just the two that are swinging
0:15:56 you are full on getting jumped by some
0:16:00 of shaw's guys
0:16:01 how many more guys do i think are coming
0:16:03 at me including joey it's one versus six
0:16:12 uh so that's gonna be athletics yep well
0:16:14 i am swift so hopefully that'll uh
0:16:17 so only three successes to dodge that
0:16:20 all right give me a silk roll yep
0:16:24 oh nothing okay uh the knife is dealing
0:16:27 five levels of lethal damage
0:16:30 uh i need a self-control check yeah
0:16:33 you're bruh you're good at that right
0:16:35 i mean you're difficult to see a six
0:16:36 psych defeat
0:16:38 all right uh
0:16:39 [Applause]
0:16:42 diff8
0:16:43 yeah bruh
0:16:44 you got no successes okay
0:16:46 uh
0:16:48 you fly into a frenzy and
0:16:51 as that happens and the knife
0:16:54 kind of shives you right up into the
0:16:56 back that is when uh weathers and amaya
0:16:59 joined the fray so i'm gonna go ahead
0:17:01 and uh i'm actually gonna let you roll
0:17:03 for weather's attack sure that's a smart
0:17:06 idea yes
0:17:08 uh weather says a 14 dice pool and it's
0:17:11 dividing his actions for two gravel
0:17:12 checks so you're going to roll two sets
0:17:14 of seven dice
0:17:16 as he goes to snatch up two of the goons
0:17:19 okay
0:17:21 two successes on the first roll very
0:17:22 good and five successes on the second
0:17:25 roll boom all right so as you fly into a
0:17:27 rage
0:17:28 two of the Brujah that are kind of making
0:17:30 their way into the fight to get the drop
0:17:32 on you are grabbed by weathers
0:17:36 and casually manhandled being dragged
0:17:38 away from you the other is amaya who is
0:17:43 going to slip up behind one of the other
0:17:45 Brujah and she's going to utilize a dread
0:17:48 gaze
0:17:49 so the guy he kind of winds his fist
0:17:51 back and she kind of like turns him by
0:17:53 the elbow meets his eyes bears her fangs
0:17:56 and hisses
0:17:58 so why don't you give me a dread gaze
0:17:59 check for her how many dices i can roll
0:18:01 she has an eight dice full and will
0:18:03 spend a point a little power for an
0:18:04 automatic success
0:18:06 four successes uh five with the
0:18:08 willpower that dude is eliminated two
0:18:10 are grappled uh the two that he has
0:18:12 struggle in his grip and are just
0:18:15 hopelessly unable to get free yeah the
0:18:17 other Brujah that are loyal to shaw are
0:18:20 kind of hesitant to get involved as
0:18:25 some of their guys are already kind of
0:18:27 getting embarrassed
0:18:28 one of them uh the one that amaya deals
0:18:31 with is already on his way out yup so we
0:18:34 go to round two are you making any
0:18:36 expenditures for this round i am
0:18:38 spending two blood on uh celerity
0:18:41 actions and another blood on
0:18:45 yeah it's either going to be strong
0:18:46 yeah probably decks yeah so i'm acting
0:18:49 on a 17 still right you're acting on an
0:18:51 18. you raised your max that's right
0:18:54 amaya goes first uh maya calls out
0:18:56 johnny you can't get carried away this
0:18:58 is what they want shaw wins if you kill
0:19:00 a vampire give me a self-control defeat
0:19:02 she tries to talk you down
0:19:04 i will spend a point of willpower okay
0:19:07 good call
0:19:09 four successes
0:19:10 okay
0:19:11 all right
0:19:12 nothing buddy yes
0:19:14 and uh auto success well if amaya says
0:19:19 there is there is something about her
0:19:21 voice that cracks through that shell of
0:19:23 yours and
0:19:25 for a moment you you calm down and you
0:19:28 remember what you came here to do and
0:19:30 joey
0:19:31 wiggles and writhes trying to get out
0:19:33 from under your grip
0:19:35 but for the moment turn is yours and you
0:19:37 can decide what you want to do try and
0:19:39 land on your feet
0:19:40 yeah give me uh give me a strength of
0:19:43 buttocks sure what is the likelihood of
0:19:44 a vampire dying from babies
0:19:49 to
0:19:50 throw a man bodily uh it's actually
0:19:52 athletics okay it's like throwing a
0:19:54 baseball but bigger big exclusion
0:19:58 it's a douche toss thankfully powerful
0:20:00 arms will probably help with this
0:20:02 all right so that's gonna be
0:20:04 seven successes
0:20:06 okay yeah you
0:20:08 casually toss them off the roof i was
0:20:10 like oh [ __ ]
0:20:11 and you hear this crunch noise down
0:20:14 below and the sounds of a car alarm uh
0:20:18 beeping and making noise oh i really
0:20:20 hope that was miles's car
0:20:23 why do you hate my car because it
0:20:26 irritates you and it's funny
0:20:28 i turned back and also fortitude don't
0:20:31 they
0:20:32 amaya looks to you no johnny
0:20:35 they don't um anyone else want to debate
0:20:38 johnny on this one
0:20:40 and uh she looks to the the crowd of
0:20:43 shaw loyalists and uh they kind of
0:20:46 quietly back off and let you have the
0:20:48 floor here's the dude that had the knife
0:20:50 uh he is being shaken by weathers
0:20:55 you actually see like the knife clatter
0:20:56 to the ground as as shaw shakes him
0:20:59 mm-hmm or his weather shakespeare
0:21:01 yes sorry weather shakes them the shaw
0:21:03 shaking will come later show shape
0:21:05 redemption yep the shawshake redemption
0:21:08 johnny gives him a death stare and kind
0:21:11 of just
0:21:12 rolls his shoulders a little bit wincing
0:21:14 at the uh at the knife wound in his back
0:21:17 i lost my train of thought
0:21:19 so anybody else uh
0:21:21 want to declare for shaw or we still got
0:21:23 Brujah here left on the roof gives
0:21:26 everybody a look around it's a little
0:21:28 quiet what i think we got to do is we
0:21:30 had to figure out how we keep Brujah safe
0:21:33 in this city because we got too many
0:21:35 cowards points over to these guys that
0:21:38 just just fought with him declaring for
0:21:40 nos selling out Brujah
0:21:42 selling out secrets of Brujah and if
0:21:45 that's what we're dealing with we can't
0:21:46 figure out the best way to move forward
0:21:49 when we have
0:21:50 those in power telling us we need to
0:21:52 provide soldiers for their private
0:21:54 armies to deal with sabbat because i
0:21:56 don't have the answer to that but we
0:21:57 need to as a clan figure out what we're
0:22:00 gonna do
0:22:01 i'm isf sword johnny's totally right and
0:22:04 i'm gonna be honest with you the
0:22:06 sabbat's coming for the camera though
0:22:08 your prince is selling you to pendragon
0:22:11 you take a praxis now shaw ends up in
0:22:13 power this is a no-win situation
0:22:17 you don't have to you don't have to
0:22:19 leave the camera i know some of you are
0:22:22 weird die-hards
0:22:24 but you can lay low out of town
0:22:27 and i've got space
0:22:29 let Rowlands deal with his own problem
0:22:31 himself
0:22:32 johnny gives a look over to weathers to
0:22:34 see what his reaction to that is
0:22:36 weathers gives this look like his eyes
0:22:40 meet yours for a second like like you
0:22:42 might as if you were the only person on
0:22:44 the roof that kind of got it but
0:22:46 it's pretty clear at least that he's
0:22:48 made up his mind
0:22:50 that if the broad decide to go
0:22:52 he's staying
0:22:53 he very clearly acknowledges that
0:22:56 amaya's got a point that anyone who
0:22:58 stays is getting used as cannon fodder
0:23:00 and amaya kind of like gives him an
0:23:02 apologetic look it's just kind of it's
0:23:04 kind of like the idealists
0:23:06 are having this moment where you guys
0:23:10 see each other you don't necessarily
0:23:12 agree with each other but you see each
0:23:14 other
0:23:16 you know
0:23:16 the sabbat in town isn't going to be
0:23:18 good to the anarchs either they may be
0:23:20 coming for the camarilla but they're not
0:23:22 going to let you just live in the area
0:23:24 yeah tell that to l.a spot burns itself
0:23:28 out all we have to do is back off when
0:23:29 we i don't think this is anything like
0:23:31 los angeles
0:23:33 anywhere can be like a los angeles you
0:23:35 just need to have the vision for it
0:23:38 do you have any idea what's coming up
0:23:39 the east coast
0:23:41 i've heard some of the stories
0:23:42 a lot of the guys that i have
0:23:44 they run town to town they do shipping
0:23:47 coyotes they heard about what's going on
0:23:50 but
0:23:51 it
0:23:52 can be something we can't dodge they're
0:23:54 coming for somebody else
0:23:56 let them fight
0:23:57 none of these people are our friends
0:23:59 both of them both of them would use the
0:24:02 Brujah as dogs on leashes
0:24:05 we lose nothing if they take each other
0:24:07 out
0:24:08 yeah well i got a lot of friends in the
0:24:09 city tell them get the hell out
0:24:11 this place is going down
0:24:14 well i'm not giving soldiers to 
0:24:16 pendragon i don't think i'm running what
0:24:18 are the antlers going to do if the
0:24:19 remaining Brujah in the city do ask for a
0:24:21 call to arms a cold arms is called arms
0:24:24 but don't drag us into the fire because
0:24:27 you're stubborn
0:24:28 we're people too and you don't like it
0:24:30 when pendragon does it to you
0:24:32 the mood of the rant kind of
0:24:35 dies
0:24:36 on the clan really kind of realizes it
0:24:39 so weathers comes forward he's like all
0:24:40 right look
0:24:42 we all know what's going on
0:24:44 it's time for a vote our options amaya
0:24:48 has presented
0:24:49 uh we
0:24:51 we we go we lay low for a while we leave
0:24:54 town
0:24:55 johnny's presented
0:24:57 i want to make sure we're clear on this
0:24:58 chinese where you're presenting you're
0:24:59 presenting that that we stay and fight
0:25:02 but we don't acquiesce to the requests
0:25:04 of Rowlands that's right
0:25:07 all right
0:25:08 and then he'll kind of like looks over
0:25:09 the ledge
0:25:11 joe what the hell is yours
0:25:12 i can't hear you he comes back joey says
0:25:15 something
0:25:17 and like a couple of them like snicker
0:25:20 like even his own friends kind of laugh
0:25:22 at joey a little i'd also like to put it
0:25:24 forth
0:25:25 that we purge any nosferatu sympathizers
0:25:28 in the clan but that might just be my
0:25:30 own personal crusade and
0:25:32 he kind of gives a hard look at like all
0:25:34 the remaining guys that he knows are are
0:25:37 actually an osuraki sympathizers
0:25:40 so
0:25:41 one of joey's
0:25:43 like supporters kind of like all right
0:25:46 what joey wants is simple guys
0:25:49 we just do what the prince asks
0:25:51 and if i pissed off about it later
0:25:52 there's more bruh to be mad a bigger
0:25:55 call to arms and the guy kind of like
0:25:57 looks at you and is like
0:25:59 i mean it makes sense right
0:26:00 if upton's doing this we would need the
0:26:02 numbers to take him out anyways
0:26:04 though the Brujah you're making aren't
0:26:06 going to be loyal to a clan
0:26:08 they're and i can be loyal to anybody
0:26:10 other than Rowlands
0:26:12 shaw and Pendragon and i can guarantee
0:26:15 you that none of those three give any
0:26:17 [ __ ] about you or any boot-looking kids
0:26:20 you make
0:26:21 but what if we don't turn those children
0:26:23 over right away
0:26:25 what if instead
0:26:27 we hold on to them since the fighting's
0:26:29 going to happen here eventually
0:26:32 we take control that is an incredibly
0:26:34 stupid idea
0:26:36 we're the only ones that we know will
0:26:38 take care of us
0:26:40 if you think
0:26:41 it's a good idea for us to just to fall
0:26:44 into small little separate bands
0:26:47 and just start making shovelheads we
0:26:49 should probably just put you down right
0:26:50 now johnny
0:26:52 you got to stop threatening everyone
0:26:54 that doesn't agree with you it's been
0:26:55 working out pretty well so far
0:26:57 really because isn't that what shaw does
0:27:00 i guess it works out for him
0:27:02 johnny's jaw tightens
0:27:04 he definitely leans back
0:27:06 the words kind of have struck home and
0:27:08 he realizes where he's at right now
0:27:12 i'm sorry
0:27:14 it's cool
0:27:15 but we can't do that i got embraced
0:27:18 as a sabbat shovelhead i escaped the
0:27:21 sabbat barely
0:27:24 i've seen what they do firsthand
0:27:27 they tried to bring me into that life
0:27:29 and mass embracing kids like this no
0:27:31 matter how much you think it's a good
0:27:33 idea
0:27:34 that's the first step to going down a
0:27:37 really dark path
0:27:39 one of the bra
0:27:40 despite the weight of your words
0:27:43 snickers to his friend is like ah
0:27:45 johnny's got brute blood
0:27:47 johnny bites his lip real hard weathers
0:27:50 into checks before this gets out of
0:27:52 control again all right so you're saying
0:27:54 that we we go through with Rowlands
0:27:57 recommendation but we hold on to the bra
0:27:59 all right [ __ ] it
0:28:00 let's put it to vote
0:28:02 it is at this point johnny that i need a
0:28:05 charisma plus leadership rule cozmo plus
0:28:07 leadership yes all right
0:28:13 you're feeling the same right right now
0:28:14 that i do every time they make a [ __ ]
0:28:15 perception check yes like where does it
0:28:17 be
0:28:18 uh does spending for awe help me on this
0:28:21 no no okay
0:28:24 difficulty eight

0:28:28 willpower including the willpower
0:28:32 the baron can i just say while we're
0:28:34 rolling that i unabashedly
0:28:36 love amaya and she's my new favorite
0:28:38 character
0:28:39 oh she's fantastic she's incredible
0:28:42 amaya has four successes
0:28:44 the other guy
0:28:45 who's not joey who's not joey
0:28:48 just doesn't have a lot just some
0:28:50 gutters
0:28:51 doesn't really stand out in terms of
0:28:52 appearance
0:28:53 oh [ __ ] off
0:28:56 one two three four five and he has a
0:28:59 minor difficulty six
0:29:03 quietly start casting their votes
0:29:05 pretty quickly it looks like these
0:29:08 brouha are deciding that they want to go
0:29:11 ahead let the mass embrace and overtake
0:29:13 the city themselves
0:29:16 why there's leans into you during the
0:29:17 vote

0:32:41 snatch
0:32:42 your little
0:32:43 head clean off his shoulders
0:32:48 do you have a flaw on your sheet about
0:32:49 being terrible to cars

0:33:21 passes you one kind of like firmly
0:33:23 shoves it up against you take that go
0:33:26 all right
0:33:27 he takes his bag and then kind of walks
0:33:29 away
0:33:36 miles we pick up with you
0:33:39 at your haven uh you've got some of
0:33:41 those crates out in front of you i know
0:33:43 you've been pondering
0:33:45 whether or not you want to make use for
0:33:46 them for uh some of your plans that
0:33:48 you've got going on you know one of them
0:33:50 has those assault rifles that were
0:33:52 checked but there's two others that
0:33:55 remain a bit of a mystery i was told
0:33:57 that i could
0:33:59 request whatever i needed for the
0:34:00 zantosa thing and this seems like an
0:34:02 opportunity i i consider that a
0:34:04 perfectly valid justification yeah
0:34:08 however as you're kind of sitting by
0:34:11 relaxing and getting ready to to observe
0:34:14 your stash your servant approaches you
0:34:17 uh he's got a little bit of a foreign
0:34:18 expression you kind of quickly get the
0:34:20 sense that he may have thought that
0:34:23 your unfortunate circumstances that you
0:34:26 recently underwent and how well he
0:34:28 handled things for you then may have led
0:34:31 to him having expectations and
0:34:34 instead of those expectations being met
0:34:36 he approaches you with your phone
0:34:39 miles i you have received a phone call
0:34:41 from uh
0:34:43 a mr johnny saxon thank you marcos
0:34:47 sets the phone down takes a few steps
0:34:50 back and just kind of waits
0:34:53 on the other hand side of the phone you
0:34:55 can kind of already hear like some
0:34:57 some sound hello
0:34:59 you hear the uh clack of a zippo
0:35:02 shutting and a drag on a cigarette
0:35:04 before johnny's voice cuts in
0:35:07 miles uh
0:35:08 everything all right i think for the
0:35:10 most part yeah so far we just i just got
0:35:12 back from the ranch
0:35:14 things are not looking too good in the
0:35:16 domain right now that is not
0:35:19 good news no
0:35:21 how bad are we looking at well i'm not
0:35:24 sure if
0:35:26 we're looking at a full-blown defection
0:35:28 but most of the Brujah are either going
0:35:30 to be leaving with the anarchs
0:35:33 or
0:35:34 probably throwing their lot in with shaw
0:35:36 might even be looking at a like actual
0:35:39 praxis at some point i mean i saw the
0:35:42 shaw thing coming but it seems a little
0:35:43 fast we'll see what happens well i think
0:35:46 that i kind of played into his plans
0:35:48 because
0:35:49 we were all worked up about being told
0:35:51 to to make children
0:35:54 i think that actually is exactly what he
0:35:56 wanted
0:35:57 most of the most of the clan is on the
0:35:59 side and i mean most right now i think
0:36:02 that the Brujah in the city that are
0:36:04 still
0:36:04 loyal to the domain are weathers and
0:36:08 i mean i'm loyal to weather so weather
0:36:10 isn't me
0:36:12 jane
0:36:14 i don't know what she's pulling maybe
0:36:15 maybe she's doing some kind of
0:36:16 undercover thing for weathers but she
0:36:18 right now it looks like she might be
0:36:20 throwing her lot in with uh
0:36:22 shaw no keep that close to the chest for
0:36:24 now we're not sure where that's going to
0:36:25 play
0:36:27 but
0:36:28 i did make mention of this in a way
0:36:30 before you left or before when we last
0:36:32 talked about it yeah
0:36:34 it's better to be in a place of position
0:36:36 to do something than to be known
0:36:39 obstructionist yeah now
0:36:42 well this is where we're at now
0:36:45 probably i should probably should have
0:36:46 listened to you more before while i got
0:36:47 you you gotta you got a pen and paper
0:36:49 yes yeah let me uh
0:36:51 you hear him fumbling in the side of the
0:36:53 phone here's my uh i got a new beeper
0:36:56 from uh from weather so he gave me kind
0:36:57 of a bug out bag this one ought to be
0:36:59 good and i'm not i'm not letting it go
0:37:02 any further than than you and weathers a
0:37:04 little early but i was asking gonna call
0:37:06 you pretty soon so that works out pretty
0:37:08 good well this would be the way to do it
0:37:10 why don't you he he gives you the beeper
0:37:11 number
0:37:12 let's head over this way we're going to
0:37:13 get up sam bush isn't going to be too

0:39:24 over to the pay phones and it looks like
0:39:25 one of them
0:39:26 is like
0:39:27 maybe out of service like they've taken
0:39:29 the phone and the cord off of it and it
0:39:31 looks like they're kind of cutting down
0:39:33 on the number of active pay phones
0:39:35 seeing use she goes to the one active
0:39:37 pay phone one eight hundred c a l l att
0:39:40 uh miles number miles your phone rings

0:40:04 miles that's a disappointment i can't
0:40:07 imagine it's a surprise though are we
0:40:10 done here
0:40:10 [Laughter]
0:40:13 i will see you when you get here goodbye
0:40:15 bye miles thank you for caring i don't
0:40:17 know
0:40:18 when hangs up the phone
0:40:20 feeling just a little bit guilty
0:40:27 let's see hang up back at the elysium
0:40:29 it is
0:40:31 very crowded uh take a look inside there
0:40:33 seems to be a bit more of the art that
0:40:35 had been placed on display by the torio
0:40:37 before you can see elsa linden kind of
0:40:41 gathering this flock of socialites and
0:40:44 even you get the impression that this
0:40:47 isn't happening for no reason she's
0:40:49 having a whole lot of secret meetings
0:40:52 right out in front of everyone and it's
0:40:54 coming in the form of various minions
0:40:57 approaching her giving encrypted
0:41:00 kind of secretive compliments gestures
0:41:03 and there's this whole language that's
0:41:05 being spoken amongst them that you do
0:41:07 not understand okay but it's brexit
0:41:10 socialite nine beyond that that foyer
0:41:12 space that she's kind of seized control
0:41:14 of uh when you take a look upstairs you
0:41:16 can actually very clearly see the
0:41:19 and prince walking side by side the
0:41:21 prince has this disgusted scowl that
0:41:25 he's wearing as as he looks over at elsa
0:41:28 and he's kind of regarding her as she's
0:41:30 some like great threat to his praxis
0:41:33 and that they're on the way to this
0:41:35 confrontation with each other
0:41:37 and is not paying attention to the fact
0:41:39 that way down the hall that you can kind
0:41:41 of see
0:41:42 from from the uh the position you're
0:41:44 standing at looking in through the
0:41:45 window there is a lot of Brujah that are
0:41:48 kind of flocking to shaw who yet again
0:41:53 does not see any reason to conceal his
0:41:55 true visage and this kind of like
0:41:57 charred monstrous nosferatu is kind of
0:42:01 demonstrating that he is some sort of
0:42:04 peer to the infamous elsa linden i am
0:42:08 kind of taking note of this
0:42:10 this all of these interactions occurring
0:42:12 in a language i am not super fluent in
0:42:15 but i am not really looking at who is
0:42:18 here
0:42:18 in this plane i am here to look for joey
0:42:22 you don't see any signs of joey however
0:42:26 while they kind of like
0:42:28 walk along the two the prince and the
0:42:29 Seneschal they get so close you can
0:42:31 kind of hear their like steps on like
0:42:33 the marble floor
0:42:35 once they get that close you notice that
0:42:37 some of the things that the Seneschal
0:42:40 mr john Reiss is wearing kind of takes
0:42:42 on this kind of a wispy
0:42:44 glow and it's this shine that no one
0:42:46 else in the area seems to kind of notice
0:42:48 they don't nothing about him really
0:42:49 stands out to anyone he's kind of like a
0:42:51 like a hawkish unattractive man
0:42:54 but in the shadowlands there's this like
0:42:57 windy realm of the dead the items that
0:43:00 he is carrying have clear power to for a
0:43:03 moment he kind of gives you side eye as
0:43:06 if he he actually notices that you
0:43:08 notice and there's this
0:43:10 millisecond exchange between the two of
0:43:12 you where you become very um confident
0:43:15 that he knows exactly why you're here
0:43:17 other than Rowlands completely oblivious
0:43:19 to that
0:43:20 continues scowling at elsa and elsa kind
0:43:23 of gives to him this just this stunning
0:43:25 uh winning smile i couldn't think
0:43:28 possibly scheming against you
0:43:30 right like
0:43:31 it's almost as if she is saying like in
0:43:32 like one quick cute half smirk is like
0:43:35 you're welcome for me being here
0:43:37 you know what i mean like i am i am here
0:43:39 and therefore you have a true elysium
0:43:41 nice wind walks in the door and she just
0:43:44 kind of takes a minute because this is
0:43:46 not this is not her forte and everyone
0:43:49 in here knows that mrs john ruiz stops
0:43:52 if you'll excuse me your grace and there
0:43:55 is um a conversation that i need to have
0:43:58 and often kind of like hofs and the last
0:44:01 bit of his entourage walks away leaving
0:44:04 upton kind of standing alone while his
0:44:07 rivals are surrounded by like
0:44:10 vassals and
0:44:12 Reiss
0:44:13 makes his way to you and in his hand he
0:44:17 kind of has this like
0:44:18 there's this there's a stereotype
0:44:20 amongst the trimmer that every single
0:44:21 one of them has a cane and none of them
0:44:23 have a limp he is walking to you and
0:44:25 absolutely has a cane in his hand
0:44:27 and right around where his hand like
0:44:30 rests while he is holding it uh you can
0:44:32 see this like again like always speed
0:44:34 glow that comes from it now that you're
0:44:36 closer to it you can see that it's like
0:44:39 that soul stuff that the dead are made
0:44:41 from in the underworld whatever it is
0:44:42 that he's wearing these little pieces of
0:44:44 jewelry they are kind of charged with a
0:44:47 wraithly presence as if he may have been
0:44:50 like minding spirits to him what is your
0:44:52 name again bronwyn cabot you can call me
0:44:55 wynn
0:44:56 thank you miss copy please come with me
0:44:58 he kind of actually walks back in the
0:45:00 direction of
0:45:02 the pay phone it's as if he like wants
0:45:04 to talk to you about something but he
0:45:05 doesn't want to be seen talking to you
0:45:07 oh i know the line and now that it's
0:45:08 secret but it's more like embarrassing
0:45:10 because you're like this like filthy
0:45:11 gangrel monster
0:45:12 no i know he's afraid i'm going to pee
0:45:14 on him in public
0:45:15 yeah
0:45:16 he definitely thinks you're going gonna
0:45:17 pee somewhere yeah
0:45:18 as you get out uh past the glass doors
0:45:20 he
0:45:21 turns and
0:45:23 lights up a cigarette and he's got like
0:45:25 one of those kind of like
0:45:27 cheesy zippos or like an arcane symbol
0:45:30 on the side of it what does the arcane
0:45:32 symbol say uh well and when you look at
0:45:34 it it looks like it's uh kind of like a
0:45:37 like uh like a hermetic seal but is it
0:45:40 actually real or is it does it say like
0:45:42 chinese food here's the thing it is it
0:45:44 is actually a real hermetic uh steel in
0:45:46 fact when he like lights the cigarette
0:45:49 you can feel the presence of some unseen
0:45:53 like force coming from the lighter
0:45:54 itself that kind of gives you pause and
0:45:57 makes you suddenly afraid to touch his
0:45:59 lighter it's like this very subtle show
0:46:01 of force as he lights the cigarette
0:46:03 takes a drag and exhales smoke onto you
0:46:06 i have something you want you do
0:46:09 unfortunately for you you remain a
0:46:11 member of the camry and therefore i will
0:46:13 hear what you have to say but that's
0:46:15 only because you have something i want
0:46:18 oh were you done
0:46:20 i might be
0:46:21 the little boy joey you want him
0:46:24 yeah
0:46:25 why because i made him a promise that i
0:46:27 would take him home to see his mom
0:46:28 before he left and that promise is very
0:46:30 important to you
0:46:32 it's important to him how important to
0:46:34 him is it i'm not gonna wave exactly how
0:46:37 important things are because if my dad
0:46:39 taught me one thing you don't talk money
0:46:41 before the other person does very well
0:46:43 let's talk money
0:46:45 as i understand it you've been
0:46:47 selected as one of the members of uh a
0:46:50 strike force headed to deal with mr
0:46:52 zantosa is that correct
0:46:55 yes i see it's very important to the
0:46:58 court that mr santos had been
0:47:00 dealt with and prevented from his
0:47:03 creations uh
0:47:05 being allowed to run amok through the
0:47:07 city naturally
0:47:09 but i don't think that his grace
0:47:12 will be deeply offended if mr santosa
0:47:14 disappears
0:47:16 rather than being confirmed dead
0:47:19 i want mr zantosa
0:47:22 alive you give him to me
0:47:25 and i'll give you the boy
0:47:27 no deal
0:47:28 boy first
0:47:30 you don't know how this works that's not
0:47:31 going to happen what will happen is the
0:47:33 transaction will be logged by the harpy
0:47:35 and so
0:47:37 my respect for the rules of prestation
0:47:39 and the will of the camarilla will
0:47:41 ensure that you get your boy
0:47:43 he takes off his glasses you've already
0:47:45 walked off alone with me
0:47:47 i can make you get me that zentosa
0:47:52 if you make me
0:47:54 get you the zantosa
0:47:55 you're operating on the assumption that
0:47:58 the rest of my Coterie will allow that to
0:48:00 happen i'm operating on the assumption
0:48:02 that your quartery is close to you and
0:48:05 that what you ask
0:48:07 they will hear and consider
0:48:09 and if you demonstrate a show of force
0:48:11 they will stay their hand
0:48:13 because of their affection to you
0:48:15 you don't know my coterie very well
0:48:17 don't be ridiculous
0:48:19 all quarteries operate that way
0:48:22 you are not tremeer
0:48:24 you will care for one another
0:48:26 you will take risks to keep one another
0:48:28 safe
0:48:29 you will make poor decisions
0:48:31 in hopes that the group of you stay
0:48:33 together forever i will make poor
0:48:36 decisions
0:48:37 that affect me
0:48:39 i will not make poor decisions that will
0:48:41 affect my coterie and the fact is we
0:48:43 have already been charged with ensuring
0:48:44 that this guy dies
0:48:46 and now you've been charged with
0:48:47 ensuring that he lives
0:48:49 all you have to do is keep it secret and
0:48:51 i have no doubt that they would keep
0:48:52 this secret for you
0:48:54 you haven't met me i can't keep things
0:48:57 secret
0:48:58 miles can trust him
0:49:00 and he'll get you your boy this is not a
0:49:02 deal i'm willing to make i will find
0:49:04 another way to get the boy
0:49:05 the boy is not going to last for very
0:49:07 long
0:49:08 as you know he is
0:49:11 he is not
0:49:12 he's not incredibly useful aside from
0:49:15 the spirit stuff that makes him to you
0:49:18 is
0:49:19 a child who has underwent a traumatic
0:49:23 experience and
0:49:24 has been prevented from being able to
0:49:26 move on because of this to me he is he
0:49:29 is fuel and sooner or later i'm going to
0:49:32 have
0:49:33 need of fuel and considering how
0:49:35 tumultuous these nights have been
0:49:37 i promise you that the moment i need
0:49:40 fuel
0:49:41 you will be the fuel i use and then he
0:49:43 disappears into oblivion eventually the
0:49:46 process is much slower
0:49:48 you see first
0:49:49 you have to understand that this the
0:49:51 world of the dead is don't condescend to
0:49:53 me mr Reiss
0:49:56 you've come to the wrong conversation if
0:49:57 you hope i may not be condescended
0:49:59 i know what your clan is for the spirit
0:50:02 world is made up of wrath of material
0:50:05 all things
0:50:06 every coin every object
0:50:09 is forged from a soul
0:50:12 and i might need an ashtray
0:50:15 so yes he will eventually be dragged to
0:50:18 oblivion and
0:50:19 cease to be altogether consumed
0:50:22 by by that infinite corrupted force but
0:50:26 first
0:50:27 he will scream for a long a long time
0:50:31 get me the zentosa
0:50:33 he turns
0:50:34 and he heads it get bent Reiss
0:50:38 and win as she was listening tears of
0:50:41 blood start coming down her face but she
0:50:43 does not actively weep
0:50:46 fully understanding what she is
0:50:48 condemning this little boy to do
0:50:50 okay
