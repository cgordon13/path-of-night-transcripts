0:00:05 path of night is an actual play vampire
0:00:07 the masquerade podcast set in the
0:00:08 classic world of darkness we're all
0:00:10 friends we're here to have fun but our
0:00:12 story can include graphic violence drug
0:00:14 use sexual content and other mature
0:00:16 themes we've talked at our table about
0:00:18 safety comfort and consent both as
0:00:19 players and storytellers we know what to
0:00:21 expect we're all excited to be here and
0:00:23 we want you to feel the same
0:00:25 so listener discretion is advised now
0:00:27 let's walk the path of night
0:00:30 last time on path of night brita neil
0:00:32 and nguyen waited weeks forReiss to
0:00:34 rouse their quarter-inmates from torpor
0:00:36 only for the ceneshall to show up with
0:00:38 sheriff weathers prince rollins and
0:00:40 miles the sire archon john peterson
0:00:42Reiss woke miles and johnny but not
0:00:44 without blood bonding the bruja in the
0:00:46 process to johnny's horror weather's
0:00:48 told him that the prince has given every
0:00:50 bruja in the city the right of progeny
0:00:52 and is requiring each of them to embrace
0:00:54 two new kindred as foot soldiers for an
0:00:56 impending war with the sabbath bringing
0:00:58 up traumatic memories for the furious
0:01:00 bully boy miles was ordered to hold new
0:01:03 haven and keep prince rollins in power
0:01:05 against the incoming storm of sabbat
0:01:07 invaders after a few nights the quarter
0:01:09 meets in a bar to discuss with miles
0:01:11 what comes next
0:01:14 miles
0:01:15 we pick up with you gathering the
0:01:16 quarterly together to meet at the royal
0:01:19 which is located right over on crown
0:01:21 street it looks like there's already a
0:01:24 throng of mortals that are kind of
0:01:25 gathered around and everyone's having a
0:01:28 good time listening to music the energy
0:01:30 is fantastic it's exactly what you hoped
0:01:33 for and just as you intended a space has
0:01:36 been set aside for you to have a quieter
0:01:38 conversation with the group when at a
0:01:40 time each of you files through you kind
0:01:41 of have to turn your shoulders to the
0:01:43 side and brush past some of the big
0:01:45 hulking fellas who are talking to women
0:01:47 and you know that classic energy
0:01:50 waiting for you guys in that back corner
0:01:52 of this bar is miles arms stretched and
0:01:56 relaxed in a seat and one at a time you
0:01:59 make your way over and have a seat
0:02:02 johnny
0:02:03 sits down
0:02:04 pulls out a pack of cigarettes
0:02:06 tosses one in his in his mouth
0:02:09 lights up
0:02:10 so what's the deal
0:02:12 when
0:02:13 walks in uh she has a hood pulled over
0:02:15 her head it's definitely occluding her
0:02:18 face a bit but no one seems to be
0:02:20 stopping her about it she just kind of
0:02:21 charges forward yeah the lighting's just
0:02:23 right so you can kind of give your head
0:02:25 some and don't have to worry about it
0:02:27 neil is sort of behind when just
0:02:30 following in her wake so he doesn't have
0:02:32 to try and push through the cloud as she
0:02:34 just shoulders people out of the way
0:02:36 yeah she's definitely got just enough
0:02:37 menace to wear
0:02:39 she parts that crowd some it takes brett
0:02:41 a bit longer to get through the crowd
0:02:43 with uh all the college-age people and
0:02:45 the attention she has a lot of attention
0:02:47 she follows in that wake as best you can
0:02:50 but she's the last get to the table and
0:02:51 there's miles just lounging waiting for
0:02:55 everyone to finally arrive how's it been
0:02:58 johnny doesn't look so hot he's got a
0:03:00 little bit of a hungry look in his eyes
0:03:03 and
0:03:04 it seems as though he's probably just
0:03:06 been forgetting to change out his
0:03:09 clothes he just looks a little bit
0:03:11 rumpled a couple of blood stains on his
0:03:13 shirt um he's been having a rough past
0:03:16 couple of nights he grunts i see exxon
0:03:19 as usual i was not able to find anything
0:03:22 about the thing we discussed the other
0:03:23 night it seems to be
0:03:24 coming up dead ends what were we talking
0:03:26 about the other night you asked me to
0:03:27 look into
0:03:29 your beeper oh yeah what is this did you
0:03:32 call kabir i could not reach him johnny
0:03:34 frowns wynn kind of leans into the table
0:03:37 and puts her elbows on the table you can
0:03:39 kind of see her mouth but she seems to
0:03:41 be purposely keeping it pulled over her
0:03:43 hood pulled over her eyes
0:03:45 we're we're probably going to need to
0:03:47 talk about some changes that have
0:03:48 happened let's talk so i don't know if
0:03:52 anyone has told you this but when a
0:03:54 Gangrel frenzies part of our beast kind
0:03:56 of marks us and it stays with us forever
0:03:59 how does your piece mark you usually it
0:04:02 takes the form of things we've been
0:04:03 fighting in animal
0:04:06 nature
0:04:07 johnny miles when you guys went down in
0:04:09 the fight i lost my [ __ ] and i lost my
0:04:12 [ __ ] hard it's unfortunate
0:04:14 um and she kind of makes sure that her
0:04:16 back is to the the crowd and she kind of
0:04:19 pulls back her hood enough to reveal
0:04:21 that the sides of her head where she
0:04:22 doesn't have any hair as well as like
0:04:24 her forehead from the bridge of her nose
0:04:26 back are marked with cobra scales whoa
0:04:30 and that's that's forever guys yeah i
0:04:32 mean
0:04:33 what you sort of i mean brynn and i kind
0:04:36 of knew although seeing in this light is
0:04:38 a little different but i also i'm not i
0:04:42 have to practice feeding now because i
0:04:44 have
0:04:45 venom what and she will extend her fangs
0:04:49 i would have thought that would be
0:04:50 something that like an ability you were
0:04:51 using but my god
0:04:54 look at that she kind of discreetly puts
0:04:56 her hands up
0:04:58 so casual onlookers can't see when you
0:05:00 guys take a look at it it's not like the
0:05:02 fangs of a vampire they
0:05:05 hook
0:05:06 and with her mouth open wide enough you
0:05:08 can actually see the glands and muscle
0:05:10 tissue that's all up inside the roof of
0:05:13 her mouth it's it's it's a different
0:05:15 mouth
0:05:16 so i haven't been feeding well because i
0:05:19 haven't had the balls to try and feed on
0:05:21 a human yet oh um i can't blame you i
0:05:25 don't have great control over the venom
0:05:27 yet what does it what does it do
0:05:29 it seems to be some kind of necrotic
0:05:32 effect what like it
0:05:34 turns them into a zombie no
0:05:36 like it um causes the tissue to die
0:05:39 areas turn black it's not it's not been
0:05:42 good for the things i've tried biting
0:05:45 and it's like forever forever forever
0:05:47 forever the things you try biting do
0:05:49 they still uh relax and
0:05:51 at least let you yeah
0:05:53 all right well
0:05:55 that's an upside yeah well we shouldn't
0:05:58 you shouldn't be fighting people then i
0:06:00 mean does that go away i have to she's
0:06:03 gotta i'm sure you'll get control of it
0:06:05 soon i mean you can feed on animals but
0:06:08 it's not the same it won't be enough i
0:06:11 would have to go through an awful lot of
0:06:13 animals in order to get enough then
0:06:15 we'll have to stay behind you until you
0:06:17 figure out how to get this right yes i
0:06:20 mean it will be an adjustment but we can
0:06:22 help you in any way possible at this
0:06:24 point hoodies hmm
0:06:26 i mean
0:06:27 it looks kind of badass definitely doing
0:06:29 it better than the
0:06:31 the zedites we keep facing they seem to
0:06:32 like the cue ball look
0:06:35 you know i know a couple of biker bars
0:06:37 we could probably go hunting at if you
0:06:38 want probably find some jackass named
0:06:40 snake who likes it
0:06:42 there's a lot of people you know what
0:06:43 they're saying
0:06:44 stuff so well i'd wait why is that a
0:06:48 theme here or that's just what dario
0:06:50 told me there's a lot of
0:06:52 guys who were bald with snake ta oh
0:06:55 what i should probably ask him about
0:06:56 that i don't want to be biting sedite
0:06:58 property but i mean well yeah also snake
0:07:00 is not an uncommon tattoo though fair i
0:07:03 think i'm sorry when i i thought it
0:07:06 would have been some discipline of yours
0:07:08 that did that but
0:07:10 well
0:07:11 miles is right you
0:07:12 you pull it off
0:07:14 next time johnny kind of reaches up and
0:07:16 just palms the top of wind's head so
0:07:18 that you can turn head to look to see
0:07:20 how far the scales go back you can lift
0:07:22 the braid too if you need to buddy man
0:07:24 it just keeps on going huh yeah i'm kind
0:07:26 of glad i don't have a hood like a
0:07:28 snakehood oh okay i was gonna say that
0:07:32 you do have that actually that is not
0:07:35 unfortunately something that's not out
0:07:36 of the cards old enough gangrel who have
0:07:38 poor enough control over themselves
0:07:40 they're they're more animal looking than
0:07:42 people looking is that why raven look
0:07:44 like she had like rhino hide or
0:07:46 something uh
0:07:47 probably part of it
0:07:49 i'm sorry it sucks to lose your good
0:07:51 looks but hey look on the bright side
0:07:53 you could've just been born ugly like me
0:07:55 i don't think either of us had luck that
0:07:57 bad johnny
0:07:59 um i do want to talk to you about
0:08:01 something though johnny when we get the
0:08:02 chance yeah no problem i've had a busy
0:08:04 few days catching up in the last couple
0:08:06 weeks and it looks like the settings are
0:08:07 on the move yeah yeah um johnny
0:08:10 instinctively shoots a look over his
0:08:11 shoulder looks like the coast is clear
0:08:15 when nonetheless puts her hood back up
0:08:17 the coterie can still see her face but
0:08:19 she is still taking masquerade friendly
0:08:21 precautions
0:08:22 so like i sort of said um i have an
0:08:25 in-road with the set heights uh
0:08:28 you remember when you ran over what i
0:08:30 guess when we ran over that one with a
0:08:32 car yeah ramirez did that yeah yeah yeah
0:08:35 um so i found him when you guys were
0:08:38 dealing with the sorcerer in the suv
0:08:41 took his phone kind of got inside his
0:08:43 head a little bit and uh told him to
0:08:44 call me
0:08:46 which is why a couple days ago he said
0:08:48 hey they're going to be moving soon
0:08:49 which is why i wanted to ask you guys
0:08:51 and then we you know it was a busy night
0:08:54 we kind of walked away from it but um
0:08:56 when do you want to set an ambush
0:08:58 because i think i could get him to get
0:09:01 them to the right place if we feed him
0:09:03 the information that says oh hey by the
0:09:05 way miles is going to be here talking to
0:09:08 brita about hunting or some thing you
0:09:10 know just feed a two perfect opportunity
0:09:13 i want to just to the energy i want to
0:09:14 run this back i mean i have to make sure
0:09:16 i have all of this clear
0:09:19 what way back when we were getting
0:09:21 attacked by asthmates in the streets
0:09:25 settites in the streets who would make
0:09:26 that mistake again uh
0:09:28 it's hard to tell what's with some of
0:09:29 these clans that aren't part of the
0:09:31 camera anyhow the point is
0:09:33 you're trying to tell me that when we
0:09:34 fought these settings you grabbed one of
0:09:37 them got in his head and you're only
0:09:39 telling us now
0:09:41 after
0:09:42 a couple of days that he's let you know
0:09:45 know that they might be gunning for us
0:09:47 again i mentioned it at the time and
0:09:49 then we sort of got distracted he did i
0:09:52 did go back and start working on it then
0:09:54 yeah when was this was the night we were
0:09:56 the other the other night when you guys
0:09:58 woke up and
0:09:59 my haven oh all right all right all
0:10:01 right my my apologies i couldn't
0:10:04 remember all the details about the
0:10:05 things that you were mumbling about when
0:10:07 i had just come out of torpor okay well
0:10:09 gotcha if you couldn't remember the
0:10:10 details why are you yelling at me about
0:10:12 it
0:10:13 yelling is his volume that's how he
0:10:14 shows love giant johnny's jaw tightens
0:10:16 he just kind of throws his hands up
0:10:19 sits back in his chair and just starts
0:10:20 puffing away in a cigarette i have been
0:10:22 working on the problem since neil
0:10:24 brought it to my attention i believe i
0:10:26 may have found something to set it up if
0:10:27 they feel like they can both humiliate
0:10:29 me and damage me at the same time it'll
0:10:31 probably be the opportunity they can't
0:10:33 miss so doing something for the archon
0:10:36 or something in regards to protecting
0:10:38 the prince after that thing they will
0:10:41 probably take that opportunity to hit me
0:10:43 and if i don't die at least embarrass me
0:10:45 well here's the here's the thing i mean
0:10:47 they've been coming at you with you know
0:10:48 tech nines and suvs what why
0:10:51 why do you think they just want to
0:10:52 embarrass you like do you have what do
0:10:54 you think what do you have that they
0:10:55 want besides just embarrass me but they
0:10:57 will it'll become more of a target
0:11:00 before these are targets of opportunity
0:11:01 if you want to set an ambush you need to
0:11:03 bait it better than just being an
0:11:05 opportunity draw them to you so okay add
0:11:08 on to it all right so you all right
0:11:10 you're clearly building up to a thing
0:11:12 right what is the thing i will probably
0:11:14 just let leak that we are about to do
0:11:17 something in specific to this archon i
0:11:19 haven't yet come up with a specific
0:11:20 detail yet but they know he's been in
0:11:23 and around town they know that i talk to
0:11:24 him and they want that information
0:11:26 if i were them i wouldn't
0:11:29 want to go up against an archon if well
0:11:31 he's on target right but he's already
0:11:33 left and they are aware of my
0:11:35 familiarity with him already and they're
0:11:37 targeting me i think what he's trying to
0:11:39 say is if he has to go pick up a suit
0:11:41 for the archon or something like that it
0:11:43 would look really bad if he showed up
0:11:45 with a few bullet holes in him or the
0:11:47 suit right yes so if we mess up a thing
0:11:50 that is proposed to us that is important
0:11:53 and possibly i die i don't it's really
0:11:56 up to them at this point but it's
0:11:58 baiting the mouse trap with both peanut
0:11:59 butter and cheese yeah they're not these
0:12:02 aren't it's not a delicious combination
0:12:03 for us but for mice believe me it works
0:12:05 spicy peanut butter yeah oh mice love
0:12:07 peanut butter i was just saying that
0:12:09 right now these attacks haven't been
0:12:10 very serious
0:12:12 there's something new every day you're
0:12:13 welcome the last time that we were in
0:12:15 the car they were just trying to kill
0:12:18 you i don't see where your dignity comes
0:12:21 into play
0:12:22 right that attack wasn't entirely too
0:12:24 serious and you can't die
0:12:26 just to be bait no no i mean rules and
0:12:29 one vampire yeah um this plan the way
0:12:32 that it's being proposed it's putting
0:12:34 you at danger and well yeah i understand
0:12:37 that that's necessary for kids
0:12:39 last time they jumped us yeah they shot
0:12:42 us with some guns these things happen i
0:12:44 mean you got to get used to having a few
0:12:47 holes poked in you with a couple of
0:12:49 bullets it's just going to be the way it
0:12:51 is counterpoint no you don't some of us
0:12:52 lead more exciting lives at night than
0:12:54 others bingo look i understand that we
0:12:56 can take a few bullets but
0:12:58 how many is too many that's what i'm
0:13:01 worried about i don't know yet i found
0:13:02 that number it's always the last one
0:13:04 that kills you yeah that's that's fact
0:13:06 you learn something new every day look
0:13:07 point point is i think this is probably
0:13:10 a great idea if the if the vet if the uh
0:13:12 the set tights want to take a hit at him
0:13:15 let's just get let's get ahead of this
0:13:17 they're gonna come out after him let's
0:13:19 get let's give them an opportunity where
0:13:20 he's vulnerable because honestly it is
0:13:23 hard to kill him but his pride and his
0:13:26 dignity are things that they can hurt
0:13:28 and that often hurts ventrue more than
0:13:30 anything else and on top of this we need
0:13:32 this to happen before we move on the
0:13:35 xantos yes what i'm going to throw out
0:13:37 there is that if we make this look like
0:13:39 too good of an opportunity though
0:13:41 they're going to say no they're trying
0:13:42 to bait us that's why whatever
0:13:44 that's why i'm going to leak it to a set
0:13:46 height cool so that the settings get
0:13:48 this information internally right okay
0:13:50 and i can't make it look like a tomb but
0:13:52 yes as i was saying can can we back it
0:13:54 up a couple of bullet points
0:13:56 okay i know that you hate when i
0:13:57 interested but i don't want it
0:14:00 but i don't want to get too far away
0:14:02 from it you said that they want
0:14:03 information about the oricon what are
0:14:05 you talking about they wanted
0:14:06 information in regards to the guns but
0:14:08 that's a venture thing we didn't what
0:14:10 okay what which guns the thing that i
0:14:13 needed to do that i picked up with
0:14:15 johnny you gotta mention at some point
0:14:16 why what is is it a big deal what no i
0:14:19 just what did the settings bring you the
0:14:21 guns technically they delivered the guns
0:14:23 okay but then why would they want to
0:14:25 know why the guns were there if they're
0:14:26 the ones who brought the guns
0:14:28 i don't know why is this going
0:14:31 they sold us guns but they don't know
0:14:33 why
0:14:34 yeah they sold the venture guns they
0:14:36 don't know why the venture were buying
0:14:37 them that's pretty much it why are the
0:14:38 venture buying really that's a great
0:14:39 question i feel like that should be
0:14:41 obvious at this point well make it
0:14:43 obvious in preparation for the thing
0:14:46 yeah did we ever really talk about that
0:14:49 yes that was the whole thing i talked
0:14:50 about before you informed me that the
0:14:51 sedex were going to attack me the next
0:14:53 couple days i don't know we mentioned
0:14:54 that after i woke up it's hard to get
0:14:56 details when that happens huh it is yeah
0:14:58 especially when you're busy with the
0:15:00 brew how being ordered to make more and
0:15:03 the gathering of the guns it's
0:15:05 all the same
0:15:07 these are upcoming future problems yeah
0:15:10 okay let's handle the ones directly in
0:15:12 front of us right which is the settings
0:15:14 and the xantos right as i was saying i
0:15:16 need this handle before we take the
0:15:18 zentosa otherwise as we're coming out
0:15:20 and dealing with that situation that is
0:15:22 when they're going to hit all right
0:15:23 let's go put some snakes and baskets
0:15:25 stop it that's just a tip
0:15:27 it's not it just doesn't work before
0:15:29 it's not gonna work now all right it's
0:15:30 st patrick's day no that one's it makes
0:15:33 more sense but it's
0:15:34 i mean i like them both to be fair it's
0:15:36 new haven all right you know what i'm
0:15:37 gonna let you guys do the quips no
0:15:38 you're not quips aside what's good bait
0:15:41 for them that guy that would be me no
0:15:43 but you doing what you were saying
0:15:45 picking up i probably will keep it vague
0:15:48 picking up dry cleaning is pretty good
0:15:50 no it's not uh actually it might not be
0:15:53 a bad idea if the lead this setting
0:15:56 ghoul gets is that you're picking up dry
0:15:59 cleaning because
0:16:00 right make it seem like we need to be in
0:16:03 a location like yeah well here's the
0:16:04 thing so when you when you picked up the
0:16:06 i'm sorry i interrupted i can see you
0:16:08 steaming
0:16:10 continue that's just his cigarette
0:16:13 you picked up the guns from the settings
0:16:16 the set heights want to know why you're
0:16:18 getting them yes it would not be outside
0:16:20 the bounds to assume that maybe the
0:16:23 archon is buying from not just the set
0:16:25 heights so if you if it's leaked that
0:16:28 it's dry cleaning or something like that
0:16:30 but it's definitely not it allows you to
0:16:33 go to a more remote location so we don't
0:16:34 have to worry about the masquerade or
0:16:36 any of that kind of stuff in a similar
0:16:38 pick up scenario so you
0:16:41 and i mean i don't know who did you go
0:16:42 with johnny last time i mean technically
0:16:44 the rest of the venture showed up i got
0:16:45 called after the big hitters it was
0:16:47 after the fact
0:16:48 i mean that if it was just you and
0:16:49 marcos then or you and britta because
0:16:51 it's clearly known that brett has been
0:16:52 spending time with you she's exactly
0:16:54 accounting so yeah there you go so then
0:16:55 it would be you guys going to
0:16:58 pick up dry cleaning neil like lifts his
0:17:00 hands and makes air quotes but that dry
0:17:02 cleaning was clearly a reference to guns
0:17:05 from somebody else then they'll show up
0:17:06 to get you and get information at the
0:17:08 same time we don't have to overthink
0:17:10 what dry cleaning is the point is
0:17:12 i'm saying we don't have to overthink
0:17:14 what that could possibly be see the
0:17:17 point is a ventrue of mile standing is
0:17:20 not going to go pick up actual dry
0:17:22 cleaning so if we put that term out
0:17:24 there they're going to know that it
0:17:26 means something else if i hear the term
0:17:28 dry cleaning one more time i'm going to
0:17:29 flip this table i think it's bolted to
0:17:31 the floor
0:17:32 challenge accepted it just johnny sits
0:17:34 back and kind of looks at you
0:17:36 waiting for you to actually pull it off
0:17:37 i'm not gonna do it in here no flipping
0:17:40 the tables see if miles told me i
0:17:42 couldn't and i always listen to miles
0:17:43 this is the way to get out of the
0:17:44 challenge
0:17:47 look it just needs to be
0:17:50 something that the ghoul will run with
0:17:52 right yes that's it doesn't have we
0:17:54 don't have to get into the specifics
0:17:56 it's fine that's what i'm saying yeah i
0:17:57 know we're all on the same page why are
0:17:59 we yelling no one was yelling i'm just
0:18:01 getting upset that people keep
0:18:02 interrupting me
0:18:03 miles
0:18:05 so we let slip to the school that we're
0:18:07 going to quote unquote pick up dry
0:18:09 cleaning we all look at win
0:18:12 is gripping the edge of the table and
0:18:14 just kind of twix her head a little bit
0:18:17 i'm going to go outside
0:18:20 you're fine honey so that's going to be
0:18:22 handled great i can just make the call
0:18:24 now when and where but before we make
0:18:26 the call what's the trap
0:18:28 the rest of us hiding
0:18:30 wherever that's why the wear is
0:18:32 important yeah we have equipment i have
0:18:34 things we can borrow we hide we wait for
0:18:37 them to show up johnny looks at when
0:18:41 heading for the uh the front of the uh
0:18:43 club grabs his uh smokes off the table
0:18:45 and says hey i'm going to make sure that
0:18:46 she's all right yep let me let me know
0:18:49 what you guys decide on and he storms
0:18:51 off after we're gonna get nothing done
0:18:59 johnny you make your way through the
0:19:00 crowd people kind of part out of your
0:19:02 way and it isn't very long once you step
0:19:04 outside that you can see when kind of
0:19:06 off on her own getting some air it's
0:19:08 like traffic very cold at this time the
0:19:11 people that are outside smoking you can
0:19:13 see their breath
0:19:15 which is something to be aware of as you
0:19:16 spend your time out here johnny uh makes
0:19:19 his way over to where wynn is lights up
0:19:22 two cigarettes and hands her one wayne
0:19:24 takes it she's just been kind of
0:19:26 meandering not in an alley but ally
0:19:29 adjacent she just kind of looks at him
0:19:30 and it's just like i don't like
0:19:32 crowds understandable
0:19:34 but it also is probably one of the safer
0:19:37 spots to be in the city at the moment
0:19:38 yeah
0:19:39 i mean
0:19:41 if we go out to
0:19:43 miles haven it's a perfect spot for the
0:19:46 sedites to hit us yeah neil's place
0:19:48 already got hit yep and i hate to say it
0:19:51 but i think there's probably more things
0:19:53 crawling around the woods than than is
0:19:55 normal i wouldn't particularly disagree
0:19:57 with any of that plus i don't have
0:19:59 chairs that's that's the trade-off you
0:20:01 get when you have a fridge you ever seen
0:20:02 my place no that's pretty much just a
0:20:05 little concrete closet under a bar
0:20:07 that's uh yeah not a place where you
0:20:09 want to have company over that's fair so
0:20:12 listen
0:20:12 um
0:20:13 while you were out we found out about
0:20:15 your daughter
0:20:16 namely that you have one
0:20:19 and you have family yeah
0:20:22 and
0:20:23 i have the feeling that that's been
0:20:25 weighing on your mind since that uh
0:20:28 announcement came out that you're
0:20:29 supposed to make more
0:20:30 a little bit
0:20:33 it's been uh it's been a hard time yeah
0:20:36 how did you uh how did you hear about it
0:20:38 friend of a friend well i um
0:20:41 i've got two kids they ought to be about
0:20:45 14 and 18 now when i first got embraced
0:20:49 it was just kind of a nightmare getting
0:20:50 away from the sabbat understandably when
0:20:53 i got back to the area
0:20:54 i started trying to pay too much
0:20:56 attention to my family
0:20:58 and i think
0:20:59 i think my daughter may have caught on
0:21:03 that
0:21:04 i was watching
0:21:05 i think i
0:21:06 might have inadvertently really screwed
0:21:08 her up you know they already were
0:21:10 dealing with the fact that their dad had
0:21:12 gone missing and was probably dead but
0:21:14 then she starts seeing his face looking
0:21:16 in the windows so to speak yeah
0:21:19 well that's um
0:21:21 only a
0:21:22 a bit away from
0:21:24 what the camarilla might consider a
0:21:25 masquerade breach so right weather's
0:21:28 kind of stuck his neck out for me to
0:21:29 make sure that
0:21:30 they would be taken care of but in
0:21:32 return
0:21:33 i was his bully boy seems like a
0:21:35 reasonable compromise yeah
0:21:38 but i mean aside from aside from my own
0:21:40 family i mean i
0:21:42 i know what it's like to be grabbed and
0:21:44 and pulled into something you you don't
0:21:46 want any part of i mean i got the worst
0:21:48 end of it being dropped into a ditch by
0:21:51 the sabbat and turned into a foot
0:21:53 soldier with little question as to
0:21:56 whether this is what i wanted or not so
0:21:58 i
0:22:00 i don't think i can justify doing that
0:22:01 to somebody else i don't i don't care
0:22:03 what kind of
0:22:04 piece of garbage i find like miles was
0:22:06 saying it it's not anything i can do so
0:22:09 johnny i'm i'm gonna bring this up
0:22:12 not because i have any real plan in
0:22:14 place for how to do it but because it is
0:22:16 an option that exists yeah gangrel are
0:22:19 wanderers man we can probably get them
0:22:21 out of the city if you don't want them
0:22:22 here for this
0:22:23 my family yeah
0:22:25 i can't guarantee what would happen
0:22:27 after or before or what would happen if
0:22:30 we got caught but we know what's gonna
0:22:33 happen if they stay i appreciate the
0:22:36 offer
0:22:38 i don't think i want any [ __ ]
0:22:40 bloodsucker touching my family
0:22:42 and i mean that
0:22:44 with as much respect to you
0:22:46 as possible i know what i am man
0:22:48 it's what we are
0:22:50 right
0:22:50 so my daughter's been calling that the
0:22:52 uh the number for the beeper that i've
0:22:54 had
0:22:55 someone's leaking it to her his uh fist
0:22:58 starts to kind of make him tight johnny
0:23:00 we've been standing here for a minute
0:23:07 i got this really awful deep sinking
0:23:10 feeling that it's that shark-toothed
0:23:12 [ __ ] that found out about this
0:23:15 who's leaking the details of my family
0:23:17 all over the city there's only a couple
0:23:19 of bruja that aren't in his pocket
0:23:21 that's probably me
0:23:23 weathers and maybe jane somebody's
0:23:25 gunning for us
0:23:27 how do you fix it realistically probably
0:23:29 asking miles or kneel to come up with an
0:23:32 actual clever plan because i want to fix
0:23:34 it with my fists and i know that's
0:23:36 probably not going to work out the way i
0:23:38 want but god damn it it feels good in my
0:23:40 head well i mean you're not talking to
0:23:42 someone who's unsympathetic to the idea
0:23:43 puff
0:23:45 speaking of which we we should probably
0:23:47 make sure we both the two of us get fed
0:23:49 because yeah i'm starving we're not
0:23:51 looking so off right now i mean we were
0:23:53 supermodels on the runway beforehand too
0:23:56 yeah let's take a walk around the block
0:23:58 maybe you won't see something that uh
0:24:00 might be convenient sounds like a good
0:24:02 plan the two of you make your way down
0:24:04 around the corner for the most part it's
0:24:06 just kind of dumb drunk college kids
0:24:08 wandering about
0:24:10 and that's my favorite flavor
0:24:13 and you make your ways off to hunt
0:24:18 [Music]
0:24:21 so back inside
0:24:22 the mortals seem to be having a good
0:24:24 time again it's another easy night uh
0:24:27 but way in the back the three of you are
0:24:29 still plotting so uh where
0:24:32 where do you think miles where where is
0:24:34 some place where you would receive a
0:24:35 shipment
0:24:37 of
0:24:38 he looks over at wyn's vacated seat
0:24:40 try cleaning
0:24:42 yeah and uh
0:24:44 you know to make it believable
0:24:46 where you feel like we can set something
0:24:48 up that's going to be away from prying
0:24:50 eyes
0:24:51 in case there's you know things get loud
0:24:53 like they do
0:24:54 do you have any place in mind somewhere
0:24:56 where gunshots won't be so noticeable
0:24:58 yes yes i have a place in mind there's a
0:25:01 set of docks on the south side we uptick
0:25:04 your building that the venture
0:25:06 have been using for
0:25:08 these kind of meetings in the past i
0:25:10 don't know if we don't direct or just
0:25:11 whatever but it should be perfectly fine
0:25:13 oh okay that that works it should give
0:25:16 us a vantage point and i'm pretty sure
0:25:18 this kind of thing might have happened
0:25:19 right before you want to call it a
0:25:20 couple of nights from now yeah that
0:25:22 would be best okay i need to gather some
0:25:24 gear i'm gonna um do you need anything
0:25:26 do i need anything what do you mean i
0:25:28 don't know i mean besides normal
0:25:29 equipment um
0:25:31 said something about a bull brita just
0:25:33 looks at neil
0:25:35 neil goes perfectly still
0:25:38 um
0:25:40 yes snow on the bull thing what is what
0:25:43 i mean yeah that would be useful
0:25:48 um i had asked when since she's a
0:25:51 Gangrel she knows animals if she could
0:25:54 it's something about the docket right
0:25:57 what the darker for me uh
0:26:00 the
0:26:01 sort of yeah
0:26:02 the other thing that i was looking into
0:26:04 yeah i i uh
0:26:06 you know i know you think i didn't do
0:26:08 anything while you were asleep but i
0:26:10 should have information coming in
0:26:12 hopefully soon
0:26:14 um
0:26:15 about that
0:26:16 yeah but uh yeah a bull if you know
0:26:19 where to get like you know cattle
0:26:21 wholesalers around here or something
0:26:23 what are you planning on doing with the
0:26:25 ball i thought you said it was something
0:26:27 like that time when you were looking up
0:26:28 at the sky something mystical like that
0:26:31 no i i j um
0:26:34 you know feeding alternatives and things
0:26:36 i just need
0:26:39 does it matter does it matter
0:26:41 i mean to a certain degree i'm curious
0:26:43 and everyone else questions everything
0:26:44 else i do yeah well that's because
0:26:48 so um yeah it's important
0:26:51 i'll pay you for it it doesn't matter
0:26:53 that's not the point
0:26:56 one this is vengeance two
0:27:00 it's i want to know now
0:27:03 malkavian stuff okay
0:27:05 you've never used that excuse before
0:27:08 neil sits for a second and you could
0:27:09 clearly see him looking back over his
0:27:11 memories like have i ever used that
0:27:13 excuse before
0:27:15 uh
0:27:16 [ __ ] look i just
0:27:18 need it please miles sure no problem
0:27:23 where's the butt
0:27:24 there's no butt he just looks directly
0:27:26 over a brito he's like no problem bretta
0:27:29 just looks back definitely
0:27:31 nothing that's being held from each
0:27:33 other that we shouldn't hold secrets and
0:27:35 whatnot no i i totally agree with you uh
0:27:38 i'm gonna make that phone call before
0:27:39 the timer and neil just gets up and
0:27:42 leaves the table and you can see him
0:27:44 pulling his phone out of his pocket as
0:27:45 he leaves one of the huskier fellas neil
0:27:48 bumps into kind of gives him a scowl but
0:27:51 otherwise people kind of ignore neil
0:27:53 this is 90s there are
0:27:55 payphone booths oh yeah absolutely he
0:27:58 will step into a payphone booth
0:27:59 and look at the number that contacted
0:28:02 him before
0:28:03 and
0:28:04 call that number on a pay phone okay
0:28:06 it takes a little while but someone
0:28:08 eventually picks up
0:28:09 hello hey it's the pawn shop calling
0:28:13 what do you want
0:28:14 just wanted to
0:28:16 give you a little bit of helpful
0:28:19 information
0:28:20 okay so thank you for everything you did
0:28:22 and keeping up your end of the bargain
0:28:24 what's the information
0:28:25 would your
0:28:27 bosses be interested in knowing where
0:28:30 miles is going to be
0:28:32 two nights from now definitely yeah yeah
0:28:36 okay hold on hold on you hear him fumble
0:28:38 around looking for a pen
0:28:40 and
0:28:41 pen's ready and
0:28:42 okay okay i'm ready tell me okay uh
0:28:46 do you know
0:28:48 the king freight warehouse down on the
0:28:50 south side docks
0:28:52 is that the one that's nearby elf
0:28:54 storage near dragon point
0:28:59 it's a self storage but some of the
0:29:00 lights went out on the sign so it just
0:29:02 says elf store egg okay well how the
0:29:04 hell was i supposed to ever notice that
0:29:06 yeah okay well cool
0:29:08 yes
0:29:09 elf storage
0:29:11 miles is going to be
0:29:13 picking up some dry cleaning at elf
0:29:16 storage
0:29:17 what miles is picking up
0:29:19 oh
0:29:21 1
0:29:21 45
0:29:24 in the morning which is a very specific
0:29:27 time to pick up dry cleaning at elf
0:29:29 storage
0:29:30 right
0:29:31 okay i'll relay it he hangs up oh i was
0:29:34 gonna
0:29:35 oh okay and i just hanged up
0:29:42 [Music]
0:29:44 miles britta
0:29:46 while neil wanders off to make his phone
0:29:48 call in a bit of a hurry two you find
0:29:51 yourselves alone in the back staring at
0:29:53 each other
0:29:55 child what have i done
0:29:57 to make you mistrust me so
0:30:00 i don't mistrust you
0:30:03 because when it came to my information
0:30:06 to be told to everyone
0:30:09 i was hiding secrets
0:30:12 but
0:30:13 when neil has something that he's
0:30:15 clearly not wanting to talk about you
0:30:18 start covering for him
0:30:20 i didn't
0:30:21 know those were huge secrets for you
0:30:24 they're not but they
0:30:26 weren't a conversation you weren't part
0:30:28 of and you felt obligated to reveal
0:30:30 those details before i had gotten there
0:30:33 and then decided that my telling you not
0:30:37 to be so overt in your listening
0:30:39 was way too much
0:30:40 i'm trying to figure out where
0:30:43 the impression is given that i am not
0:30:45 trying to do things in the best interest
0:30:47 of these people and yourself
0:30:49 where did i move wrongly here
0:30:52 i'm sorry if i said something of yours
0:30:54 that i shouldn't have miles
0:30:57 that's not entirely the point
0:30:59 but i want to say it anyway fair enough
0:31:02 i don't
0:31:03 mind and to certain degrees i feel like
0:31:05 neil listens into most of my
0:31:07 conversations
0:31:08 so
0:31:09 i'm fairly used to that he's just a
0:31:12 little bit more
0:31:14 covert about it keeping it close to
0:31:16 himself
0:31:17 but everyone has secrets
0:31:19 and everyone has things they don't
0:31:20 necessarily need to be
0:31:22 told
0:31:23 and they don't necessarily want to be
0:31:25 told and sometimes i don't dole out
0:31:27 information in a way that is
0:31:30 seemingly like it's keeping secrets from
0:31:32 people sometimes it's just too much
0:31:34 information for people
0:31:36 we tried to plan an ambush tonight and
0:31:39 it took me a good 15 minutes to
0:31:41 establish the plan that i'd already
0:31:43 established
0:31:44 sometimes it's better to just
0:31:47 not
0:31:48 and then we will fill them in as we go
0:31:50 along
0:31:51 i trust you miles
0:31:53 you've
0:31:55 you've earned that trust
0:31:57 and i get that
0:31:58 sorry continue no
0:32:00 i'm i'm sorry um
0:32:02 i didn't know
0:32:04 that i shouldn't have said
0:32:06 what i said
0:32:08 when i overheard you
0:32:10 and with
0:32:11 neil he said he didn't want it known and
0:32:14 i guess the question is do you think i
0:32:16 should know i don't i'm leaving this
0:32:18 into your judgment this is your
0:32:20 within your first couple weeks of being
0:32:22 into this thing
0:32:24 you've shown
0:32:25 some good skills and determine making
0:32:27 determinations and instincts and stuff
0:32:29 what do you think
0:32:32 it's my instinct that we shouldn't be
0:32:34 keeping things from each other
0:32:36 but
0:32:38 what
0:32:39 what if knowing could hurt each other
0:32:43 well that is your call to make at this
0:32:45 point
0:32:46 do you think that sooner or later i'm
0:32:48 going to find out
0:32:49 do you do i need to find out
0:32:52 or is this information going to make it
0:32:54 problematic for me in the future and
0:32:56 that maybe i don't need it now
0:32:59 these are the things you're gonna have
0:33:00 to start considering
0:33:02 entering into this world
0:33:04 and it gets
0:33:06 murky
0:33:07 and it gets
0:33:08 difficult and sometimes the lines
0:33:11 between friends
0:33:12 and co-workers
0:33:14 blur and that is
0:33:16 the problem and making definitive
0:33:18 calls is difficult it is not always the
0:33:21 easy to maintain friendships
0:33:25 why aren't you angrier about this
0:33:28 it's not the first time and it won't be
0:33:30 the last time
0:33:32 that these things have happened to me
0:33:33 and that people of around me
0:33:36 keep secrets of their own and i don't
0:33:38 begrudge them
0:33:39 why
0:33:40 wouldn't
0:33:41 you just ask neil
0:33:44 neil will tell me when he decides to and
0:33:46 i'm not necessarily asking you but
0:33:49 i was asking you
0:33:51 why i hadn't earned the respect that you
0:33:53 had essentially given neil
0:33:55 i'm not asking for his secrets
0:33:58 he asked me not to talk about it
0:34:00 to anyone and specifically or
0:34:02 to the rest of the codery how bad is it
0:34:06 it seemed
0:34:07 somewhat
0:34:08 regular to me
0:34:10 what it wouldn't think of it
0:34:12 she seemed a little more off put well we
0:34:14 shall see i will provide him the bowl
0:34:15 and we'll see what happens from there
0:34:17 but if you choose to
0:34:19 you can tell let me know but i will also
0:34:22 let you keep it this is
0:34:24 part of entering the night
0:34:26 so i
0:34:28 should ask this now then when i did
0:34:30 listen in on your conversation and
0:34:33 i heard some things i well some of the
0:34:35 things i did think were your secrets and
0:34:36 i did protect them miles
0:34:40 whatever that was about lichter hmm
0:34:43 that's my newest title
0:34:45 and it might have got lost in the
0:34:46 shuffle but essentially i got a
0:34:49 promotion within the bench room i heard
0:34:51 a bit of that and
0:34:52 it sounded like something i shouldn't
0:34:54 know it's
0:34:56 not
0:34:57 common knowledge
0:34:59 what i'm trying to tell you is that you
0:35:01 have earned that respect
0:35:03 and if there's something i shouldn't
0:35:04 talk about i want you
0:35:06 well obviously you can't point it out to
0:35:08 me so that i'd know it but this goes
0:35:10 both ways feel free to also ask me part
0:35:13 of the learning is seeing
0:35:15 learning what is and isn't
0:35:17 acceptable but normal morality doesn't
0:35:20 work the same way
0:35:21 i'm still finding
0:35:23 that line it's going to become
0:35:28 rougher britta wynn
0:35:31 and neil are driven to the farms of
0:35:34 wallingford where there's a dairy farm
0:35:36 waiting with the bull that's required
0:35:38 for neil's mysterious right johnny drops
0:35:40 the three of you off and heads off on
0:35:42 his own leaving the three of you out in
0:35:44 the cold
0:35:46 at a dairy farm
0:35:48 okay so presumably it's just the one up
0:35:50 in that pen over there
0:35:52 maybe it's the one in the field do we
0:35:53 know which one it is i
0:35:55 i would have to assume it's the one
0:35:57 that's isolated from the other ones okay
0:35:59 great
0:35:59 all right um as you guys kind of tiptoe
0:36:02 around you can see that there's a group
0:36:04 of them that are kind of set off to the
0:36:05 side in a barn the barn itself is like
0:36:07 really old and dilapidated
0:36:10 for some reason it's still in use you
0:36:12 kind of feel nervous for the animals
0:36:14 just looking at it but way off away from
0:36:17 from any of structures is this small pen
0:36:21 that has a bull kind of quietly pacing
0:36:24 alone a week late at night despite no
0:36:27 stimulus
0:36:28 it's as if it knows
0:36:30 something is coming for it tonight as
0:36:32 the group of you start walking the farm
0:36:35 the animals start becoming very nervous
0:36:38 and
0:36:38 you can hear
0:36:40 dogs barking and some animals kind of
0:36:43 just reacting to the presence of
0:36:45 vampires uh
0:36:47 when can you help me with with with this
0:36:50 bringing it over near the near the bowl
0:36:52 it's just it's a lot easier yeah you
0:36:53 guys should get away from the barn he
0:36:55 has a uh like one of those
0:36:57 big tupperware containers with a lid on
0:37:00 it it's kind of heavy you can hear stuff
0:37:02 like some metal things and whatever
0:37:03 rattle around inside
0:37:05 yeah
0:37:06 just just uh you know be perfect yeah uh
0:37:09 you guys should get away from the barn
0:37:11 yeah you're upsetting the animals uh
0:37:14 wait what do you mean you guys do you
0:37:15 not no
0:37:16 perfect okay before i ask you to kind of
0:37:19 get out of sight for a little while and
0:37:21 because i don't i really don't want you
0:37:23 to look at me differently after this um
0:37:25 can you do me a favor
0:37:27 yeah they get to like the outskirts of
0:37:28 the pen and he opens up the tupperware
0:37:31 container uh and inside are
0:37:34 bags of that like red
0:37:36 leaf a big knife
0:37:38 and a
0:37:40 long black like linen cloak a robe or
0:37:44 something
0:37:45 on the inside is
0:37:48 just written again in that same like
0:37:50 arabic
0:37:51 script in sharpie on the inside of this
0:37:53 tupperware and a manila folder and he
0:37:56 pulls out an incense brazier
0:37:59 if i light this up can you just go
0:38:01 kind of put it around the bowl make him
0:38:04 smell it a lot kind of chill him out
0:38:07 um
0:38:09 are you okay with that yeah
0:38:11 cool he'll just kind of stuff this
0:38:13 incense brazier with red weed
0:38:15 light it up it's got a really
0:38:18 weird like opium and blood smell to it
0:38:22 it doesn't smell like pot
0:38:25 let them breathe it in um
0:38:27 if you can yep effects when yeah
0:38:30 wind takes it and
0:38:32 heads toward the bowl she keeps her
0:38:34 movements gentle she stays within the
0:38:35 bull's line of sight so that it doesn't
0:38:37 feel as though she's quite as much of a
0:38:39 predator you can already feel that the
0:38:41 bull watches you warily
0:38:43 not so much assuming that you're here to
0:38:45 hurt it
0:38:46 but the beast it's kind of like it's big
0:38:49 brown eyes definitely gets a sense that
0:38:51 usually the animals that are
0:38:53 separated don't really come back
0:38:57 it's all right buddy
0:38:59 thank you
0:39:00 and she blows some of the smoke towards
0:39:03 the bull's nose staggers back slightly
0:39:05 but it doesn't like resist the smoke why
0:39:07 don't you give me a
0:39:09 charisma plus animal can
0:39:14 uh one success okay it definitely seems
0:39:16 put at ease
0:39:17 uh by you and then by whatever it is
0:39:20 that it's breathing in she'll take a few
0:39:21 more breaths once it seems to have
0:39:24 recovered from the whoa factor
0:39:26 and just
0:39:28 it comes kind of closer yep and
0:39:31 at this point you can probably
0:39:34 she just kind of sets the bowl down push
0:39:35 yeah
0:39:36 uh the basin down and uh
0:39:39 heads back
0:39:40 okay
0:39:45 as wind walks off neil pulls the manila
0:39:48 envelope out and then just hands it to
0:39:51 brita it's still sealed it has not been
0:39:53 opened yet
0:39:55 so i um i called in a few favors and i
0:39:58 found this
0:40:00 here
0:40:00 this is
0:40:02 information about
0:40:04 you
0:40:05 who you were
0:40:07 uh
0:40:08 building records i don't know everything
0:40:09 that's in there right now
0:40:11 i haven't looked at it
0:40:13 obviously i've talked a lot tonight and
0:40:15 over the last few nights about not being
0:40:17 seen differently after
0:40:19 people understand things and see things
0:40:21 but i
0:40:22 i want to make sure that you are aware
0:40:25 of the choice that you can make what do
0:40:27 you mean aware of the choice
0:40:28 sometimes it's better not to know things
0:40:31 because once you know them you can't
0:40:33 choose not to know them
0:40:36 trust me when i say sometimes you see
0:40:38 things that you wish you hadn't seen
0:40:40 that you wish you could forget sometimes
0:40:42 forgetting is a blessing you get to
0:40:44 choose who you are and what you know but
0:40:47 i think the choice should be yours i
0:40:49 didn't make it for you i didn't read it
0:40:52 no
0:40:53 yeah
0:40:55 do you mind if i open this now
0:40:57 you can
0:40:59 do whatever you want
0:41:01 it's it's up to you i think i understand
0:41:04 the warning that you're trying to give
0:41:05 me but
0:41:06 i have
0:41:07 so much that i can't remember everything
0:41:10 is
0:41:11 a void
0:41:12 and
0:41:14 look maybe i don't want to be who i'll
0:41:16 become if i do know
0:41:18 but i know for certain i don't want to
0:41:20 be how i am now
0:41:22 and i appreciate i i really do i
0:41:25 thank you for
0:41:27 thank you for not opening it but i want
0:41:29 you guys
0:41:31 to know
0:41:32 i would maybe talk to wynn about what's
0:41:34 inside there as much as i'm curious i'm
0:41:36 not going to remember very much starting
0:41:38 pretty soon
0:41:41 with everything that
0:41:42 was in the basement it
0:41:45 i don't see how we would see you
0:41:46 differently it's just some plants
0:41:50 yeah
0:41:52 we'll see i'm gonna wind's coming back
0:41:54 i'm gonna and he sort of hefs the
0:41:57 tupperware and steps
0:41:59 very awkwardly like over the fence
0:42:02 as best he can stumbles a little bit
0:42:04 buddy you're gonna trip let me take that
0:42:07 over like give me the box he hands it
0:42:09 over we'll be back soon okay uh we gotta
0:42:12 be on time for when johnny gets back
0:42:13 yeah um remember i after
0:42:16 so give me about eight hours um if i'm
0:42:19 not out of it then
0:42:20 come wake me up
0:42:22 and then if you can and he sort of
0:42:24 reaches in and brings out like a glass
0:42:27 basin
0:42:28 if you're up for it
0:42:30 and want our best chance of success i i
0:42:33 think
0:42:34 just
0:42:34 just like a pint of your vitae
0:42:37 holds out her risk uh at the end not now
0:42:41 yeah it this has to be done in the right
0:42:42 order but we appreciate the enthusiasm
0:42:46 we'll see i just
0:42:48 get good honey don't neal do what you
0:42:50 need to do
0:42:51 he takes the bin back don't
0:42:54 look at me different and he just
0:42:56 like he can't quite look at you guys
0:42:58 anymore
0:42:59 hustles up to the incredibly stoned bowl
0:43:02 i left the incense up there thank you i
0:43:04 need it
0:43:08 neil you're left to your own devices
0:43:11 and standing
0:43:13 in the middle of this pen dazed and
0:43:15 confused and kind of shifting slightly
0:43:17 into stupor
0:43:18 is this big
0:43:21 dark furred bull
0:43:23 neal opens up the tupperware bin again
0:43:26 takes out the bowl the knife the robe
0:43:30 keeps the incense and the kalief
0:43:34 circulating in the air underneath the
0:43:36 bowl
0:43:36 and then pushes the tupperware
0:43:38 underneath like the bowl's head and neck
0:43:41 slowly strips out of his clothes until
0:43:44 he's just standing there completely
0:43:45 naked
0:43:46 folds his clothes and leans them against
0:43:48 these the fence you strip down and the
0:43:50 bullet itself is actually pretty
0:43:51 malleable like as whenever you take it
0:43:53 by the horns and move it it seems to
0:43:54 just sort of go with it embracing
0:43:57 whatever it is that you intend to do
0:43:59 neil is extremely nervous because he's
0:44:01 only done this
0:44:02 a couple times before
0:44:04 and then puts on the black robe
0:44:07 it's just sort of gauzy and drapes
0:44:09 across him um it's open in the front
0:44:11 it's just
0:44:13 for ritual more than anything else right
0:44:15 gets into the tupperware tub like it was
0:44:18 a bit like it was a bath underneath the
0:44:21 bowl takes a long curved dagger sort of
0:44:24 pushes the bull's chin up
0:44:26 and then slits its throat
0:44:30 you slit its throat and
0:44:33 hot blood starts to pour out you can
0:44:35 actually see the steam
0:44:37 in the air from the heat of it
0:44:39 and it no easily pours out just a
0:44:43 showering kneel the bowl kind of makes
0:44:46 this like desperate drowsy noise
0:44:50 and
0:44:51 very quickly it loses its life and the
0:44:54 light in its eyes just sort of fades
0:44:58 neil uh
0:44:59 lets the blood just completely drench
0:45:01 him and start filling up this tupperware
0:45:04 and just
0:45:05 lays back
0:45:07 bathing and luxuriating in the blood uh
0:45:10 allowing a lot of the caliph laced blood
0:45:12 to just get into his mouth and move
0:45:14 through his body it hits you all at once
0:45:16 and you can feel your fangs bared and
0:45:19 you stare right up the stars
0:45:21 and
0:45:22 everything is laid bare to you and
0:45:26 before you can it even registers what's
0:45:28 happening you begin to climb
0:45:35 see neil wander off to be alone and
0:45:38 find yourselves left just the two of you
0:45:40 the animals die down
0:45:42 it's a very very quiet night there
0:45:44 aren't really insects around this time
0:45:46 of year so it's just
0:45:47 cold air and almost no clouds overhead
0:45:51 rita is holding an unopened manila
0:45:54 folder pretty tightly and she
0:45:57 hoists herself up to sit on a nearby
0:45:59 fence kind of staring at the seal of it
0:46:01 he didn't leave his will did he
0:46:04 no um
0:46:06 no um sorry this is um
0:46:09 it's the dossier
0:46:10 oh
0:46:11 wind kind of steps up on one part of the
0:46:14 fence and kind of straddles it and sits
0:46:16 near brita rita looks to win almost as
0:46:19 if she's looking for confirmation but
0:46:21 looks back to the dossier and
0:46:24 rips it open
0:46:25 do you mind if i'm sitting here while
0:46:26 you read it no i'm
0:46:28 not at all actually tell me if you want
0:46:30 to look me to look away so inside uh it
0:46:33 looks like a lot of bureaucratic jargon
0:46:36 but there's a few things that catch your
0:46:38 eye pretty quickly one is the name
0:46:40 britney ashcroft
0:46:42 the next thing that you notice is that
0:46:44 apparently you are the owner of a cafe
0:46:48 referred to as cedarhurst
0:46:50 well i
0:46:51 so you're landed gentry i have a name
0:46:54 and there is a you always had a name
0:46:56 honey oh documents surrounding that in
0:46:58 addition to this however there's a state
0:47:00 id there's a birth certificate the birth
0:47:04 certificate looks to be like a copy and
0:47:06 the copy you're looking at is pristine
0:47:09 like uncomfortably pristine
0:47:11 can i get an investigation role from
0:47:13 either one of you if you possess the
0:47:15 knowledge i do not damage the knowledge
0:47:17 sorry guys
0:47:19 ask me in an hour eight hours
0:47:21 oh we can ask you in an hour if you want
0:47:23 yes
0:47:24 if you kick him enough actually anyway
0:47:27 so you look at it again the the
0:47:30 documents look very very very pristine
0:47:34 and very well organized
0:47:37 so well organized it looks like someone
0:47:39 had
0:47:40 it looks like some of this may have been
0:47:42 fabricated but with the intention of
0:47:45 getting you the property that you own
0:47:47 what's the date of birth on the birth
0:47:49 certificate specifically how old is she
0:47:51 so looking at the document the birth
0:47:53 date listed is may 28th
0:47:56 of 1978.
0:47:58 so you're 20. news to me happy birthday
0:48:03 elated or early you take your pick let's
0:48:05 hope for early yeah
0:48:07 ready uh wow that sounds weird
0:48:10 brittany
0:48:11 ashcroft
0:48:14 um
0:48:16 i'm sorry i think i like
0:48:18 bread up better who are you apologizing
0:48:20 to
0:48:22 um
0:48:23 don't don't go through this thinking
0:48:25 that you owe me an explanation for who
0:48:27 you were
0:48:28 or who you want to be
0:48:30 this is all about giving you options
0:48:32 about who you want to be going forward
0:48:35 i
0:48:36 want that explanation for
0:48:39 myself
0:48:40 i get that i don't
0:48:42 i get that you offered to help me all of
0:48:45 you
0:48:46 and you have but you know what to some
0:48:48 extent i do owe you
0:48:51 an explanation of how this happened
0:48:54 all right but no apologies not to us
0:48:57 okay
0:48:59 [Music]
0:49:02 neil
0:49:03 you climbed my way up to the heavens
0:49:06 to describe it as an outer body
0:49:07 experiences and really begin to
0:49:09 cover the sensation or the lack thereof
0:49:12 as you float amidst the sea of stars you
0:49:15 find yourself drawn deeper into its
0:49:17 darkest aspects
0:49:19 and you are confronted with visions
0:49:23 palpable
0:49:24 living nightmares
0:49:27 many of them come into the form of your
0:49:29 own social anxieties things that you
0:49:31 want and can never have
0:49:33 the people who you wish had admired you
0:49:36 but never will those who don't recognize
0:49:38 you and don't care to but step on you
0:49:41 anyways
0:49:42 you are made painfully aware of your own
0:49:45 insignificance
0:49:47 okay
0:49:49 and that's when you hear it
0:49:50 he is continue to associate with what
0:49:53 sandris
0:49:55Reiss will deal with this
0:50:01 come on deal
0:50:02 and you hide at least you try to
0:50:05 but the psychic presence of the tremere
0:50:08 is unmistakable and it chases you down
0:50:11 the hall slowly stalking inevitable
0:50:14 until you are cornered
0:50:16 helpless
0:50:17 and doomed
0:50:24 what do you do
0:50:26 oh god
0:50:31 i didn't want this
0:50:33 neil
0:50:34 just tries to shrink further away from
0:50:37 but there's nowhere to go
0:50:39 he has
0:50:40 no weapons
0:50:42 no knowledge nothing can
0:50:44 save him and he just starts screaming
0:50:47 and screaming
0:50:49 hoping his voice
0:50:51 and
0:50:52 his words and wordless intonations just
0:50:56 tear apart those who seek to harm him
0:50:58 for a moment you feel your thoughts
0:51:01 splayed out like a butterfly underneath
0:51:03 glass
0:51:05 you can sense this tremere reaching
0:51:08 into your deepest darkest memories
0:51:11 moments with your sire
0:51:13 walking you through the incantations and
0:51:15 teaching you the secret languages
0:51:18 as he
0:51:19 dissects you you find yourself digging
0:51:22 deep and tapping into
0:51:24 the the power that is available to all
0:51:26 the sheep who dare to climb the heavens
0:51:28 and you push
0:51:30 this terrible spirit away why don't you
0:51:32 give me a will power rule you must
0:51:35 uh
0:51:36 confront your fears technically it
0:51:38 should be
0:51:39 actually you know i'm actually gonna
0:51:40 have you all courage
0:51:41 oh [ __ ]
0:51:43 uh
0:51:44 you may spend a point
0:51:45 [Laughter]
0:51:48 but unfortunately at this point when
0:51:50 attempting to climb the ladder of heaven
0:51:52 you are confronted with your worst fears
0:51:57 what is the difficulty you're looking
0:51:58 for here six six okay then two successes
0:52:01 great
0:52:04 the presence that calls itself rhys is
0:52:07 pushed away and you reach the stars an
0:52:10 offer to you is
0:52:12 the path to enlightenment
0:52:14 but
0:52:16 desires that are much more terrestrial
0:52:19 and that's when you see her waiting for
0:52:21 you
0:52:22 nara
0:52:23 and
0:52:24 this moment and this kind of perfect
0:52:27 bliss you realize that nara
0:52:30 the asamite vizier from your past
0:52:33 has also climbed the ladder of heaven
0:52:35 and has found you here
0:52:38 it has been so long beloved
0:52:42 i have missed you so
0:52:44 time is irrelevant here
0:52:46 she approaches she has kind of like long
0:52:48 dark hair chestnut eyes
0:52:51 her skin is like kind of like a like a
0:52:53 dark bronze
0:52:55 and
0:52:56 here
0:52:58 she has this ethereal beauty that
0:53:00 doesn't quite exist on earth
0:53:02 and
0:53:03 when she rests against you kind of feel
0:53:05 the bridge of her nose against your
0:53:07 chest
0:53:10 i
0:53:12 know
0:53:14 what my sire taught me i know this isn't
0:53:16 real
0:53:18 but i want it to be so bad
0:53:20 that is what it means to be a shipu
0:53:23 here
0:53:24 you can choose what is real
0:53:27 and what is false
0:53:29 what if the world you left behind is
0:53:31 false
0:53:33 what if i can be real
0:53:35 all you need do is hold me
0:53:38 and i am here
0:53:40 i i want to
0:53:44 but it's not
0:53:46 for even
0:53:48 enoshipu
0:53:50 to tell a malkavian what is real and
0:53:52 what is not
0:53:54 hubris nothing is real i know
0:53:59 roll
0:54:01 what am i rolling here i'm going to cast
0:54:02 the ritual now all right
0:54:05 i am definitely spending a willpower on
0:54:06 this okay
0:54:08 seems like the wise move okay
0:54:13 uh that is a success had three successes
0:54:15 you succeed in performing the ritual and
0:54:18 in its final moments
0:54:20 you feel uh
0:54:22 an ice cold charcoaled hand like the
0:54:25 hand of a child
0:54:26 crests your cheek comforting you
0:54:29 oh god
0:54:30 when you look up
0:54:32 you find staring down at you a boy
0:54:35 can't be older than 11 years old small
0:54:38 diminutive
0:54:39 but its skin
0:54:41 is black and charcoal like the boy had
0:54:44 been burned alive in some terrible
0:54:46 accident its eyes are gone and when it
0:54:50 speaks to you there are ancient fangs in
0:54:52 its mouth
0:54:54 the path must split
0:54:57 all things change
0:54:59 i am his herald
0:55:01 and he wakes
0:55:04 and like that the ritual comes to a
0:55:06 conclusion and you find yourself
0:55:09 staring up at the stars dazed and
0:55:11 confused and doused in blood
0:55:13 neil just
0:55:15 jerks like coming out of a nightmare in
0:55:18 this
0:55:19 huge bucket full of it's freezing what
0:55:22 is now probably mostly coagulated blood
0:55:24 screaming for just a second before
0:55:26 getting control of himself
0:55:33 those who are away on the on the farm
0:55:35 can hear the sounds of neil screaming
0:55:38 and it is it is not a natural scream it
0:55:42 is like the screech of a wild vampire
0:55:45 how long has it been about eight hours
0:55:47 when just launches off the fence post
0:55:50 because her squishy is in trouble
0:55:53 moves unnaturally fast as well the two
0:55:56 of you rush for the hill and
0:55:59 find the site where he has clearly
0:56:01 performed his ritual and their eyes wide
0:56:05 and glaring around confused is kneel
0:56:09 nude blood soaked however over his
0:56:12 shoulders kind of hanging loose is
0:56:15 some something of like black fabric that
0:56:17 is soaked and clinging to him
0:56:21 hey neil are you okay
0:56:23 i saw that
0:56:25 wind pulls off her leather jacket no no
0:56:27 no no i have to do this we have to
0:56:29 finish it i saw what i needed to see
0:56:32 i think
0:56:33 it's
0:56:34 disorienting but there's
0:56:37 it's like waking from a dream there's
0:56:38 insight and then it flees and i i need
0:56:41 to
0:56:42 okay what do you need us to do this now
0:56:44 before the dream flees
0:56:46 okay
0:56:48 neil kind of confused for a second looks
0:56:50 around on the ground
0:56:52 bretta hands him the knife
0:56:54 yeah that's what uh
0:56:55 one of them and he keeps looking there's
0:56:57 a there should be a like a basin like a
0:56:58 glass bowl like wind looks around and
0:57:01 easily found and picks it up he's got a
0:57:03 ton of blood in his neighbor looked past
0:57:05 it like five times you could not see it
0:57:07 okay
0:57:08 all right
0:57:09 and he
0:57:10 slices open his wrist
0:57:12 and then squeezes and wills a point of
0:57:15 vitae into the bowl and then
0:57:18 holds the knife out for one of you
0:57:20 takes it and
0:57:22 slices her wrist
0:57:23 a very sharp edge it slices you right
0:57:26 open
0:57:27 [ __ ] a little surprised at how well it
0:57:29 cut she lets a point of her blood enter
0:57:32 the bowl and kind of carefully hands the
0:57:35 knife
0:57:35 to brita rita takes the knife makes a
0:57:38 careful flash and wheels her own blood
0:57:41 into the basin neil holds the basin in
0:57:43 front of him doesn't take the knife back
0:57:45 swirls the blood around and watches the
0:57:49 reflection of the stars unnaturally in
0:57:52 the blood
0:57:53 around you is this
0:57:55 eerie
0:57:57 unsettling feeling
0:57:59 like something is very wrong this is no
0:58:03 hedge magic this is no this isn't
0:58:06 thaumaturgy even this is something
0:58:08 wrong neil what the [ __ ] are you doing
0:58:12 your wind's response catches your eye i
0:58:14 bought up into this moment what he's
0:58:16 doing doesn't actually really jump out
0:58:17 to you is terribly strange you find
0:58:19 yourself even maybe costumes to it
0:58:22 but
0:58:23 her reaction makes this instantly
0:58:26 contagious
0:58:27 and you feel a shiver go up your spine
0:58:32 neil now are you sure
0:58:34 when the ambient spirits of the area
0:58:37 have a like a reaction like everything's
0:58:41 attention is suddenly drawn to this
0:58:43 and nervously
0:58:45 every single spirit ever even the most
0:58:47 minor note most of these creatures set
0:58:50 their gaze up to the sky at once
0:58:53 and it is very disconcerting neil looks
0:58:56 up from the ball
0:58:57 looks directly at the stars the blood is
0:59:00 blanked out of his eyes and his pupils
0:59:03 have dilated to the point where you
0:59:04 cannot see the sclera his eyes are all
0:59:07 black taking in all the starlight
0:59:11 tell me
0:59:12 when is the best season to hunt to the
0:59:14 zentosa and i will use the third rank of
0:59:19 path of the heavens and call down the
0:59:20 hunter's moon go ahead give me a roll
0:59:23 and i will spend a point of willpower on
0:59:25 this too so i'm gonna do that and my
0:59:27 difficulty is reduced by three yes so my
0:59:31 difficulty is threes
0:59:34 do tens explode on a willpower check
0:59:37 there's not like a thing to it well that
0:59:39 sucks because i got three tens oh jesus
0:59:41 um
0:59:42 that is three four successes great uh
0:59:44 mechanically the three of us
0:59:47 when we go to fight the santosa gain
0:59:50 four free points of willpower that can
0:59:52 be spent can be spent during the account
0:59:55 for that encounter sweet in addition in
0:59:57 addition to your normal willpower you
0:59:59 just get four extras for that purpose
1:00:02 neil the heavens speak to you and
1:00:05 your questions are answered
1:00:08 the first night of the second month
1:00:10 february
1:00:12 february 1st that night the zantosa
1:00:15 that's our best chance of success
1:00:18 he will be weakest and we will be
1:00:20 strongest then
1:00:22 and then neil blinks a few times and
1:00:24 sort of staggers a little bit like this
1:00:26 took a lot out of him and his eyes are
1:00:29 back to normal all of a sudden the cold
1:00:32 seems to hit him and everything seems to
1:00:34 hit him at once and he doesn't collapse
1:00:36 but he definitely staggers wind swings
1:00:38 the jacket around him when he starts to
1:00:41 react more like neil
1:00:42 but it's clear she's she's going on
1:00:45 instincts to protect but she is not
1:00:47 happy by what she's seen leo
1:00:50 are you
1:00:51 cold i'm really cold it's then of the
1:00:54 guru here
1:00:57 a horn
1:00:58 goes off again and uh
1:01:01 out by the road you can see a very bored
1:01:05 johnny waiting for the group of you to
1:01:07 get your asses in gear johnny uh leans
1:01:10 out of the uh window of the semi-truck
1:01:13 he's driving in fact it's funny because
1:01:15 it's not it's a different vehicle than
1:01:17 the one that he dropped you guys off
1:01:19 with but he's peering out into the into
1:01:21 the dark looks like he's uh not really
1:01:24 accustomed to seeing this this dark of
1:01:27 light catches what he thinks might be
1:01:30 your silhouettes and kind of waves at
1:01:31 you
1:01:32 go tell him we'll be right there britta
1:01:34 okay
1:01:37 oh um
1:01:37 can you help me uh can you do me a favor
1:01:40 what
1:01:42 i need to
1:01:44 i don't want johnny to see me like this
1:01:46 i know let's let's wipe you down should
1:01:49 give me like a i'm gonna hose off or
1:01:51 something and
1:01:53 can you just dump everything in the
1:01:54 bucket and put the lid back on
1:01:57 please
1:01:59 can you make it to the hose by yourself
1:02:01 and are you gonna set off the animals
1:02:02 when you get there oh
1:02:05 yeah then you put the [ __ ] away and i
1:02:07 will bring the hose to you and we will
1:02:09 talk about why you are dabbling in this
1:02:11 love crafty and nightmare [ __ ]
1:02:14 the horn of the semi blairs again britta
1:02:17 has gotten there by that point she
1:02:19 flinches at the noise but she climbs up
1:02:21 and sits in the
1:02:22 next two where the hell the others
1:02:24 they're just cleaning up but um all
1:02:25 right well i got some presents for y'all
1:02:27 he reaches in the back of this i mean
1:02:29 tosses a leather jacket in your lap
1:02:31 brita picks it up and examines it it's a
1:02:33 pretty uh robust
1:02:36 biker jacket big thick silver zippers
1:02:40 and
1:02:41 hasn't been uh worn in yet looks a
1:02:43 little bit you know funny because it's
1:02:45 brand new definitely looks like it uh
1:02:48 fits your size and when you do put it on
1:02:51 it feels like you're kind of wearing
1:02:52 armor now britta does uh after checking
1:02:55 the tag seeing that it is actually
1:02:57 visually it's not johnny's size clearly
1:02:59 but she doesn't seem to understand it's
1:03:01 a present until she puts it on and her
1:03:03 back straightens so she understands what
1:03:05 it is
1:03:06 i think now you're starting to look like
1:03:07 a kindred uh and here he uh puts a uh
1:03:10 bag of clothes
1:03:12 and a couple of uh blankets and towels
1:03:15 and just a few other things i'm not sure
1:03:17 what the hell you guys are getting up to
1:03:18 out here but i can't imagine it was
1:03:20 clean so here i don't know if the if uh
1:03:23 if wynn or neil needs that britta
1:03:26 accepts it and looks down at it she
1:03:28 trades him the manila folder what the
1:03:30 hell's this it's um the dossier uh i'll
1:03:34 bring this out to them and also what
1:03:36 it's um my info i guess from neil he
1:03:39 looks down at the end the interior of it
1:03:42 brittany look i don't really need to
1:03:44 know any of this this stuff he kind of
1:03:46 tosses it onto his uh the console of the
1:03:49 uh of the truck it didn't uh
1:03:51 really feel right to me either i'll
1:03:53 bring this out to them anyway okay all
1:03:55 right be quick we gotta get moving hey
1:03:57 johnny yeah
1:03:59 thank you
1:04:00 i don't really like the jacket
1:04:02 it looks good but i will bring the
1:04:04 bucket back out to them
1:04:10 wind goes up to the barn and finds a
1:04:12 hose there's one near the stalls
1:04:14 presumably yeah absolutely she cranks
1:04:16 the water on she unfurls the hose as she
1:04:19 brings it back out to kneel neal
1:04:21 dumps the blood out she and the extra
1:04:24 blood out she hoses him down puts her
1:04:26 thumb over the spigot and just
1:04:29 poses him down you know you are kindred
1:04:32 but uh
1:04:33 where this is still guess who doesn't
1:04:35 have any points before it's really cold
1:04:38 oh
1:04:39 [ __ ] um
1:04:42 i can
1:04:43 see it you know
1:04:45 see what
1:04:46 i was afraid of this oh neil
1:04:50 you're looking at me different i'm
1:04:51 looking at you different because i'm
1:04:52 scared for you you [ __ ] look
1:04:55 this isn't okay what you're doing neil i
1:04:58 did it for knowledge and
1:05:00 knowledge is a weapon and
1:05:03 you saw what miles was doing and every
1:05:05 we're gonna need weapons we're gonna
1:05:07 need weapons but we need you
1:05:09 yeah
1:05:10 because i can get knowledge we need you
1:05:12 because you're [ __ ] you you jackass
1:05:15 you are a member of the coterie you are
1:05:17 a member of the family and you are
1:05:19 dabbling in this [ __ ]

1:05:26 i need to provide two
1:05:28 you provide neil you are enough
1:05:33 you
1:05:34 don't overhear miles as much as i do
1:05:36 miles is an asshat too and i'll protect
1:05:39 him too i'm providing knowledge
1:05:42 not just for all of you
1:05:44 selfishly too i need it
1:05:47 britta silently brings the old towel and
1:05:49 a change of clothes that seems like they
1:05:51 might fit him
1:05:52 where'd you get these johnny oh
1:05:55 that was thoughtful let's get in the
1:05:57 truck it's freezing and the clothes
1:05:59 first
1:06:00 half's the bucket the uh the clothes
1:06:02 look like they're all like real like
1:06:04 thick heavy duty kind of work clothes
1:06:07 like a cart heart shirt and like a pair
1:06:09 of dickies pants a little bit big but
1:06:12 neil puts them on and then gathers up
1:06:14 his clean clothes which he left over a
1:06:15 fence
1:06:16 and then marches down to the truck uh
1:06:19 trying like sort of struggling with this
1:06:21 somewhat blood slick tub wind just grabs
1:06:25 the tub from him
1:06:26 don't pretend don't pretend you're okay
1:06:29 right now
1:06:30 britto lingers and
1:06:32 looks to
1:06:33 the remainder of the blood that still
1:06:35 stands the ground
1:06:36 before heading off behind the two of
1:06:38 them
1:06:39 gonna do feral whispers to try and call
1:06:41 chaps her fisher cat family monster
1:06:43 comes
1:06:44 hey buddy free food the dead stuff gives
1:06:47 you like a like an indignant look when
1:06:50 you seem to presume he doesn't
1:06:52 understand exactly what you meant don't
1:06:53 give me that look you you've
1:06:55 misunderstood me before kind of accepts
1:06:58 this truth
1:07:00 and then it heads off to uh steal as
1:07:03 much as it can tell your friends the
1:07:05 suggestion seems to resonate
1:07:07 with your monstrous fisher cat
1:07:10 and when climbs into the cab puts
1:07:12 another blanket over neal angrily
1:07:14 swaddling him giant doesn't say anything
1:07:16 to neal but definitely gives him a few
1:07:18 hard stares in the rearview mirror and
1:07:20 neil in his incredible powers of
1:07:22 observation tries his best not to notice
1:07:25 and fails utterly yeah he's about to say
1:07:27 he's not very good at it he's really
1:07:29 good at noticing things there's a loud
1:07:31 rumble of the diesel engine and the
