0:00:23 [Music]
0:00:29 last time on path of nine the sheriff's
0:00:31 bully boy johnny saxon found Britta a
0:00:33 young amnesiac who was embraced against
0:00:35 her will and abandoned in the streets of
0:00:36 new haven connecticut johnny felt
0:00:38 compelled to support britta and got help
0:00:40 from his quarter-inmates miles davenport
0:00:42 and neil foster to figure out some way
0:00:44 to keep the young kindred from being
0:00:46 destroyed in accordance with the rules
0:00:47 of the camarilla elsewhere johnny's
0:00:49 quartering mate win cabot found
0:00:51 disturbing things in the woods outside
0:00:53 the city
0:00:54 to avoid having to make a deal with the
0:00:55 local nosferatu shaw the quarry planned
0:00:58 to meet with their ally sheriff earl
0:00:59 weathers
0:01:01 [Music]
0:01:08 is weather's the one
0:01:10 the tall one he's this one
0:01:13 well it seemed like miles pointing
0:01:16 directly
0:01:17 neil what do you want
0:01:18 uh
0:01:20 well i didn't wanna
0:01:22 uh johnny you wanna
0:01:23 johnny what do you want i was hoping to
0:01:25 ask a favor
0:01:27 my office
0:01:30 shoves the door open
0:01:31 it looks like kind of a small office
0:01:33 he's actually a teddy bear i promise
0:01:35 what happened to hello i know how i feel
0:01:37 about
0:01:40 what
0:01:40 don't you usually start with hello i
0:01:42 need a favor don't take social cues
0:01:44 johnny what are you waiting for let's go
0:01:45 no they're very do you want me to hang
0:01:47 out here and just kind of you're going
0:01:48 to go inside anyway last call johnny
0:01:50 everybody in let's go don't see all
0:01:52 right i was just looking for some
0:01:53 directive
0:01:55 you guys file in one at a time i'll
0:01:58 close the door a little cramped in here
0:02:00 it is a little tight in there do you
0:02:02 want to sit on my shoulders neil no okay
0:02:04 the sheriff sits down in a seat
0:02:07 lowers his face into
0:02:10 a palm
0:02:11 and looks like he's already had a little
0:02:13 bit of a long night young lake what's up
0:02:16 so
0:02:17 i'm sure you've heard plenty about the
0:02:19 situation we got going on huh yeah from
0:02:22 behind Brittain neil just points directly
0:02:24 at her did you know that uh this was the
0:02:27 situation when you sent me down to pick
0:02:28 her up no
0:02:30 as far as is that the truth
0:02:32 johnny calling me a liar whoa
0:02:34 now not helping sorry
0:02:36 no
0:02:38 point is
0:02:39 this young girl is now
0:02:41 in a big old [ __ ] storm
0:02:44 yeah and i think you know
0:02:47 why
0:02:48 i'm now in the middle of this shitstorm
0:02:50 too you got attached
0:02:53 you sheepishly kind of looks over at
0:02:54 Britta
0:02:56 sheriff weathers
0:02:58 yeah
0:03:00 you sent johnny to help me in a manner
0:03:03 of speaking
0:03:05 thank you i sent johnny to help the
0:03:06 camarilla
0:03:08 your presence here does not help the
0:03:10 camarilla i hope you understand that as
0:03:12 much as i can i need you to understand
0:03:14 that a little bit more
0:03:16 here's the score
0:03:17 our kind
0:03:19 has to remain a secret which means
0:03:22 those who are inducted
0:03:24 into
0:03:25 this circle
0:03:27 need to understand what it takes in
0:03:29 order to survive how to preserve that
0:03:31 secret
0:03:33 this secret is so important that those
0:03:35 who are not properly instructed those
0:03:37 who are
0:03:39 embraced
0:03:40 without the proper protocol followed
0:03:43 usually meet final death
0:03:46 the end
0:03:48 do you understand why
0:03:50 your presence is so dangerous can you
0:03:52 imagine what would have happened
0:03:54 if you weren't found in time how many
0:03:56 people could have been hurt
0:03:58 i'm a risk i understand that
0:04:00 but
0:04:01 you're a [ __ ] disaster
0:04:04 yeah but who's whose embrace wasn't a
0:04:07 disaster
0:04:08 neil points at miles i mean no it wasn't
0:04:10 a disaster entirely but it did come with
0:04:13 its own drama anyways but while it was a
0:04:15 disaster it wasn't necessarily your
0:04:16 fault
0:04:18 and i respect johnny for wanting to help
0:04:20 you out
0:04:21 but johnny that doesn't make for good
0:04:23 survival instincts you know that right
0:04:25 yeah
0:04:26 yeah i know that all right well
0:04:31 now that we've been through that talk
0:04:33 what what's your plan what do you need
0:04:35 for help i need some kind of leverage on
0:04:37 the prince
0:04:40 [ __ ]
0:04:40 neil happens to know a certain nosferatu
0:04:44 who's willing to trade for
0:04:46 whatever the hell he's going to trade
0:04:48 for but i told him
0:04:50 i'd rather talk to you before i go
0:04:51 crawling to shaw
0:04:53 you know what kind of survival is going
0:04:54 to take at least a boon of blood
0:04:56 okay
0:04:58 from you
0:04:59 more unless i split it
0:05:01 split it
0:05:02 you think he's gonna let her get away
0:05:04 with chump change
0:05:06 no
0:05:08 but depending on what he needs done i
0:05:10 know shaw
0:05:12 shaw's gonna use her until there's
0:05:13 nothing left
0:05:15 well
0:05:16 it wouldn't be proper to get let her
0:05:17 take the bone
0:05:19 i don't think that's how that's gonna
0:05:20 play out sean as shaw has to say
0:05:23 shaw's gonna make a play
0:05:25 to all for a boon he already has over
0:05:27 the prince he's got a handful of those
0:05:29 and he's gonna use that
0:05:31 to purchase her
0:05:33 i'm not here to be bought okay you don't
0:05:35 get to decide what you're here for
0:05:37 yeah we don't want you here to be dead
0:05:38 either
0:05:39 it might be the best option for at this
0:05:41 point i'm just trying to look out for my
0:05:42 friend
0:05:44 i know
0:05:46 what about you
0:05:47 you got any any between shows
0:05:50 i've got almost nothing left
0:05:52 they've been eating at me for months
0:05:55 bashar doesn't have a blood boon on me
0:05:59 look we might be able to talk shaw down
0:06:01 into something else
0:06:02 he's willing to he's willing to trade
0:06:04 for johnny and johnny not to you know
0:06:07 try and pull on your self-sacrifice
0:06:09 strings here but who would you rather
0:06:10 have
0:06:11 a blood boon
0:06:12 uh
0:06:13 to shaw
0:06:14 you or
0:06:15 sheriff neal can definitely soften
0:06:17 things up and we can see what we can do
0:06:19 that likes me i don't see why everybody
0:06:20 hates him that much i'm not saying he
0:06:22 doesn't or anything's wrong with sean in
0:06:24 particular i'm saying that he likes you
0:06:26 i don't be shy because
0:06:28 he's mean or nice to people i hate sean
0:06:30 because of the things he does
0:06:33 yeah okay
0:06:35 just saying
0:06:36 me too it's an option
0:06:38 all right kid it's your own life
0:06:40 i see no reason to
0:06:43 not give you at least the illusion of
0:06:45 choice
0:06:46 if you have to pick what's it gonna be
0:06:49 slavery
0:06:50 or final death
0:06:52 to put it in a slightly softer way
0:06:55 do you wanna die immediately
0:06:59 or do you wanna owe kind of um
0:07:02 perspective wise nasty guy no guy he's
0:07:05 not gonna call for a boon from someone
0:07:07 who isn't acknowledged he's gonna put
0:07:09 her under his accounting
0:07:11 [Music]
0:07:13 didn't see that one yeah you're right
0:07:15 that's fair well we can't really allow
0:07:17 that one
0:07:18 never
0:07:19 ever gonna make it into camarilla
0:07:21 society
0:07:22 if he puts her under his account
0:07:25 that's yeah i thought you said i needed
0:07:27 to be under accounting yes yes
0:07:30 but it depends on who takes you
0:07:33 i'm willing to pay the blood boon if
0:07:35 anyone well no no here's the here's the
0:07:38 other thing though we can't we can't
0:07:39 pull direct we can't pull direct threads
0:07:41 on on
0:07:43 shaw that way but there's got to be
0:07:46 somebody
0:07:48 that's a better choice
0:07:50 for accounting that
0:07:52 someone else
0:07:54 will be better that does have a string
0:07:56 to pull
0:07:57 this is and yeah that's trading favors
0:08:00 but it's my life being bought shouldn't
0:08:02 i be the one owing him the the boon
0:08:05 thing that's not no that's not an offer
0:08:07 kid you're monopoly money at this point
0:08:09 yeah it's it's more about who's gonna
0:08:13 so you know how we spent a whole year
0:08:15 better yes i was that was a safe yes
0:08:17 thank you basically until you become
0:08:19 acknowledged by the prince here you're
0:08:22 to lack better words worthless so
0:08:25 therefore getting a boon from you is not
0:08:27 worth anything to show
0:08:29 that's why he won't do it
0:08:31 but
0:08:32 if he can
0:08:33 take your accounting he basically can
0:08:35 make you a slave until
0:08:37 at such time he can present you to the
0:08:38 courty he'll never even bother
0:08:42 right
0:08:42 more than likely
0:08:44 according to sheriff weathers here he
0:08:46 will burn you out to the point where you
0:08:47 would rather take your own life well we
0:08:49 got we got two problems then we got one
0:08:51 we have to convince the prince not to
0:08:53 just
0:08:54 declare you dead but that's not the and
0:08:57 then also we got to figure out
0:09:00 how to make sure you don't wind up with
0:09:02 someone like shaw
0:09:03 now weathers i i came here because i
0:09:06 want another option than talking to shaw
0:09:08 i'm willing to do that if that's what it
0:09:10 takes
0:09:11 shaw's the only one i know that has
0:09:14 boons on the prince
0:09:17 he's angling for something and i don't
0:09:19 think
0:09:20 i don't think roland sees it Rowlands
0:09:24 the prince you don't have to worry about
0:09:25 that part your grace is fine do not
0:09:27 refer to him by name in general
0:09:30 right now but
0:09:31 the sheriff has leeway do we have any
0:09:33 idea what clan she is mildly i'm getting
0:09:36 there is there a way we can figure it
0:09:38 out faster yeah but i need a newspaper
0:09:41 which newspaper okay i don't know if
0:09:44 neil's what's correct in that fact
0:09:46 and there are other ways of finding out
0:09:48 but
0:09:49 we just see what manifests or if
0:09:51 somebody would step up and claim her
0:09:54 yeah that's not gonna happen i know
0:09:56 that's not gonna happen
0:09:57 i mean you're the one with connections
0:10:00 is there you know
0:10:02 shaw is the connection to not having a
0:10:04 principle let's just we all call to talk
0:10:06 to shaw maybe we can work something out
0:10:09 yeah what doctor elsa linden troy or
0:10:11 primogen yeah
0:10:13 she doesn't have [ __ ] on the prince
0:10:16 but she's got she might have something
0:10:17 on show yeah well that's yeah
0:10:19 yeah and she seems somewhat favorable to
0:10:21 the circumstances it's not a bad idea
0:10:25 all right here's the score guy you tell
0:10:28 elsa linden
0:10:30 that the major boon that shields me is
0:10:31 square if she can find a way to help you
0:10:33 out
0:10:34 right on
0:10:36 you got it
0:10:38 thanks boss what do you want from us
0:10:41 tell me i didn't just waste my time i'll
0:10:42 make sure you didn't waste your time
0:10:44 good luck thank you
0:10:47 don't die kid
0:10:49 i'm trying
0:10:51 regardless you can call upon us for
0:10:53 something else too
0:10:54 that's not how these things will work
0:10:56 you need extra muscle for something
0:11:00 depending on what shaw does next i might
0:11:02 need it
0:11:03 well
0:11:04 none of us particularly like shaw
0:11:06 besides neil so that could be a good
0:11:08 thing

0:11:10 kind of you're gonna do something go

0:12:01 want to borrow mine not yourself
0:12:12 johnny
0:12:13 britta
0:12:14 and miles head off to go have a
0:12:16 conversation with elsa linden
0:12:19 maybe you head over and she is on a
0:12:22 couch
0:12:24 legs crossed
0:12:26 leaning back very very comfortable with
0:12:29 a wine glass filled with an ominous dark
0:12:32 red liquid
0:12:33 and
0:12:35 gathered around her as if as if in roves
0:12:39 are kindred who are
0:12:41 listening to her regale stories about uh
0:12:45 music
0:12:46 and and uh the works that she's put
0:12:49 together and
0:12:51 a little bit of a tiff that she had back
0:12:53 in the late 1800s with her own sire and
0:12:56 members of the toreador clan regarding
0:12:58 her work and the future of the domain
0:13:01 that she once ruled over as a prince i
0:13:03 will attempt i will get eye contact and
0:13:07 basically give me a manipulation plus
0:13:08 etiquette rule when she mentions the
0:13:10 late 1800s i lean in towards Britta she's
0:13:14 not even the oldest of them
0:13:17 wait that's her life she's thinking
0:13:20 about my odds difficulty one oh she's
0:13:22 kind of a big deal i'm going to say
0:13:24 diff7 okay that is a wash whether it's
0:13:27 that she didn't notice you or simply
0:13:29 chooses to not acknowledge your presence
0:13:32 she simply continues with the story the
0:13:34 group of you kind of noticed that you
0:13:36 feel
0:13:37 and drawn to her beautiful story there
0:13:39 is there is power to her words i will
0:13:42 wait for the end of a story and clear my
0:13:44 throat
0:13:45 she eventually after 20 minutes or so of
0:13:49 of her going on and on and on about all
0:13:51 of the things that she loves
0:13:53 she finishes her class
0:13:55 and then without even looking at the
0:13:58 individual that is attending to her she
0:13:59 hands off her glass and waits for the
0:14:02 next one and now you may roll again the
0:14:04 difficulty goes up by one because you
0:14:06 failed the wall so yeah i did eight
0:14:10 three all right
0:14:13 miles
0:14:14 how long have you been there
0:14:16 i was enjoying the story also of course
0:14:18 but we come to talk business business is
0:14:20 always
0:14:22 he goes on and on about business
0:14:25 what is your business
0:14:26 i don't think we've met
0:14:29 it would be great if we could
0:14:30 talk without a crowd

0:14:42 well i um
0:14:44 the grammar of her jewelry is utterly
0:14:47 captivating i need another self-control
0:14:49 check

0:14:53 uh what is this again self-control yes
0:14:58 lyndon is dangerous uh two successes
0:15:02 with
0:15:03 two successes you managed to resist the
0:15:05 call
0:15:07 of of the diamonds that that glisten
0:15:10 along her fingers
0:15:12 i i look to her jewelry and everything
0:15:15 that she's wearing for a moment and i
0:15:17 managed to pull myself away
0:15:19 and incredible isn't it
0:15:22 yes
0:15:24 um
0:15:26 it's really
0:15:27 beautiful
0:15:30 um
0:15:32 mess
0:15:34 a little orchid you are in far over your
0:15:37 head miles let's hear the business
0:15:41 weather says that
0:15:43 the major boon you owe him
0:15:45 will go away
0:15:46 if you can help us sort out her
0:15:48 situation without
0:15:50 the center miles The Ventrue to tell me
0:15:52 that message no no you actually sent me
0:15:57 i see but i figured you might like
0:15:59 hearing it from miles rather than from
0:16:01 me why did you think i would like
0:16:02 hearing this all right so
0:16:06 as i understand it
0:16:08 you might know johnny johnny johnny i
0:16:11 please
0:16:13 you have already been too presumptuous
0:16:15 miles tell me what's going on
0:16:18 johnny's jaw tenses and he kind of just
0:16:21 stares at the ground finch just clenched
0:16:23 you know someone that has enough pull
0:16:25 with the prince to make sure that she
0:16:26 doesn't end up dead by the end of the
0:16:28 night
0:16:29 yes of course
0:16:30 so
0:16:31 weathers
0:16:32 makes your bone go away if you
0:16:35 make sure the situation goes favorably
0:16:39 uh
0:16:40 just find favorably
0:16:42 a quick death
0:16:44 painless
0:16:46 no
0:16:47 she gets an accounting would not show
0:16:50 and accounting not with shaw correct oh
0:16:52 my god kushal would do that wouldn't he
0:16:55 i see people
0:16:57 listen to you it seems
0:16:59 for good reason
0:17:00 your story was beautiful
0:17:04 maybe you could help me child it's going
0:17:06 to take more than getting people to
0:17:08 listen to you
0:17:10 shaw is
0:17:13 a political powerhouse
0:17:15 he has acquired a great many boons over
0:17:17 various kindred within the domain
0:17:20 but
0:17:22 shaw didn't reach that point
0:17:25 without putting skeletons in his closet
0:17:29 noticing
0:17:31 there's moves on the board
0:17:33 i've made a point to
0:17:36 garner some details
0:17:37 about his skeletons
0:17:40 shaw is going to laugh at you
0:17:43 if you approach him
0:17:45 and then he's going to green you of
0:17:47 everything you've got
0:17:49 and then he's going to kill her anyways
0:17:50 you know that so will you almost
0:17:55 weathers needs this if he called in that
0:17:56 boom
0:17:59 i don't know what he needs her for but
0:18:01 i'll help
0:18:04 as best i can
0:18:05 thank you
0:18:07 she seems to focus for a moment
0:18:12 you can sense a static between the two
0:18:14 of you
0:18:15 the moment passes and
0:18:17 she
0:18:18 receives her next glass
0:18:20 from the individual that's attending her
0:18:23 and she stands up and as if that's some
0:18:25 sort of social cue
0:18:27 everyone moves away from her giving her
0:18:29 space to casually slaunter away from the
0:18:31 couch that she had occupied
0:18:34 and she wanders back to that balcony
0:18:37 that you had seen her on earlier in the
0:18:39 night
0:18:40 did she indicate that she wanted us to
0:18:41 follow her no she does not but she goes
0:18:44 off alone to the balcony
0:18:46 and everyone else seems to excuse
0:18:48 themselves away from it but insane
0:18:50 accused we will wait here are you
0:18:52 sure

0:19:27 conversation is done or i swear i'll
0:19:28 kill you of course good
0:19:30 shaw has been having meetings with
0:19:32 individuals outside of the domain
0:19:35 it seems that he has been quietly
0:19:37 investigating into the actions of the
0:19:39 zantosa family i has gone to great
0:19:42 lengths to make sure that no one else
0:19:43 pursues this matter delete my phone
0:19:45 number understand i understand
0:19:47 completely thank you click
0:19:48 i will delete his phone number
0:19:54 [Music]
0:19:57 kneel yes you step outside yep uh it's
0:20:00 pretty easy to get your hands underneath
0:20:02 yeah i just i pop a couple of quarters
0:20:03 into a box and now you're doing that
0:20:05 thing i think you're doing yep
0:20:07 all right we're gonna go do it because
0:20:09 you don't want to do it on the sidewalk
0:20:10 nope i sure don't i'm gonna keep an eye
0:20:12 on him from the door i'm gonna just step
0:20:15 into an alleyway that has
0:20:17 that has enough light that i can read
0:20:19 and see the sky when are you going with
0:20:21 him i'm keeping a respectful distance to
0:20:23 make sure nobody jumps in while he's
0:20:25 going to do that and as soon as i walk
0:20:26 around a corner and i'm out of eyesight
0:20:28 i'm just going to sit down next to a
0:20:30 dumpster
0:20:31 pop it open
0:20:33 and fade out of sight
0:20:35 okay uh when you post up at the end of
0:20:39 the alley
0:20:40 and
0:20:41 neil you start doing your thing i do uh
0:20:44 why don't you go ahead and give me a
0:20:45 dice roll i will do that
0:20:49 how many successes is that two two
0:20:51 successes uh i flip through and look at
0:20:54 the horoscopes for today
0:20:56 and sort of try and look at the sky
0:20:58 uh
0:20:59 like 10 15 minutes pass
0:21:03 with him just sitting next to a dumpster
0:21:06 invisible and looking at a newspaper
0:21:09 what two things would you like to learn
0:21:10 about her hey i believe it's unspecified
0:21:13 you just sort of let's start with
0:21:16 uh
0:21:17 british nature um
0:21:20 perfectionist
0:21:22 and then either if i can get
0:21:25 so i know it's not specifically about
0:21:27 what has happened in the past it's not
0:21:29 illuminating but
0:21:30 uh it can give you
0:21:32 avenues to pursue
0:21:34 ideas so something related to
0:21:37 clan or trauma or where she comes from
0:21:39 would be great but again i don't get to
0:21:41 ask specifics it's just sort of a
0:21:43 generalized
0:21:45 so that's nature and then one of them
0:21:48 the other thing that you get
0:21:51 reading our horoscope
0:21:54 is
0:21:55 her shaking hands with an individual
0:21:58 and
0:21:59 signing off
0:22:01 on
0:22:02 a property
0:22:05 you can definitely get the impression
0:22:06 that it's it's a it's a deed and there
0:22:08 are lawyers there and
0:22:10 it looks like she has uh made some sort
0:22:12 of purchase that is very very important
0:22:15 to this young woman
0:22:16 all right and you have an address
0:22:19 i will
0:22:20 flip to the real estate section of the
0:22:22 paper and just start circling numbers
0:22:24 and letters until i got this dress down
0:22:26 and there's a location on the rack okay
0:22:29 and you know that it is a cafe that
0:22:31 closed down four months ago
0:22:34 all right
0:22:35 uh the property doesn't have a business
0:22:37 open now interesting so after
0:22:40 thumbing through the paper and sort of
0:22:43 checking the the horoscope signs in the
0:22:45 paper like kind of
0:22:47 trying to put my hand over the comics so
0:22:50 i don't break my concentrations just
0:22:51 start
0:22:52 reading family circus i uh
0:22:55 checked the position of the stars
0:22:56 against
0:22:58 where
0:22:58 it seems that the clouds that had
0:23:02 brought snow parted over the course of
0:23:04 the past hour or two
0:23:06 and
0:23:06 you can actually see the glow of the
0:23:08 moon and the stars
0:23:10 and they
0:23:12 you definitely get the impression that
0:23:15 that her her destiny her past
0:23:18 all of it is written rather clearly
0:23:20 amongst them so if you can just look and
0:23:22 focus well enough
0:23:24 you can get the details you're looking
0:23:25 for
0:23:26 i wish i knew how to do that
0:23:29 but you're getting in my way
0:23:31 sort of look at the moon i kind of glare
0:23:34 a little bit
0:23:36 and then
0:23:37 flip the paper
0:23:38 fold it up
0:23:39 roll it up and
0:23:41 put it in my pocket
0:23:42 and then
0:23:44 suddenly appear right next to winnie so
0:23:46 i misread the sheet it is nature uh the
0:23:50 visionary visionary visionary okay
0:23:52 gotcha
0:23:53 so uh
0:23:56 what do you yeah wrong person ask what
0:23:58 do you know about real estate deals
0:24:02 um it's a shitty market
0:24:06 is it yeah i don't know this bubbling
0:24:08 i'm also comparing it to the 1940s so
0:24:11 fair enough i guess i haven't bought
0:24:14 property in my lifetime
0:24:16 uh
0:24:17 okay
0:24:20 mile's probably the right guy to ask
0:24:21 about this miles is probably the right
0:24:22 guy to ask
0:24:23 did you
0:24:25 so i'm assuming you found some
0:24:26 information there yeah look at this
0:24:27 she's a capricorn that tells you so much
0:24:30 jesus jones
0:24:32 what
0:24:34 it's fascinating yeah yeah super fast
0:24:36 ray is one of her colors she should be
0:24:38 watching out for injuries to her knees
0:24:40 coming into the future
0:24:43 there's a lot we could unpack with what
0:24:44 you've told me here not going to be
0:24:46 really good in any relationships with an
0:24:48 aries so you like you got to be careful
0:24:50 with that yeah i'm not an aries that's i
0:24:52 don't i don't know i don't know when are
0:24:54 you embraced it doesn't matter this is
0:24:55 irrelevant right now
0:24:57 i'm going to get sidetracked yeah i know
0:24:59 i've met you so we should just uh
0:25:02 head back inside yeah okay yeah and i'll
0:25:04 see why not kind of
0:25:06 brush it off
0:25:08 do i smell
0:25:09 i'll sit next to the doc i smell way
0:25:10 worse
0:25:12 really answer my question i'm gonna stop
0:25:14 at the bathroom
0:25:15 i love the thing that you guys looks
0:25:17 like

0:25:29 you don't care no okay i don't
0:25:31 right
0:25:32 oh yeah i checked myself but you know
0:25:35 yeah i feel like your own brand is kind
0:25:36 of it doesn't matter you get immune to
0:25:38 your own brand yeah
0:25:40 i just really hope my own brand is not
0:25:41 garbage
0:25:42 uh it is not currently garbage it is
0:25:45 garbage adjacent
0:25:47 we're like walking talking as we're
0:25:48 doing this actually i think i'm gonna go
0:25:50 into the bathroom first i'm just gonna
0:25:52 this place is really nice they they have
0:25:54 to have one of those like you know how
0:25:55 they have a basket that has a cologne
0:25:57 and stuff in it if they don't have that
0:25:59 potpourri we'll do the trick yeah okay
0:26:01 that's that's really yeah i think i'm
0:26:02 gonna move back to the crowd the door
0:26:04 swings open as the two of you are on
0:26:07 your way in
0:26:08 wind pantomiming rubbing under her
0:26:10 armpit and
0:26:11 yeah
0:26:13 neil
0:26:14 premanger nix
0:26:16 goes walking by
0:26:18 accompanied by mr dashwood
0:26:21 and you start getting all the wrong
0:26:24 anxious feeling this trust
0:26:26 by being within 10 feet of her head

0:27:01 okay i'm going to stick around i'll

0:27:23 oh i feel hot is it a good evening miss
0:27:25 win
0:27:26 i saw what you did there to send a show
0:27:30 Reiss
0:27:31 is a very dangerous individual i'm aware
0:27:35 thank you though
0:27:37 i was very brave of you
0:27:41 brave and or stupid probably both
0:27:44 probably suffice to say it was worth it
0:27:46 to me
0:27:47 a word of advice
0:27:49 if you possess your gifts
0:27:52 do not squander it
0:27:53 understood he turns and goes walking
0:27:57 away uh accompanied um or rather
0:28:00 accompanying primogenics who
0:28:04 simply wanders off into the night
0:28:07 after they get about a block away neil
0:28:10 starts to calm down uh what were we
0:28:12 talking about
0:28:15 [Music]
0:28:18 the group of you uh are
0:28:21 waiting back on the couches elsa linden
0:28:24 uh
0:28:25 eventually meanders her way back in she
0:28:28 makes physical contact with you brother
0:28:31 and while a little cold to the touch
0:28:33 there's something comforting
0:28:35 about her presence
0:28:37 and
0:28:38 she then moves on
0:28:40 that's when you see two individuals uh
0:28:43 fresh from their conversation beside a
0:28:45 dumpster
0:28:46 wander
0:28:47 into the elysium and the five of you are
0:28:50 again gathered perfect timing yeah
0:28:54 how'd it go
0:28:55 well
0:28:56 we talked to lyndon and
0:28:58 she uh
0:28:59 got someone to give us a phone call
0:29:02 when holds up a finger
0:29:04 do we maybe want to take this somewhere
0:29:06 i mean to a certain degree but we should
0:29:08 find shah lauren yeah
0:29:10 right
0:29:11 we should do that now okay um
0:29:13 so
0:29:14 suffice it to say that
0:29:16 we've been provided information enough
0:29:18 to
0:29:19 hopefully leverage
0:29:21 great um that what do you know about
0:29:23 property deals where
0:29:25 over in the wreck for who
0:29:28 her
0:29:29 me
0:29:30 career yeah you're a property owner i
0:29:32 don't remember myself i mean in theory
0:29:33 you are
0:29:36 it depends the iraq is a pretty decent
0:29:38 place property there is
0:29:40 worth a decent amount of money and such
0:29:42 as even for non-kindred old cafe closed
0:29:46 a couple of months ago there's some real
0:29:48 estate deals in the paper and stuff plus
0:29:50 she's a capricorn are we really talking
0:29:52 about real estate right now do you
0:29:53 wonder where she comes from or not he's
0:29:55 had insights before
0:29:57 fine
0:29:58 but it doesn't have to this is tomorrow
0:29:59 night thing i just want to make sure
0:30:00 that this is yes i do know something or
0:30:03 i can find something out okay
0:30:05 how about miles tells us about what he
0:30:06 actually learned on the phone call well
0:30:08 we probably cannot talk about that here
0:30:11 hence yeah suggestion right but we need
0:30:13 to move towards shaw and basically
0:30:16 okay well then let's let's have a
0:30:17 conversation
0:30:18 right do you know where he is
0:30:20 i look around
0:30:22 he's got to be under a mask but does he
0:30:24 does he usually use the same one there's
0:30:26 a space shaw usually likes to hang out
0:30:30 in
0:30:31 and
0:30:32 there's a location doesn't really have
0:30:34 very much in the way of exhibits uh but
0:30:37 there's a lot of tables and he tends to
0:30:39 have a little bit of a following with
0:30:41 him where he goes kind of like elsa
0:30:43 linden but it's usually the more rowdy
0:30:46 crowd that's drawn to him
0:30:48 here's another good question is fester
0:30:50 hanging out nearby because he's probably
0:30:52 gonna be in your shaw you definitely see
0:30:54 fester skulking about
0:30:56 he seems to be paying close attention to
0:30:59 all the little conversations happening
0:31:00 around him but seemingly minding his own
0:31:02 business you know better yeah there's
0:31:04 fester which means the circle
0:31:07 the epicenter of that little chaos
0:31:08 circle there that's
0:31:10 that's our man that's sure we're gonna
0:31:12 have to trust me with this so that we're
0:31:13 not talking about it there so we get
0:31:14 there for the conversation
0:31:16 and i will
0:31:18 use the leverage at the appropriate time
0:31:20 so just as a general thing if we're
0:31:21 gonna go talk to shaw uh do you guys
0:31:23 know the reason that he likes me
0:31:25 but you're probably gonna leave this off
0:31:27 i don't flinch when i talk to him okay
0:31:30 just uh
0:31:31 it's a it's it's sort of a mutual
0:31:32 respect thing don't
0:31:34 don't flinch when you look at him
0:31:36 why would you
0:31:37 flinch
0:31:38 reasons not everybody uh uh not
0:31:41 everybody is blessed with the
0:31:43 a nice looking face sometimes the
0:31:45 turning does things to people
0:31:47 uh but if we're lucky
0:31:50 he will you know
0:31:52 keep his party face on but in case he
0:31:54 drops it
0:31:55 then suddenly you uh
0:31:57 you're looking at the boogeyman
0:32:00 don't flinch
0:32:01 the turning does things your appearance
0:32:04 like it made
0:32:06 like it made elsa and everything she was
0:32:08 wearing
0:32:09 so
0:32:10 beautiful no i think that's just her
0:32:11 we're going to start walking over i mean
0:32:13 the turning had some influence up on it
0:32:14 but that's a tomorrow night thing
0:32:16 ah some folks actually look like
0:32:19 monsters refreshingly honest if you ask
0:32:21 me
0:32:22 just figure best your heads over to you
0:32:24 guys hey buddy hey
0:32:26 um what are you guys doing
0:32:30 you know that thing
0:32:32 there's a rumor going around something
0:32:34 about a phone call somebody mentioned a
0:32:36 phone call somebody got a phone call
0:32:38 oh we need to talk to xiaomi
0:32:40 [ __ ] uh
0:32:42 yeah okay

0:32:48 show alone but i can i can definitely uh

0:33:12 vicious
0:33:13 thugs
0:33:14 a lot of the rest of the elysium uh it's
0:33:16 people kind of like dress very very nice
0:33:19 very dapper they tend to be soft-spoken
0:33:22 while they communicate with each other
0:33:23 whispering and smiling and and it's all
0:33:26 very seductive and alluring over here
0:33:28 it's not
0:33:29 over here it's a lot of strong jawed
0:33:32 mean looking individuals a lot of
0:33:34 obviously kind of a little like johnny
0:33:37 johnny you recognize a handful of your
0:33:38 clan mates here all gathered and and
0:33:43 very happy
0:33:44 to stand in the shadow of an individual
0:33:47 who is
0:33:49 not like
0:33:51 any of the others you've met so far
0:33:53 he
0:33:54 he doesn't look human kind of
0:33:56 comfortable sitting in the shadow
0:33:58 smoking inside and completely irreverent
0:34:02 of his surroundings is an individual in
0:34:04 a pink striped suit it's got a nice
0:34:06 color you can you can smell the scent of
0:34:08 like cigarettes cigars whiskey coming
0:34:11 from them
0:34:12 but his skin looks like it's charred
0:34:16 almost black there's entire sections
0:34:19 where you can kind of see the tendons
0:34:20 that move and allow for him to speak
0:34:24 and he looks up from his seat and smiles
0:34:27 at you with rows of teeth akin to that
0:34:29 of a shark
0:34:30 what are you on time
0:34:33 hi uh

0:34:49 this is britta come closer Britta nods
0:34:52 and she kind of she she unconsciously
0:34:55 wraps her kind of arm around herself but
0:34:58 it's gonna need to be along them
0:35:00 i'm like a town hero he's gonna do a
0:35:03 jump scare
0:35:04 she comes closer as he asks all right no
0:35:07 jump scares oh i like you fredo you're a
0:35:10 shot oh
0:35:12 it's terrible what happened to that girl
0:35:14 in that alley though
0:35:15 she didn't deserve that no
0:35:18 no she doesn't
0:35:19 but who does
0:35:21 but this does mean you've got a taste
0:35:23 for a kid
0:35:24 a taste for it unlike once you kill it's
0:35:26 only a matter of time before it happens
0:35:28 again
0:35:29 but that's okay
0:35:30 there's a place in our society for those
0:35:32 who do the killing
0:35:34 and i think you're gonna fit right in
0:35:37 ain't that right johnny
0:35:39 he's gonna fit right in you got some
0:35:41 interesting opinions shaw
0:35:43 how about you keep them to yourself it's
0:35:44 wisdom
0:35:46 young lick
0:35:47 you can benefit from it too that's what
0:35:50 we're here to talk about
0:35:51 her making it to tomorrow
0:35:53 you're making well
0:35:55 i love to help
0:35:57 but
0:35:58 you know how this society works
0:36:01 i scratch your back you scratch mine so
0:36:04 what are you looking for
0:36:07 there isn't very much i need
0:36:09 but my boys here
0:36:13 you know
0:36:15 they need friends too
0:36:17 and
0:36:19 you seem like a sweet girl
0:36:21 Britta is uh making
0:36:24 eye contact uh she's very doggedly like
0:36:28 not looking away and maintaining as much
0:36:30 of a straight face as well courage real
0:36:32 courage yeah yeah
0:36:34 and we'll call that a diff eat you or
0:36:36 this is the first time you're in the
0:36:37 presence of a nosferatu oh no i agree
0:36:40 i've been holding these sites
0:36:45 one success you managed to meet his his
0:36:49 pale yellow eyes
0:36:52 you fit right in if i can make it to
0:36:55 tomorrow
0:36:56 yes
0:36:57 that's true
0:36:59 his grace is uh
0:37:01 finicky when it comes to unknowns
0:37:04 they frighten him
0:37:05 he's afraid of shadows you know
0:37:09 unlife can be difficult mr Rowlands has
0:37:12 been through quite a bit
0:37:13 that's true but ever since the father's
0:37:16 a set became riled up
0:37:19 everything's dangerous these days huh
0:37:24 well miles uh
0:37:26 yes i would love to bet on you but that
0:37:28 doesn't seem to have done the prince any
0:37:30 good
0:37:31 so
0:37:32 why should i
0:37:33 mainly because
0:37:35 of your talks much i have lots of talks
0:37:38 talking to people outside the domain
0:37:41 your investigations
0:37:42 the hell are you talking about you know
0:37:44 what i'm talking about
0:37:46 do you want me to keep going
0:37:47 or do you want to make this more private
0:37:51 i am so intrigued your willingness to
0:37:54 play the jihad all right let's let's
0:37:56 play
0:37:58 emotions to some of the other guys
0:38:00 go for a walk
0:38:02 go find johnny's balls
0:38:03 and they kind of like nod and like
0:38:05 snicker
0:38:06 one of them gives like a light shoulder
0:38:08 bump to johnny doesn't quite push
0:38:10 johnny's shoulders as much as the guy
0:38:12 thought he was gonna but uh kind of
0:38:13 plays it off and keeps walking let's
0:38:15 hear him miles so here's this
0:38:18 you can make
0:38:20 her lip but
0:38:22 not under your accounting under who's
0:38:25 that who's gonna teach her about on life
0:38:28 show her the ropes if nobody else will i
0:38:30 will
0:38:33 i see
0:38:34 the miles here isn't exactly a paragon
0:38:36 of good decisions
0:38:38 he's drawn the eye of an entire clan
0:38:41 of very dangerous individuals if you go
0:38:44 with him they're gonna use you as a
0:38:46 means of getting to him
0:38:49 you don't want to get wrapped up in all
0:38:50 of that so soon miles what are you doing
0:38:52 to the kid some things are more
0:38:54 preferable than others
0:38:56 i mean you just did place
0:38:58 her in the circle of your friends
0:39:01 they're a good circle of friends most of
0:39:03 them are johnny's clan mates regardless
0:39:05 that's what we're offering you haven't
0:39:07 offered anything are you saying that
0:39:10 this hypothetical investigation these
0:39:12 hypothetical conversations with people
0:39:14 outside the domain that's going to go
0:39:16 away
0:39:17 is that what you're saying to me right
0:39:18 now miles it won't come to light and i
0:39:20 got you
0:39:22 your trust on that
0:39:24 you promising me
0:39:25 of course
0:39:27 all right
0:39:29 i tell you what
0:39:32 you mind your own [ __ ] business on
0:39:34 that subject
0:39:36 and you stay out of it
0:39:37 and i mean you stay
0:39:40 way the [ __ ] out of it
0:39:43 and maybe
0:39:45 maybe
0:39:48 i don't feed your friend ready here to
0:39:50 my [ __ ] gators
0:39:54 you understand me is that an agreement
0:39:56 to what i was saying or are you just
0:39:57 being threatened it's an agreement to
0:39:58 what you were saying miles okay i wanted
0:40:01 to be clear we're crystal clear
0:40:04 but i gotta warn you
0:40:06 the blackmail game
0:40:08 that's not a game you walk away from
0:40:11 you're in it now
0:40:13 you get me
0:40:14 i understand
0:40:17 i hope your quarterly understands
0:40:20 because if you're in there that's up to
0:40:22 them at this point no it's not
0:40:25 you made the move miles they're in
0:40:28 that's the [ __ ] point of what i'm
0:40:29 saying to you i guess
0:40:31 well britta
0:40:33 it's unfortunate that you'll be
0:40:36 wasting your nights with this schmuck
0:40:39 however many you get before the settings
0:40:41 kill you
0:40:42 but
0:40:44 a deal's a deal
0:40:46 i'll be making sure you're under his
0:40:48 account
0:40:49 britta holding to her courage
0:40:52 and
0:40:53 somewhat of a poker face
0:40:56 uh but holding to it maintains the same
0:40:59 eye contact that she's had the whole
0:41:01 time and
0:41:03 nods
0:41:04 a little too sharply maybe
0:41:06 oh one more thing Brittain yes
0:41:09 should we me and you
0:41:11 you and your pal shaw
0:41:16 who made that phone call
0:41:17 no
0:41:18 you i didn't bring this girl over here
0:41:20 so you could get into her face
0:41:22 i brought her over here so that you were
0:41:25 very clear about who you were talking
0:41:26 about johnny now that you've made a deal
0:41:28 with mine he's only begun to understand
0:41:31 who's you got plenty of [ __ ] teeth
0:41:32 for me to knock out johnny
0:41:36 you know how this goes i might just make
0:41:38 myself a necklace johnny happy birthday
0:41:40 you can wear the source huh am i right
0:41:45 johnny come on
0:41:46 i want to answer the question
0:41:49 you're the one who said i'm in this
0:41:51 right yeah i did if i'm going to be
0:41:54 under this accounting well i'm in it too
0:41:57 so what's the answer that i'm not going
0:41:59 to answer
0:42:01 welcome to the game kid you know like i
0:42:04 think you're gonna have a little bit of
0:42:05 fun maybe
0:42:06 maybe not for a long time but a little
0:42:08 bit of fun this grace will be calling
0:42:10 court soon
0:42:12 i'm going to make some arrangements
0:42:15 as long as she
0:42:17 doesn't completely [ __ ] up the
0:42:19 conversation with his grace
0:42:21 she'll be ready
0:42:24 as long as she doesn't completely [ __ ]
0:42:26 up
0:42:28 she'll be under your accounting miles
0:42:30 sounds like we have a deal we have a
0:42:31 deal go doing business with you shaw
0:42:34 sam
0:42:35 i look forward to the next time
0:42:38 hopefully not for a while i'll just walk
0:42:40 away should we just enjoy as everybody's
0:42:42 starting to walk away i'm going to lean
0:42:44 up just sort of across the table on this
0:42:45 point hey sean thanks for taking the
0:42:47 time man thanks for always good to see
0:42:49 you really appreciate it it's a good
0:42:50 time yeah no it's everybody's learning
0:42:52 right everybody's learning
0:42:54 once they're walking away win turns to
0:42:57 uh Britta and kind of gives her a wink
0:42:59 like
0:43:00 you did good
0:43:02 as soon as they're out of like right
0:43:04 what what Britta thinks is range
0:43:09 her range is probably her understanding
0:43:10 of what range is is a little off between
0:43:13 not understanding what she is but also
0:43:15 her aspects she might land a square on
0:43:17 the middle
0:43:18 just
0:43:20 hey that was good you didn't flinch
0:43:23 i didn't flinch
0:43:25 good that's the same thing you kind of
0:43:26 need to remember with the prince too
0:43:28 um he doesn't have as many teeth and
0:43:31 okay
0:43:32 well same amount they just look
0:43:33 different okay anyways sorry i've
0:43:35 counted
0:43:36 so
0:43:37 this is not my surprised face neil
0:43:40 the next and possibly last thing we have
0:43:42 to do
0:43:44 is you will
0:43:45 be going up to the prince no no the next
0:43:46 thing we have to do if we have to go out
0:43:47 and have a cigarette because my blood is
0:43:49 up and i am ready to just hit something
0:43:51 so you're all coming with me while i go
0:43:53 outside let's go johnny storms off smoke
0:43:55 break Brittain follows johnny immediately
0:43:58 okay remember not to stray too far you
0:44:00 guys head outside and there's a group of
0:44:02 kindred gathered underneath the balcony
0:44:04 smoking clothes
0:44:10 the true villains of the campaign
0:44:12 yeah thank you thank you for
0:44:17 it seemed like he wanted to egg you on
0:44:18 though don't thank me yet oh no he did
0:44:21 thanking me is part of tomorrow night's
0:44:23 conversation
0:44:25 man we're deferring a lot to tomorrow
0:44:27 huh it's gonna be a big day
0:44:29 look i can understand deferring some of
0:44:31 the things that i don't understand
0:44:32 tomorrow that makes sense
0:44:34 i recognize i've got way too many
0:44:36 questions to answer but
0:44:39 out of all the things that i can say
0:44:42 maybe i won't have a chance to say thank
0:44:44 you so
0:44:45 so thank you all
