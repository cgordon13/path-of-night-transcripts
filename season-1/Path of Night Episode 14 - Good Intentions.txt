0:00:00 path of night is an actual play vampire
0:00:02 the masquerade podcast set in the
0:00:03 classic world of darkness we're all
0:00:05 friends we're here to have fun but our
0:00:07 story can include graphic violence drug
0:00:09 use sexual content and other mature
0:00:11 themes we've talked at our table about
0:00:13 safety comfort and consent both as
0:00:15 players and storytellers we know what to
0:00:17 expect we're all excited to be here and
0:00:18 we want you to feel the same so listener
0:00:20 discretion is advice
0:00:22 now let's walk the path of night
0:00:24 last time on path of night miles opened
0:00:27 the weapons container that clan ventrue
0:00:29 bought from the followers of scent
0:00:30 finding enough specialized gear to fund
0:00:32 a massive war effort into new haven
0:00:34 outfitted with new gear the quarterly
0:00:35 headed to an abandoned warehouse to set
0:00:37 their trap in a fury of dragons breath
0:00:40 rounds sniper fire claws and matte black
0:00:42 axes the quarter he put down all but one
0:00:44 of the settings but the intel done to
0:00:46 miles brought out The Ventrue's darker
0:00:48 nature and he claimed the last kindred's
0:00:50 arm as punishment while johnny felt
0:00:52 dismay at the rest of his quartering
0:00:54 falling closer to their bestial natures
0:00:56 miles got a call from sheriff weathers
0:00:58 telling them shaw pulled in favors to
0:01:00 keep them away from the zentos case
0:01:02 despite this warning the quartering now
0:01:04 heads out into the snowy night towards
0:01:06 the home of vito santosa
0:01:08 [Music]
0:01:10 after the phone call the group of you
0:01:12 get into uh actually uh miles what what
0:01:15 are you guys getting into to head for
0:01:16 the uh that is the trail our uh modified
0:01:19 chevy blazer all right so the group of
0:01:20 you climb into the blazer close the
0:01:22 doors start to buckle up
0:01:24 and
0:01:25 it starts to become clear that you're
0:01:27 moving in towards the end game snow is
0:01:29 coming down it's cold
0:01:31 the movies are looking amongst each
0:01:33 other we brought those vials right
0:01:35 yeah they're in the uh they're in the
0:01:37 back well in the i mean it's not a trunk
0:01:39 and a blazer but
0:01:40 whatever that trunk space is yeah all
0:01:43 right i'd still call it a trunk
0:01:45 even though it's open yeah why not like
0:01:47 cargo space this one's yeah i like that
0:01:49 yeah this is a closed cab
0:01:51 yeah even with a closed cab yeah it's
0:01:53 got a modified bench so the point is
0:01:56 i if we're gonna roll in on santosa i
0:01:58 need to eat uh
0:02:00 yeah i am
0:02:02 i mean i could be good but i'm really
0:02:04 hungry we don't have time to eat based
0:02:07 on the phone call i just got i don't
0:02:09 think we had a choice
0:02:11 if we roll in there in the state we're
0:02:13 in
0:02:14 i think we're just going to get picked
0:02:15 apart yeah i mean we don't have the
0:02:17 hours but that was successful hunting
0:02:19 would do so we could crack those jars
0:02:21 open yeah i i as much as i would like to
0:02:24 hold on to them for a rainy day i think
0:02:25 it's about to pour i'm
0:02:27 not sure if i can eat from those why not
0:02:30 so i mean it's not that big a deal miles
0:02:32 blank unless it's kindred vitae in there
0:02:34 like we'll be fine no i think i know
0:02:37 what he means
0:02:38 so it is
0:02:39 adventure
0:02:41 flaw
0:02:42 that we can only eat from specific
0:02:45 individuals
0:02:47 i'm sure the jars aren't that gross i
0:02:49 mean we can try them first
0:02:51 gross thing it is a literal
0:02:54 food receive no sus no
0:02:57 it will do nothing for me
0:02:59 i will not
0:03:01 retain the power of the blood i will not
0:03:04 it will not calm the beast it will do
0:03:06 nothing it will be a waste
0:03:07 and
0:03:09 in the end it would be not good so what
0:03:11 do we have to do just
0:03:13 call these people that
0:03:15 these like select people you have to
0:03:16 feed off of
0:03:17 yes i
0:03:19 specifically need to feed off musicians
0:03:22 well we could just
0:03:24 play the radio or something right
0:03:27 yeah that would work
0:03:28 no kid i don't know i don't think you're
0:03:30 getting this i mean don't think i'm
0:03:32 getting this either why is it specific
0:03:34 people
0:03:35 it's almost metaphysical or it could be
0:03:38 a
0:03:38 mental block it's unsure but at the
0:03:40 creation of a ventrue
0:03:43 they become limited in what and who they
0:03:46 can feed off of what if we
0:03:49 grab a secondhand guitar and press it
0:03:51 into somebody's hands it's not that way
0:03:53 okay i just i'm trying it's
0:03:56 it's weird it is a combination of my own
0:03:58 perception and the perception of the
0:04:00 individual
0:04:01 so which is where the metaphysical part
0:04:03 comes into it okay so what if we stop by
0:04:06 like a drag show or something like that
0:04:08 while we chow down on the coolers you go
0:04:10 inside we're not gonna find a drag show
0:04:12 tonight with the weather like it is well
0:04:14 it doesn't have to be specifically a
0:04:15 drag show that was just the first
0:04:17 musical thing that came to mind
0:04:19 and that's are they an artist or a
0:04:21 musician the sometimes it gets
0:04:23 how specific does this go
0:04:26 i've vetted the individuals but usually
0:04:29 i try to get specific people who
0:04:31 consider themselves musicians it's also
0:04:33 the business ideal in and the context
0:04:35 that i have this is kind of the thing
0:04:37 that i've been doing for a while and
0:04:39 this is also not a well-known thing how
0:04:41 low is your tank
0:04:43 under half i mean there's a
0:04:47 it's a bad idea and i
0:04:49 think we should all immediately say no
0:04:51 but in if we're talking about putting
0:04:53 stuff on the table in an emergency you
0:04:54 could feed off of one of us and we could
0:04:56 feel the blood
0:04:58 right i had a similar i dick around with
0:05:00 guitar sometimes no
0:05:03 i for various reasons i know it's a bad
0:05:06 idea i'm just saying if we're not
0:05:08 emergency you don't even have to touch
0:05:10 me i think no means no in this case okay
0:05:13 i just move along and miles does it do
0:05:16 you need to taste each of these to know
0:05:18 if you can drink it i would need to
0:05:20 taste each individual one and i'm i mean
0:05:24 this seems like a backup for those
0:05:25 settings
0:05:26 so i feel like they're
0:05:28 somewhat safe but i'm also not really
0:05:31 familiar with the psyduck magic that's
0:05:32 behind these no neither am i but um well
0:05:35 toss me one of them it same here oh
0:05:39 i mean it's a dangerous game wind crawls
0:05:41 over the seat into the back what's that
0:05:43 where the jars are when
0:05:45 what like i'm going to die in a car
0:05:46 accident okay why don't we wait till we
0:05:48 pull over we can gear up and drink it at
0:05:50 the time we'll get closer to the
0:05:52 location we need to where we go by foot
0:05:54 because we're not gonna just drive up to
0:05:55 the estate we could all succeed we could
0:05:57 also stop at a gas station somewhere
0:05:59 along the way you can try and see if uh
0:06:02 if maybe there's not too many people
0:06:03 there especially weather like this so
0:06:05 maybe we can supplement these with uh
0:06:07 whoever's working yeah if you can drink
0:06:09 these we can he kind of gives a glance
0:06:11 over it
0:06:12 britta because the first thing went
0:06:14 hunting with her was a similar situation
0:06:16 to be fair yes if we come in contact
0:06:17 with any one individual person i can
0:06:19 quickly and easily make them food it is
0:06:22 not difficult but food that you can eat
0:06:25 no okay vaguely probably not i mean if
0:06:28 we were in a time crunch here don't
0:06:30 worry about me
0:06:31 there's plenty of jars for the 3u and
0:06:33 miles you know can you like taste it and
0:06:36 just like stick your tongue in it and
0:06:38 figure out if they're a musician or not
0:06:40 is that i don't know how this works i'm
0:06:41 not entirely sure yeah the weakness of
0:06:44 the ventrue is is a is a very very
0:06:47 sensitive
0:06:48 palette that is sensitive ways that like
0:06:50 mortals can't really easily understand
0:06:53 all right if we're close enough to like
0:06:54 night clubs or something do they have i
0:06:56 don't know like do they have like open
0:06:59 performance nights i mean part of the
0:07:01 problems were we're on a time crunch
0:07:03 literally we are racing probably
0:07:06 not only racing shaw to this but we need
0:07:08 to finish this in enough time to get
0:07:10 back
0:07:11 because based on what johnny has told me
0:07:14 we don't have time to [ __ ] around
0:07:17 it sounds like shaw's in the process of
0:07:19 making a move and i need to be back in
0:07:21 court the prince can't be deposed i mean
0:07:24 you're gonna be okay if you don't feed
0:07:26 currently i can be smarter i did not i
0:07:29 went into that fight a little bit hot
0:07:31 because i thought i had time
0:07:33 roll that back a minute why can't the
0:07:35 print i mean
0:07:36 not that a praxis is ever anything but a
0:07:38 destabilizing element but like why
0:07:41 besides the destabilizing element before
0:07:43 a possible sabbat attack yeah on top of
0:07:45 that i have a directive from the archon
0:07:48 or specifically my sire and a higher
0:07:51 ranked ventrue i could not let a
0:07:53 stratagoes die and a strategosis
0:07:57 entitled higher level than mine i am now
0:08:00 electro promoted right after i was woken
0:08:02 up by my sire the archon right and his
0:08:05 specific directive was not to let the
0:08:07 stratagos die and to hold this domain
0:08:10 the stratagos being rolex
0:08:13 okay
0:08:15 um okay lots on pack
0:08:17 uh but
0:08:18 why what's what's the
0:08:21 or i guess it's not your place to
0:08:22 question an archon why it's not our
0:08:24 place to question an archon do you want
0:08:26 my general gist
0:08:28 yeah Rowlands is easy to to control okay
0:08:31 yeah i guess that would make sense he's
0:08:33 also a ventrue which means he follows
0:08:35 the rules of The Ventrue regardless
0:08:37 guess what shaw is not
0:08:39 yeah here's the bottom line do you trust
0:08:41 your sire
0:08:43 yes and you think he's making the right
0:08:45 play here i've not seen him make a wrong
0:08:47 play yet well i i trust miles so i say
0:08:50 we back him on this if his sire thinks
0:08:53 that upton is the best person
0:08:55 kind of snarls a little bit when he says
0:08:57 his name he thinks upton is the best
0:08:59 person to have in charge then we back
0:09:01 him on that we make sure that that he
0:09:03 stays in charge and i know i don't want
0:09:05 shaw in charge it is part of the reason
0:09:08 i'm not too worried about going against
0:09:10 the warning from the sheriff in this
0:09:12 particular incident oh yeah the sheriff
0:09:14 called us and told us not to go
0:09:16 right but told us that we were off the
0:09:18 santosa thing yeah and that we were not
0:09:21 to go there there's
0:09:23 i feel like
0:09:24 weathers is being played
0:09:26 as usual here and
0:09:28 the good ones are easy to play well he
0:09:30 also might be revealing his hand right
0:09:33 he didn't call us in to talk right he
0:09:35 said hey
0:09:37 whatever you're doing tonight don't go
0:09:38 over there
0:09:39 right he's been put into a position yet
0:09:41 again
0:09:42 where he needs to do something that he's
0:09:44 just generally
0:09:45 he can't do anything about so he's done
0:09:47 what he could do you think you can
0:09:49 handle the political fallout of this if
0:09:51 yeah if [ __ ] rolls down onto us doing
0:09:53 what we're not supposed to yes
0:09:55 i appreciate your confidence what is the
0:09:57 plan when we get in i don't know i know
0:09:59 nothing about this place i was hoping
0:10:01 that
0:10:02 somebody else had done something in that
0:10:04 regards i've been i know
0:10:06 a little about him but here's the thing
0:10:09 guys i need him i need santosa why does
0:10:12 everyone need santos
0:10:13 if i don't bring the seneschal
0:10:17 a little boy is gonna
0:10:19 is gonna die forever tortured
0:10:22 i don't understand the lying you do you
0:10:24 remember
0:10:25 the night without we got britta
0:10:27 that i came in and i talked about
0:10:29 oh that i'd been helping a little dead
0:10:31 boy yes kinda remember how i mouthed off
0:10:34 to the seneschal
0:10:36 that night yes
0:10:37 explicitly i mean i um you seem to do
0:10:40 that a lot
0:10:42 he has nothing to respect right um
0:10:45 that being said he
0:10:47 caught this little wraith boy and do you
0:10:50 have an idea of what i mean when i say
0:10:53 he's going to soul forge him
0:10:57 no
0:10:57 what is that in the lands of the dead
0:11:00 nothing exists unless it's very old or
0:11:02 legendary or has existed throughout time
0:11:05 to make new things
0:11:08 smaller
0:11:09 more vulnerable wraiths are soul-forged
0:11:12 they are made into things
0:11:14 and i want you to imagine for a minute
0:11:16 being dipped in fire and hammered into a
0:11:19 shape and you feel every blow every burn
0:11:22 every blister
0:11:24 but you're never tempered you're never
0:11:26 hardened
0:11:27 you just
0:11:28 feel that agony forever okay
0:11:31 that's what the seneschal is going to do
0:11:33 to joey if i don't bring him zantosa and
0:11:36 i promised joey he could say goodbye to
0:11:39 his mom so we have to capture this guy
0:11:41 alive then i mean he's a he's a flesh
0:11:44 crafter right he's a remnant
0:11:46 flashcrafter is that
0:11:48 is that even safe
0:11:49 probably not i don't think anything
0:11:51 about this is
0:11:53 safe none of this is a good idea or safe
0:11:55 but this is what i have to do to keep my
0:11:57 promise to joey and to keep this kid
0:11:59 from a lot from an unlife of torture
0:12:01 right
0:12:02 what i know about zantosa himself ogden
0:12:05 street it's his address yeah it wasn't
0:12:07 raven looking into him or something she
0:12:09 was um i don't believe i can really
0:12:11 count on raven anymore i mean she did
0:12:12 kind of she pissed off and left us to
0:12:15 fight the weeping bear
0:12:16 if we if we give zantosa over to the
0:12:20 seneschal
0:12:21 where does that leave shaw
0:12:23 he just wants the seneschal any
0:12:25 information we find i don't think he
0:12:27 cares are we
0:12:29 okay are we going into this just trying
0:12:31 to bag this guy are we looking for
0:12:34 information to tie him to shaw or are we
0:12:36 like what is what what are you looking
0:12:37 for here well i know that we are looking
0:12:39 for information that him and shaw have
0:12:42 been doing dealings he is an individual
0:12:44 outside the domain with sabbat ties
0:12:46 and that is one of the major things i
0:12:49 was given a directive to bring zantosa
0:12:51 to the archon
0:12:53 and that would
0:12:54 skewers shaw the archons thought it
0:12:56 would conclave them based on the
0:12:58 information we could get out of zentosa
0:13:00 now in regards to
0:13:03 the seneschal we might be able to get
0:13:05 that boy a different way just because he
0:13:07 offers you one method doesn't mean we
0:13:09 can't use a different one i'm sorry what
0:13:12 do you mean there's a whole balloon
0:13:13 economy out there
0:13:15 my thought is just make sure they're
0:13:17 both in the same room when we present
0:13:20 zantosa to the archon
0:13:22 because
0:13:23 what's he going to do fight i mean we
0:13:26 could give him to the seneschal and then
0:13:29 immediately after the exchange is made
0:13:31 tell the seneschal to keep hold of him
0:13:34 because an archon will be coming to
0:13:35 collect him
0:13:37 i don't know i mean we'll piss off the
0:13:38 seneschal doing that i don't care i
0:13:41 i don't know if that's a good idea no i
0:13:43 don't i don't like her i'm just i'm
0:13:45 trying to look i i don't want to piss
0:13:46 off the center shell i want to give the
0:13:48 the benefit of the doubt
0:13:50 but there's nothing saying that he's
0:13:52 actually going to help us
0:13:54 if we give him zantosa and the problem
0:13:56 is that we need to give zantosa to
0:13:59 someone who's going to hold shaw
0:14:00 accountable because that is the only
0:14:02 thing that's stopping shaw from taking
0:14:04 over the city shaw knows that zantosa is
0:14:07 his only weakness right now if he knows
0:14:10 that that weakness is taken care of
0:14:11 which is why he's probably sending all
0:14:13 of the brouha nosferatu under his thumb
0:14:15 in the city to try and kill him right
0:14:17 now yeah we're definitely going to run
0:14:19 into him
0:14:20 by the way if he manages to take care of
0:14:22 santosa and kill him he has no more
0:14:24 weaknesses that means that he can run a
0:14:28 a praxis on the prince
0:14:30 it means that he can
0:14:32 attack us with impunity i'm pretty sure
0:14:35 that shaw has figured figured out
0:14:38 something about my family i'm almost
0:14:40 certain that he has made contact
0:14:43 with my daughter he's been giving her
0:14:46 numbers that he's been pulling out of
0:14:47 the sheriff's office so that she can try
0:14:49 and contact me wait go back a minute
0:14:52 what what are you talking about
0:14:54 you all know that i have kids right
0:14:57 it's i got a i've got a daughter and
0:14:59 i've got a son
0:15:00 i haven't seen them and it's probably
0:15:02 been about
0:15:04 seven years since i've actually seen
0:15:06 either of them just pray or post
0:15:10 embrace uh
0:15:12 i gotta i got embraced ten years ago
0:15:15 okay but i spent a few years
0:15:17 haunting my family
0:15:19 i may have gotten a little bit too close
0:15:21 and
0:15:22 it was weathers that got me out of some
0:15:24 trouble with uh
0:15:26 a near masquerade breach when you say
0:15:29 haunting your family
0:15:31 johnny i'm sure you were just trying to
0:15:33 take care of them
0:15:35 yeah but
0:15:37 it was
0:15:38 it wasn't the way i should have gone
0:15:39 about it what do you mean
0:15:41 well their their father died i was
0:15:44 embraced and became a vampire
0:15:47 but their father is dead and the ghost
0:15:50 of that man should not be haunting them
0:15:52 trying to look out for them from the
0:15:54 shadows
0:15:55 my
0:15:56 my daughter was growing up
0:15:58 getting into trouble that teenagers
0:16:01 ought to get into
0:16:02 and
0:16:04 i saw things that i didn't like
0:16:08 young men that i thought were predators
0:16:10 and
0:16:11 the man i was might have been angry and
0:16:14 may have given her a talking to but the
0:16:15 thing that i've become was enraged
0:16:19 and i let it get the better of me
0:16:22 and
0:16:24 i don't know what kind of damage i've
0:16:25 done to her she
0:16:27 saw something kill one of her friends
0:16:31 she thought it was a friend of hers
0:16:33 and
0:16:34 ever since then she's
0:16:38 well i don't know what she's been going
0:16:39 through now
0:16:40 but she's had to live with the fact that
0:16:42 she thinks her father's a monster
0:16:44 still alive out there in the shadows
0:16:48 and she's been reaching out to you with
0:16:50 these phone numbers i think
0:16:53 what are you gonna do about that
0:16:57 i don't know
0:16:59 but i'm pretty sure that the only reason
0:17:01 that she's been able to make contact is
0:17:03 because shaw
0:17:04 has been feeding her this
0:17:06 we could find out
0:17:07 i don't think it matters
0:17:09 i think what matters is that we have we
0:17:12 have to do something to take out shaw
0:17:15 because if we don't
0:17:17 he's just gonna exploit all of these
0:17:19 things he knows for a fact that i am
0:17:22 never gonna join his side
0:17:24 so if he
0:17:26 has the ability to run
0:17:28 a praxis on the domain
0:17:30 he's gonna he's gonna take out Rowlands
0:17:32 he's gonna take out weathers he's gonna
0:17:34 take out me and he's gonna do it in the
0:17:37 easiest way possible which is probably
0:17:39 gonna be exploiting my family well and
0:17:42 something to consider
0:17:43 because of the kind of person that shaw
0:17:46 is
0:17:47 if we stop him from getting what he
0:17:48 wants tonight and he's still around he's
0:17:51 gonna kno and and our fingerprints are
0:17:53 on it he's gonna punish you
0:17:56 he's gonna punish his
0:17:57 his daughter yeah it's i mean
0:18:00 and he's gonna make you see it we can't
0:18:02 let that happen if we have santosa he
0:18:06 might hesitate he might be looking for
0:18:08 ways to weasel out of that
0:18:10 because he knows that if we get him and
0:18:13 we put him in the right in their hands
0:18:14 the right people he'll be conclaved
0:18:16 so he might actually hesitate on pulling
0:18:18 a trigger against us if he thinks that
0:18:21 there's still some way he can play to
0:18:22 get out of it or he's just gonna use it
0:18:24 as a threat
0:18:25 i think um he'll just take out zanto so
0:18:27 first trying not to to talk over uh over
0:18:30 Britta's head here what do you want to
0:18:32 explain what a conclave is
0:18:34 a
0:18:34 conclave is
0:18:36 a judicial trial put on
0:18:39 by kindred in similar ways to
0:18:42 an actual court trial if you're familiar
0:18:44 with that at all you can call any
0:18:46 memories of that
0:18:47 and
0:18:48 we need zantosa to
0:18:51 make our case at this conclave to
0:18:54 make sure that the punishment against
0:18:56 shaw is
0:18:57 terrible
0:18:59 and effective otherwise his allies will
0:19:02 basically nullify any other kind of
0:19:04 evidence we bring forward
0:19:06 we have
0:19:08 the word of an archon to
0:19:11 get this rolling
0:19:12 but we would need to keep the witness
0:19:15 alive no loose strengths essentially and
0:19:19 is also my fear about giving it to the
0:19:20 finish all i'm working on the assumption
0:19:22 that our goal tonight is to apprehend
0:19:25 zantosa and get out before shaw and his
0:19:27 goons get there any other evidence we
0:19:29 can find while we're in there and any
0:19:30 other evidence we can find
0:19:32 right and after that we'll figure that
0:19:34 out after we've crossed this very big
0:19:36 bridge right so i mean that leads us
0:19:39 to the next question does anyone know
0:19:41 how to capture this individual
0:19:44 anything about him i mean he's mortal
0:19:47 he's a wrestler he's mortal but at the
0:19:49 same time i mean we freaked out about
0:19:52 touching weeping bear because of the
0:19:54 thing that lives inside him and zantos
0:19:56 is the one who
0:19:57 we're sort of assuming
0:19:59 uh
0:20:00 kind of
0:20:00 is in enthrall to in worship of this
0:20:04 thing so what ravens i'm trying to
0:20:06 remember more or less he's of that
0:20:08 bloodline that the thing lives in
0:20:11 okay so um that's the the bloodline he
0:20:15 is a resident of
0:20:16 so he may be he's he's a flesh crafter
0:20:19 well i was going to say for lack of a
0:20:20 better word infected with whatever it
0:20:22 was that was infecting the weeping bear
0:20:25 yeah which means touching and holding
0:20:27 him might be
0:20:29 putting a [ __ ] lock box i don't i
0:20:30 don't know i think putting him in a box
0:20:32 might be the best but i mean i will try
0:20:34 what i can i have a couple things that
0:20:35 disable mortals pretty easily and for
0:20:37 long periods of time as long as it's
0:20:39 effective okay
0:20:41 powers of the mind is that what we
0:20:43 should focus on i will try it it's a
0:20:45 good first start i think it's a pretty
0:20:47 damn good idea and then if that fails
0:20:50 then we go to plan b
0:20:52 hit him until he's unconscious and then
0:20:54 put him in a box um but at the end of
0:20:56 the day he is mortal which means
0:20:59 i shouldn't be using my claws we
0:21:01 shouldn't be looking to disable him like
0:21:02 we would disable kindred but he is going
0:21:04 to be very hard to put down he's also
0:21:06 probably going to be surrounded by
0:21:08 minions those monster things hopefully
0:21:11 not another weeping battle regardless so
0:21:13 someone's even if someone's you know
0:21:15 mortal even someone's not mortal the
0:21:18 plan hitting them until they stop moving
0:21:20 can usually result in someone dying yeah
0:21:23 right but at that point that's always a
0:21:24 bad idea
0:21:25 i mean we'll have to look around and see
0:21:27 the resources we didn't come prepared
0:21:28 for this
0:21:29 we don't have we were hoping to have
0:21:31 more time before we do do we do we have
0:21:34 shoelaces with zip ties in your truck
0:21:36 here i thought we just established that
0:21:37 i did not come here okay yeah i think i
0:21:40 think better version of preparedness
0:21:41 better version of
0:21:43 better reason that we stop at some like
0:21:44 24-hour gas station grab some zip ties
0:21:47 there maybe a few other things that we
0:21:49 can grab to help us along the way and
0:21:51 maybe uh a quick snack for one of us and
0:21:54 look i if it comes down to it choking
0:21:57 him out might not be a bad idea if we
0:21:59 need to focus those of us who can get
0:22:02 something like a weeping bear down and
0:22:04 those of us who can
0:22:06 target him with disciplines that might
0:22:08 affect him in his head that might be a
0:22:11 good way to do this and
0:22:13 i'll look for evidence i also know the
0:22:16 secrets of the ancient art called full
0:22:17 nelson the what yeah it's a very ancient
0:22:20 Brujah art he's gonna wrestle until he
0:22:22 can't move anymore oh and then you look
0:22:24 at his eyes and tell him to calm down
0:22:26 until he comes with us right
0:22:28 probably
0:22:29 johnny you probably don't want to touch
0:22:30 him i mean that's part of the problem
0:22:31 but we at that point we may not have a
0:22:33 choice is clothing gonna stop that i
0:22:35 have no idea okay so we know nothing
0:22:37 about how this thing works no not at all
0:22:38 we just when we saw a weeping bear we
0:22:40 freaked out and burned it i mean i it
0:22:42 smacked the [ __ ] out of you two but you
0:22:44 don't seem to be affected i don't like
0:22:46 the way you said that well
0:22:48 point is don't
0:22:49 let's let's try not to drink any of his
0:22:51 vitae yeah
0:23:06 it's not like they're sterile or
0:23:07 anything but the coldness of my hands
0:23:09 might well we don't know how any of this
0:23:11 works that's part of the problem i
0:23:13 understand it's just any layer against
0:23:15 it
0:23:17 yeah so zip ties hefty bags rubber
0:23:20 gloves
0:23:25 yes okay trust me
0:23:27 all right i guess we can work we can
0:23:30 take a brief stop at the store they're
0:23:31 not just for kidnapping
0:23:34 not just they're not
0:23:37 you just keep a box closed so your card
0:23:40 collection doesn't go all over the place
0:23:42 you also fix up a car with them too yeah
0:23:44 i think that's really what they're there
0:23:45 for really yeah you put holes in this if
0:23:48 you get a crack in your body work you
0:23:49 put holes on the side you just stitch it
0:23:51 up with zip ties but you put more holes
0:23:53 in if you're trying to fix a hole but
0:23:54 they're productive holes for the crack
0:23:57 a crack is just a long hole anyways
0:23:59 let's go find productive holes
0:24:02 a crack is not just a long hole look
0:24:04 this is bordering on a philosophical
0:24:06 discussion and i'm hungry okay i think
0:24:09 we all are yeah yeah but if what miles
0:24:12 is saying it's true we don't want to
0:24:13 stop for too long two minutes miles try
0:24:17 and find something and the rest of us
0:24:19 you guys
0:24:20 i'll be fine you guys can can
0:24:22 crack yours in the back neil if you're
0:24:23 looking for evidence i don't want you
0:24:24 going in half-hearted on it all right
0:24:27 still what i'm talking about i'll be
0:24:28 fine okay all right uh i'm okay let's
0:24:31 try drinking these all right i'll drink
0:24:33 the first one nah head hell no i took
0:24:36 first call okay just make sure you know
0:24:39 in theory they're just blood yep
0:24:40 johnny's gonna look for a place to pull
0:24:42 over like like hopefully like some like
0:24:44 little like gas station that might still
0:24:45 be open where we can also hit there for
0:24:47 a few supplies and things easily you
0:24:49 find a spot it's a little quiet like
0:24:52 right off like the highway and you guys
0:24:54 pull into a parking space
0:24:56 uh johnny get me a few big lighters like
0:24:58 cheap ass bikes like like i don't know
0:25:00 half dozen um once the car has come to a
0:25:03 stop like when cracks open one of the
0:25:05 there's like a sucking sound when you
0:25:07 crack it like like a thermos a little
0:25:09 bit yeah and the wax seal breaks and
0:25:13 inside is blood kind of sniff it doesn't
0:25:15 smell spoiled or anything take a sip not
0:25:18 pounding the whole thing in one go
0:25:19 tastes like blood pound the rest of it
0:25:21 yeah you drink it get a point of blood
0:25:23 and make a willpower
0:25:33 [Music]
0:25:36 she starts doing this i'm gonna head
0:25:38 into the store and just like

0:25:42 harmonica

0:25:45 another basically okay when you head
0:25:47 inside there's uh there's one person

0:25:53 their flip phone they kind of put it
0:25:55 away when someone arrives and they they
0:25:57 give you like a little bit of a nod

0:27:31 hard and she's giving like two word
0:27:34 replies
0:27:36 you know she's like cool
0:27:38 i think we're having a giving this guy a
0:27:39 better night than he was gonna have what
0:27:40 are you doing tonight not much okay one
0:27:44 letter yeah this guy
0:27:47 he's definitely working a lot harder
0:27:48 than the other person i think i will
0:27:50 attempt to feed on him while he's doing
0:27:51 this and if not it'll make it so that
0:27:53 it's just easier i don't have to use
0:27:54 memorize or anything like that i'm not a
0:27:55 musician yep that's fine yeah going
0:27:57 forward johnny will uh will lean in and
0:27:59 feed just a little bit off this guy how
0:28:01 much you take it
0:28:02 oh is it safe two or three two is safe
0:28:05 three three will knock him out three
0:28:07 he's he's still he's just passed out
0:28:08 anyways we'll go for three okay and then
0:28:11 i will make sure that there's no
0:28:13 security camera that's watching this
0:28:15 recording unless did he have to take a
0:28:17 uh invite to to see if it was worth it
0:28:19 or not no it tastes fine okay so uh
0:28:22 there is a camera it is not working
0:28:25 it looks like they have like an
0:28:26 intricate mirror system which is like
0:28:28 you know two mirrors and
0:28:30 uh they use that to tell that said he
0:28:33 does have a [ __ ] shotgun uh behind
0:28:35 the counter which seems to be like their
0:28:37 real
0:28:38 security measure do you want do you want
0:28:40 to look at well shotgun now no i think i
0:28:43 think we'll be fine with the ceramic
0:28:44 ones
0:28:45 do not drop that one i won't no more i
0:28:48 was just testing to see if it was uh is
0:28:51 that was that what it was because it
0:28:52 seemed like a nonchalant throw over your
0:28:54 shoulder well
0:28:55 now we know what what the limits of
0:28:57 those barrels are maybe in the future
0:29:00 when we don't know we just like kind of
0:29:02 slide off the counter
0:29:05 johnny gonna grabs him and kind of like
0:29:07 puts him down slowly so he doesn't knock
0:29:09 his head you ease him down uh are you
0:29:12 licking his wound yeah okay i will throw
0:29:14 down like 50 bucks grab some stuff uh
0:29:17 johnny will grab a carton of cigarettes
0:29:20 bam
0:29:21 of the supply a couple a couple of big
0:29:23 lighters i think we're ready
0:29:30 stealing well we threw down 50 bucks
0:29:32 yeah oh you paid yeah yeah yeah okay
0:29:34 yeah enough you're like overpaid yeah in
0:29:36 the 90s get in one i ventured out
0:29:47 and you feel okay because money was left
0:29:50 and
0:29:50 you guys didn't completely take
0:29:52 advantage of them
0:30:01 yeah actually basically everything you
0:30:03 could need to kidnap someone is like in
0:30:05 this aisle
0:30:06 yeah dude
0:30:08 why do they sell so much rubber hose
0:30:10 grab some maybe some yeah some work
0:30:11 gloves yeah yeah they have that yeah and
0:30:13 then uh on the way out i'll like turn
0:30:15 the lights off and flip the sign to
0:30:17 close okay
0:30:21 [Music]
0:30:24 well back in the car uh wind starts
0:30:26 passing out the cans neil waves off you
0:30:30 giving him any you guys know so uh it's
0:30:33 fine i have my own
0:30:35 and pulls out a little coin purse
0:30:38 and unzips it and puts a 1969 penny into
0:30:43 his mouth and then swallows there's a
0:30:46 little trickle of blood outside of this
0:30:47 what is that where i told you guys right
0:30:50 it's a
0:30:51 penny uh sort of looks like a penny no
0:30:54 it was a penny it's gone now it kind of
0:30:56 hurts a little bit every time i have to
0:30:57 do this
0:30:58 i don't like getting rid of their
0:31:00 special but you know there's an awful
0:31:02 lot to unpack there buddy and another
0:31:05 night i would love to hear more about it
0:31:06 sure sure
0:31:07 but uh yeah so that's why i said i'm not
0:31:09 going in empty but i don't need any of
0:31:11 that that's for you guys okay how do we
0:31:13 split this
0:31:15 well i'm assuming johnny's
0:31:17 getting some in there but we need to
0:31:19 make sure that miles
0:31:20 has
0:31:21 some to try uh honestly we might want to
0:31:23 wait until he comes back and he can try
0:31:25 some of these let's do that neil puts
0:31:28 another coin into his mouth
0:31:29 so we'll come back probably didn't take
0:31:31 us that long as they start walking back
0:31:33 just like rubs his face so it doesn't
0:31:34 look like he's been eating anything yeah
0:31:36 you guys handle the gas station quick
0:31:38 and efficiently i guess you guys are all
0:31:40 in the back and it's probably me and
0:31:42 miles sitting up in the front right i'm
0:31:43 driving i just called shotgun
0:31:49 johnny's driving there there's nobody
0:31:51 else in shotgun besides me oh yeah
0:31:53 obviously in the past yeah yeah
0:31:55 wynn is kind of bopping back and forth
0:31:57 between the cargo area and the so we
0:31:59 probably like
0:32:00 this is a good point to load out so like
0:32:02 we'll probably flip open the back and
0:32:03 start re-putting in and like we have to
0:32:05 replace the panel on johnny's armor and
0:32:07 everything like that miles try this one
0:32:10 sure she cracks open another canopic jar
0:32:12 and hands it to miles okay miles roll me
0:32:15 eight d10s
0:32:17 and if any of them are 10
0:32:19 it's a musician

0:32:30 can have johnny
0:32:32 here
0:32:34 why aren't you taking any of these i
0:32:36 don't use blood as much as the rest of
0:32:37 you but you definitely did in the last
0:32:39 fight yeah i did but i'm doing okay and
0:32:41 i would like to prioritize those of you
0:32:43 who aren't just gonna be joking around
0:32:45 looking for stuff right but it's still
0:32:47 important johnny eyes you in the rear
0:32:49 view you're looking extra squirrely
0:32:50 right now too what's going on
0:32:52 i'm totally fine you can see under his
0:32:54 lips he's like clearly licking his teeth
0:32:57 don't

0:33:00 prioritizing the rest of you neil full
0:33:02 disclosure time man

0:33:06 i i'm pretty sure this is the thing
0:33:09 there was like one ask i mean
0:33:11 we all know about it to a certain degree
0:33:13 you do yeah he looks immediately at
0:33:16 Brittain Britta sort of like goes wide
0:33:19 doe-eyed and plays innocent
0:33:22 you think that i was not able to get
0:33:24 that information after all of the odd
0:33:27 behavior that was going on odd behavior
0:33:29 i'm normally odd behavior you say that
0:33:30 all the time cracks open another yeah
0:33:33 untrue because your reaction says that
0:33:36 what i'm asking no it doesn't you're
0:33:37 panicking does it look like i'm
0:33:39 panicking whoa guys i'm actually in the
0:33:41 dark here i was kind of just messing
0:33:43 with him what's going on
0:33:45 neil has been involved with things that
0:33:47 he liked hidden from the domain and
0:33:50 everyone can we just leave it at that
0:33:52 please can we
0:33:54 can't can we no i'm last time i checked
0:33:57 we're putting a lot on the line here
0:33:59 what are we getting involved in with
0:34:01 your particular practice you're not
0:34:02 getting involved with anything um my
0:34:04 proximity to you i'm just helping you
0:34:07 would you like hidden diabolos or
0:34:09 something what's going on
0:34:10 no it's no i'm not a diablorist
0:34:13 slides into the economic jar of Britta
0:34:15 motions for her to take a drink every
0:34:16 time uh
0:34:18 neil denies things does not understand
0:34:20 the game
0:34:22 he is
0:34:24 practicing something occult
0:34:26 oh
0:34:27 that the domain would not be happy about
0:34:29 look dude i don't want to talk about it
0:34:30 because johnny from the horoscopes thing
0:34:34 because johnny freaks out about blood
0:34:35 sorcery which is why i don't want to
0:34:36 talk blood sorcery yeah but he's okay
0:34:39 with it now because he's okay with the
0:34:40 seneschal doing it and it would be
0:34:42 hypocritical if he was okay with the
0:34:44 seneschal doing it and not a coterie
0:34:45 mate
0:34:46 no
0:34:50 neil has a look at his face i'm like
0:34:52 whoa it's just complete like
0:34:54 shock and appreciation
0:34:56 between and johnny like
0:35:00 look
0:35:01 no go on and tell me
0:35:03 why you would be okay
0:35:05 with one person in the domain who we
0:35:07 love and we would protect i i would i
0:35:09 don't love and would protect the senate
0:35:12 shall he's just oh i didn't say who it
0:35:14 was yeah i thought she was talking about
0:35:16 me jeez
0:35:19 why don't we let neil talk about it
0:35:21 before we get angry we don't have a
0:35:23 whole lot of time to go into all the
0:35:24 history it's not important i don't need
0:35:26 history i would like broad strokes broad
0:35:28 strokes sure for the last
0:35:32 few decades
0:35:34 i have been
0:35:36 walking the path towards mastery of
0:35:39 heaven and earth
0:35:40 it's
0:35:41 for knowledge
0:35:42 knowledge is power
0:35:44 i don't have a whole lot to offer
0:35:46 everyone but i can offer
0:35:48 knowledge i've sort of let it slide and
0:35:51 thank you guys and have you guys think
0:35:53 like oh it's just you know small cavian
0:35:56 small caveans just know stuff which is
0:35:57 true that's not not true
0:35:59 but
0:36:00 it's not just insights it's
0:36:04 sorcery
0:36:05 that some of it is sorcery not all of it
0:36:08 some of it the path of heaven and earth
0:36:09 sounds awfully bright and and shiny but
0:36:12 you like how far does this go are you
0:36:14 like bathing in blood like making
0:36:17 sacrifices i mean yes he sacrifices part
0:36:20 is legit we know about
0:36:22 he's a vampire so can't blanch but like
0:36:25 just clearly looks crestfallen of like
0:36:28 so when i brought you guys out to
0:36:29 wallingford you went out into that that
0:36:31 that field with the cattle were you
0:36:33 actually like like slitting the throat
0:36:35 of a calf it wasn't a calf it was a ball
0:36:38 oh my it was totally a bull you know i i
0:36:40 was joking to myself like you know what
0:36:41 this feels like johnny this feels like
0:36:43 some
0:36:44 and it was
0:36:45 i mean this is some [ __ ] i thought
0:36:47 that was a pretty good decade
0:36:50 right the seneschal the shenanigans
0:36:57 let's stop using that it's not
0:36:59 completely fair the seneschal will
0:37:02 slaughter me and pull my brain apart for
0:37:04 secrets if he knows i can do this so
0:37:07 because it's not exactly true you're
0:37:08 sanctioned
0:37:09 okay so can we
0:37:11 yes we can keep it i just need to know
0:37:14 how much i i need to know enough to
0:37:16 cover for when it comes to the time okay
0:37:18 so you know how the other day i was like
0:37:20 things are coming to new haven yeah
0:37:22 things are coming to new haven i know it
0:37:24 i've seen it one of those things and
0:37:26 i've been trying to figure out how to
0:37:27 broach the subject with you johnny
0:37:28 considering this is how i thought you
0:37:29 would react is that you are
0:37:33 going to
0:37:36 mourn
0:37:37 a girl
0:37:38 it's going to happen johnny frenzy check
0:37:40 yeah
0:37:44 i don't want to use these dice they are
0:37:46 a lovely dice
0:37:48 your difficulties
0:37:51 is it self-control yes sir
0:37:55 sorry i say it again i was talking okay
0:37:57 again self-control defeat i think i need
0:37:59 a willpower on this don't i yeah uh
0:38:03 i don't have that many willpower can you
0:38:04 spell power on self-control
0:38:08 i feel like that's one of those things
0:38:09 you definitely should
0:38:12 wow all right well um three successes
0:38:14 he stiffens in the front seat i
0:38:18 the steering wheel of the suv and you
0:38:20 hear it pop a little bit i don't know
0:38:23 the plastic underneath breaks
0:38:26 i don't know that it's your daughter it
0:38:27 could be Britta it could be
0:38:30 so you know you're an empathetic person
0:38:31 it could be anybody why are we
0:38:33 particularly those women out because
0:38:35 it's somebody close to johnny that's
0:38:37 different than just a woman it's someone
0:38:39 he would mourn over it's somebody that
0:38:41 johnny would freak out over
0:38:43 and i don't know how exactly did you
0:38:44 come across this knowledge
0:38:47 i asked the heavens what's that mean
0:38:50 it means i went outside on new year's
0:38:52 eve because it was an auspicious night
0:38:54 and i stuck my feet in the dirt and
0:38:56 looked at the stars and asked them what
0:38:58 they would tell me about the future of
0:38:59 the domain and that was one of the
0:39:01 things that i saw so you just went
0:39:03 outside looked at the sky and
0:39:06 asked hey what's happening to my buddy
0:39:09 johnny no i asked about the domain
0:39:11 and that was part of it and what did the
0:39:14 stars ask in return uh nothing that's
0:39:17 the mastery part of heaven on earth oh
0:39:19 yeah yeah you didn't have to
0:39:21 cut the throat of a bull or anything no
0:39:23 that was to ascend to the veil oh
0:39:26 because i can understand the subtlety of
0:39:28 the difference on that right now okay
0:39:30 it's look
0:39:32 that was one of the things a storm is
0:39:34 coming to new haven
0:39:35 three
0:39:36 pearlescent-eyed scions are going to be
0:39:39 fighting a many armed demon
0:39:41 over the storm
0:39:43 there was a lot there
0:39:44 okay let's unpack that later okay that's
0:39:47 not necessary for our current objective
0:39:49 i agree this is why
0:39:52 neil yep yep yep johnny
0:39:55 his magic is not nearly as bad as some
0:39:58 of the stuff that i've heard the
0:39:59 premiere do regardless of your feelings
0:40:00 about any of them this
0:40:03 is just not sanctioned he spins around
0:40:05 his seat and stares at you the next time
0:40:07 you have some evil [ __ ] in your back
0:40:09 pocket that you are thinking about
0:40:11 hiding you disclose that immediately
0:40:14 because now you gotta tell me about this
0:40:15 [ __ ] right before going to zantosa and
0:40:17 that's not [ __ ] acceptable it wasn't
0:40:20 mine i don't care no i did not think
0:40:22 this would come into this part but
0:40:23 basically
0:40:24 i need to know what to protect and i
0:40:26 understand your anger here but
0:40:28 see this he was trying to help us and he
0:40:31 is trying to help
0:40:32 whatever woman this is by telling us now
0:40:35 if he was trying to help he would have
0:40:36 told us about this a lot earlier i've
0:40:38 known you for years
0:40:40 yeah but
0:40:41 your reaction is making it difficult so
0:40:44 the only reason i've survived trying to
0:40:46 do this on my own with no help or
0:40:49 teachers
0:40:50 for decades is because nobody
0:40:53 knew
0:40:54 nobody johnny we all have [ __ ] going on
0:40:57 i'm surprised that you guys are taking
0:40:58 this as easily as you are i didn't
0:41:01 no wind didn't
0:41:02 johnny my reaction was similar to yours
0:41:06 it's not good but it is also helping us
0:41:08 currently
0:41:10 and based on what he just said is about
0:41:12 to help us going into the santosa thing
0:41:14 something about the veil i'm not
0:41:16 entirely sure i tiredly don't need the
0:41:18 details currently no that was
0:41:21 connected but
0:41:22 not don't
0:41:23 i don't need the details it's easier to
0:41:25 deal with stuff if i don't have them
0:41:27 regardless
0:41:29 he has been putting himself on the line
0:41:32 to help us now
0:41:34 he's exposed himself
0:41:36 to us
0:41:38 and we have his [ __ ] back
0:41:40 whether we agree with it or not just
0:41:42 like you telling us about your family
0:41:44 and just like me putting out my
0:41:45 responsibilities to the domain and the
0:41:47 fact that we need to keep this feckless
0:41:49 [ __ ] prince
0:41:50 alive
0:41:52 and on top of that fact something is
0:41:54 going on with Britta we're all not
0:41:55 talking about it there's so much more
0:41:58 that we need to focus on right now i'm
0:42:00 just putting it out there that we're all
0:42:02 have [ __ ] going on
0:42:04 we need to protect
0:42:05 each other
0:42:07 right but it's also why we're replacing
0:42:09 johnny's backplate is because you shot
0:42:11 him in the back to break a power a power
0:42:14 i'm not familiar with
0:42:16 um i'm not i'm not um
0:42:20 familiar with it either i believe that
0:42:23 you are yeah that doesn't seem true but
0:42:26 you don't know what it is and i'm you're
0:42:29 not conscious of what you're
0:42:31 how knowledgeable you are and that's not
0:42:34 great we have leads on that and i can
0:42:36 get more right i know it's not a noun
0:42:38 problem magic yes and other things
0:42:41 look now is not the time to be decisive
0:42:44 divisive
0:42:45 is it
0:42:46 it was
0:42:47 an instinct and i followed it and
0:42:51 it was helpful i'm not putting you down
0:42:53 for this and i'm not but you need to
0:42:56 start
0:42:57 becoming aware and i need to take some
0:42:59 time
0:43:00 to see how much you actually know
0:43:02 and that means possibly something
0:43:04 invasive and that is a conversation we
0:43:06 will need to have about your willingness
0:43:08 to do that because i do not want to do
0:43:10 that without your permission at this
0:43:12 point
0:43:13 even though to certain degrees i have a
0:43:15 right
0:43:16 i
0:43:17 understand but that is not here and that
0:43:20 is not now since we are putting our
0:43:22 cards on the table and we're gearing up
0:43:23 for a fight where we don't know what the
0:43:25 [ __ ] is gonna happen this is where we're
0:43:27 at
0:43:28 we have a lot of things between here and
0:43:30 dawn so gear up and let's get ready to
0:43:33 go
0:43:34 don't throw any more shotguns
0:43:42 the group of you ride in silence for a
0:43:44 time snow kind of coming down for a
0:43:46 little while all you can really hear the
0:43:48 sounds of the windshield wipers and
0:43:50 eventually you begin to come to a side
0:43:52 of town where the street lights are less
0:43:54 and less frequent the cars traffic
0:43:57 everything kind of dies down and
0:44:00 it's terribly quiet johnny you find
0:44:03 about the right distance for the group
0:44:05 of you to be able to approach on foot
0:44:07 and you pull over and park hey uh miles
0:44:10 i got an idea give me uh let me borrow
0:44:12 your phone real quick as long as it
0:44:13 comes back in the condition i gave it to
0:44:15 you yeah i promise
0:44:17 yeah grabs the phone and like a very
0:44:19 awkwardly starts putting in a number it
0:44:22 looks kind of like a new skill to him
0:44:24 the buttons are a little small for your
0:44:26 hands you're being stared at the whole
0:44:27 time
0:44:29 but you managed to uh place a call
0:44:32 johnny who you calling i'm gonna call my
0:44:34 contacts in the um the state police i
0:44:37 still actually keep some contact with
0:44:39 some of the dispatch over there help me
0:44:41 uh kind of move quietly around this part
0:44:45 of the state all right so uh one of your
0:44:48 dispatch buddies guy named blake kind of
0:44:50 like middle age
0:44:52 heavy set tends to wear flannel sleeves
0:44:55 always rolled up and knuckles like kind
0:44:57 of kind of nasty and gnarly looking but
0:44:59 you guys you know
0:45:00 you actually kind of click with him he
0:45:02 sounds like a Gangrel
0:45:04 yeah he's just he's just ready for it
0:45:06 right uh we got we had each other's back
0:45:08 in a bar fight back when i was still
0:45:10 mortal yeah like he's got some scars in
0:45:12 your name you know hey uh

0:45:17 the weird number

0:45:28 end i uh i was wondering if you might be
0:45:30 able to do me a favor yeah yeah anything
0:45:32 you need anything you need yeah so i'm
0:45:35 uh i'm kind of keeping a lookout for
0:45:37 some people moving around and i was
0:45:39 wondering if if you got any of your uh
0:45:42 patrol guys out over on route 5
0:45:45 just keep an eye out for uh for some
0:45:47 groups of uh
0:45:49 of shitty looking types and just give me

0:45:53 uh the road
0:45:54 yeah well i mean so i'm i mean i don't
0:45:57 need to explain this to you but you know
0:45:59 roof that's kind of a chill when it
0:46:00 comes to moving to trucks they got like
0:46:01 a huge limit on height but but that's
0:46:04 kind of that's kind of exactly the point
0:46:06 yeah but i i got some people that are
0:46:08 there so you know what i'll have to keep
0:46:10 an eye out no problem at all let those
0:46:11 guys know if they see a group of uh
0:46:14 a large group of these guys moving maybe
0:46:18 not worry about them tonight it might be
0:46:19 more trouble than it's worth i
0:46:22 you you got a problem with a group of
0:46:23 guys john
0:46:24 may potentially are these guys like a
0:46:27 community problem or is this like a like
0:46:29 a you thing you just want us keeping an
0:46:31 eye out it's a me thing and you guys
0:46:32 just keep an eye out but uh like i said
0:46:35 maybe not uh it might be in your best
0:46:37 interest just have let your guys hang
0:46:39 out in the car where it's warm let the
0:46:41 snow fall and maybe not bother these
0:46:43 guys just give me a heads up yeah no

0:47:34 that sounds like a no
0:47:36 not to bring up a touchy subject
0:47:38 that's gonna power through i have
0:47:40 already
0:47:42 beseeched the blessing of the heavens
0:47:44 for
0:47:45 win and Britta and myself going
0:47:47 to find santosa it's how i knew tonight
0:47:50 was also an auspicious night
0:47:53 do
0:47:54 the two of you
0:47:55 want me to do the same no
0:47:57 we don't have a bowl i don't need one
0:47:59 then why did we need one before it was a
0:48:01 different thing
0:48:03 do you need to take your shoes off for
0:48:04 this one too no i just need a pint of
0:48:06 your blood uh no
0:48:08 a pint of my blood
0:48:10 yeah
0:48:11 you mean the thing that i'm not super
0:48:12 high on right now that's why i'm asking
0:48:15 why are we still having this
0:48:16 conversation because he asked both of us
0:48:18 johnny kind of nods never mind
0:48:21 this is i just
0:48:22 is it going to be more beneficial than
0:48:24 that vitae that v-day that i'm going to
0:48:26 lose i don't know it depends on what the
0:48:27 heavens have to say what do you think i
0:48:30 don't know
0:48:30 i need your opinion before i make a
0:48:32 decision it was beneficial for
0:48:34 the three of us
0:48:36 we were given into insights i don't know
0:48:39 how it felt for the two of them but i
0:48:41 know what it feels like for me
0:48:43 neil but i haven't the preparatory time
0:48:45 that i had then with the ball and all of
0:48:48 that i haven't glimpsed
0:48:51 that which lies beyond the veil and so
0:48:53 it's not going to be as too wordy i need
0:48:56 a is this going to be a more beneficial
0:48:59 thing or not and not a
0:49:00 i need a yes or no i think it will but i
0:49:03 i do that's all i need i don't know then
0:49:04 yes we need to trust each other so that
0:49:06 means you need to trust yourself
0:49:09 um
0:49:10 okay johnny puts the uh the vehicle in
0:49:12 park now that he's found the good spot
0:49:13 looks over at them we'll figure it out
0:49:15 soon and hops out of the car and goes
0:49:17 around the back to start getting his
0:49:18 gear
0:49:19 okay all right here's a question lex
0:49:21 before i do this has my weird ass
0:49:24 unexplainable behavior paid off as an
0:49:26 enigma now that i have explained and it
0:49:28 does have an explanation yes cool so i
0:49:30 will regain that willpower that i'm just
0:49:31 about to spend okay uh we don't really
0:49:34 have a uh a bowl or anything can we um
0:49:37 hold on and neil sort of digs out the
0:49:41 like you know how there's like those tin
0:49:43 inserts where like car ashtrays are yeah
0:49:46 just pulls that out it's like if it i
0:49:48 mean we should put it on the side but if
0:49:49 it spills a little bit it's fine just
0:49:51 can you do you wanna i can i'm just
0:49:53 getting over the fact that you're
0:49:54 defacing my car again i'll put it back
0:49:57 these just pop in and out mm-hmm it's
0:49:59 certainly not enough for a plank though
0:50:01 i know it's gonna i'm gonna have to be
0:50:02 like uh it's gonna trickle through his
0:50:03 fingers what if you don't matter what if
0:50:05 we use one of these empty jars no okay
0:50:07 um
0:50:08 i don't know how those were touched by
0:50:10 set type magic i don't know how that
0:50:12 went into play and i i don't want to
0:50:13 that was not the if we have a larger
0:50:14 vessel but
0:50:16 you know
0:50:17 you know unless you're like sure i'm
0:50:19 sure we have stuff i mean my hands would
0:50:21 be fine i just this helps to okay
0:50:23 whenever you do what you need to do make
0:50:25 a decision okay just yeah here and he
0:50:27 cups his hands out but and puts the
0:50:29 ashtray thing in the middle so it's
0:50:31 clearly gonna spill over but johnny do
0:50:33 you need us to move away for what this
0:50:36 do what you want thank you he puts his
0:50:38 hands out towards miles so i will pull
0:50:40 my katana i step out i step out it's
0:50:43 going to be a little bit harder because
0:50:44 it's snowing right so i i cut myself and
0:50:48 will into his
0:50:50 okay neil looks up towards the heavens
0:50:53 and like tries to see what he can of the
0:50:55 sky through the snow so i will make the
0:50:57 roll it's not a penalty i will spend the
0:50:59 willpower that i just gave back i really
0:51:00 hope i don't [ __ ] this roll up because
0:51:02 then i would be super embarrassed that i
0:51:03 took your blood away
0:51:06 i won't know the difference
0:51:10 it's an increased difficulty
0:51:13 so all those sixes don't [ __ ] mean
0:51:15 anything unfortunately so three
0:51:17 successes so you will have three
0:51:19 temporary willpower for this fight
0:51:21 that you can spend it goes away after
0:51:22 the out of the fight uh so neil looks
0:51:25 the sky lets the blood like trickle
0:51:27 through his fingers and trances out the
0:51:30 hunting and capture of vito santosa when
0:51:32 is the time for miles to act
0:51:36 it's tonight it's still tonight it's
0:51:37 fine tonight is the night
0:51:39 um okay
0:51:41 i don't know
0:51:42 i don't know if
0:51:44 you could feel it miles
0:51:46 i don't know if you feel it
0:51:48 but
0:51:50 uh that happens i've spoken and he
0:51:52 starts like looking around like wiping
0:51:54 his hands off in the snow i don't know
0:51:55 what it feels like on the other side i
0:51:58 don't know either but
0:51:59 i'm sure it'll work i hope so i hope
0:52:02 that wasn't for nothing when do you know
0:52:03 this area at all not well i know
0:52:06 raven sent a bunch of animal scouts to
0:52:09 this area not a lot of street lighting
0:52:11 but the
0:52:11 houses are kind of close together so
0:52:13 whatever we do it's on our part it needs
0:52:16 to be quiet look you lead us there okay
0:52:19 oh not to throw myself more under the
0:52:21 bus but this is the first time deronke
0:52:22 has been practicing from those two
0:52:24 doesn't feel [ __ ] shitty uh yes it uh
0:52:27 i mean johnny
0:52:29 stepped away and basically gets the same
0:52:32 feeling he got that he would have
0:52:33 expected to get watching you channel
0:52:36 these the powers of these ancient
0:52:39 long lost gods
0:52:41 brito watches out the window what if
0:52:43 anything does that gross feeling
0:52:45 continue
0:52:47 no to you this is
0:52:49 pretty standard preparation for a job
0:52:53 you kind of get the sensation like yeah
0:52:55 this is
0:52:56 this is just another mission we did just
0:52:59 finish one looking around is there a
0:53:01 spiritual presence here at all uh
0:53:03 spirits are kind of drawn to this this
0:53:06 sacrifice of blood that he makes and so
0:53:08 you can definitely there's like this
0:53:11 creepy look up pulse through the spirit
0:53:13 realm when he cast his magic they do
0:53:15 they all do the creepy thing where they
0:53:16 all stop and look up yeah okay uh does
0:53:19 it look like
0:53:20 uh zentosa had any any spirits at his
0:53:22 place you guys aren't close enough yet
0:53:24 okay so moving forward
