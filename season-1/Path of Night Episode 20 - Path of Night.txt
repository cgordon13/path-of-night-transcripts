0:01:05 and now the season finale of path of
0:01:08 night
0:01:09 [Music]
0:01:12 it's at this point that the group of you
0:01:14 can hear this booming howl that echoes
0:01:17 through the elysium shrieks of panic and
0:01:20 people start running
0:01:22 in front of you each of you is a piece
0:01:26 of paper based on where you are
0:01:28 positioned and what paths you had access
0:01:31 to i need you to mark off a selection of
0:01:35 names that are on that list and choose
0:01:37 which name you're headed to for each of
0:01:39 you there's the option of simply going
0:01:42 out the massive entrance that has been
0:01:44 created and simply leaving the elysium
0:01:47 so i want all of you to pick which one
0:01:49 it's going to be and when you've picked
0:01:52 go ahead and place it down in front of
0:01:53 you and then i'm going to go around the
0:01:56 table and you're going to say who it is
0:01:58 and then we're going to begin scenes
0:02:00 regarding that so first
0:02:03 is miles
0:02:05 tell me where you're going i'm staying
0:02:06 here with the domain specifically headed
0:02:08 to the lupine all right so the group if
0:02:10 you see miles
0:02:12 kind of like and what little bit of
0:02:13 light there is rush in the direction of
0:02:16 the tarp that has something growing to a
0:02:19 very very large size underneath it when
0:02:22 you're headed to
0:02:23 i don't intend to engage reefs in combat
0:02:26 but i'm heading to him first and then
0:02:28 i'm escaping when it's headed for Reiss
0:02:30 you start you slip past the crowd of
0:02:32 Brujah they're now kind of in the midst
0:02:34 of a panic
0:02:35 and you start making your way to Reiss
0:02:36 who is actively fleeing this area so
0:02:38 you're gonna have to chase him that's
0:02:40 fine Britta who has will follow quote
0:02:42 unquote follow the plan there was not a
0:02:43 plan
0:02:49 so therefore
0:02:50 uh is going to escape
0:02:53 that's what neil said that is the
0:02:54 semblance of a plan

0:06:48 that are already nearby tutorial one of
0:06:51 the brouhah thugs the first torridor you
0:06:53 immediately recognize as romeo the first
0:06:56 toryador is instantly shredded so
0:06:59 just gets romeo is just ripped apart not
0:07:02 not romeo okay okay the first toy reader
0:07:04 is shredded i was laughing as it bites
0:07:06 it shakes his head the person's head
0:07:09 comes clean off they collapse into like
0:07:12 just rotting corpse it then turns and
0:07:14 does the exact same thing to romeo romeo
0:07:17 is dead then it turns to one of the
0:07:20 Brujah and with its claws crushes the
0:07:24 brewhawk straight to the ground
0:07:26 shredding it and turning it into a smear
0:07:28 on the dirt uh it is now just the true
0:07:30 review and uh this monster as people are
0:07:34 beginning to flee uh has three
0:07:36 additional actions this round and it
0:07:38 just kind of turns
0:07:40 snarls and the two of you can see the
0:07:42 glint of these like yellow shining
0:07:44 wolves eyes this is the worst i told you
0:07:46 so ever
0:07:47 he is done
0:07:49 then elsa just goes limp staring at this
0:07:53 monster eyes wide and just kind of
0:07:56 waiting to die next we go to initiative
0:07:58 19 meal okay uh i have a hand on her
0:08:02 wrist and she's going limp and i'm just
0:08:05 um basically dragging her along here's a
0:08:08 question about this place because i hang
0:08:09 out here and shaw and the other nos come
0:08:12 here a lot is there sewage access uh way
0:08:14 out back yes okay i start dragging her
0:08:17 immediately just trying my best come on
0:08:20 elsa elsa i need you to listen to me i
0:08:22 need you to get a little more panicky
0:08:24 than you are right now but like in a
0:08:26 productive way
0:08:27 come on come on we're gonna go and i'm
0:08:29 just dragging her and while we're going
0:08:31 i'm going to try and passion her to be a
0:08:34 little bit more alert productively
0:08:36 freaked out if that makes sense yes it
0:08:37 does you know we're on elysium i know
0:08:39 it's not okay but this is an emergency
0:08:41 there's not a whole lot okay happening
0:08:42 on this i don't think the keeper is
0:08:43 going to catch you on youtube
0:08:45 we'll find out
0:08:47 oh and i really need this to go off so
0:08:48 i'm going to blow willpower i need her
0:08:50 to listen to me understood what's the
0:08:52 diff it's her humanity rating so i'll
0:08:55 just show you the dice because you don't
0:08:56 have to tell me that succeed uh
0:08:58 for the next week she'll uh she's gonna
0:09:00 be jacked up yeah she'll be a little
0:09:02 jittery but at least hopefully
0:09:04 pliable and i look right in the eyes we
0:09:06 have to go i know a way out of here she
0:09:09 gives you a fast nod and
0:09:11 she's ready to go okay i'm not gonna let
0:09:13 go over wrists because i don't want her
0:09:14 panic too much and Celerity away from me
0:09:16 and leave me for dead she will uh run
0:09:19 with you and as i'm running obviously
0:09:20 i'm gonna be like panicked looking
0:09:22 around in this crowd trying to find my
0:09:23 friends so i can yell at them but i
0:09:25 assume they're just all [ __ ] uh you
0:09:27 pretty quickly see miles and johnny
0:09:30 rushing to throw down with the lupa no
0:09:32 no run
0:09:34 i told you to run
0:09:41 uh we go to
0:09:44 18 sing what is going on
0:09:47 Reiss begins to levitate off the ground
0:09:51 and flies up towards like the chandelier
0:09:55 area watching the uh chaos but staying
0:09:58 safely away from the lupine is there any
0:10:00 way to grab that you'd have to make a
0:10:01 jump check in order to try to get to him
0:10:03 but that is that is the thing you can
0:10:05 pursue uh as a matter of fact
0:10:07 we're gonna go to wynn and miles who are
0:10:10 both acting on a 16 the two of you care
0:10:12 which one goes first you can go first
0:10:14 because i'm gonna look at johnny is like
0:10:16 are we doing this or are we getting the
0:10:17 [ __ ] out of here johnny's prepared to
0:10:19 fight the thing are you is that dominate
0:10:21 his [ __ ] ass to run
0:10:24 uh i am in fact gonna make that jump
0:10:26 check to grab Reiss okay uh i need a
0:10:29 strength plus athletics the difficulty
0:10:32 is four he is about 20 yards away uh
0:10:35 you're gonna want a pretty decent number
0:10:36 of successes in order to get there
0:10:37 remember if you have potents does that
0:10:39 add to this i do not have potency i am
0:10:41 spending a willpower for success
0:10:45 two yards off could she get to the
0:10:47 chandelier instead of raising one more
0:10:49 give me the exposed athletics to hold on
0:10:50 to the chandelier the ca strategy oh
0:10:52 being up there not a terrible idea
0:10:57 six to grab the chandelier six yeah easy
0:10:59 i know i said i really wanted to kick
0:11:01 the cenotals dick off
0:11:03 that was before the werewolf showed up i
0:11:05 just want to try and larceny that
0:11:07 whistle out of his pocket so i mean
0:11:08 werewolves change priorities i totally
0:11:10 get it
0:11:16 we go to Britta you are going to make it
0:11:18 out past the doors before you kind of
0:11:20 like realize that they're not with you
0:11:22 and then like you'll turn around and see
0:11:24 like ah [ __ ] they ran towards the danger
0:11:27 okay but i do have the guns that johnny
0:11:29 dropped yes
0:11:31 so you rush outside out there there are
0:11:33 a couple of Brujah that are just fleeing
0:11:35 at celebrity speeds down the street out
0:11:37 in front where those guys that were kind
0:11:40 of dressed like big constantine fans
0:11:42 one of them is on the ground making like
0:11:44 disgusting squelching like noises as
0:11:47 crouched over him with a hoodie with
0:11:50 sleeves rolled up to the elbows and like
0:11:53 greasy hair that hangs is just this
0:11:57 person that's like holding them
0:11:59 shaking their face wildly ripping his
0:12:02 throat apart and this
0:12:03 this premiere is
0:12:05 very dead and they have these like kind
0:12:08 of pointed curved dog-like ears
0:12:11 and they kind of look up at you with
0:12:14 eyes glowing red and a mouth covered in
0:12:16 gore
0:12:17 so i assume i do not recognize that this
0:12:20 is a
0:12:21 but i get the impression this is a
0:12:23 monster this is not a loophole it's not
0:12:24 a leap line they are not a local
0:12:27 and this thing that is clearly some sort
0:12:29 of like urban gangrel bears its fangs
0:12:32 and hisses at you do they appear to be
0:12:34 more there does not appear to be more
0:12:36 yeah
0:12:47 we'll catch up later
0:12:55 don't worry i have the answer to all
0:12:56 your secrets all my organs
0:12:59 sorry oh no no no i'm just thinking
0:13:01 about how my urge to murder is so much
0:13:04 higher than it would have been without
0:13:05 that interaction
0:13:07 um
0:13:09 okay
0:13:11 so i'm going to
0:13:12 try to dread gaze him into the elysium
0:13:15 oh you can't pick a direction you can
0:13:17 just make it flee you okay you can make
0:13:19 yourself still a good choice
0:13:22 my intention
0:13:23 my intention is to spend a willpower on
0:13:25 this you're going to roll chromosome
0:13:26 plus intimidation uh plus one automatic
0:13:28 success for having spent a point will
0:13:29 power yeah your difficulty for this roll
0:13:31 is eight okay
0:13:34 for success damn these are nice sites
0:13:37 continues to be on fire don't be mean to
0:13:39 these dice i like them we're not mean to
0:13:40 them they just don't like us back all
0:13:43 right you never give them a chance how
0:13:44 do you reveal your monstrous continents
0:13:46 to the vampire well i have just gotten a
0:13:48 large source of inspiration from a
0:13:51 vicious looking lupine in there who
0:13:53 seemed to what was his first action to
0:13:56 shred into my only hope of finding my
0:13:58 identity further that was the second
0:13:59 section the second action i'm sorry
0:14:06 so
0:14:07 my immediate first impulse as Britta in
0:14:10 this situation when i see this gnarly
0:14:12 looking Gangrel standing in my way
0:14:14 hissing at me is to mimic the werewolf
0:14:17 in my own vampiric way to bare my teeth
0:14:21 and
0:14:22 snap as if ripping i'm ready to rip off
0:14:25 flesh and i my eyes show through their
0:14:28 vampire quality you can kind of almost
0:14:30 sense like the temperature issue in me
0:14:33 like you know how when something's
0:14:35 really cold or really hot like the air
0:14:37 changes you can't feel it yeah like my
0:14:40 hands look wrong it looks up at you kind
0:14:42 of like still like crown crouched down
0:14:44 into tonjes and it makes a sound that's
0:14:47 some sort of a cross between like like a
0:14:49 big new york city rat and like an alley
0:14:52 cat and squeal hisses it's way across
0:14:55 the street and away from you
0:15:03 i look at you and you just like
0:15:05 give well nod to each other then i'll
0:15:07 just go for it and you're moving at the
0:15:09 same time glance passes back and forth
0:15:11 between mile and johnny like hey man
0:15:13 it's been a good ride let's do this
0:15:17 i can pump to
0:15:19 eight decks five strengths okay
0:15:26 be five successes okay with five
0:15:28 successes you grab hold of this massive
0:15:31 lupine hopping onto its back
0:15:33 grabbing like onto its like cheeks and
0:15:36 main it is so muscular that it feels
0:15:40 like you're grabbing onto just a spool
0:15:42 of like thick knotted rope like just
0:15:45 there's just no give from its muscles
0:15:47 kill it
0:15:50 and you can feel the heat of its body
0:15:52 like it's this is just it is an
0:15:54 absolutely terrifying experience your
0:15:57 beast is begging for you to let go
0:16:00 turn and if it kills you [ __ ] it at
0:16:02 least the fear is gone
0:16:04 um and you hold on
0:16:06 johnny miles is holding on to this thing
0:16:09 and it looks at you its teeth are about
0:16:12 as long as the distance between your
0:16:14 brow and your chin its lips curl back
0:16:17 and when it growls
0:16:19 uh you know that feeling you get when
0:16:20 you're like right by an amp and that
0:16:22 like oh yeah like the sound kind of like
0:16:25 goes through you yep it's growl goes
0:16:28 through you
0:16:30 from out behind his back two little
0:16:32 silver blades are sticking out of big
0:16:34 meaty fists and he rushes into the thing
0:16:37 and starts just putting blades in what
0:16:40 he thinks are the weak spots
0:16:42 this is this is just a big hairy guy
0:16:44 he's just telling himself this is just a
0:16:45 big hairy person but they still got they
0:16:48 still got arteries they still got
0:16:50 tendons and we're still just gonna stab
0:16:52 those and just make him bleed as much of
0:16:54 his blood as he can and hopefully these
0:16:56 silver knives that that when insisted
0:16:58 are this thing is allergic to are gonna
0:17:01 carry the day for him he is going to
0:17:03 stab it as many times as he can and he's
0:17:05 not going to stop until it stops moving
0:17:07 okay don't you miles helping you gives
0:17:09 you access to its vulnerable point so
0:17:11 you're going to be able to add a plus
0:17:12 two dive bonus to your total attack pool
0:17:14 before you divide it okay i'm dex six
0:17:16 currently
0:17:17 um i have three mainland okay
0:17:21 two more dice is 11 dice altogether yes
0:17:24 and i'm can i split it three ways yes
0:17:27 you have to divide into three very small
0:17:28 pools okay so that's three dice four
0:17:30 dice than four dice yes your difficulty
0:17:32 for this attack is five okay are you
0:17:34 doing anything with your potents yes i'm
0:17:36 going to uh i'm i'm going to take my
0:17:38 potents and spend blood to make it
0:17:40 automatic points of uh damage sounds
0:17:42 great now do i do that for each attack
0:17:44 you do that for the round perfect
0:17:46 the first attack three dice i'm going to
0:17:48 spend a point of willpower to get an
0:17:49 automatic success okay
0:17:52 that is three successes
0:17:54 oh no i'm sorry uh four successes
0:17:56 because you said five right three carry
0:17:57 over into damage i'm gonna do all the
0:17:59 attacks first and then roll the damage
0:18:01 hey man
0:18:02 these may well be your last attacks so
0:18:04 you may do them in the order of your
0:18:05 choosing uh next one uh spending a point
0:18:08 of willpower okay uh i am out of
0:18:10 willpower okay um
0:18:15 they are subtly different that is one
0:18:17 success
0:18:18 success
0:18:19 right yeah but that's a one so that that
0:18:21 does that kills that success give me uh
0:18:23 your last attack
0:18:25 and then the last attack unassisted by
0:18:27 willpower
0:18:30 boy oh baby um i am swift
0:18:34 so i'm guessing that those explode
0:18:36 correct they do which means they're two
0:18:37 successes oh just two you don't roll
0:18:39 they're too successful that's five
0:18:41 successes okay uh why don't you give me
0:18:43 three damage rules okay yes johnny so
0:18:46 the first one we said two carryover yes
0:18:48 i have a strength of five currently i
0:18:52 didn't bump it all the way to six to
0:18:54 carry over plus five and then the weapon
0:18:56 this the knife does one additional die
0:18:59 or no just it just lets me because
0:19:01 they're not proper knives yep fair
0:19:03 enough
0:19:07 let's see that in a second
0:19:09 so that's six seven
0:19:11 plus four that's eleven okay give me
0:19:14 next damage this next one no carried
0:19:16 over
0:19:20 pause you carve into the first time
0:19:23 and your wounds dig
0:19:25 deep it staggers uh for a moment it
0:19:28 seems that you have this thing
0:19:30 dead to rights and you cut into it and
0:19:33 blood starts to spray everywhere so you
0:19:36 know that you struck true and for a
0:19:38 moment it seems like this thing might
0:19:41 die but before it does it takes a step
0:19:44 back shakes its head doubles down
0:19:47 snarling and rushes in for more the
0:19:50 wound you dealt it
0:19:52 closes completely
0:19:54 next damage
0:19:59 uh six more uh damage okay and last
0:20:02 damage rule and this one four carried
0:20:04 over correct yep this is so scary
0:20:10 it rolls very well
0:20:12 ten more damage jesus okay you get arms
0:20:16 deep up in the thing cutting and and
0:20:19 carving and it kind of like grabs on and
0:20:22 you can feel these hands
0:20:24 that are as big as your chest kind of
0:20:28 grab on like like it intends to just
0:20:30 pull you to pieces
0:20:32 and it just
0:20:34 slows down and the engine of death kind
0:20:37 of falls
0:20:39 over slumped onto the ground with its
0:20:41 tongue hanging out of its mouth
0:20:43 over the course of just moments
0:20:46 this rage monster
0:20:48 changes shape and uh after after that
0:20:52 like a rather kind of like gruesome
0:20:54 shifting of bones and flesh laying on
0:20:57 the ground is this young woman with
0:21:00 blonde hair
0:21:02 and like freckles on her face she can't
0:21:04 be older than like 16 years old just
0:21:07 carved up and dead on the ground
0:21:13 [Music]
0:21:16 next action
0:21:17 did you say next action yes oh my god
0:21:24 tim
0:21:25 rolling against the stake
0:21:28 okay three
0:21:33 one two three four
0:21:35 five ten lethal
0:21:36 tim
0:21:37 [Music]
0:21:38 you will take seven levels of lethal
0:21:40 damage as a stake presses up through
0:21:43 your heart and you can kind of like see
0:21:45 and are paralyzed there and dropping you
0:21:48 down at his side is shaw staring at
0:21:52 johnny
0:21:58 you should have stayed out of my way
0:22:00 johnny buddy i hope you have celerity i
0:22:03 do
0:22:05 [Laughter]
0:22:09 he kind of looks at you while you're
0:22:11 rocking your knives he's brandishing
0:22:12 another steak
0:22:14 in terms of extra actions it is Reiss at
0:22:17 the top who has not used his celerity uh
0:22:20 berta did you take any extra actions
0:22:21 this round i have two celerity actions
0:22:24 remaining so you have two celebrity
0:22:26 actions at this point oh my god thank
0:22:28 god
0:22:34 can you see what happened here i don't
0:22:36 know so you turn yeah and you saw uh
0:22:40 johnny go
0:22:42 toe-to-toe with a lupine and kill him
0:22:44 hell yeah uh with miles wrestling and
0:22:47 holding it in place long enough for like
0:22:50 [ __ ]
0:22:51 piccolo's special beam cannon
0:22:53 yeah and uh
0:22:58 but when it's done you do see
0:23:00 miles lifted up off the ground with a
0:23:02 stake through his chest uh when you see
0:23:05 shaw
0:23:06 here's something of like a glimmer and
0:23:09 is hard to physically keep track of
0:23:11 interesting and that okay uh does that
0:23:15 look like the effect that neil was able
0:23:17 to get rid of using lights with the um
0:23:20 the truck headlights he was able to get
0:23:22 rid of straight up ski okay this is a
0:23:24 strange glimmer this is uh not something
0:23:27 superior skill with obviously then to
0:23:30 what neil has demonstrated in the past
0:23:31 well i want to attack him yeah nasty is
0:23:34 that okay uh give me a perception of
0:23:35 this awareness okay
0:23:36 i am spending a will power uh it's not
0:23:39 bad if you run out of welfare correct no
0:23:41 it just means you guys are [ __ ]
0:23:43 i'm spending one running
0:23:46 all right
0:23:48 three successes or four four sorry you
0:23:50 can attack them without taking the minus
0:23:52 with the without the plus two difficulty
0:23:53 okay i'm using the pistols
0:23:56 um i'll aim for the head and increase
0:23:58 the difficulty yeah the reason that the
0:23:59 obfuscate helps them is because it makes
0:24:01 aim for the head like not
0:24:03 i'm gonna spend my last willpower okay
0:24:05 all in for johnny
0:24:08 difficulty eat okay
0:24:10 god damn britta oh my god
0:24:13 one pop jaw in the face i'm gonna ah
0:24:15 it's gonna be so cool
0:24:18 here's that other action to pop really
0:24:19 so i have five successes
0:24:22 all right cool four carryover it's a
0:24:23 damage dice and you get an additional
0:24:25 damage die for shooting him in the head
0:24:26 okay a lot more if it had been a rifle
0:24:29 yes would it be real hard to
0:24:34 look we'll work on that costume later uh
0:24:36 i don't believe sharpshooter applies
0:24:37 because it's a it's a pistol right sure
0:24:38 if you're you you aim specifically for a
0:24:41 head target yeah okay
0:24:42 shooter
0:24:43 oh shoot i had something
0:24:47 okay
0:24:50 that is five uh you will deal a point of
0:24:53 lethal damage
0:24:54 johnny and shaw have these same
0:24:55 initiatives
0:24:57 that means you guys are attacking each
0:24:58 other simultaneously i'm just going to
0:25:00 avoid him with celerity okay give me the
0:25:02 next plessage
0:25:06 six successes three he goes to ju and
0:25:09 you definitely weave out of the way of
0:25:10 the attack
0:25:12 britta do you have any celebrity actions
0:25:13 left i have one remaining celerity
0:25:15 action
0:25:16 what are you doing with it
0:25:18 i think i'm just shooting him give me an
0:25:19 attack one just like before okay uh give
0:25:22 me a perception plus awareness
0:25:24 difficulty eight minus zero specs
0:25:29 that would be two successes good you
0:25:31 attack without penalty okay give me your
0:25:33 attack rule okay head for lethal
0:25:35 difficulty eat
0:25:39 i think i botched this i have no eights
0:25:42 and i have a one Britta
0:25:44 gun and
0:25:45 jams lovely how many celebrity actions
0:25:48 you have he's out i grab him
0:25:51 you're done old man
0:25:54 too slow and johnny leaps on top of uh
0:25:57 shaw okay let's see if i can get him now
0:25:59 [Music]
0:26:00 that's three successes to grab him
0:26:02 grabbed a
0:26:04 new round uh i'm not spending any
0:26:06 celerity i will spend
0:26:09 one celebrity
0:26:15 race Reiss attacking me johnny yeah lose
0:26:18 nine blood
0:26:19 and a stream of vitae
0:26:22 leaves your body and go straight to Reiss
0:26:27 uh no three blood sure i need you to
0:26:29 make a hunger frenzy check
0:26:31 oh he's holding somebody
0:26:34 uh what's the uh
0:26:36 that's
0:26:38 uh yes but your maximum dice pool is
0:26:40 you're based on your blood pool so if
0:26:42 you're at zero pool you have zero dice
0:26:44 so
0:26:45 so you're spending a point of willpower
0:26:46 to not frenzy i haven't heard balancing
0:26:48 are you spending a pointable part or not
0:26:50 frenzy or no johnny's frenzying all day
0:26:52 all right
0:26:54 ate it i got racist super threw [ __ ]
0:26:58 shaw under the bus
0:27:03 uh dual thought action all right so [ __ ]
0:27:05 this guy
0:27:06 he's dominating me yes
0:27:08 he points at shaw
0:27:10 kill
0:27:11 i'll spend a while after this
0:27:15 okay he has five successes okay uh he
0:27:17 does that he dominates you and just kind
0:27:19 of lands over on the balcony
0:27:22 and it looks like he plans on just kind
0:27:24 of walking away all right i dropped from
0:27:26 the chandelier onto shaw uh popping
0:27:28 claws on the way all right give me a
0:27:30 secret
0:27:32 uh six okay five carryover oh don't kill
0:27:36 him
0:27:36 yeah that's really bad which is what
0:27:38 Reiss wants yeah i know yep not my
0:27:40 choice buddy
0:27:42 uh five damage okay he
0:27:45 he's gonna have to actually roll
0:27:46 self-control
0:27:49 okay he maintains awareness so he's
0:27:53 gonna take four ag on the plus side i
0:27:55 don't think he and Reiss are friends
0:27:56 anymore
0:28:00 okay so that was uh win on 16. uh johnny
0:28:05 are you 14 you're 14 now yep so you and
0:28:09 uh britta are going at the same time
0:28:11 that change initiative that i only spent
0:28:13 one for Celerity i don't remember how
0:28:15 yes bertie you're up what are you doing
0:28:17 uh well
0:28:20 you see a wild feral looking johnny's
0:28:23 face as his fangs distend and his eyes
0:28:28 kind of just go glassy probably reminds
0:28:31 you slightly of the uh of the horrifying
0:28:34 city gangrel that you just saw
0:28:36 true
0:28:37 uh both of these two are frenzying on
0:28:39 shaw correct
0:28:40 is not in forensic not in french
0:28:42 but i have deviated from pursuing Reiss
0:28:45 i'm aware uh that
0:28:48 also Reiss is like pretty overt he's
0:28:50 late he's actually yeah he's floating
0:28:52 through the area
0:28:53 so some context questions uh is anyone
0:28:56 else still around or did everyone just
0:28:58 [ __ ] dip
0:29:00 i mean like like in like four years
0:29:02 we hired
0:29:03 mid-dip okay so and there are broad
0:29:05 settings fighting each other for no
0:29:07 [ __ ] that's me
0:29:09 i was the kind of a sorcerer and i ain't
0:29:11 seen that [ __ ] back up they're going
0:29:13 i don't think i can shoot out Reiss but
0:29:16 you got two shots before he disappears
0:29:18 he's already taken his action [ __ ] it
0:29:19 let's try
0:29:22 that's my first instinct so i'm going
0:29:24 with it
0:29:25 maybe i'll bring some concentration
0:29:27 magic
0:29:28 i don't think it works that way
0:29:32 i should declare whether or not i'm
0:29:33 aiming for the head i am aiming for the
0:29:36 head
0:29:38 that is
0:29:40 wash okay
0:29:42 he kind of looks back at you like
0:29:45 like how like a father regards a child
0:29:47 when they like do something silly
0:29:49 and then he just kind of continues
0:29:51 on his way so then we go to
0:29:56 uh johnny do you have him grappled i
0:29:59 feed
0:30:00 great gain three blood is that yes does
0:30:03 that do any damage was that does that do
0:30:05 it does not okay does that blood bound
0:30:07 you to shaw one step yep what do i
0:30:09 usually i can't stop thinking about him
0:30:14 fast
0:30:17 i want to be in
0:30:18 in with him all the time uh shaw is
0:30:20 gonna attempt to break the gap oh yeah
0:30:21 absolutely
0:30:22 because he can [ __ ] disappear uh and
0:30:24 he's yeah he's gonna be splitting his
0:30:25 high school but he is
0:30:28 injured
0:30:29 so that is down that he is down some
0:30:30 knights he will spend a point of power
0:30:32 to ignore when penalties all right
0:30:34 actually no he'll instead spend
0:30:35 pointable power for uh an automatic
0:30:37 success can you spend blood to add
0:30:39 automatic successes to phones he did he
0:30:41 did so i will as well i'm not letting
0:30:43 him go
0:30:45 [Music]
0:30:47 so we're looking at five four nine
0:30:50 successes to hold him there uh you hold
0:30:53 uh beats his seven
0:30:54 you can feel him kind of like
0:30:56 struggle to break free
0:30:58 but at this point you're like ravenous
0:31:00 and lost into like
0:31:02 your desire to eat him yeah
0:31:04 after uh shaw we go to celebrity actions
0:31:07 i have one who's shooting that shoot
0:31:10 shaw he dies
0:31:13 if i if that goes through so i guess i'm
0:31:14 just shooting Reiss again it's a bad
0:31:16 idea but good idea
0:31:19 shooting someone is the right one
0:31:21 working gun right now yeah i figure when
0:31:24 the other one jammed she probably just
0:31:25 like tossed it over her shoulder i mean
0:31:27 you have two yeah my girl
0:31:38 [Laughter]
0:31:44 it's like a [ __ ] six hundred dollar
0:31:46 pistol it's jammed it's worth nothing
0:31:49 it's still worth the trip okay so two
0:31:52 for on spencerity
0:31:54 four for dexterity and five for fire i
0:31:57 do declare aiming for the head for
0:31:58 lethal
0:32:02 [Music]
0:32:08 three three okay he takes two lethal he
0:32:11 kind of stumbles forward grabbing his
0:32:12 bleeding head
0:32:14 okay we go to the top of initiative uh
0:32:16 Reiss goes
0:32:21 shaw loses nine traits of blood
0:32:24 a stream of blood comes from him to
0:32:28 Reiss
0:32:29 shaw immediately enters hunger frenzy

0:37:03 from Reiss done uh the whistle is there
0:37:06 it is
0:37:07 just barely dinged from a pellet from a
0:37:09 shotgun okay but is otherwise a-okay and
0:37:12 i kind of put my hand up for weathers
0:37:15 to kind of hold for a second
0:37:16 is joey still there
0:37:18 yes joey come here buddy he like and i
0:37:20 just take him away gives you a hug and
0:37:23 i
0:37:23 weathers i don't care what you do to him
0:37:25 you're the [ __ ] sheriff it's a suit
0:37:29 during this conversation it kind of like
0:37:30 gives the human kind of like a sad look
0:37:33 knowing that this person is very dead
0:37:36 and he just kind of levels the shotgun
0:37:38 and finishes what he started drawing
0:37:40 this conversation i'm going to go over
0:37:42 and on stick miles done
0:37:45 very carefully but it's not certain how
0:37:47 this works she recognizes the wood stake
0:37:50 right by the heart so she'll
0:37:52 pop it out
0:37:54 what happens i have the willpower yeah
0:37:56 done and i can spend the blood to heal
0:37:58 yep
0:38:00 smiles is the lupine like right next to
0:38:03 me yeah yeah i eat on that too
0:38:06 i mean it's a buffet we all need blood
0:38:09 honestly like either this young woman
0:38:11 who is dead on the ground
0:38:13 was a musician or because of her
0:38:16 supernatural nature you are able to draw
0:38:18 vitae from her i feel like i don't even
0:38:20 care
0:38:21 what she has important thing when you
0:38:23 mark off these boxes you do not draw a
0:38:26 dash you draw an x
0:38:28 it is actually specifically different
0:38:30 because every point of blood you take is
0:38:32 doubled
0:38:33 so that x
0:38:35 counts as two blood when you spend it
0:38:37 and
0:38:38 there are mechanical advantages that
0:38:40 happen when you do so so please keep
0:38:43 that in mind and also we need to keep
0:38:44 track of how many traits of this monster
0:38:46 blood you have inside of you my
0:38:47 intention is to go and feed off of the
0:38:50 cool suit if it doesn't appear to have
0:38:52 done uh so i don't know how many traits
0:38:54 i'd get from that it has a treats
0:38:55 remaining okay you guys start moving
0:38:57 around feeding various chaos
0:39:00 outside it is a [ __ ] masquerade
0:39:04 disaster that is taking place in
0:39:05 downtown new haven i will pull out the
0:39:07 cell phone that my smiles gave me you
0:39:09 don't have a cell phone to you
0:39:11 you do okay i will text uh neil lupine
0:39:14 dead
0:39:17 [Music]
0:39:20 neil did you get outside i'll back one
0:39:22 thing you see is gene
0:39:25 driving away
0:39:26 with a young woman who looks an awful
0:39:28 lot like johnny and they
0:39:30 peel out and are bailing
0:39:32 so there's kind of like this moment of
0:39:33 like
0:39:34 relief
0:39:36 okay
0:39:38 it is then that you get a pretty bad
0:39:40 feeling
0:39:41 kind of casually approaching
0:39:43 is a mexican woman
0:39:46 who is wearing a leather jacket and
0:39:48 jeans with boots that come up to the
0:39:50 knees
0:39:51 or on her neck hangs this like
0:39:54 silver pen that makes some sort of like
0:39:56 spiked ankh
0:39:58 and
0:39:59 at her flanks
0:40:01 are four
0:40:03 despicable like greasy ugly vampiric
0:40:07 things with like pointed ears and like
0:40:10 whiskers and
0:40:12 long talons
0:40:15 shadows around her
0:40:17 gather and shift causing this like
0:40:20 very dramatic flare to her arrival in
0:40:23 her hand as she approaches
0:40:26 is a like [ __ ] cutlass
0:40:31 hi
0:40:33 you knew that we would come i did
0:40:37 i'm like kind of pushing elsa back in as
0:40:41 much as i can like not obviously like
0:40:43 yeah but just if we just walked outside
0:40:45 like kind of edging her backwards
0:40:47 we came for her
0:40:49 but you might be just as valuable who do
0:40:52 i live with
0:40:55 um
0:40:59 which
0:40:59 what do you need
0:41:02 i don't know value is subjective
0:41:06 i just need a victim
0:41:08 someone who will be missed oh
0:41:12 okay
0:41:15 yeah
0:41:18 give me a second
0:41:21 she nuts
0:41:22 after like looking back at her i look
0:41:24 back at elsa when you [ __ ] first look
0:41:27 at elsa when you look back at her again
0:41:28 she's alone
0:41:30 even in her hiding senses yep
0:41:34 oh
0:41:36 okay
0:41:39 neil is still a moral person
0:41:42 and he just kind of like closes the door
0:41:45 on elsa back inside
0:41:49 and then turns around
0:41:52 hi
0:41:54 wow
0:41:56 it's okay
0:41:57 can i um
0:42:00 i don't know what's about to happen but
0:42:02 i don't really want to be here for this
0:42:03 is that is that okay
0:42:06 and he digs into his pocket and uh
0:42:09 pulls out a coin
0:42:11 and puts it into his mouth
0:42:13 and then his pupils dilate and he's not
0:42:15 really there anymore
0:42:17 you feel the khalif wash over you
0:42:19 and
0:42:21 kind of lead you to a better place
0:42:25 the last thing you
0:42:27 you see in that moment is
0:42:31 the darkness of the killing spree
0:42:34 calmly approach and everything goes dark
0:42:40 [Music]
0:42:48 we cut back to inside
0:42:50 you guys look around the elysium wind
0:42:52 just kind of looks down at uh joey do
0:42:55 you want me to get this to your mom or
0:42:57 do you want me to hold on to it
0:43:00 can i see my mom
0:43:01 we'll go say goodbye to mom i promise
0:43:03 right where does mom live
0:43:05 he starts rattling off this like little
0:43:07 address down in the suburbs by
0:43:08 wallingford
0:43:10 she kind of just writes on her jeans
0:43:12 at this point
0:43:14 thank you
0:43:15 okay buddy
0:43:16 weathers kind of lights up a cigarette
0:43:19 tosses you as pack
0:43:21 johnny kind of just puts a hand out but
0:43:23 it's still kind of just crumbled on the
0:43:24 floor everything heavy the masquerade is
0:43:27 [ __ ] out there
0:43:28 we're gonna need to get into contact
0:43:29 with the keeper and clean this [ __ ] up
0:43:32 i'll have texted neil by the time that
0:43:34 i've finished feeding off the ghoul suit
0:43:37 i assume no response at this point
0:43:39 doesn't seem odd
0:43:41 but after there's some time that passes
0:43:44 i'll try calling him
0:43:45 okay
0:43:47 hello
0:43:48 who is this you hear like a
0:43:50 kind of slight rasp of this woman's
0:43:53 voice
0:43:54 who is this calling
0:43:56 i'm looking for neil
0:43:58 he is gone
0:43:59 what kind of gone
0:44:01 who is this
0:44:02 his Coterie mate
0:44:04 it's quartering me
0:44:06 i'm very sorry about what happened to
0:44:08 him but
0:44:09 your city
0:44:11 has been chosen
0:44:14 for crusade
0:44:16 and so
0:44:18 the blood
0:44:19 of those who reject cain must flow until
0:44:22 your sins
0:44:24 are made right and you are absolved
0:44:27 who are you
0:44:29 i am but
0:44:30 one piece of a greater whole
0:44:33 but we
0:44:34 are the killing spree
0:44:36 and what does neil have to do with this
0:44:39 he is but one more sinner why him his
0:44:42 faith is the same as
0:44:45 all who oppose this sort of cain
0:44:48 he is not unique he is simply
0:44:52 gifted with absolution before what comes
0:44:56 he does not have to see his friends
0:44:58 suffer
0:44:59 what will be done to them the way they
0:45:01 will be vivisected
0:45:02 and devoured
0:45:06 what do you mean
0:45:07 gone she hangs up
0:45:10 run over to whoever is closest
0:45:13 i am probably still up with the meat
0:45:15 suit and the little boy you are handling
0:45:17 joey johnny is just on the floor down by
0:45:19 where the werewolf is
0:45:21 and where shaw's remains are smoking a
0:45:23 cigarette just kind of like curled up
0:45:25 covered in blood and you are getting off
0:45:28 the floor or what yeah if he by the time
0:45:30 he spent i've started straining myself
0:45:32 out and looking to find my cell phone
0:45:34 because i need to start calling the
0:45:35 media all right you are doing something
0:45:38 so the person i walk to is john and i've
0:45:40 run to rather is johnny okay and i i'm
0:45:44 brandishing the phone killing spree has
0:45:46 neil
0:45:49 uh uh your difficulties increased by
0:45:51 plus one for every point of lupine blood
0:45:53 do you have in you
0:45:55 so i'm already nine
0:45:57 and i have
0:45:58 uh six traits of lupine blood okay so
0:46:02 your div ten five success is required
0:46:04 okay
0:46:05 then i cannot possibly resist frenzy
0:46:08 there's something incredibly
0:46:09 invigorating about the lupine blood and
0:46:11 you're kind of like like being licking
0:46:13 your lips and i'm like yeah that feels
0:46:16 really good i feel like i feel pumped
0:46:18 and you get the bad news and that is
0:46:20 when the downside of this blood in your
0:46:22 system becomes
0:46:24 very apparent and everything goes red
0:46:28 you will immediately burn for Celerity
0:46:30 what that's going to do is you're going
0:46:31 to spend one blood or an additional
0:46:33 action on celerity yep and to add your
0:46:35 potence to all of your damage rolls for
0:46:37 the round because every point of the
0:46:39 lupine blood you spend counts as two an
0:46:41 ish
0:46:42 oh come on jesus
0:46:45 is this understanding yeah is this a new
0:46:47 scene it is not okay nobody
0:46:50 i'm plus threes uh celerity and potents
0:46:53 yep jesus christ am i able to spend a
0:46:56 blood to beef up a stat or is there no
0:46:58 warning no
0:46:59 you can you can see it when he goes
0:47:01 dead-eyed and like freaks out i am
0:47:03 spending four
0:47:05 three celerity rounds okay miles what
0:47:07 you doing uh has it been three rounds
0:47:09 since i pumped to eight decks yes okay
0:47:13 so i'm back to six so eighteen eighteen
0:47:15 win twelve Britta seventeen johnny
0:47:17 twenty all right what is going on at
0:47:19 twenty-two full nelson get em ray johnny
0:47:22 don't or no spend for the wool fire
0:47:25 you're cranked up
0:47:28 you're all high
0:47:31 on the werewolf's blood
0:47:33 five successes to grapple you
0:47:35 yep i was right full nelson
0:47:38 hold still
0:47:39 so now it's what an opposed breakout yep
0:47:41 strength brawl uh he is spending for
0:47:43 automatic successes yeah he'll take a
0:47:45 strength to seven
0:47:48 he has five successes thank god for the
0:47:52 dice not being with me right now there
0:47:54 with you yeah exactly okay
0:47:57 uh weathers has 15 successes to hold you
0:47:59 in place oh yeah
0:48:02 just holding me by the head
0:48:04 he holds on you need to calm down um i
0:48:07 will dominate him command to be still
0:48:12 nine okay that is enough to take you out
0:48:14 of frenzy cool basically he's gonna have
0:48:15 you hold still long enough for this rage
0:48:18 to pass
0:48:19 when you start coming to again and this
0:48:21 is not like a regular frenzy where you
0:48:23 like lose control yeah you blacked out
0:48:26 and turned into a deranged monster for a
0:48:28 moment and then through some wrestling
0:48:30 and the use of disciplines they manage
0:48:33 to get you to a point where you're not
0:48:34 killing people and eventually you feel
0:48:38 weathers
0:48:39 hesitant like nervously let go of you
0:48:41 Brittain's powered up ready to uh take a
0:48:44 celerity action but when what it was
0:48:46 apparent that weather's got a good grip
0:48:48 on johnny she stood ready to move away
0:48:52 but
0:48:53 watched with wide eyes at this strange
0:48:55 frenzy that johnny's in breathing
0:48:57 heavily ragged breaths finally he's uh
0:49:00 i'm back i'm back girl okay all right
0:49:03 [ __ ] careful with that stuff
0:49:05 brutus said the killing spruce here

0:49:22 bothers outlets do they have him they
0:49:24 have him if they're here they're they're
0:49:26 not gone

0:49:30 we've got dozens of them
0:49:33 gaggle like you but not i mean they're
0:49:36 just no not like animals some strange
0:49:38 looking
0:49:39 red eyes
0:49:41 i can get the red eyes honey that's
0:49:43 that's not a thing
0:49:44 okay we've got to get out of here
0:49:46 now
0:49:50 calm down
0:49:52 right now we're indoors we're inside get
0:49:55 the lights on
0:49:56 stop
0:49:58 scrambling around is exactly what
0:50:00 happens
0:50:01 we stay together and we're still here
0:50:04 that's what's happened so far
0:50:06 so take a breather prepare yourselves we
0:50:09 knew the sabbat were coming stick
0:50:11 together neil most likely went out the
0:50:13 back door pretty solid ammo do you still
0:50:16 have elsa's number yes let me check you
0:50:18 guys keep a spot around eyes open all
0:50:21 right
0:50:22 are we turning the lights on do we want
0:50:23 people to be able to see what's in here
0:50:25 i like seeing
0:50:26 looking outside the street lights are
0:50:28 not on across the street there's no
0:50:30 power it's like
0:50:32 they
0:50:33 caught the power to a section of the
0:50:34 city and then caused mass panic we got
0:50:36 to get to a room that we can watch the
0:50:38 entrances on we're way too exposed here
0:50:41 that's true but let's check the back
0:50:43 door real quick we can make sure miles
0:50:45 trust me on this we need to get to a
0:50:47 room that we can watch the exits on if
0:50:49 we're gonna take a breather we cannot
0:50:50 stay i'm not taking a breather we're
0:50:52 going to go check the back exit he may
0:50:55 it might be around there it was quick
0:50:56 let's go do that then we can move back
0:50:58 and find a defensible position let's
0:51:00 move check in with elsa here's with her
0:51:02 and i make the call and we start moving
0:51:03 towards the back door i take a photo
0:51:06 i kind of like put us all shoulder to
0:51:08 shoulder so that we're kind of walking
0:51:09 in a square so that no one can slip in
0:51:11 behind any of us when you guys get to
0:51:13 the back
0:51:14 kind of like sitting by the back door
0:51:17 that like barricade like it's just a
0:51:18 bunch of [ __ ] kind of thrown in front of
0:51:20 it
0:51:21 is
0:51:22 elsa sitting with tears of blood
0:51:26 streaming down her cheeks just quietly
0:51:28 and delicately whimpering britta will
0:51:32 approach and sit on the ground next to
0:51:34 her
0:51:35 offer
0:51:36 some scrap of fabric to try to wipe off
0:51:39 the blood
0:51:40 neil
0:51:42 what happened
0:51:43 he saved me
0:51:46 from the killing spree
0:51:48 yes where did they take him i don't know
0:51:53 they were waiting outside the back door
0:51:56 stragglers i don't i don't know there
0:51:58 was a woman
0:51:59 she said she needed someone
0:52:02 anyone to simply be a victim as some
0:52:06 some sort of symbol and kneel
0:52:11 he shut the door and went outside to
0:52:14 them joni is a sabbat survivor
0:52:17 what might this mean them taking
0:52:19 somebody like that
0:52:21 so if she's saying that she needed a
0:52:24 victim you kind of know that is killing
0:52:26 spree mo
0:52:28 whenever the killing spree comes
0:52:30 someone you love dies
0:52:32 and it's not like a waiting thing it's
0:52:34 not like a ritualistic usually they just
0:52:36 cut them apart
0:52:37 kill them right then and there
0:52:39 there is a very good chance that on the
0:52:41 other side of that door
0:52:43 neil's still there
0:52:45 got three to resist frenzying at the
0:52:47 word victim
0:52:48 okay but she starts tearing the
0:52:51 barricade apart you start grabbing
0:52:53 there's like folding chairs all kinds of
0:52:55 [ __ ] and
0:52:57 by the time you get through it you shove
0:52:59 the steel door open and you open up to
0:53:02 this dark quiet parking lot
0:53:05 and when you do
0:53:07 there's no body
0:53:09 it's just a dark empty parking lot
0:53:12 he's not here
0:53:14 what does that mean i don't know close
0:53:16 the door pull back in where to grab elsa
0:53:19 okay shut the door rebuild the barricade
0:53:22 don't go back to the sheriff's office
0:53:24 that's pretty pretty secure what do you
0:53:26 think of it where the [ __ ] is arabella
0:53:29 we should also probably consider getting
0:53:30 back to the prince don't say anything
0:53:33 else
0:53:34 johnny uh goes back into the main hall
0:53:36 takes a look at the uh truck that ran in
0:53:39 here and smashed into the thing how bad
0:53:40 is it i mean the lights are still on you
0:53:43 kind of give it a look what do you got
0:53:45 for like car repairs or anything of the
0:53:47 like oh crafts especially give me dex
0:53:49 crafts
0:53:51 two successes with
0:53:53 two successes
0:53:54 you can get the pickup truck going
0:53:57 you can try driving out of here right
0:53:58 now
0:53:59 let's do it everybody else's fleet this
0:54:01 place there's no pla reason to stay here
0:54:03 miles
0:54:04 why didn't
0:54:06 the seneschal die like kindred because
0:54:09 he inhabited a person
0:54:10 weathers pats you on the back miles i'm

0:54:17 way i've got other people rally and i
0:54:20 need to find out what's going on you
0:54:21 want to at least ride in the back of the
0:54:22 truck to get out of this location i
0:54:24 don't think it's a good idea for us to
0:54:25 put everyone in the same spot smart move
0:54:27 you guys just stay safe you too johnny
0:54:30 reaches out and kind of like grabs the
0:54:31 other shoulders you too old man
0:54:33 he gives a nod like this might be like
0:54:35 his last conversation like just kind of
0:54:37 that kind of self-awareness
0:54:39 and then walking with purpose he goes to
0:54:41 collect elsa and get the hell out
0:54:43 oh earl
0:54:45 jane got out
0:54:48 like
0:54:48 like a light shines from behind his eyes

0:57:34 like you're in a pool of like hot water

0:57:41 small
0:57:43 delicate arms wrapped around you from
0:57:45 behind
0:57:47 with
0:57:48 almost like spindly feminine hands
0:57:51 holding you and as you kind of
0:57:53 look around you see like her darker skin
0:57:57 resting against your bare chest
0:57:59 and

0:58:03 tub of water
0:58:05 you come to in the presence of nara who
