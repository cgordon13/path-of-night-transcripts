0:00:29 last time on path of night
0:00:31 neil faxed photocopies of the mysterious
0:00:34 book of nod to arkhan peterson's office
0:00:37 johnny and other allies worked together
0:00:39 to smuggle johnny's kidnapped daughter
0:00:41 away from shaw
0:00:43 made deals with the followers of set to
0:00:45 work against seneschal Reiss shaw and
0:00:48 his massive bruja thugs
0:00:52 meanwhile
0:00:53 miles opened buddha's mind to the
0:00:54 missing memories of the strange life she
0:00:57 led before her embrace
0:00:59 and it is then that veto escaped
0:01:09 keep writing for a second let me go
0:01:11 check on zantosa okay let's go make sure
0:01:13 he's still here he's not awesome
0:01:18 awesome
0:01:19 i love everyone
0:01:21 give me a frenzy check
0:01:26 self-control check difficulty seven
0:01:29 spend a little power i don't want to
0:01:31 spend a willpower i don't want it to
0:01:33 come back how much self-control
0:01:35 do you yes okay two successes all right
0:01:39 something gets punched
0:01:40 you hear a loud
0:01:42 slam and then i come back are you he
0:01:44 left
0:01:46 that santosa yes
0:01:48 britta will run to
0:01:50 the nearest window assuming it's still
0:01:51 night and stick her head out of it berta
0:01:54 will run to the nearest gun and start
0:01:55 looking out the window
0:01:58 i'm sorry what
0:02:00 i've no i i mean
0:02:02 that is what happens oh seriously yes
0:02:05 it's not a joke
0:02:07 oh i thought you were just joking no
0:02:08 second you have the notion that oh he's
0:02:10 getting away
0:02:12 i'll take care of this i do that then
0:02:14 you see britta uh the closest gun nearby
0:02:16 is probably the one that she would keep
0:02:18 by her sleeping bag
0:02:19 and that gets what are you doing
0:02:25 first finish what you're writing and
0:02:27 then we'll find him we have limited time
0:02:30 am i able to do this thing
0:02:33 all right then you
0:02:36 keep the gun if you wish Britta manages
0:02:38 to halt herself after sort of feeling
0:02:40 the
0:02:41 familiar
0:02:42 heft yeah the weight of the gun in her
0:02:44 hand sort of centers her and miles voice
0:02:47 as well pulls her back she looks at him
0:02:50 and nods and places the gun down by her
0:02:53 side before she walks to finish her
0:02:55 notes
0:02:56 while you're finishing your notes i call
0:02:58 neil
0:02:59 or
0:03:00 you have a phone right i text you so
0:03:02 that well i didn't want to interrupt her
0:03:03 in case he's hiding reading or writing
0:03:05 yeah that makes sense uh zantosa has
0:03:07 escaped come back when you can feed
0:03:09 first
0:03:11 i'm about to eat
0:03:12 looking at his phone with his fangs
0:03:15 around some dude's neck like son of a
0:03:17 [ __ ]
0:03:18 do we have anything
0:03:20 time to feed
0:03:22 maybe
0:03:23 it's my next call okay
0:03:28 [Music]
0:03:30 so the two of you are up you get a text
0:03:33 message uh neil
0:03:35 that
0:03:35 uh
0:03:37 veto has gone loose the two of you kind
0:03:39 of been
0:03:40 hunting kind of doing your thing it's a
0:03:43 cold snowy january but the pubs are kind
0:03:45 of actually
0:03:47 pretty pretty busy around this time snow
0:03:50 does not and yeah
0:03:52 right and
0:03:54 it really doesn't take a ton of effort
0:03:55 for you guys to go outside join somebody
0:03:57 for a cigarette two against one
0:04:00 uh before you know it you guys are
0:04:02 running like a little circuit uh so
0:04:05 i'm gonna let each of you roll the d10
0:04:08 and combined is how much blood you guys
0:04:10 are able to safely obtain i rolled an
0:04:13 eight i did two hey okay so you guys
0:04:15 have a total pool of 16 that you guys
0:04:17 can divide amongst the two yeah you guys
0:04:19 go hunting and the hunting is great i
0:04:22 don't know what this is like if i just
0:04:24 take my eight i'm only down one okay uh
0:04:26 i would also like to take my eight
0:04:28 because i'm going to expend almost all
0:04:30 of it okay so you heal myself do you
0:04:32 need more then no it's more important
0:04:34 that you have blood than i do it's
0:04:36 pretty important that i have some blood
0:04:38 because i like claws um because i like
0:04:40 claws
0:04:41 how much uh so i can now that vito
0:04:44 [ __ ] around one for one okay so with
0:04:47 eight it takes one action
0:04:49 and one blood to heal one point of
0:04:51 damage okay i will blow that in combat
0:04:53 so you can just kind of i will blow four
0:04:55 of that eight to heal myself back up to
0:04:57 i'm just bruised
0:04:59 okay uh and then the other four
0:05:02 will go in so that i'm only three blood
0:05:04 down
0:05:05 sounds great all right
0:05:07 what a swing
0:05:08 so um
0:05:10 so when we should probably get back

0:08:53 i'm not yelling why is she apologizing
0:08:55 though
0:08:56 why did you guys let him out of your
0:08:57 sight because i needed to have a private
0:08:58 conversation just megan put his fingers
0:09:00 in his ears
0:09:02 that seems childish so i locked him in
0:09:04 the bathroom and you lost him
0:09:09 no he escaped i didn't lose him but i
0:09:13 know where i put the whole point of
0:09:14 keeping an eye on him look it'll sort
0:09:16 itself out just get back here do we know
0:09:18 where the pipes connect yeah probably
0:09:20 the water system i don't know okay don't
0:09:23 know anything about engineering is there
0:09:25 like i can make a call
0:09:27 is there a basement with a water heater
0:09:29 that i know of in this cafe anything
0:09:31 like that yes i'm gonna walk down there
0:09:34 try and see if i can i'm gonna switch my
0:09:36 aspects from
0:09:38 hearing uh i thought specs one right
0:09:40 right okay uh to i guess smell
0:09:44 trying to smell the blood in the pipes
0:09:47 which i realize is
0:09:49 way a long shot
0:09:50 so
0:09:51 by the time you make it down to the
0:09:53 basement or whatever was making that
0:09:55 sound
0:09:56 is long gone
0:09:59 all right no such luck i'll run back
0:10:01 upstairs and just return to miles
0:10:05 he's gone through the pipes
0:10:07 through the pipes
0:10:08 okay make your call we'll meet you here
0:10:11 we're gonna be ready to go
0:10:14 clap
0:10:16 as he hangs up i can't i can't [ __ ]
0:10:19 believe it
0:10:23 [Music]
0:10:26 you head down to elysium well i don't
0:10:29 head to the elysium i head to the the
0:10:31 blocks around elysium okay um my idea is
0:10:34 that if she manages to get out i need to
0:10:37 be
0:10:38 johnny on the spot so to speak
0:10:40 to to grab her up off the street uh jane
0:10:43 and my daughter
0:10:44 that's the hope
0:10:46 when he gets there he's gonna kind of
0:10:48 start doing some laps around the block i
0:10:50 guess he's probably
0:10:52 driving like one of the trucks or vans
0:10:55 that he has access to through kind of
0:10:57 his work as bully boy as he's just kind
0:11:01 of
0:11:02 casing
0:11:03 the area around elysium he's also
0:11:05 keeping an eye out on a lot of the
0:11:07 commuter lots because elysium's downtown
0:11:10 and new haven has all these kind of like
0:11:12 small little lots behind the bars where
0:11:15 people will park and if he sees an
0:11:17 opportunity he might stop and
0:11:20 maybe
0:11:21 go up to ask somebody for change while
0:11:23 they're getting into their car to leave
0:11:25 or getting them getting out of their car
0:11:26 to go to a bar and maybe just take a few
0:11:29 uh traits of blood sit them back in the
0:11:31 car turn it on so they're warm and give
0:11:33 me a processional
0:11:35 you're avoiding my dice
0:11:37 yeah yes the dice are not good
0:11:40 i mean they're
0:11:47 perception just raw perception yep
0:11:49 before
0:11:52 one success cool uh you're able to find
0:11:54 a little working system to do this why
0:11:56 don't you go ahead and hold me a d10
0:11:58 uh you're gonna go ahead and gain six
0:12:00 blood from that because it's cold out
0:12:02 johnny will lick the wound of of the
0:12:04 person he's taken some blood from lay
0:12:06 them back down in their in their
0:12:07 driver's seat that's they're just kind
0:12:08 of like looks like they're taking a nap
0:12:11 in their car
0:12:12 turn the car on make sure the heat's
0:12:13 running so that way by the time they
0:12:15 wake up there they'll be just kind of in
0:12:17 their car running and they'll still be
0:12:19 warm and okay
0:12:21 so he'll case around a few lots like
0:12:23 that eventually
0:12:25 i think he kind of starts to get a
0:12:26 little bit uh anxious and look for a pay
0:12:29 phone
0:12:30 some of the pay phones seem to be out of
0:12:32 service like they pulled the actual like
0:12:35 phone components out oh yeah
0:12:37 but there are others that are still
0:12:38 active and usable
0:12:40 fantastic he'll find one of those pay
0:12:41 phones
0:12:43 go up to it
0:12:44 look at the beeper check to see if he's
0:12:46 any had any messages
0:12:47 uh i'm the beeper there are no messages
0:12:50 grab the phone put in some change
0:12:52 think about calling jane but then think
0:12:54 better of it if it just in case she's
0:12:56 still
0:12:57 doing stuff and doesn't want to like
0:12:59 blow up her phone so
0:13:01 he'll give kabir a call
0:13:03 there's actually a an answer on the
0:13:05 other line johnny
0:13:07 did you know it was me i mean yes of
0:13:09 course
0:13:10 what
0:13:11 johnny you're my only friend
0:13:14 come on kabir
0:13:15 things aren't that bad for you are they
0:13:17 life of the ravnos my friend we don't
0:13:20 make very many friends
0:13:22 yeah oddball question when was the last
0:13:24 time that you and i hung out
0:13:26 oh i don't know enough
0:13:28 some time ago
0:13:30 gambling usually
0:13:31 so
0:13:33 remember a specific instance
0:13:35 an instance of us hanging out yeah the
0:13:37 last time last time we were actually
0:13:38 that actually saw you uh there was this
0:13:41 uh one time
0:13:43 that myself you
0:13:45 uh we met with a woman by the name of
0:13:46 jane swindle
0:13:48 i'm not talking about stanford
0:13:50 when was when was the last time that i
0:13:51 saw you like way out on the road just
0:13:53 the last time you remember seeing me i
0:13:55 don't know i
0:13:57 i
0:13:58 have you seen me this year
0:14:00 no johnny the year just started
0:14:03 well that's answers one thing
0:14:06 i now have many questions
0:14:08 what what does this answer uh there's a
0:14:10 nosferatu walking around this new haven
0:14:12 posing as you
0:14:15 at least i think it's a nos we should
0:14:17 punish him we should but uh
0:14:20 i think that's already in the works and
0:14:22 i think it's gonna be a little more of a
0:14:23 punishment
0:14:24 well
0:14:25 whatever he gets he gets no one should
0:14:27 just be posing as me
0:14:29 it could be things are things are pretty
0:14:31 hot in new haven right now
0:14:33 like real bad
0:14:34 what's going on
0:14:36 the pr for one the prince is missing oh
0:14:38 that's not bad well it is bad because
0:14:40 this it looks like the shena the
0:14:42 seneschal is making some kind of uh
0:14:45 shadow praxis on him he's taken over
0:14:48 looks like
0:14:50 with the backing of shaw
0:14:52 and most of the bruja in the city who
0:14:54 are now in his pocket danny
0:14:57 i don't mean to come across as
0:14:58 condescending
0:15:00 you are a good friend
0:15:02 but
0:15:03 this apocalypse
0:15:05 is
0:15:06 new havens apocalypse and you are bigger
0:15:08 than new haven you're a good driver why
0:15:11 don't you just collect your things
0:15:14 and
0:15:14 why don't we just go find a city that
0:15:16 doesn't have this problem the problem is
0:15:19 my codery mates are also in the middle
0:15:21 of the back them up we'll take them too
0:15:23 and because of that
0:15:25 rhys and shaw are looking for every bit
0:15:27 of leverage to make sure that we're not
0:15:29 getting in the way and that includes my
0:15:31 family
0:15:33 you understand what this means yes
0:15:36 i'm not sure i do
0:15:38 my
0:15:39 my blood is singing and my head is
0:15:41 racing
0:15:42 no that's good johnny how's that good
0:15:44 because there's only one reaction a man
0:15:46 can have when his family is threatened
0:15:49 and that can be a big threat a little
0:15:51 threat a vague threat a sincere threat
0:15:53 it does not matter what it is
0:15:55 when someone wishes armor upon your
0:15:56 family
0:15:58 you kill that man
0:16:00 without question
0:16:02 and you make sure everyone knows who
0:16:03 killed them so that everyone understands
0:16:06 that your family is not a family to be
0:16:08 threatened that is the responsibility of
0:16:10 you as a man yeah
0:16:12 you kill them you kill them dead johnny
0:16:15 now listen before you start telling me
0:16:17 about your stupid rules
0:16:20 the rules are an illusion
0:16:23 all they serve to do is convince you
0:16:26 that you're a man who must obey and you
0:16:28 are not
0:16:29 you are a man
0:16:31 who can kill
0:16:34 and if their actions dictate that you
0:16:36 kill you kill
0:16:39 and get your family out of there
0:16:42 anywhere you want to go johnny
0:16:44 i will take you there
0:16:45 i will make sure you are safe and you
0:16:48 your friends your family
0:16:50 they will thrive
0:16:52 you tell me what i can do to help you
0:16:53 and i will help you
0:16:55 you tell me who needs to die and that
0:16:57 will help you make sure they die
0:16:59 beer
0:17:00 i appreciate the fact that uh you're
0:17:01 ready to go to war with me
0:17:03 that is what a man does for his family
0:17:05 but
0:17:06 i think what i need to do for my family
0:17:08 tonight
0:17:09 is get them the hell out of new haven
0:17:11 i might have uh i might have somebody
0:17:14 working on getting them out

0:20:42 it's like 12 brew uh
0:20:46 they're looking to catch you before you
0:20:48 get to elysium
0:20:50 if you pull in like that you're gonna
0:20:52 play into their hand
0:20:54 you know that ravenous i hang around
0:20:55 with
0:20:57 yeah
0:20:58 he's uh
0:21:00 he's going to be at the citgo right off
0:21:03 the merit in an hour
0:21:05 second okay you know what i'm talking
0:21:07 about i think so
0:21:09 i'll write some directions i'll put them
0:21:11 on the the dash of my truck i'm going to
0:21:13 leave it around the back
0:21:15 the keys are gonna be on uh
0:21:18 i'm gonna put them under the seat
0:21:20 all right okay
0:21:22 hopefully
0:21:23 miles has cocked up some kind of plan if
0:21:26 you get an opportunity you get out the
0:21:28 back
0:21:29 with her
0:21:30 all right
0:21:32 do you know where the rest of my family
0:21:33 is
0:21:35 i don't
0:21:37 shaw's keeping
0:21:38 aces
0:21:41 all right
0:21:42 you make sure you at least get her out i
0:21:44 will that the truck is going to be on
0:21:46 the back corner behind elysium right
0:21:49 across from the uh that little pizza
0:21:51 shop
0:21:52 okay all right
0:21:54 keys under the door
0:21:56 open this seat
0:21:59 make sure that you guys have an
0:22:01 opportunity to get out i think
0:22:04 well if miles is is doing what i think
0:22:06 he's doing i think that
0:22:07 most of the brujah might be keeping
0:22:10 their eyes on the front of elysium
0:22:12 okay is there anything else you need
0:22:14 jane
0:22:16 no just be careful
0:22:18 is she with you

0:23:01 yeah you put so all right it's a little
0:23:04 weird
0:23:06 my tastes are esoteric neil says like
0:23:10 not knowing the context and being a
0:23:12 little nervous
0:23:13 yeah
0:23:14 you uh
0:23:16 i guess so
0:23:18 i hope it helps
0:23:19 yeah i hope so too man thanks for thanks
0:23:21 for looking out if you need anything let
0:23:23 me know sounds great
0:23:25 still alive right so
0:23:27 uh i know
0:23:29 i tucked he starts to like hurt oh no
0:23:31 i'm not gonna say it again and hangs up
0:23:33 the phone
0:23:46 there were definitely computers there
0:23:47 were there definitely computers there
0:23:49 there are computers but not electricity
0:23:50 there's no yeah there's no power
0:23:53 is there a library on the way on the way
0:23:56 around here
0:23:57 uh yeah yeah we can even i mean no i
0:24:00 know i just yeah it's it's a question
0:24:02 how far out of the way it is for where
0:24:03 we were walking
0:24:06 you know what screw it yeah let's go to
0:24:07 the library uh just real real real fast
0:24:09 um and then on the way i'm going to call
0:24:11 my other contact after miles told me the
0:24:15 horrifically bad news of the man going
0:24:17 into the sewage pipe because neil
0:24:20 has gang contacts
0:24:22 he has
0:24:23 a medical examiner office contacts and
0:24:26 he has sewage maintenance union rep
0:24:28 contacts
0:24:29 and i'm going to uh i know keep going
0:24:33 there's reasons uh
0:24:35 and he's gonna call up the his sewage
0:24:38 guys
0:24:39 um carl shilwalter
0:24:42 so as he's walking just
0:24:44 dial the phone as they're walking
0:24:45 towards the library
0:24:47 uh hello
0:24:48 hey carl it's uh it's neil how's it
0:24:52 going doing okay hey weird question yes
0:24:57 i get to expect that
0:24:59 so you know the you know the cafe over i
0:25:02 give him the address for british place
0:25:05 uh
0:25:06 i i don't think it's open but yeah you
0:25:09 know like the property you know the idea
0:25:10 i'm familiar with the concepts i
0:25:15 and i've got some weird questions about
0:25:16 like sewer hookup over there if the if
0:25:18 there was a pipe like if you were going
0:25:20 to flush something down like the sink
0:25:21 where would that go if like somebody
0:25:23 wanted to go find it so the scene i've
0:25:25 got in mind is like somebody dr like
0:25:27 flushes a bunch of drugs down the toilet
0:25:28 and then somebody like the cops are
0:25:30 trying to go find where it went well i
0:25:31 can't get mixed up in this kind of stuff
0:25:33 it's not just going to be up front it's
0:25:35 a
0:25:36 come on man don't crush my literary
0:25:38 dreams here your literary dreams yeah i
0:25:42 just wanna where does it go
0:25:44 like is there like one place if somebody
0:25:47 was gonna go and like try and get out of
0:25:48 the sewers or into the sewers from that
0:25:50 general location like where would they
0:25:51 go is there like one place or is it a
0:25:52 ton there's a lot there's a lot of
0:25:55 okay um i mean it's in the downtown area
0:25:58 yeah i i know there's a lot of hard
0:25:59 times that gets rid of the stores it's
0:26:01 gonna follow those lines okay i just but
0:26:03 there's no
0:26:05 in your opinion if somebody was down
0:26:06 there and they like didn't really know
0:26:08 where they were going in the sewers
0:26:10 where would they most likely end up you
0:26:12 just follow the water and so they would
0:26:13 just probably follow the water if i'm
0:26:15 trying to make this as simple as
0:26:17 possible yeah well that's the okay you
0:26:18 just follow the wall that's what i'm
0:26:19 curious about okay so and then that
0:26:21 would hook up
0:26:22 neil does some like weird mental maps in
0:26:24 his head hey cool man cool thanks
0:26:27 that was it i just
0:26:28 but it does hook up to the main sewer
0:26:30 line down because it's in downtown and
0:26:31 you're it absolutely looks like so you
0:26:33 would probably get to the main sewer
0:26:34 line and it's actually probably gonna
0:26:36 hook up almost immediately great and
0:26:38 then because that's that's right in the
0:26:40 downtown new haven area all right and
0:26:42 then from there
0:26:43 it would just flow out
0:26:45 and just you'd fall the flow outward
0:26:47 okay cool that's that was my only
0:26:48 question i just want to double check you
0:26:50 know
0:26:50 it's not like i spent a lot of time down
0:26:52 in the sewers
0:26:57 all right
0:26:58 how's the kids
0:27:00 oh they're great actually great good i'm
0:27:01 glad all right
0:27:03 do you get no never mind this i feel
0:27:05 like this doesn't get weird and thanks
0:27:07 for the answer call
0:27:08 well it's great talking to you yes um
0:27:11 i'm so bad at this no i know it's weird
0:27:14 bye man uh hey you you have a good one
0:27:16 also great you know if you have any
0:27:18 other questions let me know we can i you
0:27:21 know it's great talking to you yeah man
0:27:22 we should uh
0:27:24 should go see a movie or something i'll
0:27:26 talk to later yeah sure you have a good
0:27:28 one you too take care bye bye later
0:27:30 later
0:27:35 so who is really only hearing neil's
0:27:37 side of all of these conversations
0:27:40 [Laughter]
0:27:42 just kind of looks at neil before you
0:27:44 pick up that phone again oh i don't need
0:27:46 it again what's up i need some context
0:27:48 for everything that i just heard okay so
0:27:51 uh
0:27:52 my buddy dario
0:27:54 have you ever met dario i don't remember
0:27:56 he's uh
0:27:57 i mean he's local he's in los reyes and
0:28:00 he's old he's in it's a gang
0:28:02 later he you know they hang out around
0:28:04 my
0:28:04 area they say it doesn't matter it
0:28:06 doesn't matter dario um i asked dario to
0:28:08 kind of look around for any like weird
0:28:10 crime scene stuff looking out for hey
0:28:12 disappearances you know underworld
0:28:15 on the world going to underworld
0:28:16 especially if somebody's using more
0:28:17 mortal pawns to do stuff during the day
0:28:20 so i asked him that he sent me some
0:28:21 emails which is why we're going to the
0:28:22 library because i got to check your
0:28:23 computer uh because this phone it's a
0:28:26 phone you know and that's not helpful
0:28:28 right and then
0:28:30 i have uh another buddy carl
0:28:33 he's the union rep for the local sewage
0:28:36 maintenance workers
0:28:38 uh because i wanted to know
0:28:40 since
0:28:41 miles and Britta sort of
0:28:43 intimated that uh zantosa fled in
0:28:47 through the pipes down into the sewer
0:28:49 system
0:28:51 wind holds up a finger just
0:28:53 pausing him for a second while she kind
0:28:55 of processes
0:28:56 the thing he just said
0:28:59 neil that's the part i needed you to
0:29:00 lead with
0:29:01 that's i was going in chronological
0:29:03 order i can see that order of importance
0:29:07 maybe prince's disappearance versus
0:29:09 santos's disappearance they're both
0:29:10 connected i i can't prioritize order
0:29:12 that's what i need miles for gotcha all
0:29:14 right library yeah so anyway uh he's on
0:29:18 the sewer i wanted to know what the
0:29:19 sewer hookup was and whether you can get
0:29:20 to the main line because you know
0:29:23 unlike what i told carl i actually have
0:29:25 spent a lot of time down in the sewers
0:29:26 uh so if miles wants us to we could
0:29:29 probably head zentos off the pass
0:29:31 so
0:29:32 here's my concern if santosa is in the
0:29:35 sewers
0:29:36 known ally of shaw
0:29:38 i'm comfortable making my way down
0:29:40 around there probably more so than
0:29:42 zantosa is
0:29:43 okay well then let's get to that library
0:29:45 no whether or not i can find him i have
0:29:47 no idea but
0:29:48 all right let's get to the library and
0:29:50 make a phone call to miles and say hey
0:29:52 do you want us to try and hit them all
0:29:53 yeah let's do the library first because
0:29:54 i want the information from the library
0:29:56 before i talk to miles okay they sort of
0:29:58 hustle against the february wind
0:30:01 to go to the library okay before they
0:30:03 close
0:30:07 [Music]
0:30:10 johnny will
0:30:12 go ahead and
0:30:14 park the his vehicle in the spot based
0:30:16 helena
0:30:18 put the keys under the seat
0:30:20 dismount and find a place that's close
0:30:23 enough to elysium
0:30:24 and kind of just
0:30:25 keep it on kind of stake it out
0:30:28 stuff
0:30:29 yeah he just watches he sits out there
0:30:31 with a boom box
0:30:45 wow i wish i had some uh a thing that is
0:30:48 four successes
0:30:50 very good damn dude my tens don't
0:30:52 explode though so it would have been six
0:30:54 nice
0:30:56 post up
0:30:57 the elysium is pretty [ __ ] well
0:30:59 defended and it's not just bruja they
0:31:02 are definitely trimmier from the shane
0:31:04 tree that are kind of like
0:31:05 walking around
0:31:07 being subtle so they don't have their
0:31:09 wands out
0:31:11 yeah
0:31:12 they're helicopter wanding so basically
0:31:14 he posts up down the street hopefully
0:31:16 near some other like night goers so he
0:31:19 has a crowd so he has a crowd to blend
0:31:21 in with
0:31:22 lights a cigarette
0:31:24 and kind of just wait to see if he sees
0:31:26 anybody that he needs to get the back on
0:31:29 for a while pretty much i mean as long
0:31:31 as hey there
0:31:33 everything's kind of really low-key
0:31:36 unless security is bothered
0:31:38 they don't seem to bother anyone
0:31:41 takes a look at this beeper any messages
0:31:44 nothing yet
0:31:45 once again after maybe about a half an
0:31:47 hour watching or so
0:31:49 john you'll start to get anxious again
0:31:51 and look to see if you can find
0:31:54 tell you what he'll actually go into one
0:31:55 of the bars that he's at
0:31:57 that's kind of nearby
0:31:59 go in the back order a drink
0:32:01 tip really well
0:32:02 and then as he's pointing down the money
0:32:04 in the tip i'll go hey by the way uh you
0:32:07 guys have a phone call like or a phone i
0:32:09 can borrow
0:32:10 yeah sure hello kind of like pick up the
0:32:13 phone like turn it so that you can it's
0:32:14 in the back where it's a little bit
0:32:15 quieter and he will call a number he
0:32:18 hasn't called in a very long time
0:32:20 um he will call
0:32:23 his wife
0:32:25 at about the 30 to 45 minute mark he's
0:32:27 gonna get a beep for me too where's the
0:32:29 music it's usually just a phone number
0:32:31 on a beeper
0:32:32 none of those fancy blackberry messaging
0:32:34 devices it rings and rings and rings and
0:32:36 rings and rings and rings and rings and
0:32:39 rings it does not seem that this person

0:35:41 i will in an hour we'll figure this out
0:35:45 um i'm so sorry gene
0:35:48 no you you say that in person
0:35:51 johnny hangs up
0:35:52 just in time for his beeper to vibrate
0:35:54 yep
0:35:57 picks up the phone again
0:35:58 makes another call
0:36:00 miles you sound awfully cheaper sorry
0:36:03 it's just the way i answer the phone
0:36:05 what's going on um
0:36:07 we're about to move out
0:36:09 uh a large contingent of settings should
0:36:12 meet us at elysium uh i assume you're
0:36:15 nearby did you happen
0:36:17 to get her out
0:36:20 no her and jane are still inside there's
0:36:22 too too many people watching exits but
0:36:27 i think i think when we show up with all
0:36:29 your set type friends it's going to give
0:36:31 her the uh
0:36:32 opportunity she needs to leave and she's
0:36:34 got a vehicle already prepped for her to
0:36:36 go got it we're going to make a quick
0:36:38 stop of my
0:36:39 bubble beyond the movie soon
0:36:41 in other news the zantosa uh escaped
0:36:46 through a drain
0:36:47 escape to a drain
0:36:50 so far that's the general knowledge that
0:36:52 i've been given that he somehow made
0:36:54 himself
0:36:55 pliable
0:36:57 no he's getting all upset over something
0:37:00 we can't control he did ask about you
0:37:02 before
0:37:04 that
0:37:05 when he asked
0:37:06 what you were doing
0:37:08 and what did you tell him i told him
0:37:11 that you were looking after somebody
0:37:12 that you're under your care
0:37:15 [Music]
0:37:16 i didn't give him a lot of details
0:37:19 i don't know what he plans on doing with
0:37:21 that miles why do you have to keep on
0:37:22 telling me [ __ ] that makes me want to
0:37:24 break things while i'm in public
0:37:27 because i'd rather you
0:37:29 processes it in increments instead of
0:37:31 all at once
0:37:33 all right
0:37:34 well hopefully
0:37:36 i've uh
0:37:38 hopefully the bond that i have with him
0:37:40 will keep keep him somewhat nearby um
0:37:43 but they said a lot of blood i don't
0:37:45 know what that means
0:37:47 i'm hoping that he didn't just like
0:37:49 store your blood in him or something
0:37:52 i have no idea what he can do and it's
0:37:54 starting to become bothersome
0:37:56 so let's not count count on the blood
0:37:59 bond just in case only is my child so
0:38:03 that should count for something we'll
0:38:04 find out we'll be by soon all right well
0:38:06 i have uh i'm nearby
0:38:09 i can look down the street and keep eyes
0:38:11 on the front of elysium so i'll just
0:38:13 make sure that uh when you guys show up
0:38:16 i'll be on your side got it
0:38:18 from the other room miles do we have
0:38:21 time to hunt i'm pretty hungry it's my
0:38:24 next call get ready to go

0:38:46 uh yeah you find your email and sure
0:38:48 enough you have four unread messages i
0:38:53 try and pick one of the corner one of
0:38:54 the ones that's like a closed desk so
0:38:56 people don't see me looking at crime
0:38:58 scene photos or whatever the [ __ ] you
0:38:59 say i grab a book from a shelf and kind
0:39:02 of like position myself so folks have to
0:39:04 see me before they see him or what he's
0:39:06 looking at sure and yeah i will start
0:39:09 opening up the emails okay the first
0:39:12 email that you open looks to be
0:39:13 something of the coroner's office
0:39:15 it is a john doe
0:39:18 a husky blonde
0:39:20 clearly a kindred interpret
0:39:23 john doe you immediately recognize the
0:39:27 body of opt-in Rowlands
0:39:30 perfect okay got him uh
0:39:32 hey fantastic
0:39:34 yeah uh
0:39:35 yeah well i found him
0:39:37 unless these other emails say he got fed
0:39:39 into incinerator which i'm hoping didn't
0:39:41 happen which which him him him we were
0:39:43 talking about one him is that the same
0:39:45 ham which him are you talking about z no
0:39:49 okay so not him we didn't find him no
0:39:51 okay no why would why does mortician's
0:39:53 photos tell me where
0:40:05 one is perpetually confused by the other
0:40:10 he lowers his voice
0:40:12 mr Rowlands puts a lit finger up to his
0:40:14 his lips like he's trying to be
0:40:16 conspiratorial even though they're in a
0:40:17 [ __ ] dead library like who cares
0:40:19 yeah he's at the city morgue perfect
0:40:21 yeah well i do i got a guy over there
0:40:23 too so this will be perfect okay okay uh
0:40:26 all right plow through those emails
0:40:28 i am but i had to stop and explain
0:40:30 myself well you said something out loud
0:40:32 that's how i think i open up the second
0:40:34 email jesus tap dance in christ the
0:40:36 second email is
0:40:38 another corporate kindred
0:40:40 handsome young blonde man
0:40:43 do i recognize him
0:40:46 [Applause]
0:40:48 oh boy they both look like really
0:40:51 dirtied and roughed up looks like they
0:40:53 probably got like caught in like they i
0:40:56 caught something rough
0:40:57 oh boy
0:40:59 well this time i'm gonna lean over and
0:41:01 look if we solve this problem i don't
0:41:03 think we have to worry about shaw
0:41:05 anymore okay
0:41:07 that's not ideal i will
0:41:09 hey can you go stand over by the printer
0:41:11 yep i don't want anyone else to get
0:41:12 these before we do got it okay and then
0:41:15 we're gonna break the printer on the way
0:41:16 out okay because i don't actually know
0:41:18 how to not have these saved into the
0:41:20 printer you had me we're gonna break the
0:41:22 printer okay but like subtly and i'm
0:41:23 gonna
0:41:24 once she gets over there i'm gonna print
0:41:26 off these emails in these photos okay
0:41:28 and then i'm gonna go to number three
0:41:30 okay number three
0:41:32 looks like a [ __ ] grenade went off in
0:41:36 a panic room and it's just like torn
0:41:38 metal splintered wood
0:41:40 someone did him [ __ ] dirty i knew
0:41:43 where the panic room was and knew where
0:41:45 the panic was
0:41:47 i will print that photo off as well uh
0:41:49 and then the third pick third email is
0:41:51 just kind of like a little pic scat just
0:41:54 a smattering of of images of both the
0:41:57 crime scene and the two john does okay
0:42:00 uh the john does are deemed rather
0:42:02 unusual because the grenade that went
0:42:04 off should have turned anyone in there
0:42:06 into [ __ ] pace
0:42:08 and these guys are actually kind of
0:42:09 largely like largely intact yeah so
0:42:13 they're a little surprised that these
0:42:14 guys have all their fingers
0:42:16 after a situation like that
0:42:18 neil like closes out signs off closes
0:42:21 all the stuff and then walks briskly
0:42:23 past win it's like okay i'll grab those
0:42:25 things i printed off and then i don't
0:42:26 know
0:42:27 pull the toner out or i i i don't know
0:42:29 how to
0:42:30 what just kind of opens the door of the
0:42:32 printer and grabs a handful of stuff and
0:42:34 rips it
0:42:37 closes it i'm sure there's a way to snap
0:42:39 delete old files that i don't know what
0:42:41 they are and i don't know what that is
0:42:42 so let's go uh i gotta make some phone
