0:05:07 you're on speaker I'm on what
0:05:09 speakerphone
0:05:10 what I'm driving and I don't have any
0:05:12 hands
0:05:16 microphone yes
0:05:18 basically every one of my near proximity
0:05:20 can hear you
0:05:21 then we should be careful with what we
0:05:23 discussed thank you for informing me yes
0:05:27 um
0:05:28 so the most
0:05:30 pressing news is that you are being
0:05:33 something called dog tag excuse me right
0:05:36 so that is apparently a thing the Sabbat
0:05:39 do by tossing a werewolf in your general
0:05:42 presence what does this have to do with
0:05:43 lupines Miles what are you talking about
0:05:45 you heard a killing spree are you
0:05:47 familiar with anything going on outside
0:05:49 of the Elysium right now I need to know
0:05:51 what your base level is there something
0:05:53 involved in the loophons going on
0:05:54 outside of the Elysium there may be a
0:05:56 Lupine coming to Elysium
0:05:58 uh Elsa height is Neil
0:06:01 um
0:06:03 we don't know I would not have led with
0:06:05 that Miles
0:06:06 um we don't know what's going to happen
0:06:08 maybe sometime when the Sabbat attack we
0:06:10 don't know what's gonna happen tonight
0:06:12 we're pretty tonight I'm pretty sure the
0:06:14 Zantos has said it was going to happen
0:06:15 tonight no he was speculating
0:06:18 long story your life is in danger it may
0:06:21 involve dog tagging which is where they
0:06:24 throw a werewolf at you not just because
0:06:26 of that though also uh right two
0:06:29 individuals on the secondary part
0:06:32 we've got information that the combined
0:06:35 forces of Arabella Rhys and Shaw plan on
0:06:38 killing you we're on our way and I've
0:06:41 got back up what does that mean I think
0:06:44 you've said makes any sense I need you
0:06:46 to keep yourself safe for the next 30
0:06:47 minutes
0:06:49 when is the Lupine coming I don't know
0:06:51 find out she hangs up that was
0:06:54 productive she's she's motivated that
0:06:56 wasn't productive at all why not she
0:06:57 knows no you didn't mention the
0:06:58 collateral that we have now we're trying
0:07:01 to buy her onto our side she was
0:07:03 basically look no she's having a panic
0:07:05 attack I should know one
0:07:08 I called her to let her know she was in
0:07:09 life's in danger not to buy her time
0:07:12 over the phone because I'm not doing
0:07:14 that over the phone yeah I I get it but
0:07:17 like why do you people keep assisting
0:07:19 well sending everyone to a panic spiral
0:07:21 yeah I'm just speaking from experience
0:07:25 yes I'm done thank you so we'll handle
0:07:28 it in the next 30 minutes she's now
0:07:30 aware just in case sorry I'm just
0:07:32 starting to go into a panic spiral it's
0:07:34 okay now well so I need everybody else
0:07:37 to gear up with what we have here
0:07:40 um
0:07:42 your shirt Johnny's gonna meet us there
0:07:43 once we pull up we will have a shirt
0:07:45 once we get to my place thanks do we
0:07:47 have anything that's good against
0:07:48 werewolves also at my place all right
0:07:51 does everybody remember that third
0:07:53 container hey just a fun fact if a
0:07:56 Lupine does show up tonight yeah don't
0:07:58 fight it run away
0:08:00 run away super super fast great does
0:08:03 anyone know what works on lupines yeah
0:08:05 running away besides running uh nothing
0:08:08 can I make an occult intelligence role
0:08:10 I've heard salvos I would like
0:08:12 confirmation
0:08:14 mostly because I have that from a
0:08:16 Stephen King movie One success okay so a
0:08:20 few important things about silver yes
0:08:22 you you have heard that silver is
0:08:24 effective against Luke Lines Auto game
0:08:26 uh in terms of Rarity in the world of
0:08:28 Darkness silver and platinum trade
0:08:31 places silver is extremely rare is that
0:08:35 what I get yes
0:08:37 so that's basically it silver weapons
0:08:41 I don't have a lot of stuff just my
0:08:43 Platinum dinnerware again we don't but
0:08:46 that's also not silver that's Platinum
0:08:48 at least yeah I don't have I don't know
0:08:50 it was a direct Elsa sorry I also
0:08:54 sounded really scared like she's had
0:08:56 experience I think Neil I should run
0:08:59 yeah no because she had to run because
0:09:01 she was
0:09:04 yeah she was forced out of a territory
0:09:06 by yeah lupines that'll happen look the
0:09:09 third box might have something in it
0:09:10 we'll take a look real quick cool also
0:09:13 if I'm understanding what the santosa
0:09:15 said about this whole process properly
0:09:17 and the things that I saw
0:09:19 properly uh this is not like a hey
0:09:23 funsies and then you you beat the Lupine
0:09:25 yay this is a it kills everyone it kills
0:09:29 everyone and if it doesn't and you do
0:09:31 manage to successfully fight it off
0:09:32 guess what Killing Spree is standing
0:09:35 outside
0:09:35 so [ __ ] run and hide okay this is
0:09:39 this is not a this is not a like stand
0:09:40 your ground kind of scenario right
0:09:42 except you just described that either we
0:09:43 fight the Lupine and die or go outside
0:09:45 and die yeah but going outside you can
0:09:47 hide and we know the territory better
0:09:50 than they do so we can hide some of us
0:09:52 can hide well how about all of us could
0:09:55 hide miles it's just it's just whether
0:09:58 you're decent there we are putting the
0:09:59 cart before the horse here let's get to
0:10:01 the house let's pick up the supplies
0:10:03 we'll formulate a plan when we see what
0:10:04 we have I'm just very nervous that I
0:10:07 know miles is not more nervous miles is
0:10:09 dealing with things in the way miles
0:10:10 deals with things and you are dealing
0:10:12 with things in the way you deal with
0:10:14 things let's meet up with Johnny maybe
0:10:16 he knows something he's been near
0:10:18 Elysium he could have seen something
0:10:19 that might help that Johnny has a that's
0:10:22 a sensible suggestion but where he's
0:10:24 gonna show up with us in about the same
0:10:25 time when the said I'd show up he'll
0:10:27 move in with us
0:10:29 and at that time hopefully Jane has not
0:10:31 been discovered so this needs to be
0:10:34 quick yeah
0:10:36 it's a good idea to check the box let's
0:10:38 I'd rather be prepared just in case
0:10:40 because sometimes we don't get that
0:10:42 option
0:10:43 I'm just worried that if we have the
0:10:44 fight option we will prioritize it over
0:10:48 the Run option and Neil sort of looks at
0:10:50 himself for a second realizes that
0:10:51 Johnny's not with the codery right now
0:10:54 and unbuckle the center seat and like
0:10:56 scoot away from wind so that they're
0:10:59 less crowded in the back seat and
0:11:00 buckles himself back up
0:11:02 miles do you have any silver chains or
0:11:04 anything like that like jewelry
0:11:05 no okay
0:11:11 you go
0:11:14 [Music]
0:11:15 it's a pretty quiet ride New Haven
0:11:18 despite this like chaos that's on the
0:11:21 horizon I think actually seems pretty
0:11:23 normal traffic is low it's a nice easy
0:11:26 ride to miles's Haven we will pull up oh
0:11:31 that this place isn't already burned to
0:11:33 the ground who knows that it's just
0:11:36 normal there that's what I'm hoping for
0:11:37 a little bit of normalness before we
0:11:39 move into everything else everything is
0:11:41 just fun
0:11:43 all right where's the Box should still
0:11:45 be in the living room wind pops out
0:11:47 brother what else take a look at the Box
0:11:49 all right and Bretta will go to the box
0:11:52 which box are you looking at the third
0:11:54 the Assassin box okay uh there is
0:12:00 within the box it looks like it's pretty
0:12:01 well kitted out for an assassin that
0:12:03 assassin also happened to have silver
0:12:05 [ __ ] yes that's the important part it
0:12:08 has three silver throwing knives pick
0:12:11 them up very carefully show them the
0:12:13 mouse I don't know how to use that [ __ ]
0:12:15 Neil shakes his head so I'm not my range
0:12:18 of expertise either well I suppose that
0:12:20 I know of I can throw [ __ ]
0:12:23 like take them with us just in case yep
0:12:25 if nothing else we could just hold them
0:12:26 and stab them pause on that we're
0:12:28 walking into Elysium yeah we're gonna
0:12:31 carry a bunch of knives into Elysium
0:12:32 we'll figure out something there's no
0:12:34 weapons on Elysium that they know of and
0:12:36 if we break the rules of Elysium going
0:12:38 in there they will kill us then why
0:12:40 don't we hide them somewhere outside of
0:12:41 Elysium not doing us any good because it
0:12:44 won't help us because the Lupine from
0:12:46 what I've seen and he like makes air
0:12:48 quotes when he says scene is going to be
0:12:51 in the Elysium with us and you have
0:12:53 already said that running is what we
0:12:55 should do yes so the first thing we do
0:12:57 is we get outside of Elysium grab them
0:12:59 and if it comes after us let's just stop
0:13:01 and then we lose the loop spiraling is
0:13:04 pointless just take them for now we can
0:13:06 try to hide them at least on ourselves
0:13:08 right not going inside to Elysium just
0:13:11 take them keep them in the car by the
0:13:14 way better can I get a self-control
0:13:15 attractive as you look through the box
0:13:16 Nate what's up
0:13:18 still pretty oh boy you've managed to
0:13:20 message so far
0:13:22 uh plus anything nope just self-control
0:13:25 difficulty me I'm not gonna spend a
0:13:27 willpower I'm a torador
0:13:29 hey
0:13:30 I'm good all right
0:13:32 damn those guys love you I love them
0:13:35 back that's why
0:13:38 before with that statement I basically
0:13:40 go upstairs and put on a very nice suit
0:13:44 can I borrow a sweater for like a shirt
0:13:46 or yeah you can have both yeah we're in
0:13:48 all of our clothes like messed up at
0:13:49 this point please take some stuff put
0:13:51 put on some normal looking things
0:13:53 normal's not really my thing but I'll do
0:13:55 what you ask there you go we all can
0:13:58 look good we get changed and we get
0:14:00 going to Elysium yep any time to hunt
0:14:03 I thought right we were supposed to have
0:14:04 food that was Role perception to for add
0:14:08 your herd
0:14:10 11. oh wait
0:14:13 baby yeah so one success okay play a lot
0:14:18 of games it's hard to keep track
0:14:20 that's this is the part I get one you
0:14:23 get a quick snack uh you're on very
0:14:26 short notice yep uh your ghoul was able
0:14:28 to provide you with one individual who
0:14:31 is very hard up for his mixtape to be
0:14:33 listened to and
0:14:36 basically are going to have to listen to
0:14:38 the mixtape if you plan on getting them
0:14:39 alone right let's put the mixtape on all
0:14:43 right the mixtape is hot garbage great I
0:14:47 eat them
0:14:48 okay I gain 10 blood oh not not like
0:14:52 five I mean that's what you said so
0:14:56 uh yeah you're not gonna make it
0:15:00 self-control five yeah I feel like with
0:15:02 your blood uh I am five out of 15. okay
0:15:05 so you're at you're still at full five
0:15:06 uh self-control dice
0:15:09 um now we normally can take three
0:15:10 without too much things no you can take
0:15:12 two with nothing three yeah three they
0:15:16 need to go to the doctor yeah but that
0:15:17 mixtape already made us a lovely ill so
0:15:20 so he kind of guessed what's coming yeah
0:15:22 you guys need some Johnny in your life
0:15:23 is getting real far off the patch how
0:15:25 much can I take with him being in care
0:15:27 of somebody afterwards uh why don't you

0:15:46 see this happening uh as that's also
0:15:49 asking about feeding can I roll to see
0:15:51 what seems to be up there like as in how
0:15:53 bad is this okay yeah
0:15:56 uh medicine plus what intelligence
0:16:00 three success
0:16:03 so with three successes I this person is
0:16:06 going to be okay uh so long as you know
0:16:10 they're monitored they're okay right now
0:16:12 but their heart can undergo some issues
0:16:15 due to how much blood loss that was four
0:16:17 four pints of blood is kind of like a
0:16:19 lot [ __ ] dangerous hey miles we
0:16:22 should really have someone take care of
0:16:24 him um he's looking kind of bad that was
0:16:27 my plan Marcus who call him an ambulance
0:16:29 can we pay for it yes thank you if you
0:16:32 need more

0:17:02 had troubles recently with that and I
0:17:04 see that as a very big gesture
0:17:07 then I will she gives you like a
0:17:09 resentful look and then sticks his wrist
0:17:12 up
0:17:12 bretta's eyes go wide and she just kind
0:17:15 of looks between Marcos and Miles he's
0:17:17 offering to help he's joining the team
0:17:19 in this particular function Fredo Wilson
0:17:22 reach out take gentle hold of his wrists
0:17:26 can't look at him like checking to the
0:17:30 resentment is still there it is still

0:20:26 I I'm not doing this with any intentions
0:20:28 of having conversations okay that's fine
0:20:31 he just kind of gets in adjust the
0:20:33 mirror takes a deep breath and starts
0:20:37 the car drunk Marcos is such a mood
0:20:41 starting to feel like what Kindred life
0:20:43 is like
0:20:44 totally silent and the old stay totally
0:20:47 silent as they're driving until like the
0:20:49 awkwardness gets to him too much and
0:20:51 then starts slowly humming like a Girl
0:20:54 from Ipanema yeah and he won't be able
0:20:56 to help himself that happens very
0:20:57 quickly uh the entire trip is just him
0:21:00 dead silent utterly self-loathing and a
0:21:03 little drunk
0:21:04 and when you like talk hum the volume
0:21:08 just goes up and then he just puts his
0:21:11 hand right back on the wheel and keeps
0:21:13 striving uh the only thing I want to say
0:21:15 is we're going and I'm very happy to end
0:21:17 on this but as we get there into the
0:21:18 bodies is it just when it gets too it's
0:21:22 just too awkward and too horrible Neil
0:21:24 would be like hey you know miles will be
0:21:28 very pissed but like
0:21:30 you know Joey's got red progeny right
0:21:33 no okay it just keeps
0:21:38 trying to trying to help it as it and
0:21:41 then just fall silent and like stares
0:21:42 out the window humming
0:21:45 all right so you guys are gonna go and
0:21:47 pick up the bodies it is uneventful grab
0:21:49 and bring it back yeah and then I'm
0:21:51 gonna
0:21:52 you know I'm gonna be a little behind
0:21:54 them but I'm gonna uh call cab and just
0:21:57 have it take me to lose him okay but I
0:21:59 will walk into Elysium yeah Marcos gets
0:22:02 the bodies sets them up sits down by the
0:22:06 piano
0:22:07 and like just begins playing an
0:22:10 incredible song
0:22:12 and then just kind of stops when he
0:22:14 realizes you aren't gone yet and just
0:22:16 waits for you to leave
0:22:18 you're very talented okay I'm gonna I'm
0:22:22 gonna go with a derisive expression he
0:22:25 lets you go and it's not until like
0:22:27 you're out on the sidewalk that you can
0:22:30 hear the distant sounds of the piano
0:22:31 he's definitely playing Moonlight Sonata
0:22:33 there's no ways not
0:22:34 all right and yeah and then I will call
0:22:38 cab and hadulysium after the two of them
0:22:39 or the three of them sounds good
0:22:42 [Music]
0:22:48 and so yeah we'll go past and uh we will
0:22:51 stop somewhere near the front of leasing
0:22:54 because I know that Johnny is keeping an
0:22:56 eye out so that he sees the truck and
0:22:58 then we will wait for the Sunday cars to
0:23:02 show up and that's when we'll make our
0:23:03 way in wait honestly Johnny is probably
0:23:06 uh at this point he's sat up you know
0:23:10 like uh you know when when bars have the
0:23:13 uh the outside patio winter time where
0:23:16 they hit where all the smokers kind of
0:23:18 congregate and bring drinks and it's
0:23:19 it's like fenced off but it's out like
0:23:22 imposing in the sidewalk he's probably
0:23:25 sitting out amongst there with his full
0:23:27 drink of liquor that he hasn't actually
0:23:29 touched uh just chain smoking cigarettes
0:23:32 laying low and keeping an eye on the
0:23:35 area and he's really not just looking at
0:23:37 the front of Elysium he's looking in for
0:23:40 suspicious activity all around I feel
0:23:42 like he's in the perfect kind of like
0:23:43 Halo like Zone around Elysium where like
0:23:46 they won't notice him because he's just
0:23:48 too far off but like if people are
0:23:50 starting to make weird moves on that
0:23:52 property they're going to be kind of
0:23:54 your perimeters outside their perimeter
0:23:56 yeah
0:23:57 pull up in front and
0:23:59 hope that Johnny spots us you guys are
0:24:02 not
0:24:04 Ultra subtle nope uh as you pull up
0:24:07 Johnny you spot them immediately have I
0:24:09 seen anything else out of the ordinary
0:24:11 in the area
0:24:13 everything is like everything is like
0:24:15 specifically low-key you know what I
0:24:17 mean normally like people spill out a
0:24:19 side the Kindred start talking they
0:24:21 smoke their clothes they talk their [ __ ]
0:24:23 none of that is going on whatever it is
0:24:25 is so tense
0:24:28 inside that the audience is captivated
0:24:31 I don't see any Oddball uh people in the
0:24:35 same kind of area that I am like keeping
0:24:37 an eye on Elysium or anything not as far
0:24:39 out as you are now okay
0:24:41 okay once I once I uh catch sights
0:24:45 of the uh
0:24:47 Cobalt Nightshade Blazer
0:24:51 I will uh kind of just get up
0:24:54 grab my smokes move past the people and
0:24:58 start walking towards Elysium being a
0:25:01 bully boy
0:25:02 what are some of the normal things that
0:25:04 I'd be expected to carry into Elysium
0:25:06 for weapons weathers kinda keeps a
0:25:10 pretty strict policy about it basically
0:25:11 bully boys are expected to carry a
0:25:14 weapon if if they feel that they might
0:25:16 need one so like on an intense uh night
0:25:20 like this absolutely you would be
0:25:22 expected to carry a weapon however it
0:25:25 can never be a weapon that is easily
0:25:28 seen by Common passerby so like you need
0:25:32 to basically dress you need to basically
0:25:33 handle it like you're being you know
0:25:35 unobtrusive security
0:25:37 so in that case Johnny has his knife on
0:25:41 him his boot knife boot knife good and
0:25:43 he's going to carry see if he can if he
0:25:46 can have two pistols on his person
0:25:48 concealed in his jacket that he intends
0:25:51 to hand over to other people to defend
0:25:53 himself sounds good easy
0:25:55 and then
0:25:57 also maybe a steak
0:25:59 wooden Stakes are actually common
0:26:01 choices so yeah so he's gonna have a
0:26:03 steak and two pistols in his jacket
0:26:05 which I think is probably a reasonable
0:26:06 amount to hide and then the boot knife
0:26:08 in his boot sounds good when we get out
0:26:12 when we'll take the the silver knives
0:26:14 just kind of hold them out you can stash
0:26:16 those anywhere on you
0:26:18 all right Mom you you bring in throwing
0:26:21 knives now
0:26:22 they're silver so
0:26:25 um
0:26:26 unexpected guests are allergic to Silver
0:26:30 if you say so
0:26:31 any luck with your family Johnny talk
0:26:33 about that again in some more time all
0:26:35 right all right so we move on up and
0:26:37 start a formation and I hope the the so
0:26:41 basically one of the setup cards pull up
0:26:42 but they haven't got out yet
0:26:44 so while you guys are hanging out yep uh
0:26:48 kind of out in the parking lot behind uh
0:26:51 the Elysium itself
0:26:53 you can see uh three like black SUVs
0:26:59 just like the ones that have chased you
0:27:01 guys around town in the past
0:27:03 uh they pull up and Goons
0:27:07 start climbing out a strong jawed beard
0:27:12 some of them have like greasy mop top
0:27:14 hair and they just look like straight up
0:27:18 goons and these goons start looking for
0:27:22 midnight Cobalt and
0:27:25 find their way find their way over to
0:27:28 Miles and you see a group of
0:27:31 sedai thugs
0:27:33 square up to to Great miles we're gonna
0:27:38 [ __ ] eat character conversation more
0:27:40 miles is like no I need them to know
0:27:42 what my car is [ __ ] them
0:27:46 it's so good
0:27:49 I stepping I think a gentlemen gentlemen
0:27:52 to you
0:27:53 yes we're expecting someone else no well
0:27:57 we're just ready to do this me too who
0:28:00 are we killing unsure yet what
0:28:02 possibilities will you let us know will
0:28:04 do
0:28:06 it
0:28:07 The Surly jug definitely gives us
0:28:10 at Miles like I hope you know what
0:28:13 you're doing
0:28:14 that's what it's all about isn't it
0:28:15 let's go on in I feel really
0:28:17 sophisticated first uh let himself and
0:28:21 look around to see who else is at the
0:28:23 opening to Elysium here so as you guys
0:28:26 approach the Jordan Elysium there's a
0:28:28 pair of men with kind of scraggly hair
0:28:32 dressed like
0:28:34 dressed like they're really really big
0:28:37 fans of Constantine
0:28:41 kind of hanging out by the door smoking
0:28:43 cigarettes with like tan trench coats
0:28:46 and like uh specifically like blue silk
0:28:50 ties and they kind of give the group of
0:28:54 you nods like they intend bad things but
0:28:58 get out of your way so that you can do
0:29:00 what you have to do they specifically do
0:29:02 not bar your entrance into Elysium
0:29:04 beyond that there's like half a dozen
0:29:08 brouha hanging out out front and they
0:29:11 all
0:29:12 Snicker and like talk [ __ ] about you
0:29:16 know Johnny and Miles selling out to the
0:29:17 set Heights and the set Heights stare at
0:29:20 them and they stare at the set Heights
0:29:21 and things are already looking like
0:29:23 people are going to start thumping
0:29:25 chests against each other at any moment
0:29:28 sorry that was not in character
0:29:30 you sure
0:29:32 no
0:29:35 Johnny definitely gives some nasty looks
0:29:37 back to the brujah just to start
0:29:39 striding for it don't even notice these
0:29:41 two miles oblivious to the drama that
0:29:46 surrounds him walks right in inside it
0:29:50 looks like there is
0:29:52 a smattering of awkward stupid pointless
0:29:58 conversations that are being held uh
0:30:00 amidst Kindred who are kind of just
0:30:04 waiting nervously for whatever's about
0:30:07 to happen to happen
0:30:09 and as you kind of go out into like that
0:30:13 big open space that makes it for you
0:30:15 that has like the couch is facing each
0:30:16 other and there's lots of Kindred kind
0:30:18 of dressed and fashionable clothing chit
0:30:21 chatting uh up overhead there's this uh
0:30:24 there's like a chandelier that shines
0:30:25 beautiful pieces of art all over the
0:30:28 place Britta can I please have a
0:30:29 self-control check a difficulty eight
0:30:31 yeah
0:30:34 [Music]
0:30:37 interesting I have nothing
0:30:40 including the willpower I said I'm not
0:30:42 supposed oh okay uh Brita walks in right
0:30:45 alongside side Miles ready to rock and
0:30:49 gets lost in this incredibly just
0:30:53 complex and distracting piece of Modern
0:30:57 Art imagine I'm walking behind her and I
0:31:00 do not see her stop no you bump right
0:31:02 into bump right oh sorry kiddo does that
0:31:06 break me out no interesting oh okay and
0:31:10 she just kind of grabs Brita by the
0:31:11 shoulders and keeps walking her forward
0:31:13 as a reminder like Toyota I have to be
0:31:16 careful late at night because if you
0:31:18 catch the start of the sunrise you have
0:31:20 to make a check
0:31:21 the fact that you're being burned to
0:31:23 death by the sun does not end the the
0:31:26 Tory Brooklyn weakness and Toyota just
0:31:28 sometimes die watching the sunrise
0:31:30 awesome so
0:31:33 and we're walking inside and we're
0:31:36 walking Johnny glances around to see if
0:31:38 he recognizes uh anybody that might be
0:31:42 on our side at any I don't know how many
0:31:46 other bully boys are left in in uh
0:31:48 weather's control and also actually I
0:31:49 want to see if I can spot weathers
0:31:51 anywhere so you do spot Weathers who is
0:31:54 pacing back and forth
0:31:57 kind of like a like a caged animal like
0:32:00 he's he's ready for for this [ __ ] to
0:32:03 start if whether it goes well or not he
0:32:06 he kind of very clearly needs something
0:32:09 to start happening Johnny walks over the
0:32:11 weathers gives him a hard look
0:32:14 doing all right old man I think right
0:32:16 about now is as good as it's going to
0:32:18 get tonight probably uh weathers Johnny
0:32:21 kind of like looks up at lyndon's
0:32:24 spooked you know if you heard it but
0:32:27 what's happening tonight
0:32:28 I know that there's
0:32:30 rumors that arabella's looking for
0:32:33 allies to support a Praxis claim Johnny
0:32:36 reaches into his uh pocket pulls out a
0:32:39 pen grabs weather's hand and writes
0:32:42 lupines new frowns what the hell are you
0:32:45 talking about
0:32:46 he then writes Sabbat and then dog
0:32:50 tagging
0:32:52 I have to talk to the center show are
0:32:55 working with the Sims film no one's
0:32:57 going to leave unless they call Court
0:32:59 Center Charles got to be talking being
0:33:01 reasonable if what I've been hearing is
0:33:04 true
0:33:05 the center shawls
0:33:07 well aware of all of these things and is
0:33:11 making moves
0:33:13 and that includes moves with Arabella
0:33:15 Rollins
0:33:16 and our good friend Shaw
0:33:19 although it looks like miles and the set
0:33:21 lights made nice he looks over at miles
0:33:23 on his pile of goons
0:33:25 what does that mean for us it means the
0:33:28 numbers are a little bit more even
0:33:31 okay
0:33:33 Jane had to step up
0:33:35 have you seen her now for a half hour at
0:33:37 least
0:33:39 okay
0:33:40 what's the plan what's miles doing
0:33:43 I'm not sure
0:33:46 yeah
0:33:48 he's being frustratingly Cavalier about
0:33:50 the whole thing
0:33:52 kinda unlike him
0:33:54 find nobody knows
0:33:56 I'm going to see if we can find Shaw he
0:33:59 disappeared in here somewhere where this
0:34:01 goes and he steps off to the side
0:34:05 [Music]
0:34:07 hey I mean the crew are heading towards
0:34:09 Elsa London Elsa Linden is up on the
0:34:12 second floor
0:34:13 she for whatever reason is not
0:34:16 surrounded by people and she's just kind
0:34:19 of like nervously leaning against the
0:34:21 window looking out the window like she
0:34:24 is completely tuned out of everything
0:34:26 that's going on in court and is just
0:34:28 kind of in her own head you do spot
0:34:30 Reese enter and walking beside him
0:34:34 terrified is
0:34:37 got ghostly little boy who as soon as he
0:34:41 sees you looks like he wants to like
0:34:43 rush to you but this
0:34:46 terrible fear of whatever it is Rhys
0:34:49 might do overwhelms him and he just
0:34:52 remains still
0:34:53 keeping close to the termia I kind of
0:34:56 give him a wink
0:34:58 he just kind of nods very fast
0:35:01 it's taking a lot but she is she wants
0:35:05 to be as he remembered her to be when
0:35:07 she shot the thing that hurt him in the
0:35:10 woods in one pretty much one shot
0:35:13 win is very much aware of how badly this
0:35:16 could go especially now that the xantosa
0:35:18 isn't here yeah are there any other
0:35:21 raids about no it looks like this is the
0:35:24 one who's gonna hang out nearby
0:35:27 can I make a lore Wraith
0:35:30 um role I want to know if there is
0:35:31 something compelling him to stay with
0:35:33 Rhys that I can get my hands on sure
0:35:37 intelligence yep
0:35:39 I'm gonna spend a willpower on this
0:35:44 uh three successes okay uh four sorry
0:35:47 you would know that if racism possession
0:35:50 of
0:35:51 a Fetter like a link that the boy had in
0:35:55 life whatever it is that kind of keeps
0:35:57 him tied to the Living World
0:36:00 um in theory Rhys could use that to
0:36:04 Blackmail and manipulate the poor ghost
0:36:07 is it also possible Rhys just is a
0:36:09 necromancer and has other means of doing
0:36:11 that that is certainly possible but a
0:36:13 lot of necromantic means would still
0:36:16 require that you have to make use of a
0:36:18 Fetter yes all right when Reese and I
0:36:21 were talking about the xantosa I seem to
0:36:24 remember something about a ring yes does
0:36:26 that look like it could have belonged to
0:36:27 a little boy or a little boy's mother
0:36:30 uh the ring is too big okay it is it is
0:36:33 a man's ring okay it's my role is it
0:36:35 possible that he the soul is already
0:36:37 bound into the ring
0:36:40 like been forged into it no okay if the
0:36:43 if so if the boy's Soul has been forged
0:36:46 the boy's soul is the item okay you
0:36:48 would not be able to see him he would
0:36:50 not be able to interact with him so from
0:36:51 where I am
0:36:53 um Brita is in front of me just staring
0:36:55 off into the chandelier
0:36:57 all right I'm going to kind of lean
0:36:58 forward and put my lips right next to
0:37:01 her ear kiddo I really need you to focus
0:37:03 up for me right now what's my timeline
0:37:06 give me a self-control check I will
0:37:09 spend the willpower this time sounds
0:37:10 good
0:37:14 difficulty eight three successes okay
0:37:17 when gets your attention and you tear
0:37:19 yourself wait sorry too in case it
0:37:20 matters cheers nope two's still good
0:37:23 sweetheart I need you to look very
0:37:25 closely at this initial and I need you
0:37:28 to tell me if anything you see on him
0:37:31 could in any way be something that
0:37:35 belongs to a little boy or a little
0:37:37 boy's mother bretta's gonna try to keep
0:37:40 the same sort of glaze expression on her
0:37:42 face try not to let her expression slip
0:37:44 too much as if she's still entranced by
0:37:46 the chandelier she's gonna also try to
0:37:48 orient her body away from the chandelier
0:37:50 just kind of as much as she can turn
0:37:52 towards the center shawl and not towards
0:37:54 the item she'll look carefully
0:37:56 unassisted at first so if she sees
0:37:58 nothing she's going to switch on
0:37:59 heightened Vision go ahead and give me a
0:38:02 perception plus alertness your
0:38:04 difficulty is eight minus your aspects
0:38:07 rating
0:38:10 minus one okay so for Success okay uh
0:38:15 with four successes you can see kind of
0:38:18 uh tucked into his coat pocket there's
0:38:22 just enough of like a bump in a sheep
0:38:26 in his pocket you can actually make out
0:38:28 the shape of a whistle at that point
0:38:31 once Brita gets an idea of the object
0:38:34 she will stop using aspects keeping
0:38:36 herself still she's still very cautious
0:38:38 about the chandelier the Temptation is
0:38:41 very real but she'll allow herself to
0:38:45 break out of the glaze expression
0:38:47 lean back over to win
0:38:50 front pocket something like
0:38:53 a whistle is it obvious when you start
0:38:55 pumping blood into disciplines or into
0:38:57 raising your stats no okay my what an
0:39:00 interesting question you have what the
0:39:03 guys
0:39:05 and wind just kind of like makes it look
0:39:07 like she was doing a weird Gangrel
0:39:08 nuzzle thing against her codery mate you
0:39:11 give her the weird Gangrel muzzle yep
0:39:13 also also you kind of get a weird Gangrel
0:39:16 nuzzle as she says thank you
0:39:19 I was using the hide but I'm not really
0:39:22 look it can be two things
0:39:28 [Music]
0:39:31 so I'll move up to the second floor with
0:39:33 Elsa and I will ask the Posse to you
0:39:36 know wait back a little bit okay with a
0:39:39 March up the stairs towards her uh you
0:39:41 approach Elsa you do not seem to be able
0:39:43 to kind of like draw her attention her
0:39:46 gaze is just outside it looks like she's
0:39:49 maybe reminiscing and in her hand is a
0:39:54 wine glass filled with some dark red
0:39:56 liquid she just seems completely
0:40:00 apathetic as to what's going on around
0:40:02 her
0:40:03 Elsa Miss Lyndon I figured your first
0:40:07 name would at least get you to turn
0:40:09 around to look at me I dare not look
0:40:11 away or blink I've come as I said it
0:40:14 would
0:40:15 and I've come prepared to deal with any
0:40:17 of these eventualities there is no
0:40:19 preparing for a Lupine miles there are
0:40:22 some but there's also people that'll
0:40:24 help you if that comes to that
0:40:28 you know I've seen them before up close
0:40:30 I had heard
0:40:32 mindless beasts
0:40:35 strong enough to
0:40:37 tear a modern chorus under
0:40:40 also there's other things going on right
0:40:43 now and I know that it's not the biggest
0:40:45 of your concerns but things do need to
0:40:48 keep moving the political Affair of the
0:40:50 local Kindred will mean nothing the
0:40:52 moment the Lupine arrives
0:40:54 or it'll be that exact moment when all
0:40:56 this solidifies
0:40:58 what
0:41:00 we're under the impression that Rhys and
0:41:02 them are working
0:41:03 or at least knowledgeable of what
0:41:05 Killing Spree is about to do and part of
0:41:08 this is stopping them
0:41:09 so I'm here to ask for your help
0:41:12 if we agree
0:41:14 to give them the city
0:41:16 will the Lupine still come
0:41:19 yes
0:41:21 it makes no sense
0:41:23 it's about makes no sense their chaos so
0:41:26 what exists to destroy why would they
0:41:28 make all of these machinations if they
0:41:31 intend on simply wiping out the local
0:41:34 Court
0:41:35 I think that's just here to cause chaos
0:41:37 it's going to do that yes that's true
0:41:40 but so much more miles because maybe
0:41:43 these people thought they were smarter
0:41:45 than the individuals they were dealing
0:41:46 with
0:41:47 looks back at you
0:41:49 they're hubris has played to me every
0:41:52 step hubris has plagued all of this
0:41:55 quarter miles
0:41:56 that's true you shouldn't be here but
0:41:59 you're here and I said I would come
0:42:03 what is your plan they're gonna go for
0:42:05 practice
0:42:06 and you plan to fight it yes
0:42:09 and you want me to help you fight
0:42:11 correct
0:42:12 at least politically everything else is
0:42:15 up to you
0:42:17 if we survive the night things will
0:42:19 shift
0:42:20 yes I suppose if we survive the night
0:42:23 the sky's the limit
0:42:25 you've been a trustworthy person this
0:42:27 court and you've helped me out when you
0:42:28 didn't have to
0:42:29 but it should also be known that
0:42:31 Roland's hasn't suffered the final death
0:42:33 yet
0:42:35 he is not no do you have proof of this
0:42:38 yes
0:42:39 also proof that somebody knew exactly
0:42:42 where the Panic Room was that they were
0:42:45 in
0:42:46 and took them out with a grenade
0:42:48 a Precision strike
0:42:51 forever provide what evidence you have
0:42:53 to Romeo he'll make sure that it gets
0:42:56 out to all of the locals and by the time
0:42:59 you are confronting Rhys everyone will
0:43:01 know of his duplicity
0:43:03 Elsa just a quick question yes she said
0:43:06 like she has not looked away from the
0:43:07 window what was the question I asked you
0:43:09 well what was the term that I used
0:43:11 before that you didn't understand
0:43:13 speakerphone good enough we are under
0:43:16 the understanding that there's a person
0:43:18 that can impersonate other people in
0:43:19 this court I understand and show us here
0:43:22 somewhere
0:43:23 anything I should say to Romeo you let
0:43:26 him know that I said for him to spread
0:43:29 the information far and wide he'll know
0:43:31 what to do I would get yourself nailed
0:43:33 Johnny I see a little point in that
0:43:35 currently he's holding some of our best
0:43:37 things and he'll be able to make a
0:43:39 decision about getting you in and or out
0:43:40 or keeping you safe I was serious she
0:43:43 actually like looks away from the window
0:43:46 okay
0:43:47 I mean weathers will probably be close
0:43:49 to each other well she kind of gives you
0:43:52 a nod and heads downstairs
0:43:56 and just sits by Johnny and I'm gonna
0:43:58 start walking and go and look from up
0:44:00 there to see if I can find Romeo
0:44:02 [Music]
0:44:07 Johnny will be kind of pacing around
0:44:09 keeping an eye on things so he's not
0:44:11 really staying in one location at some
0:44:13 point he's gonna kind of get to like the
0:44:15 back of Elysium and go into some of the
0:44:17 back rooms where like the sheriff and
0:44:19 the bully boys kind of like stay just to
0:44:21 kind of like keep see if see if what he
0:44:23 can see in the back areas and if he can
0:44:25 get to a window on the back side of
0:44:27 Elysium he'll take a look to see if the
0:44:29 car is going when you kind of slip
0:44:31 around and look you can see that the car
0:44:35 is not gone two people are in it and
0:44:38 they're kind of like reclined in seats
0:44:40 quietly waiting for some opportunity to
0:44:43 drive away and you immediately recognize
0:44:47 Jane and Jessica
0:44:49 I'm going to walk into Elysium and look
0:44:51 around for everybody and just kind of
0:44:52 see the Tableau of all them standing
0:44:54 there everyone looks pretty goddamn
0:44:55 serious I made my way over miles I'm
0:44:58 probably in the second part of the
0:45:00 Falcon like looking around for Romeo
0:45:02 gives a subtle thumbs up so uh
0:45:05 that's our uh
0:45:10 around for him
0:45:12 are we are they up on the balcony yeah
0:45:14 the two of them are yeah I'm posed about
0:45:17 looking Romeo Romeo
0:45:22 uh yeah
0:45:24 you guys actually pretty easily see
0:45:26 Romeo making a b line towards someone I
0:45:29 would like follow the trajectory where
0:45:31 he's going as he head into Beretta I'm
0:45:34 still standing by which interesting
0:45:35 miles you may want to intercept that oh
0:45:37 thank you before this gets to move down
0:45:40 the stairs young toriadori I'm sorry
0:45:43 what you see points uh Romeo stops in
0:45:46 front of you but and he takes off his
0:45:49 Sony like CD player Walkman and just
0:45:53 like you know he takes the headphones
0:45:54 off his ears
0:45:55 yo hey Jesus Christ you're that uh
0:46:00 you're that new Toyota right
0:46:03 I've heard that you maybe had a similar
0:46:06 start
0:46:07 yeah something like that I mean uh
0:46:11 she'll hold her hand for a handshake and
0:46:12 she'll say
0:46:13 well obviously you know who I am but you
0:46:16 shake your hands and his hands are ice
0:46:19 cold to the touch so are mine yeah I
0:46:22 notice I think right you would notice
0:46:25 the equivalent temperature I'm
0:46:26 describing it to you because you know
0:46:27 this does he appear to take notice I'll
0:46:30 look up to his face at the contact and
0:46:32 The Sensation
0:46:33 so you guys shake hands your eyes fall
0:46:35 down to the two of your hands and his
0:46:37 eyes fall to the two of your hands and
0:46:39 then you both kind of look up at each
0:46:41 other at the same moment when is
0:46:43 watching
0:46:45 it's like trying not to be disapproving
0:46:47 but failing the mom chaperone at the
0:46:50 middle school dance yep
0:46:54 should um talk
0:46:56 see if we match stories he like leans in
0:47:01 really close very comfortable with you
0:47:02 and Whispers
0:47:05 I think I know who you are and he just
0:47:07 turns and walks away nope
0:47:10 um
0:47:14 let's stop and me I'm walking off with
0:47:16 him
0:47:16 I was like I'm coming straight at them
0:47:18 at this point miles you arrived and he's
0:47:22 like oh sorry excuse me and he like goes
0:47:25 to disengage yeah yeah I was like hold
0:47:27 he pauses I also Lynn didn't send to me
0:47:29 what does she need she kind of like
0:47:31 becomes way more focused she needs you
0:47:34 to spread this information about
0:47:37 Arabella Rhys and Shaw's plan and the
0:47:41 fact that the prince has not suffered
0:47:43 the final death what'd you got for me
0:47:45 and I show I got the pictures kind of
0:47:47 takes the pictures and like looks
0:47:49 through them all right I'll make sure
0:47:51 this gets out I don't know if this is a
0:47:53 role or what this is uh and or if it's
0:47:56 just no that's not a thing
0:48:00 uh just basic like eye color skin color
0:48:04 hair color combination could this be one
0:48:07 of the kids from the memory Romeo you're
0:48:09 not sure I don't have like a clear idea
0:48:11 yeah the memory of the kids doesn't
0:48:13 stand out quite enough okay cool uh no
0:48:16 uh he's busy no I don't care I'm gonna
0:48:20 try to walk off with him unless someone
0:48:21 stops me
0:48:23 he kind of like as she starts to go he's
0:48:25 like puts in like stop
0:48:28 the Ann British expression that she is
0:48:30 not ready to be cool but she'll kind of
0:48:33 tilt her head the big deal eyes and very
0:48:36 hesitantly nod because miles just asked
0:48:39 him to do something it seems to be the
0:48:41 only thing holding her back from this
0:48:43 we'll talk okay he starts heading up the
0:48:46 stairs and then up on the second floor
0:48:49 out of the Sheriff's Office emerges
0:48:53 sure and who looks around
0:48:56 has that typical toothy grin that he
0:49:00 watches the group with his skin is still
0:49:02 like charcoal black has full Nosferatu
0:49:06 Visage is clear as day for everyone to
0:49:10 see did weathers head up to the
0:49:12 Sheriff's Office and then he come out no
0:49:15 okay no weathers is uh still kind of
0:49:18 like looking around okay so Shaw's just
0:49:20 uh coming out of the Sheriff's Office
0:49:22 like he's shared like he [ __ ] owns
0:49:25 the place yeah exactly
0:49:27 very quickly goon start forming up at
0:49:30 Shaw's flanks and Rhys moves to go and
0:49:35 join him if I catch weather's eyes I
0:49:38 definitely give him kind of like a and
0:49:40 point up he looks up kind of gives you a
0:49:42 nod and seems to be keeping an eye on
0:49:44 this situation but the goons head
0:49:45 downstairs and they seem to be headed
0:49:48 towards miles seeing what's going on
0:49:50 followers of set goons start making
0:49:52 their way over to Miles and at this
0:49:54 point the entire court false silent and
0:49:58 begins to watch the group of you I'm
0:50:00 gonna fall in and
0:50:02 stand by Miles as well I will stand by
0:50:04 my Posse make my way down sort of
0:50:07 awkwardly past them because they were on
0:50:08 the second floor too down to stand next
0:50:10 to miles but I am very much on the
0:50:12 lookout for an opportunity to bump into
0:50:14 Rhys okay kind of joining you guys
0:50:17 around your like what kind of song like
0:50:20 on the outskirts of it is Elsa Linden
0:50:22 who like lights of Virginia Slim
0:50:27 and like nervously start smoking it is
0:50:32 not the tension of the meeting that has
0:50:36 her freaked at something something else
0:50:38 I'm
0:50:39 this is maybe a bad idea considering how
0:50:42 much jewelry she wears I'm not going to
0:50:44 look at her but I'm going to see if I
0:50:45 remember what kind of jewelry she wears
0:50:48 silver and color uh she does wear a lot
0:50:50 of silver jewelry it really it's a heck
0:50:52 a lot of sense
0:50:54 Johnny takes a look around and make sure
0:50:56 that his he's only giving us back to
0:50:57 people that he trusts in this situation
0:50:59 and then kind of just stands with his
0:51:01 hands on his hips but pushes his leather
0:51:03 jacket up exposing the fact that he's
0:51:05 got a pistol
0:51:07 um and it hit the uh like sitting in the
0:51:09 back of his jeans in fact actually if he
0:51:11 can manage it he's going to show off
0:51:12 both of those pistols because he doesn't
0:51:14 need either of them this might sound
0:51:16 like a really weird question the stances
0:51:18 that the cotery is taking right now and
0:51:20 how they're all standing next to each
0:51:22 other am I getting some serious Deja Vu
0:51:24 yes
0:51:25 Neil starts looking really nervously at
0:51:29 how everyone is standing and then
0:51:31 throwing glances towards the front doors
0:51:33 Brita catches the look from her angle
0:51:36 and tries to she's confused she can't
0:51:39 really get why he looks nervous but she
0:51:41 well like adjusts I sort of
0:51:44 subconsciously put on heightened senses
0:51:47 edges a little closer to her emotional
0:51:50 support malcavian this is
0:51:54 [Music]
0:51:56 miles
0:51:58 sure it's good to see you it's good to
0:52:02 see you it's unusual I heard word that
0:52:06 the will of the prince was violated and
0:52:08 someone made a visit to the Sabbat
0:52:12 you don't know anything about this miles
0:52:15 to you last time I checked I was
0:52:17 carrying out the will of the prince so
0:52:19 no well friends that's so what you know
0:52:24 about the Sabbat in the area Shaw I know
0:52:26 everything I'm supposed to know I'm a
0:52:28 member of the Nosferatu Johnny so why
0:52:31 don't you Enlighten the court you sure
0:52:33 you aren't there
0:52:34 shrugs like go for it I have been
0:52:37 conducting an investigation as the newly
0:52:41 appointed Sheriff of this domain it kind
0:52:43 of points to Rhys who kind of gives the
0:52:46 crowd a nod confirming that he has
0:52:48 indeed been awarded this position
0:52:50 appointed by who the son of Shaw who
0:52:53 acts with the will of the prince but the
0:52:55 prince still lives the Santa Shaw's
0:52:58 power exists so long as the prince isn't
0:53:01 present he's just going to replace the
0:53:03 domain position even though the prince
0:53:06 think you and I both know that rolands
0:53:09 is gonna let Reese do whatever the hell
0:53:11 he wants that's not really the subject
0:53:14 of this conversation not yet it's been
0:53:17 brought to our attention via the aid of
0:53:19 the web the Sabbat has been using an
0:53:22 infiltrator to get in deep learn the
0:53:24 secrets of this court so his master
0:53:26 could strike some of you might remember
0:53:29 that a while ago there was a bruja that
0:53:33 weathers insisted be allowed to walk
0:53:36 among us despite his disgusting Sabbat
0:53:39 Origins you [ __ ]
0:53:43 you're going to spread those lies those
0:53:45 lies yeah who's your son Johnny I don't
0:53:48 know who my sire is never caught his
0:53:50 name well good for you I do
0:53:53 Johnny is the product of The Killing
0:53:57 Spree an Infamous Sabbat pack that has
0:54:00 begun acting in the area using
0:54:02 intelligence provided to them by Johnny
0:54:05 and the crowd starts like gasping at a
0:54:08 bunch of [ __ ] raw like [ __ ] knew
0:54:09 it Johnny's a [ __ ] traitor anyone who
0:54:12 knows Johnny knows he doesn't have a
0:54:13 drop of intelligence
0:54:17 and kind of just gives you this like
0:54:20 look like really
0:54:23 guys
0:54:25 well that's interesting Shaw because
0:54:28 the information that we have says that
0:54:31 the Killing Spree was provided that
0:54:33 information by you
0:54:36 ridiculous I've never even met members
0:54:38 of The Killing Spree no but you missed
0:54:40 my child people start immediately like
0:54:42 looking at Shaw and like they're giving
0:54:44 me that like really intense stare that
0:54:46 they give when they're like totally
0:54:48 using or a perception but like trying to
0:54:51 not reveal that they're using or
0:54:52 perception she's literally looking at
0:54:54 the rules for oral perception
0:54:57 one of those people is me I didn't say
0:55:00 anything about talking to killings
0:55:02 pretty directly that's weird that you
0:55:04 went directly there how about Vito
0:55:06 Sentosa Johnny please stop helping me
0:55:09 that's a good question where is Vito
0:55:13 zantosa Johnny who helped veto get out
0:55:16 of town before my guys were able to
0:55:19 perform their strike who's hiding that
0:55:21 member of the Sabbat no one's hiding
0:55:23 that member of the Suboxone and where is
0:55:25 he not here and not there it's not what
0:55:28 I asked miles consider this a formal
0:55:30 Sheriff investigation answer my question
0:55:33 where is Vito santosa how about we table
0:55:36 that since maybe we should come up with
0:55:38 the question of who attacked the prince
0:55:40 in his own Haven seems a little bit more
0:55:44 important than your than what an
0:55:46 impending Sabbat attack because of your
0:55:48 quotery mate or an impending Sabbat
0:55:50 attack because of you you also seem to
0:55:52 dodge that question the crowd is getting
0:55:54 [ __ ] more and more nervous every time
0:55:57 so I was like I'm painting is about
0:55:58 attack and painting someone attack and
0:55:59 pending someone attacks when miles drops
0:56:01 the life somebody attacked the prince
0:56:03 bomb both recent shower up there and I
0:56:05 want to be watching for any flickers of
0:56:08 nervousness in their auras when that
0:56:11 comes out of nowhere uh give me or
0:56:13 perception
0:56:15 uh so one success uh with one success
0:56:17 Rhys shows just the faintest ghost of
0:56:22 nervousness I'll lean over the miles and
0:56:24 just out of the corner of my mouth
0:56:25 without moving Maurice what I know he
0:56:28 doesn't like
0:56:29 that is that the prince was attacked
0:56:31 recently on top of the sudden change and
0:56:35 the only person who knew where Roland's
0:56:37 was was Arabella and now I was tasked by
0:56:41 my sire archon Peter Zoom to look into
0:56:45 dealings with people from our domain to
0:56:48 outside the domain so you're telling me
0:56:50 that the Venture engaged in a plot
0:56:52 against their fellow Venture and this
0:56:55 should be a distraction from Johnny's
0:56:57 blatant treachery because
0:57:00 it seems like you're deflecting a lot it
0:57:02 seems like I'm in the midst of doing my
0:57:04 job and being interrupted by an
0:57:06 impatulent ventru who's trying to
0:57:08 protect his clearly guilty quotery mate
0:57:11 it seems like you're also protecting the
0:57:13 two individuals that are I guess not a
0:57:15 codery but co-conspirators everybody
0:57:17 knows you've been talking with them all
0:57:18 day look at the faces around you they
0:57:20 all know

0:57:24 floor and Arabella steps out onto the
0:57:28 balcony when a door swings open Neil
0:57:30 starts and like almost has a panic
0:57:32 attack and then sees Arabella and like
0:57:34 calms down door swings open

0:58:03 that somehow you're the one that's
0:58:06 straightforward and I'm the master
0:58:07 manipulator can't believe that the Brew
