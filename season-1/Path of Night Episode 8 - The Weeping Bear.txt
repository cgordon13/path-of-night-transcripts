0:00:02 the masquerade podcast set in the
0:00:03 classic world of darkness we're all
0:00:05 friends we're here to have fun but our
0:00:07 story can include graphic violence drug
0:00:09 use sexual content and other mature
0:00:11 themes we've talked at our table about

0:00:19 we want you to feel the same so listener
0:00:21 discretion is advised
0:00:23 now let's walk the path of night
0:00:28 last time on path of night new year's
0:00:31 day
0:00:32 1999 miles and clan venture made a deal
0:00:35 with his enemies the followers of saturn
0:00:37 received some mysterious packages along
0:00:40 with an ominous warning that trouble is
0:00:42 coming to new haven
0:00:44 china received a distressing phone call
0:00:46 from his past and bumped into an old
0:00:48 ravnos ally
0:00:50 wynn urged the quartery to help her deal
0:00:53 with the monster corpse in her fridge
0:00:57 in preparation for dealing with what
0:00:59 waits in east rock park the quarter is
0:01:01 ready to head out for brita's next
0:01:03 attempt at feeding
0:01:07 so at this point the group of you are
0:01:09 meeting back
0:01:10 at miles is haven um
0:01:13 miles
0:01:14 you receive a t9 text message
0:01:18 from your minion
0:01:19 indicating that he has acquired the
0:01:21 vehicle that you've requested
0:01:22 and it will be arriving shortly
0:01:25 great i wonder which exact shade of red
0:01:27 it is because i think we just described
0:01:30 it as being red yeah so i can't wait to
0:01:32 see which one he picked out well it's
0:01:33 enjoyed to find out within a few minutes
0:01:35 you're way too chipper what's going on
0:01:37 i'm getting a new car what other reason
0:01:39 would he have three o'clock in the
0:01:40 morning on new year's eve
0:01:43 how
0:01:44 i mean i believe it's still like
0:01:46 early nightish isn't it it's money it's
0:01:48 true it is money don't actually have a
0:01:50 watch right now but yes the usual answer
0:01:52 for these things is money influence oh
0:01:54 okay i have no response to that
0:01:56 i mean how else do you get things done
0:01:58 asking for favors
0:02:00 hitting things taking them those those
0:02:02 usually get you followed around by the
0:02:03 mortal authorities when you know if you
0:02:05 do it
0:02:06 especially if you steal nice cars i mean
0:02:08 you could also just do it yourself
0:02:11 you don't have to hit this like hit
0:02:12 anything you don't ask for a favor you
0:02:13 just do it
0:02:15 yes
0:02:16 how do you get things done you just do
0:02:18 them
0:02:19 are we
0:02:20 stopping by then once we get the car
0:02:23 yeah yes we'll probably need to make
0:02:24 sure it's fully fueled and
0:02:26 at that point we'll hopefully engage in
0:02:28 your
0:02:30 feeding
0:02:31 okay
0:02:32 good good feeling resolute about this
0:02:36 it's not a choice right
0:02:38 not particularly it's kind of a
0:02:40 necessity
0:02:42 so it doesn't really
0:02:43 matter
0:02:44 yes
0:02:45 there you go
0:02:46 well
0:02:47 you have to do it sometime then let's do
0:02:50 it very good gather your gear
0:02:52 we'll go outside and wait for the
0:02:55 car to pull up
0:02:56 gear
0:02:57 don't you have gear
0:02:59 i have shoes and a shirt did you find
0:03:02 those yeah i got them okay yeah they're
0:03:04 right so you need other gear
0:03:07 to go to the store no because we're
0:03:09 going after that to out to win's place
0:03:12 oh you're getting away with monster
0:03:13 things
0:03:14 oh
0:03:16 right
0:03:17 i've been really uh sidetracked tonight
0:03:19 no no i don't think i need gear i'm fine
0:03:21 okay
0:03:22 i've got all my stuff yes
0:03:27 excellent it pulls up it flashes what
0:03:30 seems to be a series of high beams
0:03:33 at the front windows
0:03:35 uh johnny johnny peeks out of the window
0:03:37 looks at it i thought you said you did
0:03:39 are you serious is that a hummer
0:03:41 yes it is
0:03:43 oh
0:03:44 god damn it miles i got it after the
0:03:47 front door opens
0:03:49 the only thing i had available was
0:03:51 uh twilight maroon oh it sounds perfect
0:03:54 excellent thank you marcus hands the
0:03:56 key's over
0:03:59 gives kurt nod to the group of you and
0:04:02 heads off to try to get some sleep
0:04:06 you know if you want to stop being
0:04:07 attacked by settings you know rule
0:04:09 number one might be finding a vehicle
0:04:11 that's a little bit less
0:04:13 noticeable i mean all they have to do is
0:04:15 post mortal people to watch whatever
0:04:17 whatever i used to leave this place with
0:04:18 anyway so what's the difference
0:04:20 trackability and traffic
0:04:23 and they have
0:04:25 they have both vampire magics and our
0:04:27 cute senses
0:04:29 might as well live in style okay
0:04:31 miles i'm just saying i've made a whole
0:04:33 career out of getting to places
0:04:35 unnoticed
0:04:37 are we ready to go yeah let's go maybe
0:04:39 we should stop talking about cars
0:04:42 i'm sorry i i don't mean to rush
0:04:44 everyone it's just i
0:04:46 need to do this and i i don't want to
0:04:48 lose my
0:04:49 steal you're understandably nervous and
0:04:52 we're probably not helping right now
0:04:54 that thing inside you getting worse
0:04:56 yeah yeah i think it's something you can
0:04:58 feel it clawing at you huh
0:05:00 yeah i feel like that's not helpful well
0:05:02 it's a metaphor oh
0:05:04 that makes it okay i think i'm going to
0:05:05 store the sorry what else would you
0:05:07 describe it i wouldn't describe it she
0:05:09 knows what she's feeling i'll do this
0:05:11 right and that means

0:05:21 going to put my
0:05:23 katana in the trunk for now that makes

0:05:48 with your new car and i just i want to
0:05:50 call shotgun
0:05:51 neil runs towards the passenger side i
0:05:53 mean he's kind of running

0:05:57 hard as he can
0:05:59 go he'll go johnny will celebrity in
0:06:02 front of him

0:06:09 back
0:06:11 oh you pushed real hard
0:06:13 um
0:06:14 yeah let's power it up and let's go find
0:06:16 this
0:06:19 mouse who's driving that'd be me
0:06:21 not a chance to tell if you would let
0:06:23 any of us drive not the first drive no
0:06:28 [Music]
0:06:31 so
0:06:32 without being attacked by followers of
0:06:34 set it can't happen you make it to the
0:06:36 gas station
0:06:40 because it was like two blocks pretty
0:06:41 quiet half the tank has gone around
0:06:45 you
0:06:48 you can actually see a marked difference
0:06:52 in your fuel level there
0:06:54 i think i'm actually gonna have to put
0:06:55 gas in this uh why don't you go inside
0:06:57 and let's hand you some cash take the
0:07:00 cash and uh get out and head
0:07:03 towards the mini mart as soon as brother
0:07:06 gets out neil will turn around and look
0:07:07 at the rest do you i mean she's gonna be
0:07:09 alone in there do you want me to
0:07:12 you know
0:07:13 he nods his head towards the the door
0:07:15 just in case
0:07:17 she doesn't have to know johnny motions
0:07:19 at you and win
0:07:20 because one of the two you just kind of
0:07:23 hang over her shoulder make sure she's
0:07:25 not going to do anything we can hang out
0:07:28 it's not that big a place
0:07:31 yeah are you sure because i could be in
0:07:32 the room she never has to know
0:07:34 i think we need to let her do this one
0:07:36 on her own okay i i trust you that's
0:07:39 that's i i will trust your judgment on
0:07:41 that those are famous last words i i
0:07:44 think i still think you should be the
0:07:45 two of you should just keep an eye over
0:07:47 our shoulder don't let her know you're
0:07:48 watching sure well just we'll hang out
0:07:50 outside yeah that stack of wood
0:07:53 yeah well there's like what does every
0:07:55 gas station sell wood
0:07:57 uh because they also sell gasoline which
0:07:59 is an accelerant for fires yeah that's
0:08:01 why i'm asking get out and start walking
0:08:03 over i'll open the door who's manning it
0:08:06 there's a little bell and
0:08:08 you see uh
0:08:10 around the a middle-aged man

0:11:06 yes
0:11:08 yes i would and he closes up
0:11:11 his his little like magazine with a
0:11:14 bunch of crossword puzzles on it

0:11:20 bathroom
0:11:22 who says romance is dead holy [ __ ] this
0:11:24 kid's a natural yeah she's gonna have a
0:11:26 hell of a lot easier time than we do
0:11:27 yeah she is
0:11:28 following to the bathroom yep he goes
0:11:30 into the bathroom he's waiting uh the
0:11:33 bathroom
0:11:35 is
0:11:36 mortifying
0:11:38 horror story
0:11:39 the most upsetting thing she's seen into
0:11:42 like
0:11:43 the light flickers
0:11:45 the mirror like you can't see yourself
0:11:47 at all in it i don't want to
0:11:50 so
0:11:51 i'll kiss him
0:11:52 because i'm gently at first move down to
0:11:55 the neck go for it he like uh gives like
0:11:58 this like nervous laugh as you go to
0:12:00 kiss him but like
0:12:02 manages to keep himself together just
0:12:04 long enough to be kissed
0:12:06 uh and does not seem to put up any
0:12:08 resistance i'll giggle back as if this
0:12:10 is all a joke destroys his confidence
0:12:13 immediately
0:12:19 oh if i see that then i'll go in for a
0:12:22 kiss to confirm that this is still going
0:12:24 well for him
0:12:28 with as much confidence as she can yes
0:12:31 yeah there's there's just a very sad all
0:12:33 shucks
0:12:34 sort of reaction from him are you
0:12:37 going for the bite going for the bite
0:12:39 okay
0:12:40 uh he offers no resistance
0:12:43 you sink your fangs into this into his
0:12:45 flesh
0:12:46 and
0:12:47 just like
0:12:49 before he is instantly at your mercy uh
0:12:52 almost like uh like a actually to
0:12:56 an uncomfortable level it upsets her but
0:13:00 at this point she is getting hungry
0:13:03 and uh
0:13:04 how much are you taking
0:13:06 so she had some description
0:13:09 she's not trying to take
0:13:11 much but i don't know how good her scope
0:13:14 is
0:13:15 i have one dot of medicine i think she
0:13:18 will have some knowledge if he starts
0:13:20 going
0:13:21 too faint or too limp or too pale okay
0:13:24 why don't you give me a perception
0:13:26 medicine check
0:13:28 the difficulty of this role is six i
0:13:30 will
0:13:31 spend a willpower mark it off and go
0:13:34 ahead and give me a roll
0:13:37 four successes four successes
0:13:41 you know that you can probably safely
0:13:43 take three
0:13:44 and you get a feel for it uh he'll be
0:13:47 tired he's probably going to fall asleep
0:13:51 but he's not going to be in need of
0:13:52 medical attention net said
0:13:55 when
0:13:56 you break the kiss
0:13:58 and lean back
0:13:59 he still has an open wound on his neck
0:14:02 i will lick it you lick the wound and it
0:14:04 closes as though we're never there
0:14:07 and i will throw his arm over my
0:14:10 shoulder
0:14:11 uh i am not strong i don't think let's
0:14:13 see i've strike two is that enough
0:14:15 strength two is enough for you to kind
0:14:17 of help him out of the bathroom all
0:14:18 right
0:14:19 clumsy but you can do it
0:14:21 having been
0:14:23 working heightened senses listening from
0:14:25 outside after she lost sight

0:14:29 okay she might need help getting this
0:14:30 guy out of here now you hear the thunk

0:14:38 the bathroom and i can't really help
0:14:40 i'm on it

0:15:01 hops out of the uh hummer right after
0:15:03 they go to follow her gets out and
0:15:05 actually starts pumping the gas and then
0:15:07 goes around over the window
0:15:09 uh on the driver's side to talk to miles
0:15:12 he looks back over make sure everybody
0:15:14 else is out of earshot you know as best
0:15:17 he can
0:15:18 hey so uh i was wondering if you'd do me
0:15:20 a favor
0:15:21 what's going on
0:15:23 you know how uh i made mention that uh
0:15:26 i ran into kabir
0:15:29 i don't want to get anybody upset or
0:15:31 thinking that something's up with that
0:15:33 but
0:15:34 if you don't mind doing me a favor
0:15:37 at some point
0:15:38 give him a call and johnny passes
0:15:41 miles a number
0:15:43 that he has for kabir give him a call
0:15:46 and ask about me and ask him when the
0:15:48 last time he saw me was say you're
0:15:49 trying to find out where i am to get in
0:15:52 touch
0:15:53 right now
0:15:54 there's only two people that have this
0:15:56 beeper number who holds up the uh the
0:15:59 rhinestone beeper
0:16:00 and that's wet's weathers
0:16:03 and kabir
0:16:05 so if one of them
0:16:06 [ __ ] me on this
0:16:08 might tell us about where this leak is
0:16:10 coming from because i'm not sure that
0:16:12 who i ran into earlier is actually kabir
0:16:15 it seems
0:16:17 coincidental but that's not
0:16:20 after a night like tonight yeah i know i
0:16:23 hear you you want me to do that now
0:16:25 give it some time
0:16:27 i don't
0:16:28 i don't want it to seem too obvious that
0:16:31 i'm checking into this
0:16:33 all right i've already been seen with
0:16:35 you tonight we've been doing things
0:16:38 give it a little bit of time and give
0:16:39 him a call and ask him when the last
0:16:41 time he saw he saw me was i will venture
0:16:44 to do so
0:16:45 thanks
0:16:50 i guess we should put him behind the
0:16:51 counter right yeah lex how conscious is
0:16:53 this guy
0:16:55 uh
0:16:56 he's not that awake yeah okay he kind of
0:16:59 groans every now and again but all right
0:17:02 easy buddy winnell definitely like she's
0:17:05 done this before like she's picked up
0:17:06 passed out guys and put them back on
0:17:09 their stools she just kind of hefs him
0:17:11 over swings him on
0:17:13 sets him down yeah he doesn't really put
0:17:15 him very much in the way of resistance
0:17:17 it's mostly just dead weight yep
0:17:20 brita is kind of like there's there's
0:17:22 nothing on her face but she kind of

0:20:26 send the front

0:20:35 there's plenty in the back too did it go
0:20:37 johnny i couldn't remember exactly what
0:20:39 your brand was so i just got you most of
0:20:41 it you bought a whole damn curtain what

0:20:54 i fed
0:20:55 excellent she did good yep
0:20:59 okay win

0:21:02 going i don't know where you're specific
0:21:04 all right um
0:21:06 neil can we swap c's
0:21:07 so i can sit in front and point the way
0:21:09 i guess
0:21:11 i know you called it i would let you sit
0:21:12 on my lap but that would definitely draw
0:21:14 attention
0:21:15 yeah that's illegal yep
0:21:18 yeah i just clamber over the back seat
0:21:19 like the center console into the back
0:21:21 are you
0:21:23 meant to feel
0:21:25 full
0:21:26 with
0:21:27 feeding off one human
0:21:29 it depends on
0:21:32 how long your tank is
0:21:35 and certain degrees almost never fearful
0:21:38 i mean that's the truth it's always
0:21:40 there it's always hanging in the back
0:21:44 sometimes it's quieter
0:21:47 okay
0:21:48 let's go check out some monster things
0:21:51 that we need caught
0:21:52 with a ridiculously loud roar of the
0:21:56 giant
0:21:58 obtuse vehicle the group of you're in
0:22:02 you head off for your secret mission to
0:22:04 the woods
0:22:05 canyon arrow
0:22:08 do i need a wheel car for just loving
0:22:10 this car so much nature uh it is
0:22:13 director
0:22:14 i will award you a point for getting
0:22:16 everyone together
0:22:18 on your weird dream machine
0:22:20 does this this thing can go off-road
0:22:22 correct
0:22:23 yes okay
0:22:25 it's gonna need to
0:22:27 i'm pretty sure we can let's find out we
0:22:29 could also just park and walk
0:22:31 we should definitely just park and walk
0:22:33 we should not be driving a hummer
0:22:35 through the woods
0:22:36 i'm sure you know yeah why don't you
0:22:37 take us through yep
0:22:39 all right bang a left here yeah all
0:22:41 right and then a right and then that
0:22:43 parking lot
0:22:44 no one patrols it it's fine to park
0:22:46 there so when we get there
0:22:48 wind kind of just pops out and starts
0:22:50 walking you're gonna wait for us
0:22:52 gonna grab a thing or two here
0:22:55 oh that's right you brought gear
0:22:58 everybody got sensible shoes that's
0:23:00 really the important gear
0:23:02 who's got sensible shoes who doesn't who
0:23:04 needs to piggyback i do
0:23:06 depends on what i've been supplied
0:23:08 you've got sensible clothing
0:23:10 all right here just take my boots
0:23:12 i've walked this 100 000 times just take
0:23:14 my shoes all right thank you no problem
0:23:17 i do need them back and you're probably
0:23:18 not going to want to keep them so thank
0:23:21 you thank you january 1st is not exactly
0:23:23 ideal you say thank you
0:23:25 but when you put them on there's like a
0:23:27 soft squish
0:23:29 i will pick one up and look inside
0:23:31 probably a little fungal just had these
0:23:33 for a while yep these are these are
0:23:35 second-hand doc martens the blood's
0:23:38 become whatever is in there now
0:23:40 i'll look at it for a second
0:23:43 shake my head put that in another
0:23:45 category of thought and put my foot in
0:23:47 the booth
0:23:51 we'll get outfits and such later once
0:23:53 the store is open um once everyone is
0:23:55 properly shot and geared winds just
0:23:58 starts making her way through the woods
0:24:00 wait how well do you know the woods here
0:24:02 fairly if something's still out here
0:24:05 looking around should we
0:24:07 you should keep your eyes peeled there's
0:24:08 a lot of weird things happening in the
0:24:09 woods here
0:24:11 okay
0:24:12 like when you take the front i'll take
0:24:14 the i'll take the rear everybody stay
0:24:15 between us dark out here i have
0:24:17 definitely a city all right so i mean we
0:24:19 could just use this flashlight
0:24:21 wind pops or gangrel eyes on what does
0:24:24 that look like so winds eyes are
0:24:26 normally like the color
0:24:28 like a super light green like a
0:24:30 seagull's eyes and
0:24:32 all of a sudden they begin to glow
0:24:35 and shift they gain a red shift to them
0:24:38 and sort of reflective like if you've
0:24:40 ever caught a deer's eyes and headlights
0:24:44 there's clearly not natural
0:24:47 brenna britta will start and stare for a
0:24:49 moment but remember her circumstance and
0:24:52 look back okay
0:24:54 that's a really good point with uh
0:24:57 brittany you know how
0:24:59 you're talking about how things were
0:25:00 getting really loud you could hear
0:25:02 too much
0:25:03 yes if you
0:25:05 if you try and just
0:25:08 relax you ever been to the ball and see
0:25:09 one of those magic eyes
0:25:11 yes
0:25:12 you know how you kind of have to relax
0:25:13 your eyes just uh
0:25:15 just to see the the picture inside
0:25:17 yes try to do that for like all your
0:25:20 senses i hate those damn magic eye
0:25:22 things yeah i could never never
0:25:24 make them work i see a different thing
0:25:26 in the same picture every time every
0:25:28 sense just
0:25:29 just
0:25:30 try and relax and see and hear
0:25:33 everything around you but don't look
0:25:35 directly in the miles's flashlight
0:25:39 okay
0:25:40 what do you do with it
0:25:42 bretta will take a moment
0:25:45 try to center herself in focus
0:25:47 enter that sort of a
0:25:49 blank state
0:25:52 and she'll
0:25:55 use her heightened senses
0:25:58 neil also puts up heightened senses when
0:26:00 you extend your senses
0:26:02 the
0:26:04 dark ambience of the woods starts to
0:26:07 give way and you find yourself able to
0:26:09 see much further
0:26:10 in the dark than you had otherwise
0:26:13 interesting thing to note the light that
0:26:15 is already present
0:26:18 is
0:26:19 seemingly reaching further in order for
0:26:22 you to see what you're looking to see
0:26:24 wore it totally dark
0:26:26 your heightened senses would not be able
0:26:28 to aid you
0:26:30 so a very important moment as
0:26:33 this brother kind of figures out that
0:26:36 her ability to high in her senses does
0:26:37 not actually allow her to see in total
0:26:39 darkness but in a situation like this
0:26:42 walking through a dark woods
0:26:43 yes
0:26:44 she'll look from maybe whatever
0:26:46 starlight is available and the aura from
0:26:49 the light from
0:26:51 the flashlight put that together for a
0:26:54 moment and adjust
0:26:56 what do you see
0:26:57 it's
0:26:58 strange it's sort of like what's
0:27:00 available is
0:27:02 well i suppose the word would be
0:27:03 heightened
0:27:05 light sound
0:27:07 yeah
0:27:09 once you
0:27:11 start to practice
0:27:12 you'll be able to see things hear things
0:27:14 a little bit easier it doesn't help
0:27:17 if you're bereft but if you can't see
0:27:22 you could use everything else around you
0:27:25 just something to keep in mind but be
0:27:27 careful you can get overwhelmed
0:27:29 too much sensory input that's why i said
0:27:31 don't look directly at the flashlight if
0:27:33 a gunshot goes off too close to your
0:27:35 ears it's
0:27:37 it's more than painful it's disorienting
0:27:40 do i have to use all of my senses in
0:27:42 this way
0:27:43 no
0:27:44 so right now
0:27:46 just vision would be good
0:27:49 if you want to keep your ears open too
0:27:50 that wouldn't be a bad thing ear sight
0:27:53 smell even can all be different uh
0:27:57 yeah maybe not touch what you're wearing
0:27:59 shoes
0:28:00 that's a fact and also don't think about
0:28:02 it yeah
0:28:04 well let's move on then i have to step
0:28:06 in them
0:28:07 so is
0:28:08 my fisher cat around anywhere your
0:28:10 fisher cat has not returned to you yet
0:28:12 okay i'm gonna call out to it
0:28:15 okay
0:28:16 can it be safely assumed that i've
0:28:17 worked out kind of a a call for him
0:28:20 or like a whistle of some sort
0:28:22 do you have beckoning uh i have
0:28:25 animalism one okay but he's my retainer
0:28:28 yeah and
0:28:32 you're certain
0:28:33 that if it can hear you it will come to
0:28:36 you okay all right sorry just calling
0:28:38 chaps we're gonna have him go get raven
0:28:40 while we're doing this
0:28:42 because i think we're going to want to
0:28:43 talk to her anyway
0:28:46 we can start walking but you are going
0:28:47 to want to keep your eyes peeled for
0:28:49 basically tiger traps
0:28:51 i'm sorry this place is trapped yes did
0:28:54 you trip
0:28:57 no that's
0:28:58 that's how long has this been going on a
0:29:01 while
0:29:02 why is this the first i've heard of it
0:29:04 because it's raven's project
0:29:06 was she starting this before she left as
0:29:09 long as i've known her
0:29:10 raven has been working on this
0:29:12 wait so raven's been trapping the woods
0:29:14 she's had to
0:29:16 to control the things that are coming
0:29:17 out of it
0:29:19 oh i was no mention of this mate
0:29:21 anywhere you would have to ask her great
0:29:24 and where's raven been lately yonder
0:29:27 fisher cat stalks out of the woods
0:29:30 and starts to make its way over to win
0:29:34 it makes an eerie eerie sound
0:29:38 doesn't make like child crying sounds or
0:29:40 something yeah they sound awful
0:29:42 sounds like a 12 year old girl getting
0:29:44 murdered
0:29:45 it's awful
0:29:46 right does is this chaps or is it a
0:29:48 different fisher
0:29:49 this is your fish again
0:29:53 hi buddy
0:29:54 hey
0:29:55 how's it going
0:29:57 i found her
0:29:58 yeah
0:29:59 where is she
0:30:02 she's looking for something
0:30:04 did you hear
0:30:06 it's back the weeping bear yeah that's
0:30:09 what i thought it was gonna be
0:30:11 it's making another pass
0:30:13 yeah
0:30:15 has it caught anything right recently i
0:30:18 don't know
0:30:19 all right
0:30:20 it smells like the things that are in
0:30:23 your home
0:30:25 yeah i kind of thought that might be the
0:30:27 case too
0:30:28 it's not good it's not good man
0:30:30 everything's hidden
0:30:32 when you see it you hide too
0:30:34 all right
0:30:36 and choked like pull what do you have
0:30:37 for me yeah
0:30:39 she'll pull like
0:30:40 just a stash of beef jerky
0:30:43 kind of takes it and this
0:30:45 mean fisher cat starts to stalk off on
0:30:48 its way for artification does she speak
0:30:50 in english when she's talking to her or
0:30:52 she's speaking in fisher cat so it's
0:30:53 just this awful conversation it's just
0:30:55 these horrible monster noises being made
0:30:58 between
0:30:59 oh god
0:31:02 that is always unnerving
0:31:04 that was chaps
0:31:05 delightful um how'd it go uh he told me
0:31:09 where raven is
0:31:10 um things are not good but we knew that
0:31:13 how not good did we do you know what the
0:31:16 weeping bear is
0:31:17 no that sounds awful this is
0:31:20 way more than you first let on to
0:31:22 believe what i was under the impression
0:31:24 that there was some sort of monster dog
0:31:26 that you had stuffed into a refrigerator
0:31:28 it's related
0:31:29 how
0:31:31 it's either made from it or descended
0:31:33 from the weeping bear i'm sorry what so
0:31:36 let's go to the fridge
0:31:38 and i will show you
0:31:39 kind of what it is i will take that
0:31:41 moment to like pop my gun out of a
0:31:43 telstra like check
0:31:45 check it back in put it back in you
0:31:47 might want to do the same
0:31:49 but yeah do mine be mindful of
0:31:52 traps with st sticks in the bottom brita
0:31:54 very absent-mindedly undergoes a weapons
0:31:56 check when do you mind while we're on
0:31:59 the way explaining
0:32:02 weeping there
0:32:04 yeah for the whole class
0:32:07 it used to be just a bear
0:32:10 and then the sabbat got a hold of it
0:32:13 and they turned it into a war machine
0:32:16 you sure about that that it was the
0:32:17 sabbat yes i was just hoping it was a
0:32:19 very sad bear no it's um only you can
0:32:22 prevent forest fires how do you how do
0:32:24 you know it was the sabbat
0:32:26 because they're the ones that can do
0:32:28 this
0:32:32 and
0:32:33 they used it against
0:32:36 certain battles
0:32:37 where it was documented
0:32:40 raven knows a lot more about it great
0:32:43 um is she coming um
0:32:46 no we'll go to her
0:32:48 she might meet us there she's she's a
0:32:49 leaf in the wind
0:32:51 so here's the thing about the weeping
0:32:53 bear
0:32:55 because of what it was used for
0:32:59 it's really got a taste for a kindred
0:33:01 so that's
0:33:03 it keeps it from mortal society
0:33:06 but um it wanders back and forth from
0:33:09 connecticut to massachusetts
0:33:11 hunting
0:33:12 abilities
0:33:16 it's
0:33:18 i think of a nightmare creature and it
0:33:19 can probably do it it's
0:33:21 strong quick strong quick tough
0:33:24 horrifying to look at
0:33:26 anything unusual
0:33:30 it's old
0:33:31 it's
0:33:33 it killed its handlers it
0:33:36 it eats kindred no
0:33:40 claws that are going to rip rip through
0:33:42 even kindred flush typical
0:33:45 physical
0:33:46 attack things nothing
0:33:48 if it's actually the sabbat it's
0:33:50 designed to kill vampires right well
0:33:53 that means it's precluding things that
0:33:54 we just don't would like say snake magic
0:33:57 i'm seeing if any of that like i'm
0:33:58 suddenly going to go blind
0:34:01 i mean if it gets your eyes okay i got
0:34:03 that i got that sense yes
0:34:05 these these things tend to be battering
0:34:07 rams more than anything else
0:34:09 great
0:34:10 what does it mean that they're sending
0:34:12 in the sabot i mean this is a pretty big
0:34:16 weapon of theirs by that description
0:34:18 it's nobody's weapon anymore they've
0:34:20 lost control of it yeah
0:34:23 raven's done her part to kind of
0:34:26 keep the masquerade about it but even
0:34:27 she can't put it down
0:34:29 she's tried i i know this isn't really
0:34:32 the point of what we're all talking
0:34:33 about but
0:34:35 did she lie to the prince about being
0:34:37 able to find raven
0:34:40 at the moment
0:34:42 okay i mean to be fair she didn't the
0:34:44 cat did
0:34:46 oh okay but you'd
0:34:49 i mean you could tell him couldn't you
0:34:52 yeah but she doesn't want to think is
0:34:54 the point
0:34:55 well
0:34:56 did you see how he talked about the
0:34:58 gangrel yeah no i i get it i just
0:35:01 now we all know
0:35:04 that you know where raven is i and where
0:35:06 she is is inside the bounds of a
0:35:08 camerian domain
0:35:10 i mean it's usually better to tell
0:35:12 the prince something like that right
0:35:15 you are blood bound to him so you're
0:35:17 gonna side with him honey
0:35:20 oh
0:35:21 right
0:35:23 i just i don't want to bring up
0:35:24 potential problems i never know where
0:35:26 she is at any given moment okay
0:35:28 technically do i have a means of finding
0:35:30 her yes all right that i just wanted to
0:35:32 make sure we were all on the same page
0:35:35 because magic death bear probably the
0:35:37 bigger issue right now but i just i'll
0:35:40 get it covered okay if it becomes an
0:35:42 issue okay i just want to make sure that
0:35:43 we all are aware of potential issues
0:35:45 well i'm hoping we don't have to fight
0:35:46 weird magic death bear
0:35:49 or weeping bear which seems to be yeah
0:35:53 all right
0:35:55 okay i just let's go all right
0:36:03 so as we're walking i'm keeping an eye
0:36:04 peeled for
0:36:06 more pit traps just kind of keeping
0:36:08 aware of if there are any animals
0:36:10 fleeing which direction they're fleeing
0:36:11 from
0:36:12 after a while into the woods johnny pops
0:36:14 out one of the cigarettes and lights up
0:36:16 sorry for those who are smelling with
0:36:18 the enhanced sense enhancement senses
0:36:21 just walk downwind johnny yep
0:36:23 those of you who are walking around and
0:36:25 looking for trouble
0:36:27 yes
0:36:28 i need a perception plus survival your
0:36:31 difficulty will be modified
0:36:34 if you have heightened senses up there
0:36:36 no i'm just providing like
0:36:39 so what is it so it's perceptional
0:36:41 survival
0:36:42 base difficulty is eight it sounds like
0:36:45 you guys are going to be doing this as a
0:36:46 team
0:36:47 so who's your main person rolling that's
0:36:50 well these are her woods i'm gonna
0:36:52 nominate the wind takes lead
0:36:55 i don't care if she's not necessarily
0:36:56 the best one to do it she's the one
0:36:57 doing it she's also got her magical eyes
0:37:01 she can see the dog so here's how this
0:37:03 works everyone who is helping win
0:37:06 your difficulty is eight
0:37:08 if you have heightened census going your
0:37:10 difficulty is seven so everyone who's
0:37:12 helping win
0:37:14 go ahead and give me a roll
0:37:19 i'm just trying not to hinder her it's
0:37:21 appreciated three successes
0:37:24 so three
0:37:26 from
0:37:27 neil one success from bretta one success
0:37:30 from brita uh negative one success from
0:37:32 johnny johnny
0:37:33 the licensed cigarette
0:37:40 you're going to gain a number of bonus
0:37:42 dice okay equal essentially to neil's
0:37:44 contribution okay
0:37:46 thanks johnny you're
0:37:48 welcome is mine uh seven or eight your
0:37:52 difficulty is six okay you are totally
0:37:54 negating this penalty uh six successes
0:37:57 yeah the handful of things you pick up
0:38:01 first you notice that the woods are very
0:38:05 very very quiet save
0:38:08 for the sounds of ravens up in the trees
0:38:10 kind of relaying
0:38:12 things back and forth to each other
0:38:15 the next thing you notice
0:38:17 is that
0:38:18 while you the two the group of you are
0:38:20 moving through these woods
0:38:22 there's a pair
0:38:24 of traps that have been triggered
0:38:27 but do not seem to have successfully
0:38:29 caught whatever it is that simply
0:38:32 marched on through unabated
0:38:36 that's not ideal the last thing you
0:38:38 notice
0:38:39 is
0:38:40 a massive
0:38:42 probably a bear track
0:38:46 and judging by the direction that it's
0:38:49 walking where like this kind of like
0:38:52 wet mush snow cover like muck
0:38:56 is like pressed down
0:38:59 seems to be facing in the direction
0:39:02 of your haven
0:39:04 well [ __ ]
0:39:05 what's wrong i think the bear's headed
0:39:07 for my house
0:39:09 i mean why do you think because i've got
0:39:11 it's
0:39:12 it's blood in my fridge
0:39:13 not to say your house isn't important
0:39:16 but doesn't that give us some time not
0:39:18 if we want the evidence to look at
0:39:21 um she'll take out like whatever coins
0:39:23 she has and kind of
0:39:25 wave them in the moonlight to signal to
0:39:27 the ravens that she sees them and
0:39:30 some form of communication with them you
0:39:32 can kind of hear that among the ravens
0:39:35 there's a relayed response
0:39:37 that leads deeper into the woods
0:39:39 all right i will give you guys the
0:39:41 choice we can either go and maybe
0:39:43 encounter the bear at my house or we can
0:39:44 try and find raven directly do you think
0:39:46 raven is looking for the bear probably
0:39:50 can you tell her
0:39:51 that's where it's headed and we can
0:39:52 intercept each other all the way there
0:39:55 maybe she could probably
0:39:57 what johnny knows about
0:40:00 the things that zamitsi make
0:40:03 does it make sense that if this is some
0:40:06 kind of horrible like schlockda or
0:40:08 something that it would be going to like
0:40:11 reclaim
0:40:13 this dog and like eat the evidence
0:40:15 give me an intelligent saboteur
0:40:18 this is way outside my heart
0:40:22 all right um you're using a secondary
0:40:25 skill
0:40:26 this is a dif5
0:40:30 uh one success with one success you know
0:40:34 that for something like this size
0:40:37 and this is probably not a shlock this
0:40:39 is a full-on
0:40:41 war cool
0:40:43 and war ghouls are strong enough to very
0:40:45 casually flip cars
0:40:47 rip kindred and sunder it is bad
0:40:50 would i have any reason to understand
0:40:52 why it might have other things in the
0:40:54 woods they're largely mindless slaves
0:40:57 obedient to their masters
0:40:59 one turning on its master
0:41:02 is unheard of
0:41:04 that is not something that is really
0:41:06 something you'd very commonly hear about
0:41:08 among the sabbath would it make no sense
0:41:09 that it seems that its master is still
0:41:11 active then well with your sabbath lord
0:41:14 you know
0:41:15 that there are
0:41:17 urban legends
0:41:19 and stories of uh vicissitude running
0:41:22 amok
0:41:23 where those who get way carried away
0:41:25 with it
0:41:27 sometimes there have been rumors never
0:41:29 never actually
0:41:31 firsthand knowledge everyone everyone's
0:41:33 heard of someone who's heard of someone
0:41:35 who's had this happen but sometimes
0:41:38 the vicissitude runs a muck
0:41:41 and
0:41:42 it it causes unusual behavior
0:41:45 and a specimen
0:41:47 many zomitsi actually actively try to
0:41:49 create
0:41:50 scenarios where this might happen if
0:41:52 this thing is
0:41:54 sniffing around and looking for
0:41:55 something it's probably more likely that
0:41:57 it's under some directive to do so
0:42:00 then it's like that it's doing that of
0:42:02 its own accord
0:42:03 you know when
0:42:04 i know you you think this is some kind
0:42:06 of rogue
0:42:08 sabbat war machine
0:42:10 but i think it's much more likely that
0:42:12 this is actually if if this thing is in
0:42:15 fact
0:42:16 created by the sabbat i don't think it's
0:42:19 just do it's just wandering of its own
0:42:21 accord i would be okay with that being
0:42:24 the case
0:42:25 but i really don't think it is
0:42:27 so you guys headed to follow the tracks
0:42:30 or what are you looking to do i'm
0:42:31 looking to tell the ravens that um
0:42:34 we're going to be headed towards my
0:42:36 house which may have the weeping bear
0:42:38 nearby and maybe they could get that
0:42:40 message to raven for me sounds good all
0:42:42 right so you're going use uh feral
0:42:43 whispers feral whispers and
0:42:46 that
0:42:48 two successes great
0:42:51 they seem responsive and uh split up to
0:42:54 pursue the tasks that you have assigned
0:42:56 them
0:42:57 we can keep going keep going where
0:42:59 towards my house
0:43:01 isn't that where the gigantic waffle is
0:43:03 if the gigantic awful bear thing is
0:43:05 there then we don't have to proceed
0:43:06 there
0:43:07 we can stay at a distance but if it's
0:43:10 not there i still want to get the
0:43:11 remains
0:43:12 right
0:43:13 i'll uh
0:43:14 i'll be with you guys the whole time i'm
0:43:15 just gonna step behind a tree
0:43:17 quick question
0:43:18 what do we need from here why do we need
0:43:20 the corpse can we not just go
0:43:22 we we should probably put eyes on it
0:43:23 because we want to confirm what exactly
0:43:25 it is i believe her
0:43:28 that's
0:43:29 a surprising vote of confidence but i i
0:43:32 still think we should get hands on it to
0:43:34 make sure that a is actually dead
0:43:36 and b
0:43:37 we should bring it to raven so we are
0:43:39 going to travel further in this woods
0:43:42 the supposed territory of this horrible
0:43:46 weeping bear the weeping bears territory
0:43:48 is not exclusively here it stretches
0:43:50 from here to massachusetts yes so we're
0:43:53 in its territory yes it's in my
0:43:55 territory by definition
0:43:58 it's in my territory okay well
0:44:02 are you saying you're defending your
0:44:04 territory i'm saying i am going to my
0:44:06 house and i'm opening my fridge
0:44:08 well speaking of the fridge um
0:44:11 the bear
0:44:13 is tracking the scent of the dead thing
0:44:15 or
0:44:16 that's conjecture on my part at this
0:44:18 point well what i mean is when we grab
0:44:20 the dead thing assuming the bear isn't
0:44:23 there
0:44:24 don't we become a moving target
0:44:27 yeah but we're all moving targets at
0:44:28 this point we're kindred and that's what
0:44:30 it eats
0:44:31 well more of a beacon than maybe yeah i
0:44:34 go back to my original question
0:44:36 you don't have to come back
0:44:39 from behind uh from behind the tree that
0:44:41 he disappeared behind
0:44:43 miles we helped you with the snake
0:44:44 people thing we're going to help that
0:44:46 win with anything happening but i'm just
0:44:48 trying to figure out why we need this
0:44:50 particular object wait you're not i
0:44:53 thought you were going to be
0:44:55 you're not invisible
0:44:57 what no i was but so
0:45:00 you can't really it's hard to talk
0:45:03 when you're
0:45:05 it's fine it doesn't it doesn't matter i
0:45:06 just
0:45:08 you know i'm going yeah right i'll be
0:45:11 behind you
0:45:12 and then neil disappears back behind the
0:45:13 tree and then does not appear to come
0:45:15 out
0:45:17 does he leave footprints in the snow
0:45:18 when he's obfuscated yeah you just don't
0:45:20 notice them okay because because really
0:45:22 it's not invisible it's just look here
0:45:24 it's it's just we we you just actively
0:45:26 do not notice their presence yeah when
0:45:28 you stop using obfuscate
0:45:31 everyone's going to react is that they'd
0:45:33 notice all of those things all along
0:45:34 surgical amnesia
0:45:36 so when
0:45:37 proceeds to her home
0:45:39 okay
0:45:40 uh keeping an eye out for more
0:45:42 giant bear prints
0:45:44 you find another here and there but when
0:45:47 you arrive to
0:45:49 your
0:45:50 little shack in the woods
0:45:53 there is no sign of a giant bear monster
0:45:55 okay
0:45:56 so wind just keeps approaching when
0:45:58 there's no sign okay i do want to give a
0:46:00 quick description
0:46:02 every so often in the woods you find
0:46:04 these little
0:46:05 cinderblock shacks with just a single
0:46:08 door wind lives in one of those
0:46:10 there's a single door
0:46:12 there is it is cinder block it looks
0:46:15 like it's maybe 10 by 10 if we're being
0:46:17 charitable and there are some flowers
0:46:19 blooming nearby not blooming per se but
0:46:21 they have been planted there
0:46:23 almost like the area is slightly tended
0:46:26 some kind of weird municipal shed
0:46:27 basically yeah
0:46:29 that long forgotten
0:46:31 switch for some kind of
0:46:33 pipe or electric relay
0:46:36 she will be careful approaching the door
0:46:39 to the shed and then she'll open it okay
0:46:42 and just kind of
0:46:43 cautiously peek inside to make sure
0:46:45 nothing is waiting there just glance it
0:46:47 looks to be the same as how you left it
0:46:48 uh she shoves the door open
0:46:50 the rest of the way
0:46:52 all right all clear guys
0:46:54 all right i uh just in case because of
0:46:56 paranoid i definitely still have
0:46:58 heightened senses up okay
0:47:00 just because
0:47:02 it's entirely possible there's somebody
0:47:04 like me pulling a trick like me johnny
0:47:05 just goes ahead and trumps and inside
0:47:07 the shed i mean i like both stealth and
0:47:09 survival so i'm pretty sure i've been
0:47:11 tromping the whole time
0:47:13 um inside it's a fairly different story
0:47:16 it's a spartan little shed
0:47:19 there's an army cot
0:47:21 she does have a very old welcome mat
0:47:24 there is in fact a 1960s era fridge it's
0:47:27 like an avocado green it's got a latch
0:47:29 handle that you have to lift and pull
0:47:31 open
0:47:32 very reasonably sized it's plugged in
0:47:35 and she kind of pulls a cord over her
0:47:37 head and kind of waits to see if the
0:47:39 light will come on or not there's a
0:47:40 quick flicker and then it's on
0:47:43 all right oh okay that worked this time
0:47:45 and then she has like a just uh like
0:47:47 someone put out an old bookshelf like on
0:47:50 the side of the road for garbage and it
0:47:52 is just stacked with books and there are
0:47:54 books stacked on both sides of it mostly
0:47:57 of like occult and history and
0:47:58 psychology some of them look to be um
0:48:01 college air or college textbooks from
0:48:04 the 60s as brito walks in she'll wipe
0:48:07 her feet off on the old welcome mat
0:48:09 and her attention kind of immediately
0:48:11 goes to the books and she starts
0:48:14 tracking through the titles
0:48:15 yeah let's see this thing
0:48:17 yeah feel free to read one if you want
0:48:19 oh okay thank you and she pops open the
0:48:22 fridge it is still there excellent she
0:48:25 grabs the hefty bag pulls it out i'm
0:48:28 gonna open this outside
0:48:29 all right it's got a pretty aggressive
0:48:32 odor
0:48:33 johnny gives her a hand just pulling
0:48:34 this thing because i measure it's kind
0:48:35 of big and unwieldy so yeah
0:48:38 it's a it's about the size of like a
0:48:40 large dog inside the bag yeah
0:48:43 expression i'll bring the flashlight out
0:48:44 too like
0:48:46 all right she'll plop it down outside
0:48:48 the shed and open it up how bad does
0:48:51 that smell oh oh the coffee skate just
0:48:54 breaks immediately
0:48:56 oh it smells very very pungent it's like
0:48:59 uh it's like that smell of like when you
0:49:03 know there are flies breeding nearby
0:49:06 yeah that that maggot basically sour
0:49:09 like
0:49:10 yeah
0:49:11 oh
0:49:12 that is
0:49:13 gross yup yup it is um so she'll kind of
0:49:18 pull her shirt over her nose a little
0:49:19 bit and reach in and grab it by the
0:49:21 scruff of the neck and pull it up
0:49:25 for a better examination of it
0:49:28 great it's ugly
0:49:30 johnny we'll kind of lean in and take a
0:49:31 look she'll lift one of the four legs
0:49:34 what is this thing
0:49:36 johnny yeah
0:49:38 that is not a hellhound that is not a
0:49:40 shlokta it is
0:49:42 so normally when body modifications are
0:49:44 applied there's a bit of symmetry to it
0:49:46 there are like stylistic choices
0:49:49 this looks like
0:49:51 a mutant is this any is is this
0:49:55 so it has none of the hallmarks of
0:49:56 vicissitude as all of the hallmarks have
0:49:59 associated as none of the hallmarks of a
0:50:02 flesh crafter so
0:50:04 this thing might have been birthed
0:50:07 out of
0:50:08 some kind of rogue this is a tude maybe
0:50:11 it's possible
0:50:13 this thing is not
0:50:15 was not made by a flesh crafter
0:50:18 yeah i didn't think so either frida will
0:50:21 come out uh the smell and having heard
0:50:24 that
0:50:26 what could have made it then
0:50:28 could have been born
0:50:30 i'd really rather hope not because i
0:50:32 think there's possibly more of them i
0:50:34 think she might be right i think this
0:50:36 might have born of what the weeping bear
0:50:40 if wind's right about this weeping bear
0:50:43 and it really is a war ghoul that has
0:50:45 gone rogue
0:50:46 i don't know all the implications of
0:50:48 that but
0:50:50 those things are usually mindless
0:50:52 so the fact that it's able to serve it's
0:50:54 been able to survive this long just
0:50:56 tracking between
0:50:58 here and mass well the other thing also
0:51:00 is that this thing
0:51:02 there's more than one of them this is
0:51:03 just the one i found
0:51:05 there was another one dead in one of the
0:51:06 traps maybe these things are dropping
0:51:08 off of off of the uh
0:51:11 the mass of flesh
0:51:13 i mean you gotta understand these things
0:51:14 that when i say a war goal
0:51:17 that makes it sound pleasant these
0:51:20 things are often
0:51:21 two
0:51:22 three four different kinds of creatures
0:51:25 just
0:51:26 laced together a bear but also parts of
0:51:30 people
0:51:32 it's
0:51:34 it doesn't make sense looking at them
0:51:36 there's like john carpenter's the fig
0:51:39 kind of stuff you're starting to hit
0:51:41 kind of in the uh in the realm of what
0:51:42 we're looking at there's a
0:51:44 there's a possibility this is related to
0:51:48 the thing that made xavier leave too
0:51:51 it had the capacities before that yeah
0:51:53 he encountered something it
0:51:56 changed his views a little bit
0:51:58 the guys he was with died or were
0:52:00 horribly warped
0:52:02 okay all this tells me is we did not
0:52:03 bring enough firepower for this guy we
0:52:06 brought enough firepower and when kind
0:52:07 of unceremoniously drops it back into
0:52:09 the bag
0:52:10 this horrible thing is birthing other
0:52:14 smaller horrible things well and that's
0:52:15 the weird thing about this thing is
0:52:17 because it was prowling the woods like
0:52:19 any other carnivore it was
0:52:22 it was looking for food it wasn't
0:52:24 directed anywhere
0:52:26 you notice anything weird about the
0:52:27 smell of its blood neil
0:52:29 do i as the
0:52:32 sweetness of an infection
0:52:35 no it's it's like it's
0:52:36 like it was sick like a
0:52:39 like you ever lance a boil or uh
0:52:41 like when you were mortal
0:52:44 like that that sort of like sweet
0:52:47 sour
0:52:48 stench that the pus that came out yeah
0:52:51 kind of like kind of like that
0:52:54 so one
0:52:55 well
0:52:56 i guess so i have two dots in science
0:52:58 but i'm not sure if brita remembers that
0:53:01 what do you think about that i think as
0:53:03 you examine it it's going to come pretty
0:53:07 naturally so brita is going to take a
0:53:09 closer look
0:53:11 something about the phrase lance boyle
0:53:14 trick something in her memory
0:53:16 and
0:53:17 she takes a closer look as it's dropped
0:53:20 back in the bag
0:53:22 what do you say
0:53:23 not made by a flesh crafter i
0:53:26 mean it's alive right johnny
0:53:30 or at least it was not like us i mean
0:53:32 it's hard to tell exactly what
0:53:34 this thing is
0:53:37 but
0:53:38 it looks
0:53:39 grown this way flush crafters tend to
0:53:45 they sculpt things
0:53:47 it's like
0:53:49 the difference between
0:53:51 uh
0:53:52 the difference between a garden and just
0:53:55 things growing out in the wild
0:53:58 cultivation
0:53:59 yeah is this something that i can make a
0:54:01 science role on
0:54:03 cool uh intelligence science okay
0:54:09 seven
0:54:11 one success with one success you get the
0:54:14 notion that maybe
0:54:16 the
0:54:17 sickness
0:54:19 that
0:54:20 uh neil has picked up on
0:54:23 might be tied to what's happening like
0:54:25 whatever it is sick with is causing this
0:54:28 mutation which would mean that all the
0:54:30 flesh that everyone's been handling
0:54:33 we need to wash our hands we need to
0:54:35 sink in there i don't think you
0:54:37 understand when the sickness
0:54:39 whatever neil smelled
0:54:41 if it's something like like
0:54:43 lancing a boil right this seems
0:54:45 transmissible
0:54:46 we need to avoid contact with us to
0:54:49 just
0:54:50 living flesh or to dead flesh
0:54:53 because you don't get sick anymore
0:54:55 do i have any way of knowing whether
0:54:56 that would affect us differently i'm
0:54:58 afraid not the kindred condition is very
0:55:01 new to you you we don't we don't get
0:55:04 sick from anything
0:55:06 well not naturally
0:55:08 this doesn't look terribly natural does
0:55:10 this
0:55:12 having heard her say that does this
0:55:13 sound like any sort of
0:55:15 conjuration or sorcery
0:55:17 that i might be aware of does not sound
0:55:19 like magic now look i don't
0:55:22 know anything about whether we get sick
0:55:24 or not but
0:55:26 would caution hurt
0:55:28 no no no no no no it's a smart idea i
0:55:31 just don't touch it
0:55:33 when ties are not in the bag to make
0:55:35 sure that stuff doesn't leak out the
0:55:36 scientist is going what where's
0:55:38 heightened sensors going so
0:55:40 okay so the two of you kind of noticed
0:55:42 that one of the branches kind of like
0:55:44 tilts
0:55:46 what is that and kind of perched and
0:55:49 looking down
0:55:50 at the group of you with a curious
0:55:52 expression is a
0:55:54 woman
0:55:55 who uh seems to have remarkable balance
0:55:58 for starters
0:55:59 and she's wearing like
0:56:02 like a black
0:56:03 hood and
0:56:05 one of those very old-school
0:56:08 like uh i don't say like a cape she's
0:56:10 like she's gonna cloak
0:56:12 dressed you know very dark
0:56:14 dark hair kind of very like have i ever
0:56:17 seen raven before
0:56:18 this is very much so raven
0:56:21 oh uh
0:56:22 when
0:56:23 looks up and gives a wave before kind of
0:56:26 lowering her head not submission so much
0:56:28 but respect for the powerful woman in
0:56:30 front of her she gives a nod uh she's
0:56:33 clearly this this person
0:56:35 not human she doesn't have a great deal
0:56:38 in the way of beast features showing
0:56:40 but what you can tell
0:56:42 is that her skin
0:56:45 especially those titan senses
0:56:47 um have like a marble like quality to
0:56:50 them to it it's almost like she's stoned
0:56:53 her eyes kind of reflect in the dark
0:56:56 they've got a red glow to them
0:56:58 so uh
0:57:00 it's not here but dude i don't i don't
0:57:03 know what the protocol is for this
0:57:06 i'm not really sure how to
0:57:08 how do we uh
0:57:10 hi raven
0:57:11 hi the tracks trailed off a bit but we
0:57:13 figured it was better to be cautious
0:57:16 um we do have one of these
0:57:18 beast creatures here
0:57:20 i was wondering if you could give some
0:57:21 insight i think it's tied to something
0:57:24 i've been investigating for some time
0:57:26 i think it could be tied to a large
0:57:28 number of the things you've been
0:57:29 investigating
0:57:31 you feel like coming down out of the
0:57:32 tree no that we've been backing show up
0:57:35 any moment
0:57:36 and i tend not to stay in arms reach of
0:57:38 it oh okay
0:57:41 raven i'm just gonna go wash my hands
0:57:42 i'll be right back
0:57:43 she gives him for a minute of nod
0:57:45 she accepts it with another nod goes
0:57:48 inside and scrubs her hands with lava
0:57:50 soap after wind comes back out after
0:57:52 raven was like it could be here any
0:57:53 minute uh neil goes into the shed and it
0:57:56 does not appear to come back out
0:57:58 wind does come back out after she
0:58:00 scrubbed all the viscera off her hands
0:58:03 raven does this have to do with the man
0:58:04 you've been investigating i believe so
0:58:07 there's been strange occurrences
0:58:08 happening at his home
0:58:10 and i believe
0:58:12 what you
0:58:13 are handling
0:58:16 was once human
0:58:17 we weren't sure if this was somehow an
0:58:19 offshoot of the weeping bear
0:58:22 i believe in a certain way it is
0:58:25 the weeping bear was
0:58:27 was a sculpted monster
0:58:30 and as we've all learned
0:58:34 the way of the tsumitzi power
0:58:37 it isn't a mere discipline
0:58:39 i'm concerned that that as whatever it
0:58:42 is
0:58:44 began to stir
0:58:46 those who were sculpted
0:58:49 by its power
0:58:52 changed
0:58:53 like evolution
0:58:55 perhaps
0:58:56 like a waking of a deep-seated
0:58:58 consciousness
0:59:00 is it possible that its overuse has led
0:59:02 to like a widespread hive mind that's
0:59:04 now starting to gain consciousness
0:59:06 well that depends on what um
0:59:09 what sort of conversations your
0:59:10 companions are comfortable with i leave
0:59:13 that to my companions i don't know most
0:59:15 of that wasn't really within my depths
0:59:17 there's a lot
0:59:19 that
0:59:20 our clan is dealing with right now that
0:59:22 is not particularly convenient for
0:59:25 upstanding camerins to hear about
0:59:28 why
0:59:31 i don't believe that this is evolution
0:59:35 i believe that
0:59:37 whatever has been lurking
0:59:40 inside of those who practice this
0:59:42 discipline
0:59:43 is beginning to
0:59:44 wake it is a sign
0:59:47 of gehenna
0:59:49 ah
0:59:50 so the conspiracy theories
0:59:52 sure look at what lies at your feet
0:59:56 so you said a guy was behind us
0:59:58 there was a family
1:00:00 who refers to themselves as zantosa
1:00:03 many years ago
1:00:05 they brought something
1:00:07 into this country
1:00:09 deeply loyal to it whatever it was
1:00:12 and hid it i have reason to believe that
1:00:16 this remaining member of the zantosa
1:00:19 family
1:00:20 is
1:00:22 communing
1:00:24 with a portion of it
1:00:26 it goes by the name of vito zantosa
1:00:29 he owns properties
1:00:31 all over new haven
1:00:34 and he's been here for a very very long
1:00:36 time
1:00:37 vito zantosa is
1:00:43 with kindred power flowing through his
1:00:45 blood
1:00:46 and the power to sculpt flesh is natural
1:00:48 to him
1:00:50 born that way yes
1:00:52 this meats here capable of
1:00:54 unusual feats
1:00:57 this one in particular was developed
1:00:59 over the course of many generations
1:01:02 so it sounds like there's some kind of
1:01:04 zamitsy elder in the area
1:01:08 no
1:01:09 look i understand what you're talking
1:01:11 about members of the sabbat love to come
1:01:13 up with stories about where things come
1:01:16 from
1:01:17 raven is not a member of the sabbat yeah
1:01:19 but she's listening to their propaganda
1:01:21 no she's not
1:01:23 all right
1:01:24 so look what is the problem and how can
1:01:27 we come to a solution
1:01:29 because so far we're just talking about
1:01:30 cause and effect
1:01:32 i don't know
1:01:35 what happens if veto is put down
1:01:38 he is
1:01:41 a vassal of something feeding it
1:01:45 but i do not believe whatever it is that
1:01:47 he cares for
1:01:49 is kindred
1:01:51 so extreme prejudice
1:01:55 well
1:01:56 that depends
1:01:58 if you use extreme prejudice
1:02:01 his grace your prince
1:02:04 will have questions about what you use
1:02:06 to extreme prejudice on
1:02:08 i feel like a safe answer right now a
1:02:09 sabbat
1:02:11 and what sort of panic do you think you
1:02:13 would cause
1:02:15 if you tell the court of new haven that
1:02:16 the sabbath has come for them
1:02:19 regardless we can't leave it alone it
1:02:21 won't make it better
1:02:24 i think it'll cause a lot less panic if
1:02:25 we say yes there was a bot
1:02:28 and we exterminated it but will we
1:02:30 actually be able to exterminate it is
1:02:32 the problem would they even believe that
1:02:34 you could
1:02:36 i mean i managed to get a whole clan
1:02:37 pissed off at me this wasn't too far
1:02:39 from
1:02:40 any idiot can slap a bee's nest or the
1:02:43 stick
1:02:44 we're talking about the sabbat
1:02:46 um a horde of blood and pain
1:02:51 it would be a difficult sell
1:02:54 frankly
1:02:55 on top of the fact that really if there
1:02:57 was a pack in the area
1:02:59 we probably would have would have heard
1:03:01 about it already right we can't just
1:03:03 we're not saying this is a pack
1:03:05 a lone possibly former member so far
1:03:08 we've heard about one if it's a single
1:03:10 vampire then it's not so but it might be
1:03:12 some kind of crazy anarch at best it's
1:03:15 not a vampire though is it i do not
1:03:17 believe so
1:03:19 born
1:03:21 what would that make him an oddity vito
1:03:24 sandoza
1:03:25 yes a reference is that supposed to mean
1:03:28 something it is what he is
1:03:31 a revenant
1:03:33 someone
1:03:34 born
1:03:35 like a kindred yes
1:03:38 raven this is
1:03:40 britta she was um
1:03:42 she's new hi it's um
1:03:44 good to meet you
1:03:47 good to meet you great so we're still
1:03:49 talking about a set of problems and i'm
1:03:50 still not
1:03:52 because there's not a cut and dry
1:03:54 solution miles
1:03:56 i'm not even hearing what the actual
1:03:57 problem is so far the problem is that
1:03:59 there is
1:04:00 a man with
1:04:02 with kindred powers influencing the
1:04:04 wildlife of the area perhaps
1:04:06 and we don't know if we can kill him
1:04:08 without unleashing something worse
1:04:10 sounds like we can't leave it alone
1:04:12 either
1:04:13 otherwise we wouldn't be talking about
1:04:14 it
1:04:15 i don't disagree with that but i don't
1:04:16 have a solution to offer right but we
1:04:19 are establishing how long we should
1:04:20 spend working on it well
1:04:23 the longer we wait the worse it usually
1:04:24 gets
1:04:25 very rarely does things just get better
1:04:28 while they're all kind of focused on
1:04:30 each other in the conversation i'm gonna
1:04:32 kind of walk around the perimeter of the
1:04:34 little clearing
1:04:35 around uh winds place and just keep
1:04:38 an eye out on
1:04:41 horrible bear monsters at the white
1:04:43 house just in case
1:04:45 raven also just because it's come up are
1:04:47 you the one trapping the woods
1:04:50 yes
1:04:51 all right
1:04:52 just wanted to ensure it was you and
1:04:53 there wasn't another rogue element
1:04:56 it is me
1:04:58 veto has been
1:05:00 difficult he walks during the day
1:05:04 he lives he breathes
1:05:06 he fathers children
1:05:08 i believe his children are revenants as
1:05:11 well
1:05:12 that was the name that came up at
1:05:13 elysium wasn't it
1:05:16 the one that we're keeping under wraps
1:05:18 for the time being
1:05:20 what is this
1:05:22 politics
1:05:24 but there's somebody at court that has
1:05:25 been talking to the zantosa family
1:05:28 now you keep that secret i didn't make
1:05:30 anything about that somebody with sure
1:05:32 somebody with shark teeth if you know
1:05:33 what i mean oh for [ __ ] sake
1:05:36 what
1:05:37 just of course it was going to be him
1:05:39 we're usually not supposed to name names
1:05:42 revenants if they have
1:05:44 our powers as well as the strengths of
1:05:47 humans
1:05:49 do they have
1:05:50 our weaknesses as well as the weaknesses
1:05:53 of humans
1:05:54 i don't know i've never even seen a
1:05:57 revenant before they are not as strong
1:05:59 as kindred
1:06:01 but they can come close enough
1:06:03 however they do not share your
1:06:05 weaknesses
1:06:06 they don't walk during the day
1:06:09 they fuel
1:06:11 their disciplines with their own vitae
1:06:14 so they don't need to feed
1:06:16 that is right
1:06:18 but there's always a cost
1:06:20 yes
1:06:21 the revenants tend to
1:06:25 be poorly adjusted
1:06:27 to their existence
1:06:31 so they don't like being alive
1:06:33 or they're mentally they don't handle
1:06:35 their lifestyles well
1:06:37 it's not much of a thing
1:06:39 if they're staked will that kill them or
1:06:41 will that make them
1:06:43 drive a stake through the heart of a
1:06:45 living person
1:06:47 and they will die most living people
1:06:49 don't have vitae
1:06:50 so hence the question sounds like
1:06:52 they're alive for the most part so
1:06:55 they're less
1:06:57 durable
1:06:59 is there a way he can be subdued but not
1:07:01 killed
1:07:02 who
1:07:03 veto
1:07:04 he is a man
1:07:06 my thought was we
1:07:08 orchestrate a car accident and um
1:07:11 he's taken to a hospital and kept in a
1:07:14 medically induced coma brings up a whole
1:07:17 another can of worms i'm not sure we
1:07:19 want to go down
1:07:20 i would rather navigate the political
1:07:23 scene than unleash
1:07:25 whatever he may be the bastion for it's
1:07:27 a possibility there's a lot of variables
1:07:29 there
1:07:34 while they're talking neil
1:07:36 you're kind of hanging around the trees
1:07:38 roll perception bus alertness yep
1:07:42 two successes
1:07:44 okay
1:07:45 three successes i'm sorry
1:07:46 moving low
1:07:49 to where it snout kind of comes like
1:07:51 within a foot of you just on the other
1:07:54 side of the tree you're leaning on you
1:07:56 see
1:07:57 this
1:07:59 hulking
1:08:00 monstrosity
1:08:02 with flesh stretched thin
1:08:05 weird pockets of fat
1:08:08 chunks of bone that add like this
1:08:10 plating along its hide
1:08:12 um there is no fur it is have you seen
1:08:14 what a furless bear looks like they look
1:08:16 horrible it is like a furless bear with
1:08:19 horrific body modifications
1:08:23 and it kind of
1:08:24 slowly thumps past you
1:08:27 and
1:08:28 in a very uncomfortable way even you
1:08:33 almost didn't notice it
1:08:36 i uh
1:08:38 hopefully for a moment is it going
1:08:40 towards the rest of them
1:08:43 yes
1:08:44 and they're not going to have any idea
1:08:45 um
1:08:46 it's slinking
1:08:48 so i will just
1:08:50 walk slightly faster than it
1:08:53 to get there first
1:08:55 like
1:08:56 move with it you're both at a walking
1:08:58 pace yeah
1:09:00 uh
1:09:03 i'm not gonna they're getting there at
1:09:04 the same time is not going to be helpful
1:09:06 um
1:09:07 i'm going to let it get a little ahead
1:09:10 of me
1:09:11 and
1:09:12 go
1:09:13 are there any low hanging branches
1:09:14 raven's up in a tree
1:09:17 all right
1:09:18 i'm going to uh
1:09:20 i thought bears could climb but who
1:09:22 knows i'm gonna try and scrabble the
1:09:24 tree a little bit
1:09:25 uh and i'm gonna grab like a rock or a
1:09:27 stick or something as i'm going up
1:09:29 and when i get to what kneel i have
1:09:32 survival one so what neil thinks is a
1:09:34 safe pipe
1:09:36 uh i'm gonna wing a rock at them
1:09:39 give me a dexterous athletics for
1:09:41 climbing cool it's talent so i don't
1:09:44 take a penalty
1:09:48 uh there's a [ __ ] beer here i've been
1:09:50 spending blood
1:09:52 for more decks yes
1:09:56 cool one success
1:09:59 you quietly scamper up the tree i'm just
1:10:02 going to lean out and kind of
1:10:04 i'm going to try and like hit johnny
1:10:06 ears like she's trying to really hit
1:10:08 somebody give me dex with synthetics
1:10:14 no no that's no successes
1:10:17 trying to give me a perception plus
1:10:18 alertness your difficulties eat
1:10:21 i really don't want to have the
1:10:22 reception both alertness yes
1:10:25 what about those heightened senses
1:10:28 we got there cool
1:10:32 hey one success
1:10:34 okay
1:10:35 a rock
1:10:37 whizzes by
1:10:38 you and preda what the hell who's up
1:10:41 there when you look
1:10:43 to ask who's out there
1:10:45 there is a hulking bear monster stalking
1:10:49 straight towards the group of you
1:10:53 and it is
1:10:54 it is big it is a little bigger than the
1:10:58 vehicle you showed up in
1:11:00 look out
1:11:09 all right we're gonna roll initiative
1:11:10 yeah
1:11:13 can we spend blood to beef stats before
1:11:15 rolling initiative uh nope okay that's
1:11:17 an action compact
1:11:21 uh
1:11:22 sucks to get jumped it's not an action
1:11:24 it's a it's reflexive
1:11:30 yep so for initiative
1:11:32 1d10
1:11:36 add your decks
1:11:38 add your wits
1:11:39 add your celerity unless you're spending
1:11:41 blood for extra actions
1:11:42 10. so you're under 10
1:11:44 16. 16 for win
1:11:47 uh unless 10 000. do 10's explode on
1:11:49 initiatives not an initiative 16. 16 for
1:11:53 miles all right so then that's
1:11:55 just going to be an 11. john 11. i've
1:11:58 been eight sweeping bear
1:12:01 14
1:12:03 first on initiative is a tie between
1:12:06 both miles and win
1:12:09 match simultaneously you may
1:12:11 going out of time what's your preference
1:12:13 are we able to turn off heightened
1:12:15 senses
1:12:16 is that an action no it's a dog you can
1:12:18 just do it
1:12:20 as soon as we would see the bear then i
1:12:22 would turn it off
1:12:23 okay i think i'm going to
1:12:26 draw the sword
1:12:28 move to the front to be the most
1:12:31 obvious thing at this point and let
1:12:32 other people do stuff to it and try to
1:12:34 just defend
1:12:36 and i'm going to spend blood for
1:12:39 i'll spend an index i don't know where
1:12:40 my cup which means next round you'll be
1:12:42 on 17. uh that's
1:12:44 nope next one i'll be on
1:12:47 nineteen three okay so you've got to
1:12:49 specify so you're spending three people
1:12:51 for yeah yeah
1:12:52 i don't spend less
1:12:54 uh win is
1:12:55 a popping claws um and if possible i'm
1:12:58 gonna grab the bag with the thing in it
1:13:01 and throw it at the bear okay uh give me
1:13:03 dex athletics as you hawk a bear or hook
1:13:07 a
1:13:07 bag at a bear
1:13:10 a bag with a bear
1:13:12 it's a bear inception basically
1:13:14 oh that's pretty uh two successes with
1:13:17 two successes
1:13:19 uh the bag of meat thumps against the
1:13:22 bear monster the weeping bear
1:13:24 and it lets out this
1:13:27 terrible growl cacophony wine then we go
1:13:33 does it seem interested in the bag we're
1:13:35 just alarmed by it
1:13:37 we go
1:13:38 to the bear
1:13:40 the weeping bear seems to take to the
1:13:43 back okay ripping it open and like
1:13:46 mushing up and like taking the huge
1:13:48 bites out of
1:13:50 this flesh
1:13:52 like the the thick pustules they want to
1:13:54 kind of like burst in first like gushers
1:13:56 yeah yeah that's 14 raven vito santosa
1:14:01 and
1:14:03 in one fluid motion she hops off the
1:14:05 branch takes the form of a raven it is
1:14:08 flying off we are on johnny saxon also
1:14:12 it's a predator what is it
1:14:14 is it is it an action to draw my boot
1:14:16 knife no perfect so
1:14:18 johnny will pull his boot knife and
1:14:21 uh seeing that it's kind of obsessed
1:14:24 with the uh the thing that got hooked at
1:14:25 it and miles is in his kind of front
1:14:28 vision he's going to try to move to the
1:14:30 side of the thing and find something
1:14:34 some kind of tendon or muscle or some
1:14:36 spot where he can start doing damage and
1:14:38 he's just going to like land to it with
1:14:40 his knife okay give me an attack roll
1:14:43 um and i did spend blood for two extra
1:14:45 actions so i'm gonna
1:14:47 just perforate the side of this thing
1:14:48 sounds good and unfortunately that's a
1:14:50 little too
1:14:52 uh and the attack roll knife is just
1:14:55 giving bonus on damage not the actual
1:14:56 attack right is strength plus one die at
1:14:59 diff
1:15:00 well it's it's male it should be dex
1:15:01 plus melee right yep okay
1:15:04 and d5 d5 to attack
1:15:08 so that's three successes two all over
1:15:11 give me damage
1:15:13 two rolled over and then
1:15:15 three four
1:15:18 [Music]
1:15:20 that was a terrible roll oh well so
1:15:22 there's only two uh two damage okay uh
1:15:25 you stab into its hide
1:15:27 it is british uh upon seeing
1:15:30 johnny made the attack
1:15:33 uh am i able to
1:15:35 am i able to look for a cover and then
1:15:37 shoot or is it just shoot
1:15:38 you can take a move and shoot okay so i
1:15:41 will
1:15:42 is there cover available uh there's tons
1:15:44 of trees
1:15:46 and there's also the shack that wind
1:15:48 lives in i assume since we're out in the
1:15:50 clearing the trees will be closer
1:15:52 so
1:15:53 i will move to a tree and aim
1:15:56 aim or shooting sorry shoot okay give me
1:15:58 uh decks plus firearms
1:16:04 one success
1:16:05 hit general damage
1:16:09 one success
1:16:11 sorry those are all ones no successes
1:16:13 okay
1:16:14 you hit a bone hide and kneel yeah uh
1:16:18 one question did i see guns in windshack
1:16:21 when we were in there earlier there is a
1:16:23 shotgun that she keeps in her shed her
1:16:25 pistol is still with her good to know
1:16:27 i'm gonna
1:16:28 take a move to just clamber out of this
1:16:30 tree you know not fast because i don't
1:16:32 want to be seen still start making my
1:16:34 way over to
1:16:35 windshed kind of going around so i don't
1:16:38 walk right past the freaking bear
1:16:40 uh but while i'm walking i want to
1:16:43 one i'm gonna spend another blood for
1:16:45 another dexterity
1:16:46 just because and i want to
1:16:49 open my eyes
1:16:50 uh and use eyes of chaos on this i was
1:16:53 told that this thing is a mish-mash of
1:16:55 all sorts of stuff
1:16:57 a chaotic wreck of flesh
1:17:00 and i want to look at this misshapen
1:17:03 flesh and try and discern
1:17:06 in the pattern of its make
1:17:08 who or what is driving it okay yeah okay
1:17:12 all right uh actually first i need a dex
1:17:14 plus athletics that makes sense
1:17:18 and if you fall out of the tree
1:17:20 obviously
1:17:22 yes i am fully aware
1:17:24 uh no that's three successes okay
1:17:28 you shoot me down no problem i would
1:17:29 like to stay in the tree forever but i
1:17:31 want to help my friends what difficulty
1:17:33 are you setting for this because i know
1:17:34 it's variable with eyes of chaos seven
1:17:36 okay
1:17:38 that is one two three four five
1:17:40 successes
1:17:42 with five successes you know that the
1:17:45 bear is pretty much helpless
1:17:47 and it is under the sway
1:17:50 of
1:17:51 its own
1:17:53 body like the animal is a prisoner in
1:17:56 its own flesh and the flesh has this
1:17:59 malevolent sentience to it like on a
1:18:02 cellular level something is possessing
1:18:04 it gross and bad okay cool do i get a
1:18:07 sense and this may be too much but do i
1:18:08 get a sense of what it wants here right
1:18:11 now other than just to kill us to merge
1:18:15 okay we go to additional actions
1:18:18 johnny what do you got all right
1:18:21 seeing that my knife didn't get cut that
1:18:23 deep the first time i move with
1:18:26 unnatural speed and try to actually
1:18:28 drive it deeper
1:18:31 cool uh three successes
1:18:37 oh baby that's what i'm talking about
1:18:40 that's going to be two full because i i
1:18:42 do have powerful arms so that'll help me
1:18:44 uh for for stabbing this thing i'm
1:18:47 guessing right yep so that's gonna be
1:18:49 six seven eight nine
1:18:51 damage the most powerful of arms
1:18:54 soaks three and you stun it beautiful
1:18:58 um
1:18:58 [Music]
1:19:01 seeing that that it's been stunned i
1:19:03 will use my last action to drive my
1:19:05 knife into one of its eyes would that be
1:19:08 a called shot i guess
1:19:10 so use that the uh i'll use this
1:19:13 opportunity to try and drive the knife
1:19:16 into a kill shot if
1:19:18 that's possible with this thing
1:19:22 all right so in that case it's diff
1:19:26 seven
1:19:27 okay
1:19:28 so we're looking at once again three
1:19:29 successes uh so to carry over i'll id
1:19:32 also you had three extra bonus types for
1:19:34 damage for the coal shot
1:19:38 okay so that's gonna be
1:19:40 two four five six seven eight damage
1:19:45 okay uh at this point uh you've got
1:19:48 quite a bit of blood on you and even put
1:19:49 in some work on this thing
1:19:51 we will go to a new round and at the top
1:19:54 of initiative is miles so it looks like
1:19:56 johnny has done a lot of damage to this
1:19:58 thing right now oh yes still looks in
1:20:01 fighting shape though it is still on its
1:20:03 feet and capable of fighting yes
1:20:05 more than likely it's going to try to
1:20:07 attack johnny if it's going to attack
1:20:08 anyone at this point correct very likely
1:20:11 top of the round we got to spend for uh
1:20:13 for new stuff so i'm going to spend for
1:20:16 one extra action i will also spend for
1:20:19 actually you know what i'm not going to
1:20:21 spend for any extractions i'm just going
1:20:22 to hold for defense because i can
1:20:24 potentially use my celery to help dodge
1:20:26 because i think i've probably gained its
1:20:28 ire at this point does that make
1:20:30 sense i would like to spend for an extra
1:20:32 action this thing doesn't seem to be
1:20:34 moving with any kind of extra solarity
1:20:35 or speed does it no okay all right so
1:20:37 miles what are you doing
1:20:39 i am uh going to get ready to attack and
1:20:42 wait until
1:20:43 it exposes itself by turning away or
1:20:45 whatever or attacking me and then i will
1:20:47 make my attack okay
1:20:49 wait i'm going to spend a blood to um
1:20:52 beef up my decks gonna jump on its back
1:20:54 and
1:20:55 go for the rake like
1:20:57 one two
1:20:58 split in the dice pool okay
1:21:01 no successes on one no successes on the
1:21:04 other one
1:21:05 okay
1:21:07 you scratch and rake against its bone
1:21:10 plating and it doesn't seem to dig deep
1:21:12 enough to draw blood
1:21:15 uh it's gonna take a swing on johnny so
1:21:19 expecting a reprisal johnny's gonna use
1:21:21 his action to dodge
1:21:23 okay
1:21:26 [Music]
1:21:29 uh difficulty six doesn't matter because
1:21:31 i rolled like garbage
1:21:33 this is the round for it well uh once
1:21:36 one success
1:21:39 i have three
1:21:40 you'll take one so two
1:21:43 one rolls over
1:21:45 is there any way i can
1:21:47 help with that defense
1:21:49 since i was holding uh not really okay
1:21:52 just checking
1:21:54 i had nine dices so many and it just
1:21:56 didn't throw the one that's six and an
1:21:59 eight no this round
1:22:02 it's not good for us you guys had a very
1:22:03 strong round one
1:22:05 round two definitely seems to belong but
1:22:08 that means the pendulum is going to
1:22:09 swing back
1:22:10 all right we'll finish it off next round
1:22:12 is it doing ag
1:22:14 no okay so i get to soak got your jacket
1:22:17 i do
1:22:19 bring that jacket
1:22:21 oh god
1:22:23 is so many dice
1:22:26 go ahead and roll uh what's the jacket
1:22:28 give
1:22:29 plus one die this one die all right
1:22:35 one two three four all right
1:22:40 i am currently swinging for eight lethal
1:22:43 all right so that's gonna suck i'm gonna
1:22:45 need a self-control chair it
1:22:47 hits johnny uh he attempts to get out of
1:22:50 the way
1:22:51 when it connects he crumples to the
1:22:54 ground
