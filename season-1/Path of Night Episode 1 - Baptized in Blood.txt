0:00:27 welcome to path of night i'm lex your
0:00:29 storyteller and our tale is set in the
0:00:31 world of darkness a twisted reflection
0:00:33 of 1999 where cities are choked by
0:00:36 taller buildings deeper shadows and
0:00:38 apathetic communities who are overrun by
0:00:40 rampant crime and beneath all of this
0:00:43 there is an insidious world where
0:00:45 monsters prey on the mortal masses using
0:00:47 them as pawns in their secret wars in
0:00:49 the city of new haven connecticut it is
0:00:51 vampire's whole court new haven is a
0:00:53 camarilla-controlled domain ruled by a
0:00:56 complacent prince and buried under the
0:00:58 sway of cunning elders who vie for
0:01:00 resources in an eternal struggle
0:01:02 our story begins in a dark alley we find
0:01:05 a young woman confused alone and covered
0:01:08 in blood
0:01:10 everything kind of picks up with
0:01:13 like noisy rain like heavy heavy heavy
0:01:15 rain
0:01:16 and you can feel what um
0:01:20 kind of feels like the sediment of of an
0:01:22 alley it's kind of made up of like filth
0:01:24 and dirt and sand and
0:01:26 and it kind of clings to you
0:01:30 when you open your eyes and set up some
0:01:33 you can see pretty clearly that you are
0:01:36 in fact in an alleyway under the open
0:01:39 sky where there is a bit of a downpour
0:01:42 overhead the first thing you feel is
0:01:44 just this very very lonely
0:01:47 lost sensation like something's wrong
0:01:50 you know that feeling you get when you
0:01:51 know you're about to get a call and
0:01:53 maybe like something's happened to like
0:01:54 a family member or something like that
0:01:56 but or to find yourself experiencing
0:01:58 that sensation and isn't completely sure
0:02:00 why
0:02:01 but
0:02:02 outside of the alley everyone seems to
0:02:04 be going about their business and having
0:02:05 a pretty good time
0:02:07 so
0:02:08 what will you do with your evening
0:02:11 well
0:02:12 i will stand up and
0:02:15 brush the dirt off
0:02:17 try to look down at what i'm wearing but
0:02:19 it doesn't remind me of anything i don't
0:02:22 even remember buying this shirt i
0:02:26 walk out of the alleyway
0:02:28 it feels like i might have gotten coffee
0:02:30 at that place across the street before
0:02:32 but i couldn't tell you when
0:02:35 i start walking down the street trying
0:02:37 to find something like that anything
0:02:40 like that
0:02:41 places that trigger some sense of
0:02:45 what's missing so you head out into the
0:02:47 street
0:02:48 there is just this throng of people
0:02:51 walking about at night who seem
0:02:53 completely unaware of one another a
0:02:55 handful even like kind of bump shoulders
0:02:57 with you and at best you gotta watch
0:02:59 where you're going the sediment from
0:03:00 inside the alley still kind of clings to
0:03:02 you it's in your hair you feel filthy
0:03:05 but as you go
0:03:07 there is there are these purple lights
0:03:09 overhead
0:03:10 uh they kind of shine with like that
0:03:12 like a neon purple vibrant light and it
0:03:15 says
0:03:16 haven't
0:03:18 out in front there are people dressed in
0:03:20 ridiculous black and white striped
0:03:22 clothing and and someone's got their
0:03:24 hair kind of combed over to the side you
0:03:26 can only really see one eye and that eye
0:03:28 is completely caked in black makeup but
0:03:30 there's something here that you want
0:03:32 and you find yourself
0:03:35 kind of drawn to like this very sweet
0:03:37 scent
0:03:38 and as you get in it's it's like cheap
0:03:40 perfume
0:03:42 kind of cheap like guy body spray the
0:03:44 kind that you know they spray too much
0:03:45 on
0:03:46 and normally it would it would just kind
0:03:48 of make you crinkle your nose but right
0:03:49 now there's just there's just something
0:03:51 about it and
0:03:52 you head in
0:03:55 once inside
0:03:57 there is a number of people dancing
0:04:00 and there's just kind of this pulsating
0:04:02 bass and you can kind of feel in the
0:04:04 ground it kind of it hits you it's
0:04:06 almost like a like a a bit of a jarring
0:04:09 experience
0:04:10 between like that moment where you're
0:04:11 outside and it's just kind of the sounds
0:04:13 of people and cars and
0:04:15 the usual sounds of the city and then
0:04:16 when you go in it's just this very loud
0:04:19 pulsating music you find that everyone's
0:04:21 kind of
0:04:22 looking at at least the people that are
0:04:23 close enough to see you in this kind of
0:04:25 very dark smoky area
0:04:27 what do you do
0:04:28 when i notice that people are looking at
0:04:30 me oddly i
0:04:33 try to catch my reflection and something
0:04:36 but it's pretty dark in here and i'm not
0:04:38 having a lot of success so
0:04:40 i guess i try to find the bathroom
0:04:42 for a mirror and kind of wander towards
0:04:45 the bathroom and it isn't very long
0:04:47 before you find a few total strangers
0:04:49 kind of looking to like bump and grind
0:04:51 and dance with you and
0:04:52 for a moment uh
0:04:54 you think you might but no no you
0:04:57 you continue on you head for the
0:04:59 bathroom
0:05:00 and and
0:05:01 when you get there there's a little bit
0:05:04 of a line outside
0:05:05 while you're going an individual leaves
0:05:08 the bathroom wiping off their face they
0:05:10 kind of give you like a little bit of a
0:05:12 crooked smile they have like bleach
0:05:14 blonde hair and and this coat that has
0:05:16 like kind of like a slightly ridiculous
0:05:17 color that comes up to like the very
0:05:19 bottoms of their earlobes they make eye
0:05:21 contact with you good for you
0:05:24 i stare back at them trying to place
0:05:26 whether
0:05:27 i know them or
0:05:30 if i could have forgotten them but i
0:05:32 don't know what they're talking about
0:05:35 there's something disconcerting about
0:05:37 this person monstrous but he smiles and
0:05:40 at least in terms of
0:05:42 body language doesn't really give you
0:05:43 any reason to to feel uncomfortable
0:05:46 before you know it he's on his way
0:05:49 and the line to the bathroom has moved
0:05:51 enough to let you kind of get in i walk
0:05:54 in i face the mirror so you've got to
0:05:56 face the mirror there's a handful of
0:05:57 people already there there's there's a
0:05:58 young woman very young
0:06:00 who seems to have a great deal of hair
0:06:02 spray in her hair and you can it stinks
0:06:06 and she's kind of bent over by the sink
0:06:08 snorting
0:06:09 god knows what
0:06:11 and that's when you get a look at
0:06:12 yourself and that your hair is matted
0:06:16 and filthy and
0:06:17 there are tears in your clothes and you
0:06:19 look
0:06:20 sick and that's when you start to kind
0:06:22 of feel
0:06:23 feel sick but it's it's a it's like it's
0:06:26 like a frustration and
0:06:28 it's like there's something else
0:06:30 you can't quite put your finger on there
0:06:32 hey try to look in the mirror for if
0:06:36 what if i collapse or hit my head maybe
0:06:39 what the hell could have happened you
0:06:41 ponder these things and get a close look
0:06:43 at yourself in the mirror and
0:06:45 you know this face
0:06:46 you know that you're you but
0:06:48 something something's wrong it's like
0:06:51 you're not alone like like there's
0:06:52 something hiding inside of you looking
0:06:54 back at you through those eyes
0:06:56 there's something in myself that i don't
0:06:58 recognize right now exactly you feel a
0:07:01 hand on your shoulder uh you you're
0:07:03 leaning so close that that you almost
0:07:04 miss it uh hey hey are you okay
0:07:08 um
0:07:11 no
0:07:12 do you need anything i wouldn't even
0:07:13 look back at her she's she's pretty
0:07:15 young she probably shouldn't even be
0:07:16 here
0:07:17 she's got to be 16 maybe 17. certainly
0:07:20 not old enough
0:07:21 to be at a goth club like she is
0:07:24 and she kind of stares at you this big
0:07:26 blue baby baby blue eyes and seems
0:07:29 completely worried
0:07:30 about you and for some reason at her own
0:07:33 safety at a place like this
0:07:35 i
0:07:36 wonder if i should ask her to take me to
0:07:39 the hospital or
0:07:41 i check my pockets quickly to see if
0:07:44 i've got maybe my id on me or something
0:07:46 like that but
0:07:48 i don't find anything and something
0:07:50 about
0:07:51 i want to
0:07:52 talk to her maybe or
0:07:54 i'm not sure what i want but the way
0:07:56 that she's looking at me and the way
0:07:58 that i feel there's something
0:08:00 maybe she can help or
0:08:03 i don't know
0:08:05 honey do you need a cab or something
0:08:06 something happen to you
0:08:08 i think so
0:08:09 um
0:08:11 could you help me call one
0:08:14 yes yes yes i can here you know you go
0:08:16 ahead and make yourself comfortable and
0:08:17 she kind of heads over and and she gets
0:08:19 these paper towels and you're like
0:08:21 clacking at the plastic container and
0:08:23 she she gets out the paper towels and
0:08:25 she rushes to you and starts helping you
0:08:26 out i'm gonna make a call yeah okay you
0:08:28 just you just relax and and everything's
0:08:32 gonna be okay all right the clocking and
0:08:34 everything seem seems so much louder
0:08:36 than normal i don't know why i'm hearing
0:08:38 it so intensely i but i i take the paper
0:08:41 towel and i try to just lean by the
0:08:43 counter but you sit by the counter and
0:08:46 she kind of steps just a few feet away
0:08:49 from you
0:08:50 turns away and
0:08:52 is dialing and that's when the bathroom
0:08:55 stalled the door opens and someone else
0:08:58 comes out
0:08:59 uh
0:09:01 they're wiping off their eyes and looks
0:09:03 like they're not having a great night
0:09:04 themselves and they they stop to look at
0:09:06 you this woman uh a bit older
0:09:08 unlike the last person spoke to probably
0:09:10 just
0:09:11 actually too old to be here you know
0:09:13 kind of out of out of place
0:09:16 what is this
0:09:18 she kind of looks up and down at you
0:09:22 i'm i'm sorry you
0:09:25 what happened here
0:09:26 i
0:09:27 um
0:09:29 i think i need to go i then
0:09:33 go
0:09:33 what
0:09:35 oh what what is in your hair
0:09:37 i run my hand through my hair to try
0:09:39 again to identify what it is but
0:09:42 just like everything else about me right
0:09:44 now i don't
0:09:46 recognize it and it just feels
0:09:49 foreign and
0:09:52 not a part of me
0:09:54 sweetie you look like a train wreck why
0:09:56 don't you why don't you come over here
0:09:58 and and
0:09:59 she kind of
0:10:00 honestly she's a little pushy about it
0:10:02 and she kind of gives like a little
0:10:03 shell off to the side
0:10:05 and she starts going through her bag
0:10:06 looking for something
0:10:08 the other girl heads over hey uh i made
0:10:10 this call for you why don't why don't we
0:10:13 get going and she kind of gives the
0:10:15 older woman a little bit of a
0:10:16 distrustful look is that okay what
0:10:19 yeah let's go um thank you miss but i
0:10:22 think you were right when you said that
0:10:23 i should go and
0:10:24 she's got a cab for me oh shoot your
0:10:27 cell phone and she kind of takes out her
0:10:29 phone and she starts
0:10:31 entering something in
0:10:33 she turns to get on the phone herself
0:10:36 and you kind of catch something like a
0:10:37 tattoo on her neck it
0:10:39 doesn't seem to mean anything and
0:10:42 you're pretty sure it should be facing
0:10:43 the other way but it looks kind of
0:10:45 something like a like a v
0:10:47 with a circle kind of placed
0:10:49 almost towards the center of it a little
0:10:51 unusual for a neck tattoo but she starts
0:10:54 yammering on like something incredibly
0:10:55 important is going on but everything
0:10:57 seems to be some sort of code your your
0:10:59 new friend the younger woman that was
0:11:01 assisting you doesn't really seem to
0:11:03 give you much time to wait she's kind of
0:11:05 already pulling at you she touches me
0:11:08 and it doesn't feel
0:11:11 right
0:11:12 there's something about the sensation
0:11:14 where i don't recognize the way that i
0:11:16 feel i feel like she would
0:11:20 i follow her anyway
0:11:22 she looks down at the point where your
0:11:25 hands meet
0:11:27 you're so cold i don't think i'm feeling
0:11:30 very well i
0:11:32 i
0:11:32 touch my own hand and
0:11:35 there's not that familiar sense of
0:11:37 warmth it is so
0:11:39 cold that makes me feel even more
0:11:41 separate and something inside of me
0:11:43 reacts to that difference it feels
0:11:48 inhuman
0:11:50 just as that thought comes to mind this
0:11:52 this girl is almost
0:11:54 drawn to whatever it is that's wrong
0:11:56 with you maybe wanting to help but maybe
0:11:59 also a little bit curious and she
0:12:01 doubles down making contact with your
0:12:02 hand again and trying to warm you up
0:12:05 fully aware of how cold you are and
0:12:07 that's when
0:12:08 you kind of catch the scent of her
0:12:10 breath
0:12:11 you can feel whatever it was that was in
0:12:14 you stir much more aggressively than i
0:12:17 had before and and that's when you're
0:12:20 certain there is there is something
0:12:21 deeply wrong with you and this this
0:12:23 hunger starts to very quickly build up
0:12:27 and then she pulls you along and and you
0:12:29 head through the throng of people that
0:12:31 are out dancing and completely oblivious
0:12:33 to whatever it is that you're going
0:12:34 through and eventually you make your way
0:12:36 back outside
0:12:38 and she kind of steps off to the side
0:12:40 yet again by another alley
0:12:42 the cap should be here any any minute uh
0:12:45 what's your name
0:12:46 i look at her and she asks and i realize
0:12:49 that i don't know the answer
0:12:52 but
0:12:54 the rain as it hits her hair the warmth
0:12:57 of her
0:12:58 it makes
0:12:59 i can smell her
0:13:01 and it smells
0:13:03 really
0:13:04 good it does
0:13:07 and you can feel whatever it is that's
0:13:09 inside you
0:13:11 give you just this
0:13:13 this final push to send you over the
0:13:15 edge and it's at this point that i need
0:13:17 a little bit of a dice roll i need you
0:13:20 to make a self-control check to resist
0:13:22 the urge to just
0:13:25 jump on top of this this unsuspecting
0:13:27 victim and take whatever it is that's
0:13:30 inside of you is demanding
0:13:32 go ahead and roll and
0:13:35 i see
0:13:38 it's then that as as this thing rattles
0:13:41 inside of its cage and and demands that
0:13:44 you feed this girl again looks right
0:13:46 back up you with with her baby blue eyes
0:13:50 and she's like oh whoa
0:13:52 my name is and and that's when
0:13:53 everything kind of
0:13:55 goes dark you lose control of yourself
0:13:58 you remember
0:13:59 this
0:14:00 whimper this very
0:14:02 very helpless whimper coming from her
0:14:07 and you're in an alley again this time
0:14:08 you're not alone
0:14:11 there's someone laying
0:14:13 right next to you
0:14:15 already just as cold as you are but
0:14:18 unlike you she doesn't move
0:14:22 i try to brush her hair out of her face
0:14:24 so
0:14:26 but her eyes are close and
0:14:28 she's so still
0:14:32 that same feeling that feeling from
0:14:34 before the the grit of the alleyway
0:14:36 except it's all stuck to me
0:14:39 i see
0:14:41 red all over my hands and i try to wipe
0:14:45 it off
0:14:46 it doesn't seem to wipe off all that
0:14:48 well i no it's it's right under your
0:14:50 nails and it doesn't seem like it's
0:14:52 going away at all
0:14:53 and the more you struggle the worse it
0:14:54 gets and then there's something about
0:14:57 this girl
0:14:58 something that wasn't there before and
0:15:00 you find yourself peering at it
0:15:03 registering it but but something about
0:15:06 it not quite clicking with you and there
0:15:08 are these marks
0:15:09 along the side of her neck
0:15:13 i
0:15:14 touch my own neck to see if
0:15:16 did the same thing happen to
0:15:19 no the same thing didn't happen to me my
0:15:21 neck feels
0:15:22 cold but fine but
0:15:25 well i look closer at her neck to see if
0:15:30 yeah
0:15:32 it looks like
0:15:33 and that's when you can hear the
0:15:35 footfalls of boots behind you
0:15:38 i turned fast i don't know
0:15:41 the cops maybe or
0:15:43 when you look up
0:15:44 you see please describe yourself
0:15:46 see a uh
0:15:47 medium height man maybe about five ten
0:15:50 five eleven making heavy footballs down
0:15:53 the alley wearing a pair of worn
0:15:55 levi's
0:15:57 tan work boots
0:15:59 flannel shirt covered by
0:16:02 an old beaten up leather jacket
0:16:05 unadorned with any kind of
0:16:08 pins or anything like that and
0:16:10 shaggy
0:16:12 shoulder length brown hair
0:16:15 what does he see
0:16:16 as he rounds the corner into the alley
0:16:18 he sees
0:16:20 a girl about 17 or so she's covered in
0:16:24 her own blood
0:16:25 her blonde hair has gone nearly red as
0:16:29 if she'd dyed it
0:16:31 she's been turned over partially
0:16:34 it seems like someone has tried to brush
0:16:36 the blood off her face it leaves these
0:16:39 finger marks
0:16:41 by where someone tried to open
0:16:44 her eyes
0:16:45 next to her
0:16:46 another girl just a couple years older
0:16:49 her hands
0:16:51 covered in that same blood
0:16:54 she wears something simple a black dress
0:16:57 it could have been nice maybe if it
0:16:59 weren't covered in
0:17:01 grit
0:17:02 blood dirt her hair is a rat's nest it's
0:17:06 entirely full of the same sediment
0:17:10 you could only guess
0:17:12 what has happened to make it look that
0:17:14 messy as you turn
0:17:16 she stands
0:17:18 and looks at you with
0:17:20 wide eyes full confusion
0:17:23 johnny
0:17:25 there's a moment where
0:17:27 you start thinking of other things about
0:17:29 your life and
0:17:30 the way that it reflects on the here and
0:17:32 now and
0:17:34 it eats at you a little
0:17:36 you see his jaw lock up
0:17:39 tensed with rage
0:17:42 the veins on his neck swell up his brown
0:17:45 knots with muscle that wasn't there and
0:17:47 it's in an instant he is down on top of
0:17:51 you
0:17:52 grabs you by the jacket and slams you
0:17:54 into the wall who the hell are you what
0:17:57 the hell is this
0:17:58 i i
0:18:01 no answer that girl didn't deserve this

0:18:19 yeah what do you think happens when you
0:18:21 drain them with blood
0:18:23 blood blood i i
0:18:26 johnny
0:18:27 backs up for a moment
0:18:29 he let he lets you go
0:18:30 you see his eyes kind of widen and shake
0:18:33 a little bit
0:18:34 do you remember anything
0:18:37 her mouth opens as if she were going to
0:18:39 answer but
0:18:41 he tenses up again and gets right in
0:18:43 your face what's your name i
0:18:45 um
0:18:46 i
0:18:48 my name is
0:18:51 my name my name
0:18:52 i
0:18:53 um
0:18:55 [ __ ]
0:18:56 johnny spins around and slams the wall
0:18:59 with such force
0:19:01 you see the masonry crack
0:19:10 i
0:19:11 what did you just do i
0:19:13 shut up you he points
0:19:16 a gnarly fist in your direction he walks
0:19:19 over to the girl on the ground
0:19:22 bends down it starts kind of looking
0:19:24 through her purse
0:19:26 inside of it you can find an id
0:19:29 a wallet
0:19:31 there's a cell phone there
0:19:33 as you can scroll through the phone
0:19:36 there's tons of friends i can't help but
0:19:38 hover as you're looking through
0:19:41 and
0:19:42 i only see bits of what you can see i i
0:19:45 i'm not stupid enough to get closer
0:19:49 but
0:19:49 i can see some of the pictures and
0:19:52 as you lean in a little bit towards
0:19:54 johnny he snaps up again with an
0:19:56 unnatural speed and says don't [ __ ]
0:19:58 move i automatically take some steps
0:20:01 back but then i
0:20:03 realize and i stand so the phone rings
0:20:07 he makes a fist and crushes the phone
0:20:09 that starts to ring
0:20:11 drops it back into the purse it seems
0:20:14 easy
0:20:15 something casual that he's able to just
0:20:18 make it disappear i stare
0:20:22 partly in wonder but mostly in horror i
0:20:26 have never seen that kind of strength
0:20:30 you don't remember your name
0:20:33 no no where were you last night
0:20:36 last
0:20:36 night i
0:20:38 i
0:20:39 i don't i don't you're lying to me no no
0:20:42 no i'm not lying to you i i just don't
0:20:45 remember
0:20:46 he takes a deep breath and suddenly he
0:20:48 seems like out of a movie his eyes snap
0:20:51 to you and they are far more blue than
0:20:54 you remember he looks gentle for a
0:20:57 moment
0:20:58 you need to tell me the truth
0:21:00 what do you remember it's comforting to
0:21:04 see this
0:21:06 man act more human
0:21:08 i can't help but feel like
0:21:10 maybe a bit safer
0:21:12 like he would
0:21:14 actually listen to me
0:21:16 i
0:21:17 search my memory
0:21:20 and there's threads bits and pieces just
0:21:23 the color of the walls or the sound that
0:21:26 shoes make on tile but
0:21:28 the first thing that comes back
0:21:32 i
0:21:34 i think my name
0:21:37 is
0:21:39 bretta
0:21:43 britta
0:21:45 that sounds
0:21:46 right his nostrils flare but he never
0:21:49 breathes back in
0:21:51 a weird force of habit it seems
0:21:54 i find myself watching him
0:21:57 for the rise and the fall of his chest
0:21:59 but i don't see it now that he's calmed
0:22:02 a little bit he kind of looks you over
0:22:05 and you see his eyes begin to shake a
0:22:07 little bit
0:22:08 his jaw's tenses
0:22:10 his fists clench
0:22:12 he paces a bit but it doesn't lash out
0:22:14 like he did before
0:22:17 all right
0:22:19 look britta
0:22:22 we're in a bad spot right
0:22:24 now we
0:22:27 we
0:22:29 but i'm gonna help you get through this
0:22:31 i'm sorry if i scared you
0:22:34 i need you to go stand at the front of
0:22:36 the alleyway don't leave there i'll be
0:22:39 watching i'm gonna deal with this really
0:22:41 quick
0:22:42 emotions towards the girl on the ground
0:22:45 deal with this what what are you
0:22:48 trust me it's gonna be better for
0:22:50 everyone
0:22:53 don't worry about it kid
0:22:55 but don't worry about it
0:22:57 we'll talk about it later stand at the
0:22:59 front of the alley
0:23:00 if you see anybody coming just give a
0:23:02 quick whistle
0:23:04 you can whistle right you remember that
0:23:07 yeah i remember i remember how to
0:23:09 whistle right
0:23:11 britta has it hesitates before turning
0:23:14 looking back at
0:23:16 the body seeing it as a body for the
0:23:19 first time registering that that was the
0:23:22 truth of it that this girl wasn't going
0:23:25 to sit back up
0:23:27 and as that realization sinks in
0:23:31 she sees the blood on her own hands
0:23:34 matching the blood in the girl's hair
0:23:38 go on
0:23:40 she's sarah sound
0:23:43 realizing that
0:23:44 her shoes are missing
0:23:46 she takes those steps out
0:23:49 to the edge of the alley
0:23:51 to stand and to keep watch
0:23:54 she watches people pass by
0:23:58 as you watch it's gotta be
0:24:01 at least 20 minutes and every now and
0:24:03 again you can hear something
0:24:05 behind you whatever he's doing he's
0:24:07 there's an occasional noise but
0:24:09 otherwise total silence from the alley i
0:24:11 want to look back i want to know
0:24:15 i did this
0:24:17 but
0:24:18 i don't
0:24:19 if i look back that makes this real and
0:24:22 i'm not willing to
0:24:25 so i do what he says and i stare out and
0:24:28 i keep watch
0:24:30 it's it's unusual
0:24:32 the way
0:24:34 people walk by
0:24:36 an alley
0:24:38 with a strange man who breaks bricks
0:24:41 with his bare hands and
0:24:43 and you covered in filth
0:24:46 without even a shrub
0:24:48 no one cares
0:24:50 and eventually
0:24:51 as all these people walk by not caring
0:24:54 completely enamored with their own lives
0:24:58 a black suv pulls up and it is it is
0:25:01 tinted and has it works and and gives
0:25:04 you that total drug dealer feeling
0:25:07 i see it and i turn immediately
0:25:10 a car's here i
0:25:12 yep boot falls as johnny comes back up
0:25:15 the uh alleyway back door to the truck
0:25:18 opens up that's the suv
0:25:20 and
0:25:21 an individual hops out
0:25:23 lighting up the cigarette johnny does
0:25:25 the same
0:25:26 looks at you you smoke
0:25:29 i don't remember if i tonight's a hell
0:25:31 of a night to start
0:25:32 my name's johnny by the way
0:25:34 he offers you a cigarette
0:25:36 she takes one
0:25:38 and
0:25:39 mimics you as you light it as you put it
0:25:43 to your own mouth
0:25:44 damn it johnny
0:25:47 you can't be getting close to them it's
0:25:48 just going to hurt me shut
0:25:50 your face
0:25:52 get in
0:25:54 you know the situation
0:25:56 i know how it ends
0:25:58 yeah but did you know that this
0:26:01 he points at Britta
0:26:03 was the situation
0:26:07 i'm quiet
0:26:08 listening there's another one too you
0:26:10 know
0:26:11 is that one gonna get up no
0:26:13 you sure no she's not getting up
0:26:17 all right
0:26:20 we're gonna have enough on our
0:26:21 conscience tonight
0:26:23 nineteen
0:26:26 and this one doesn't know what the hell
0:26:27 is going on with her
0:26:29 it might be better that way
0:26:32 as the two are discussing this i
0:26:35 stare at them trying to keep track of
0:26:37 the conversation trying to make any of
0:26:39 it make sense nothing matches up it i
0:26:42 can't recognize any of it
0:26:44 and they talk about
0:26:46 not getting attached
0:26:48 it sounds important but
0:26:51 as i'm trying to listen trying to make
0:26:54 sense i just
0:26:56 look down at my hands
0:26:58 they seem
0:26:59 paler as well as colder my hair
0:27:03 has so much blood in it you could barely
0:27:04 even tell what color brown it used to be
0:27:07 i hold the cigarette
0:27:09 with shaky hands
0:27:11 and
0:27:14 well you kind of
0:27:16 and almost shake too much to let this
0:27:18 let yourself and
0:27:22 when you finally
0:27:24 get the lighter to go
0:27:26 there is
0:27:28 a terrible sensation of fear that comes
0:27:30 from the spark
0:27:32 and then it passes
0:27:35 i drop the lighter and sensually i
0:27:38 it makes such a loud clatter on the
0:27:40 ground of
0:27:41 the the bed of the suv
0:27:44 i feel stupid about it but
0:27:47 johnny reaches out [ __ ] i forgot i'm i'm
0:27:50 sorry kid you got a lot to learn and
0:27:54 look this is gonna be the worst night of
0:27:55 your life but johnny come on man
0:27:59 i told you
0:28:02 look
0:28:03 sorry this is the worst night of your
0:28:04 life but it's
0:28:06 things are going to get better from here
0:28:07 all right
0:28:09 okay he gives you that stare again and
0:28:11 suddenly his eyes crystallize and
0:28:15 you want to trust him in this moment
0:28:18 and then it passes
0:28:20 breton notices something
0:28:22 i don't know why you're sharing this
0:28:23 moment you're the guy
0:28:26 he's he's breathing
0:28:29 you know wears like baggy jeans and
0:28:31 a jersey that's that's a few sizes too
0:28:33 big
0:28:34 and that really stupid backwards red
0:28:37 yankees baseball cap
0:28:39 um
0:28:41 but
0:28:42 he's not like johnny
0:28:44 alright you can kind of tell the
0:28:45 difference it's it's this this this
0:28:48 being in the presence of
0:28:50 of a more dangerous predator and
0:28:53 that man even though you can you can see
0:28:55 that gun that it's got tucked in his
0:28:57 belt
0:28:58 that's prey
0:29:02 johnny
0:29:03 yeah kid
0:29:05 um
0:29:07 i i can't see
0:29:10 you
0:29:10 breathing
0:29:20 [Music]
0:29:25 when you wake up the first thing you
0:29:27 immediately sense is that it's probably
0:29:29 a half hour so before you normally would
0:29:32 you're alert something just drew your
0:29:34 attention and your instincts are are on
0:29:37 run away
0:29:39 and that's when it registers that you've
0:29:41 been disturbed from your slumber because
0:29:43 of a sound inside of the shed something
0:29:46 moving and and
0:29:48 falling off the wall
0:29:50 did my fisher cat not alert me to this
0:29:52 did not okay as you
0:29:55 take a look around the room
0:29:57 everything seems uh
0:29:59 just fine the door hasn't been disturbed
0:30:01 it doesn't look like there's been any
0:30:02 attempts to breach the shed
0:30:05 and as you sit up you notice that
0:30:08 the shed has just a few temperatures out
0:30:10 of place it's a little colder than it
0:30:12 should be right now
0:30:14 and it's
0:30:15 it's supposed to be pretty cool
0:30:18 that's when you start to
0:30:20 feel the presence
0:30:22 of someone else something else
0:30:24 scanning around this room a second time
0:30:27 there's a figure that is there that
0:30:29 wasn't before
0:30:30 and before you is what looks like the
0:30:33 emaciated remnants
0:30:35 of a boy
0:30:37 one of its eyes are missing the side of
0:30:39 its face looks like it's been kind of
0:30:41 chewed on and
0:30:42 some of the the i say this with air
0:30:45 quotes flesh
0:30:47 seems to have already decayed as though
0:30:49 he's been dead for days do i recognize
0:30:51 this as a rafe yes okay
0:30:54 the boy looks at you wide-eyed confused
0:30:57 and scared but somehow aware
0:31:00 that you can see it too
0:31:03 where'd you wander in from
0:31:05 i don't know
0:31:06 no
0:31:07 no
0:31:10 what's your name
0:31:12 joey
0:31:13 joey
0:31:14 yeah
0:31:15 i need help i can see that what you need
0:31:18 help with
0:31:19 there's something in the woods
0:31:21 can you show me
0:31:23 yeah does he look physical enough that i
0:31:25 can take his hand
0:31:27 you're not sure
0:31:28 and when you reach out to test
0:31:31 he fades away and
0:31:33 you are alone again in the shed okay
0:31:38 it's early in the night you know that
0:31:40 this evening
0:31:42 there's a bit of a get-together being
0:31:44 held because it's it's in celebration of
0:31:46 the new year so all of the kindred are
0:31:48 expected to attend
0:31:50 even those who are only nominally
0:31:52 members of the camera
0:31:54 that's nice i'm gonna go look in the
0:31:55 woods for
0:31:56 what this kid needed
0:31:58 sounds good put on boots grab a steak
0:32:01 not like the wooden steak not the meat
0:32:03 steak
0:32:04 um
0:32:05 and
0:32:07 grab a gun
0:32:08 you pack the gun
0:32:10 you're back at the stake
0:32:12 strap on your boots and you slip out of
0:32:14 the shed also i grab a flannel shirt
0:32:17 now you're ready to go no now i'm battle
0:32:19 ready
0:32:20 well
0:32:21 it isn't long before
0:32:23 uh enter in the woods that you start to
0:32:25 see
0:32:26 some of the trails that people usually
0:32:29 jog in the afternoon early evenings
0:32:32 and you come upon a section that has
0:32:35 police tape yellow tape blinding the
0:32:37 area
0:32:38 whatever investigation that's happened
0:32:40 here
0:32:41 seems to have been resolved hours ago
0:32:44 uh do a quick look around make sure
0:32:46 nobody else is actually there
0:32:48 give me a perception plus alertness the
0:32:50 difficulty of this role because it's
0:32:52 night time
0:32:54 and uh it's a bit dark out
0:32:56 is going to be difficulty seven
0:33:01 i have one success great
0:33:04 you take a look around and
0:33:06 you hear
0:33:08 the sounds of animals moving away
0:33:11 frightened
0:33:12 and whatever happened out here
0:33:15 the animals of the forest of uh east
0:33:18 rock park are still spooked
0:33:21 how close are they coming to me they're
0:33:23 not moving towards you okay it seems
0:33:26 so it's it's like the area around where
0:33:28 this crime scene happened
0:33:30 is quiet like the animals moved away
0:33:33 from it
0:33:34 and they have not come close since but
0:33:36 way off in the distance
0:33:38 you can still hear that the local
0:33:41 uh raccoons etc are all kind of spooked
0:33:43 by whatever it is that happened to it
0:33:45 wherever they are moving away from i'm
0:33:47 gonna head toward
0:33:49 sounds good uh wow it doesn't sound
0:33:51 stupid
0:33:53 give me uh uh give me a perception
0:33:56 survival
0:34:00 oh what's the difficulty six three
0:34:02 successes great
0:34:03 so
0:34:05 you move away
0:34:06 from the crime scene itself
0:34:09 and you plot along the trail and then
0:34:12 you start to go
0:34:13 off trail a bit
0:34:15 and as you go deeper and deeper into the
0:34:17 forest now it is completely silent you
0:34:21 can't hear anything at all
0:34:22 aside from the the
0:34:25 noise of your footfalls
0:34:27 as you kind of
0:34:29 dip
0:34:30 under a fallen tree to kind of pass on
0:34:32 towards your your intended destination
0:34:36 you notice that there is
0:34:38 a deep hole
0:34:39 that's been dug into the ground and
0:34:41 there are
0:34:42 wooden spikes inside of it it's not
0:34:45 covered it looks like whatever happened
0:34:47 uh whatever the trap was intended for
0:34:49 it's already been tripped and so it's
0:34:51 it's pretty easy to see is there
0:34:53 anything caught in it
0:34:55 when you look
0:34:57 you can see something in it but it's
0:34:59 difficult to make out exactly what
0:35:02 can i reasonably have a lighter
0:35:04 i'll roll the g10 four and up you have a
0:35:06 lighter
0:35:09 four great
0:35:11 you check your pockets you can't quite
0:35:13 remember which one it's in and then you
0:35:14 take out a lighter just to see if i can
0:35:16 see what's in there
0:35:18 you light the lighter
0:35:20 and
0:35:21 what you see is about the size of a dog
0:35:25 like a large dog
0:35:26 can't be over 60 pounds
0:35:29 and the trap has
0:35:32 done what it was meant to do
0:35:33 whatever it is is now it is now dead
0:35:36 but it seems to have no skin
0:35:39 it's some sort of beast that's covered
0:35:42 in this very thick layer of mucus and
0:35:44 fat
0:35:45 the thing that really kind of catches
0:35:47 you off guard about it is that it has a
0:35:50 human face
0:35:52 okay and
0:35:53 has human-like arms however not all of
0:35:56 the fingers are there uh the joints
0:35:58 don't quite line up right
0:36:01 there's something in there it's got to
0:36:03 be
0:36:03 it would probably be around four feet
0:36:06 tall standing
0:36:08 is this about the size of the little boy
0:36:09 that came to my shed
0:36:11 no okay
0:36:12 hmm
0:36:13 can i occult this to see if this is
0:36:16 anything i have ever heard of sure all
0:36:18 right
0:36:19 would it be um
0:36:21 intelligence or wit
0:36:23 intelligence okay
0:36:25 [Music]
0:36:28 three successes great
0:36:30 with three successes
0:36:32 you
0:36:33 know that there are there's a handful of
0:36:35 things that can do this
0:36:37 one
0:36:38 is with your knowledge of spirits
0:36:41 you know that some instances of
0:36:43 possession can cause someone to be
0:36:46 have a very warped appearance
0:36:48 you also know that among the kindred
0:36:51 there is a clan called the zumisi that
0:36:53 is capable of manipulating flesh and
0:36:55 they can
0:36:56 if they wanted to they could make
0:36:58 something
0:36:59 that's this grotesque
0:37:01 but usually they they have to victimize
0:37:04 someone in order to accomplish that end
0:37:06 that's when you begin to feel
0:37:09 a cold hand
0:37:10 gripping your pinky and ring finger
0:37:13 is it joey it is joey you know what
0:37:16 happened here little man
0:37:19 that's the thing that was chasing me
0:37:21 yeah
0:37:22 did he do that to you
0:37:25 no okay
0:37:27 no that's not what it did to me
0:37:29 what did it do to you
0:37:32 he gives us
0:37:33 very
0:37:35 look as he seems to
0:37:38 to dread thinking back on it you you
0:37:40 ain't gotta tell me if you don't wanna
0:37:42 he bit my face up
0:37:44 and
0:37:46 he hurt me
0:37:48 but but first he chased me
0:37:51 and
0:37:53 and before before he chased me uh i was
0:37:58 i was alone after dark i was
0:38:00 i'm i was i was moving
0:38:02 out moving out of where my house
0:38:07 with your family
0:38:08 no
0:38:09 just on your own
0:38:11 yeah
0:38:12 striking out yeah like a strong
0:38:14 independent man
0:38:16 yeah
0:38:18 he seems like really uncertain like by
0:38:20 the strong independent man line
0:38:22 but i mean he kind of settles on it
0:38:25 why were you leaving
0:38:28 my friend went away and
0:38:32 no one no one cared
0:38:34 and
0:38:36 my mom
0:38:39 he kind of like
0:38:40 drifts off not really explaining his
0:38:42 situation but
0:38:44 also
0:38:45 inferring a great deal
0:38:47 well do you know where you came from
0:38:51 uh can you show me where you started and
0:38:53 maybe where you ran through
0:38:55 yeah
0:38:57 all right
0:38:59 he tucks your hand along and
0:39:01 he
0:39:02 i still keep a hand on the gun yeah
0:39:04 hopefully the kid doesn't notice but
0:39:06 this would be a really opportune time
0:39:08 for someone to jump me he uh he does not
0:39:11 seem to notice your hand on the gun okay
0:39:13 and he leads you outside the park and
0:39:16 outside of the park he kind of walks
0:39:18 around
0:39:19 this like long like road that doesn't
0:39:22 even really have a sidewalk and brings
0:39:24 you to an entrance point of the park and
0:39:26 he's like this is where i went
0:39:28 uh i was going to camp
0:39:30 uh just for a few nights while i figured
0:39:33 out
0:39:34 where i was going to go from there
0:39:36 but uh
0:39:37 so i went this way and he kind of starts
0:39:40 walking along holding your hand
0:39:42 and uh the kid actually seems to be
0:39:45 pretty familiar with the park
0:39:47 eventually he leads you to the crime
0:39:49 scene
0:39:50 and he seems startled to see that
0:39:52 there's now police tape all around the
0:39:54 area that presumably didn't have it when
0:39:57 he was last there
0:39:59 this is where you wound up
0:40:01 it chased me it ran on it ran on its
0:40:03 arms and feet
0:40:05 yeah yeah
0:40:07 that's kind of gnarly
0:40:08 yeah i tried to fight it and i hit it
0:40:11 good job
0:40:14 it's okay
0:40:15 sometimes
0:40:17 i think i got hurt pretty bad
0:40:19 i think you probably did too buddy
0:40:23 i want to go home
0:40:27 we can see about finding you a place to
0:40:28 stay
0:40:30 we can go and say goodbye because you
0:40:31 were leaving anyway right
0:40:34 yeah
0:40:35 yeah let's just keep that going but we
0:40:37 can go and see about saying goodbye to a
0:40:39 place
0:40:40 are you really say bye to my mom
0:40:42 we can figure out how to say goodbye to
0:40:44 your mom
0:40:45 water a bit at the mention of that
0:40:48 we'll find a way to say goodbye to mom
0:40:50 okay uh
0:40:52 he looks startled give me perception
0:40:54 alertness
0:40:57 what's the difficulty
0:40:58 six
0:40:59 one success
0:41:00 you can hear uh
0:41:03 some of the twigs
0:41:05 and like
0:41:06 bits of snow kind of mush
0:41:08 under these these hands and feet
0:41:11 as
0:41:12 something very akin to a person
0:41:15 crawls out from behind a set of trees
0:41:20 through these holes in its face that
0:41:21 aren't quite placed right
0:41:23 it
0:41:24 sniffs around at the air
0:41:27 following its nose because it doesn't
0:41:28 have eyes
0:41:30 it starts to
0:41:31 make its way
0:41:33 to the crime scene
0:41:35 it
0:41:36 lays almost completely flat and slides
0:41:39 and rides
0:41:41 underneath the tape
0:41:42 and gets closer to
0:41:44 where it looks like there are
0:41:46 chalk marks depicting the shape of
0:41:49 a young human and it puts its face right
0:41:52 up against the blood
0:41:54 and this tongue that seems to have these
0:41:57 fatty pustules
0:41:59 that kind of like align the tongue
0:42:02 it starts to trace along the smeared
0:42:04 dried blood trying to kind of get a
0:42:06 taste of it it does not seem to have
0:42:08 noticed you i look at
0:42:10 the ghost boy joey and put my finger to
0:42:13 my lips to tell him to keep quiet
0:42:16 the boy is visibly trembling
0:42:18 at the side of it yeah just i kind of
0:42:20 put up a hand be calm i don't actually
0:42:23 say it because i don't want this thing
0:42:24 to know me but i kind of am giving him
0:42:25 the impression of be calm be quiet let
0:42:28 me handle this
0:42:29 i turn the whip out the gun and take a
0:42:31 shot at it
0:42:32 pull the gun rule initiative
0:42:40 miles is
0:42:41 six foot tall blonde hair blue eyes
0:42:43 wearing glasses
0:42:45 in a very well-tailored business suit
0:42:47 and everything is
0:42:49 in the proper place
0:42:50 hello
0:42:52 my name is miles dampenport and i'm
0:42:54 sorry that we've had to meet in this
0:42:56 kind of condition so i guess we should
0:42:59 start off with
0:43:00 who are you
0:43:02 who am i
0:43:03 yes
0:43:04 who are you
0:43:06 i
0:43:08 i think i'm
0:43:15 i
0:43:16 can't remember you can't remember
0:43:20 so you're not entirely sure that you're
0:43:22 even
0:43:23 britta
0:43:25 i don't
0:43:27 um
0:43:28 i don't feel right
0:43:30 i don't
0:43:32 remember
0:43:34 anything i
0:43:37 i don't know who i am right now
0:43:39 and this doesn't feel
0:43:44 your situation is
0:43:46 unfortunate there seems to be a problem
0:43:49 someone has violated
0:43:51 our traditions
0:43:53 and has
0:43:56 made you a kindred without
0:43:58 proper
0:43:59 without the proper say-so
0:44:02 traditions
0:44:03 kindred what is any of this i
0:44:07 that's a lot to take in
0:44:09 um
0:44:10 but let's just say that
0:44:12 it comes with a thirst for blood
0:44:15 blood yes if you're not aware you're
0:44:18 currently covered in either yours or
0:44:20 somebody else's i don't
0:44:23 remember
0:44:24 there's so much of it
0:44:27 right so
0:44:29 i need you to tell me
0:44:31 as much as possible especially about the
0:44:34 person
0:44:35 that made you this way
0:44:37 to even give a shot of this circumstance
0:44:39 becoming better for you
0:44:43 circumstance becoming better
0:44:46 what are you not saying
0:44:50 grim
0:44:52 i'm going to lay it out for you
0:44:54 your creation
0:44:56 is breaking the law
0:44:58 the law of protesting progeny what's
0:45:01 that
0:45:03 law progeny is to be
0:45:06 given to an individual
0:45:08 that means that they can sire
0:45:11 and this
0:45:12 is given to them by the elders
0:45:14 elders
0:45:16 sire i've never heard of any law like
0:45:19 this i
0:45:20 you've been thrust into a world that you
0:45:23 do not understand and does not exist
0:45:26 until you're basically here
0:45:30 doesn't exist
0:45:32 right
0:45:34 what does that mean
0:45:38 it means that we keep our existence
0:45:40 hidden from those
0:45:42 from regular people from normal people
0:45:46 from those that aren't kindred
0:45:48 kindred
0:45:50 yeah there's a another term for it but
0:45:52 we don't we don't use it
0:45:55 why not
0:45:57 well it's mainly because
0:46:00 it's uncouth
0:46:02 i guess is the main reason why we don't
0:46:03 use it
0:46:05 uncouth
0:46:06 yes why
0:46:09 let's hold off any questions for now let
0:46:11 me just explain your circumstances
0:46:14 by this violation of law
0:46:16 not only is there a punishment going to
0:46:17 happen to the person that did this to
0:46:19 you
0:46:21 but you will also be killed
0:46:23 killed
0:46:25 right so we need as much detail as
0:46:28 possible
0:46:29 and we may be able to find a way to
0:46:31 salvage this situation this situation
0:46:34 you're saying that you're gonna kill me
0:46:36 yes that's the situation
0:46:39 look i don't understand any of this and
0:46:41 i
0:46:43 that's more unfortunate and i do not
0:46:45 like that
0:46:46 we're a persecuted person that does not
0:46:48 understand the laws they have violated
0:46:50 but
0:46:51 that is neither here nor there
0:46:53 laws and persecution i've never heard of
0:46:56 laws like this i
0:46:58 well to be fair you
0:47:00 don't really remember your full name so
0:47:02 that's not much to go by
0:47:04 i don't think that even if i remembered
0:47:07 my full name that i would understand
0:47:09 this no
0:47:10 you probably would not whatever this is
0:47:12 that was unfair
0:47:14 but you interrupted again continuing
0:47:16 forward
0:47:17 we're going to give you something to
0:47:19 clean up gonna give you a few minutes
0:47:21 together see if you can remember
0:47:24 anything of important detail
0:47:26 anything at all it might not even be
0:47:28 about the person that did this to you
0:47:31 they might be able to
0:47:34 salvage this situation somehow if you
0:47:36 prove useful in a different way
0:47:40 the person who
0:47:42 did this to me i
0:47:45 she wracks her brain
0:47:47 she leans back in her seat staring off
0:47:49 into the distance
0:47:52 it
0:47:54 seems
0:47:55 like there's an edge of a memory in the
0:47:58 way that she cringes
0:48:00 but
0:48:03 no answer comes out
0:48:05 he'll watch for a few minutes
0:48:07 and then i'll get up
0:48:08 and knock in the door and like we bring
0:48:10 her some water and a change of clothes
0:48:12 this is
0:48:13 not acceptable
0:48:16 [Music]
0:48:19 okay when you had just pulled out a gun
0:48:22 on this thing
0:48:23 i'm going to spend some blood to beef my
0:48:25 stats
0:48:26 if that's acceptable i will say you have
0:48:29 a round
0:48:30 to prepare for combat before
0:48:33 you roll into the fight okay so
0:48:36 what's your blood per round one
0:48:38 so you can allocate one
0:48:40 i'm gonna beef my decks
0:48:42 by one and then we have the round of
0:48:44 combat do you want to put blood anywhere
0:48:46 there as well um i will
0:48:49 throw one more into stamina
0:48:52 okay
0:48:53 all right an initiative is
0:48:55 dex plus widths and then 1d10 and then
0:48:57 one d10
0:49:01 eight is going on a total of seven you
0:49:03 will go first okay i'm gonna attempt to
0:49:04 pop it with the gun bang bang
0:49:07 all right give me dexter's firearms you
0:49:09 can spend a point of willpower for an
0:49:11 automatic rate of success if you would
0:49:12 like i'm going to do that what is the
0:49:14 rule with engaging in a skill that you
0:49:16 do not have any skill in
0:49:17 plus one diff okay
0:49:19 i have no firearms ability yes
0:49:24 um
0:49:25 okay
0:49:26 you need to have a nice chat with johnny
0:49:28 about that yeah probably need to figure
0:49:30 that [ __ ] out just trucker he knows how
0:49:32 to do it right yep
0:49:33 it's not a mall caving that guy never
0:49:34 fights yep and then an auto success i'm
0:49:37 spending a willpower for
0:49:39 [Music]
0:49:42 more successes is that kind of your
0:49:44 willpower i don't think it is uh it is
0:49:46 not
0:49:47 um so yes an additional five five
0:49:49 successes
0:49:51 you don't need johnny to teach you again
0:49:56 so why don't you
0:49:59 have four dice carry over damage okay
0:50:02 and then rule the base damage of your
0:50:03 gun all right
0:50:05 what is base firearm damage what kind of
0:50:07 gun is it pistol i believe that's five
0:50:09 heavy pistols so i'm rolling the four
0:50:12 successes and then five for damage five
0:50:14 more days yep
0:50:16 throwing it
0:50:18 [Music]
0:50:21 that's a lot of zeros
0:50:23 yes it is
0:50:24 seven successes seven successes
0:50:28 you
0:50:29 bang
0:50:30 you hit it square
0:50:33 near by its mouth right right between
0:50:36 the two slits as for our nose
0:50:38 and its body
0:50:40 shivers in in
0:50:42 kind of a convulsive manner and then it
0:50:44 tips over and falls its tongue that
0:50:47 disgusting tongue hangs out of its mouth
0:50:50 and you can hear it breathing shallowly
0:50:54 it's not taking another action
0:50:56 no
0:50:57 finishing it
0:50:58 you walk over
0:51:00 you level a gun
0:51:01 and
0:51:03 there's this wet spray of red on the
0:51:05 ground behind its head and then like a
0:51:08 thicker fluid starts to slowly molasses
0:51:11 its way out
0:51:13 what does that smell like
0:51:16 like brain matter
0:51:18 smells like victory is what it smells
0:51:20 like it was kind of probably a little
0:51:22 better than it did when you were human
0:51:24 yeah
0:51:25 all right is joey still there you look
0:51:28 around and joey's gone again
0:51:30 okay all right put the holster the gun
0:51:32 again
0:51:33 um
0:51:36 your phone starts going off
0:51:38 it's not a pager
0:51:40 well actually i think it is a page
0:51:43 what's the number
0:51:45 you take a look
0:51:46 uh it looks like it's sheriff's office
0:51:49 like the the actual sheriff's office or
0:51:52 the vampire sheriff's office the mortal
0:51:53 sheriff's office does not have your
0:51:54 contact information that's fair
0:51:57 uh so it is it is the kindred sheriff
0:52:00 all right um
0:52:02 i'm gonna kind of take a minute they can
0:52:05 [ __ ] wait
0:52:06 i'm going to
0:52:08 take a minute to look at this sure can i
0:52:11 occult it
0:52:12 like you did i did okay
0:52:14 um i'm not going to get more information
0:52:16 from being able to look at the insides
0:52:18 here's how this would work right okay so
0:52:20 you can uh examine it and take time
0:52:23 but taking time also means you're going
0:52:25 to want to research it so you're going
0:52:26 to want to look for some sort of like
0:52:27 old library you can go through you're
0:52:29 going to want to cross-examine this with
0:52:32 with other sources of information and
0:52:35 that's going to be an extended occult
0:52:36 rule which which we can get into but for
0:52:40 now you can start by
0:52:42 you know taking a look at this yep
0:52:46 all right
0:52:48 if that's going to take more time than i
0:52:49 think the sheriff is willing to endure
0:52:51 for me i'm going to go and
0:52:53 call back and see what they want
0:52:55 okay
0:52:56 um is there a pay phone close by or
0:52:58 would i have to go home i just paid for
0:53:00 him just inside the park right around
0:53:02 where where the boy had actually led you
0:53:03 in there's like a little there's like a
0:53:05 bus stop and then some pay phones okay
0:53:07 i'm gonna go and to the pay phone 1-800
0:53:10 c-a-l-l-a-t-c
0:53:13 and the sheriff's number
0:53:16 uh so when you call the number
0:53:19 you recognize the voice of a kindred by
0:53:21 the name of jane
0:53:22 you know jane to be the bruja whip
0:53:25 and she tends to do a lot of networking
0:53:29 and
0:53:29 assisting assisting for uh
0:53:32 earl weathers the barrage sheriff
0:53:35 hey uh so we've got a little bit of an
0:53:37 issue going on here um are you around

0:53:48 um
0:53:49 i'm not quite sure if he's home
0:53:54 are there any other
0:53:55 like mother hens you can maybe leave him
0:53:57 with no uh okay so i'm just gonna love
0:54:00 with you um
0:54:02 someone
0:54:04 uh
0:54:06 someone violated one of the traditions
0:54:08 there might be some bloodshed we need to
0:54:11 start looking into who's the one
0:54:12 responsible for it progeny got violated
0:54:15 so
0:54:18 i can come in i guess i'm peeking into
0:54:20 another room right now johnny's looking
0:54:21 a little emotional so i kind of need
0:54:25 maybe some kind of backup that's not
0:54:27 going to freak out on me if things go
0:54:28 bad
0:54:29 all right well speaking of not freaking
0:54:31 out there's this uh humanoid beastish

0:55:23 it doesn't it doesn't quite fit right
0:55:26 into the fridge you have to work at it
0:55:28 but eventually
0:55:30 you you managed but yeah you crack some
0:55:32 bones
0:55:33 fits way easier that way and then you
0:55:35 fit
0:55:36 the disgusting monster into your
0:55:38 refrigerator and are again clear to go

0:57:26 ring finger as we walk all right
0:57:28 you take his cold hand
0:57:30 and you begin to walk and by the time
0:57:32 you pass through the door from the shed
0:57:34 he's gone again yep
0:57:37 so where do you go go into the elysium
0:57:40 great or to visit the sheriff because
0:57:43 i don't need this [ __ ]
0:57:48 back at the elysium brother you've been
0:57:50 alone in a windowless room
0:57:52 you hear a knock on the door and miles
0:57:56 opens it and steps into the room
0:57:59 i'm carrying a set of clothes for you um
0:58:01 he puts the clothes down on the table
0:58:04 put these on
0:58:05 and then i will fill you in what's going
0:58:07 to happen next
0:58:09 and i will leave and close the door
0:58:12 Britta nods and looks to the clothes
0:58:15 they seem much fancier than she's used
0:58:18 to she doesn't
0:58:20 know what to think of the circumstance
0:58:21 but
0:58:22 she takes the clothes and she puts them
0:58:24 on
0:58:25 at least they're clean at least they're
0:58:26 not soaked in blood
0:58:28 and she goes out to meet with miles
0:58:31 i adjust a few pieces of your clothes
0:58:34 i stand still hi i'm not sure if i've
0:58:36 done something wrong
0:58:38 i'm going to bring you on elysium um i'm
0:58:40 essentially going to be a chaperone
0:58:42 until we're called before the prince
0:58:45 what's elysium
0:58:48 uh
0:58:50 a party of sorts but their rules so for
0:58:54 the most part just
0:58:56 stick by me
0:58:58 don't say anything out of turn we're
0:59:01 gonna keep you in neutral crowds anyways
0:59:03 uh observe
0:59:05 observe for what
0:59:07 how everyone else acts
0:59:10 okay
0:59:12 um
0:59:13 you'll be called before the prince
0:59:15 at some point
0:59:17 and then your case will be decided
0:59:19 i don't know if they're going to ask you
0:59:20 questions
0:59:22 and i don't know exactly how this is
0:59:23 going to go yet
0:59:25 the prince like
0:59:27 actual
0:59:29 he's called the prince you call him your
0:59:31 grace
0:59:33 and
0:59:35 think of medieval
0:59:38 no sirs
0:59:41 always your grace
0:59:42 everyone your grace
0:59:44 nope just the prince oh everybody else
0:59:45 you can do sirs whatever
0:59:47 just watch for other people's cues
0:59:50 that's the best way i can go about it
0:59:51 without giving you introduction to every
0:59:53 single person saying use this
0:59:55 particular suffix Britta nods uh but she
0:59:59 doesn't really seem to fully understand
1:00:01 she's
1:00:02 searching for some meaning in all this
1:00:04 but
1:00:06 it's a wash
1:00:08 we're mostly gonna be around people that
1:00:11 i know and you've met some um johnny
1:00:15 and
1:00:16 we're going to just
1:00:19 keep it easy
1:00:21 people might come and talk to you we'll
1:00:22 see what happens
1:00:23 we'll mostly try to dissuade them from
1:00:25 that
1:00:26 why
1:00:28 because they don't need to be overly
1:00:30 curious
1:00:33 so we don't need them to be talking
1:00:35 is there something that i shouldn't
1:00:38 say
1:00:40 i don't think there's much you can say
1:00:41 based on everything else that we've
1:00:42 talked about but
1:00:44 there can be some prickly people
1:00:47 and we do not need to start anything
1:00:50 especially right now
1:00:52 you're
1:00:53 in a precarious position
1:00:55 and we do not need to become more
1:00:57 precarious
1:00:59 you said something about the
1:01:02 the rules being broken
1:01:04 yes
1:01:06 your creation was a violation of the
1:01:08 rules therefore you're a violation of
1:01:11 the rules
1:01:13 and generally
1:01:15 the outcome was not a positive one for
1:01:17 you
1:01:19 i didn't mean to kill her
1:01:21 that's
1:01:22 actually not the biggest problem
1:01:26 not the best way to go about it but your
1:01:28 existence is the bigger problem than the
1:01:30 actual death that was caused
1:01:33 whatever this is i don't remember what
1:01:36 happened but i didn't
1:01:39 i don't think i could have asked for
1:01:40 this
1:01:41 it does not seem like it and i don't
1:01:44 think anyone is blaming you and you
1:01:47 should have been taught
1:01:49 and that's part of the thing the person
1:01:51 that created you
1:01:52 should have been the one teaching you
1:01:55 and bringing you through
1:01:56 and telling you how to do this
1:01:59 and they should have been a while before
1:02:01 you are actually even introduced into
1:02:03 this
1:02:04 court
1:02:05 where you would have had time to adjust
1:02:08 unfortunately we don't have that so
1:02:10 instead
1:02:12 you get to go around and
1:02:15 be with us and we will be as close to
1:02:17 that as we can get
1:02:19 you're going to have to learn fast and
1:02:20 hopefully it will actually be
1:02:24 useful
1:02:26 why would someone
1:02:28 have done this to me
1:02:34 lots of reasons and way too many to go
1:02:37 through
1:02:38 now i'm going to ask you a question here
1:02:40 and it's going to be very
1:02:41 uh
1:02:43 do you think
1:02:44 that you can handle this or do you need
1:02:47 help
1:02:49 can you i'm going to need you to be
1:02:54 strong
1:02:55 and
1:02:58 on top of your game out there
1:03:00 and i know that you don't know a lot
1:03:02 but i need you to be able to flow and go
1:03:04 with it i can help
1:03:08 but you being willing will make it a lot
1:03:10 easier
1:03:14 so all you're asking
1:03:17 for now right is that i
1:03:20 watch the people around me that i
1:03:23 try to learn
1:03:24 how to
1:03:26 mirror them
1:03:28 yes
1:03:29 and that i
1:03:31 stay quiet and
1:03:33 don't speak unless spoken to
1:03:35 that's essentially correct
1:03:37 and if you can remember anything
1:03:39 bring it to our attention as soon as it
1:03:41 any of us at any time but not
1:03:44 in the middle of somebody
1:03:46 we are obviously making deference to do
1:03:48 not interrupt them
1:03:50 johnny myself maybe a couple others that
1:03:52 we introduced to and be with
1:03:55 were fairly casual
1:03:58 i
1:03:58 i can try
1:04:00 if you can't let me know
1:04:02 and i can do something to help
1:04:05 it's a little invasive but
1:04:07 it can be helpful invasive
1:04:10 something you'll learn about at some
1:04:11 point
1:04:13 that seems to be the answer for most of
1:04:15 my we don't have a lot of time right now
1:04:17 so i am giving you
1:04:20 the cliff notes version the banging on
1:04:22 the door
1:04:25 i open the door johnny uh
1:04:28 he smirks at uh miles
1:04:30 talking the poor girl's ear off
1:04:33 i don't even have enough time she's not
1:04:35 a venture you know she's either going to
1:04:37 survive this thing if she's not
1:04:38 what's
1:04:42 i'm just trying to get her to through
1:04:44 this night without any major missteps
1:04:47 you all right kiddo
1:04:50 i'm
1:04:52 here yeah sure
1:04:56 let's just get moving
1:04:59 i was about to go out anyways
1:05:03 look
1:05:04 miles uh miles is one of the good ones
1:05:06 listen to what he has to say but uh
1:05:10 don't worry too much about the etiquette
1:05:12 no matter w with some of these older
1:05:14 types doesn't matter what the hell you
1:05:16 do it's never going to be good enough
1:05:19 i essentially just said follow our lead
1:05:22 it's still not going to be good enough
1:05:25 types like
1:05:27 the prince
1:05:28 yeah
1:05:29 he's not the worst of them though some
1:05:31 of them uh
1:05:33 some of these
1:05:35 kindred they can get real old
1:05:38 and the older they get the weirder they
1:05:39 get
1:05:40 very particular
1:05:44 you know what maybe that's better left
1:05:45 for another time
1:05:47 come on let's go
1:05:49 oh all right
1:05:50 [Music]
1:05:54 you uh
1:05:55 head off to the meeting location
1:05:57 and as you arrive
1:06:00 jane is outside waiting for you
1:06:03 uh hey
1:06:05 we should uh
1:06:06 get in soon okay um
1:06:09 so the girl seems pretty young
1:06:12 uh
1:06:13 i don't know who did this
1:06:15 but we gotta we gotta deal with them
1:06:17 okay um
1:06:18 and
1:06:20 has the scourge been notified
1:06:23 the scourge is aware
1:06:27 there's a little bit of a claim
1:06:30 that weathers is responsible for
1:06:33 some sort of escalation they think that
1:06:35 this is the same thing that happened
1:06:36 with a guy named romeo about a year ago
1:06:39 it sounds like the prince might be
1:06:41 buying into it
1:06:43 and that can be pretty bad for weathers
1:06:47 okay this all sounds like a very
1:06:48 political thing which as you know i
1:06:50 don't really care about what is it you
1:06:52 are calling me in for okay so here's
1:06:54 what's going on
1:06:56 okay
1:06:57 weathers
1:06:58 a pretty nice guy i think personally
1:07:02 not being biased
1:07:04 has stumbled upon
1:07:05 a young lady who is probably going to be
1:07:08 executed tonight
1:07:11 and we need to figure out who made this
1:07:14 young lady into what she is
1:07:16 because if we don't
1:07:18 we're gonna end up having to execute
1:07:20 some other little girl
1:07:22 okay
1:07:24 so here you know what johnny can explain
1:07:26 come on in all right
1:07:31 upstairs in the building britta gianni
1:07:33 and miles you're headed back into the
1:07:34 gathering so the group of you step out
1:07:36 of the room and down the hall you can
1:07:39 hear the sounds of conversation
1:07:41 you step out into this much larger open
1:07:44 space where there seems to be about a
1:07:47 dozen a half or so individuals kind of
1:07:50 lounging and having side conversations
1:07:52 with each other and that's when you
1:07:54 notice that in this in this large
1:07:57 opulent room
1:07:59 there are these works of art
1:08:01 and one of these paintings the the
1:08:04 subtle colors of it
1:08:05 strike you in a way like colors have
1:08:08 never
1:08:09 never touched you before and i need you
1:08:12 to make a self-control check difficulty
1:08:16 six
1:08:20 one success
1:08:22 so the one success you managed to resist
1:08:24 the urge
1:08:26 to be
1:08:27 uh
1:08:28 to be enraptured by this art for the
1:08:31 duration of the entire scene
1:08:34 and as the two of you are walking out
1:08:36 with her she just kind of stops eyes go
1:08:38 wide
1:08:39 and
1:08:40 she looks around the room as if to have
1:08:43 received vision for the first time
1:08:46 it's so
1:08:47 beautiful hey
1:08:49 you with us
1:08:51 what johnny gives her kind of a weird
1:08:54 side glance miles that's when you notice
1:08:56 something else all together
1:08:58 all of the side conversations being held
1:09:01 by people in beautiful outfits
1:09:04 with gorgeous makeup and hair done just
1:09:07 just the way in the in the most
1:09:09 up-to-date fashions that
1:09:11 1999 has to offer um
1:09:14 and uh a lot of spaghetti straps
1:09:19 and
1:09:20 they all turned to look at her
1:09:24 some of them whispered to each other you
1:09:26 know none of it's good and
1:09:28 that's when even that's when even the
1:09:30 two of you kind of noticed that you are
1:09:33 the belle of the ball in all the worst
1:09:35 ways
1:09:36 let's keep it moving
1:09:37 i turn away from the painting as soon as
1:09:40 i can get my attention away from it the
1:09:42 colors really are so beautiful but
1:09:45 everyone is staring and i i find myself
1:09:49 just sticking close to johnny let's just
1:09:52 meet up maybe neil has some information
1:09:55 yeah i asked him to go searching around
1:09:58 hopefully he's got good news for me
1:10:01 yeah that'd be really cute
1:10:04 you got to stop doing that man what i'm
1:10:06 just
1:10:08 normal
1:10:10 appearing as if he has always been
1:10:12 walking with the group but you just
1:10:14 managed to catch him out of the corner
1:10:15 of your eye
1:10:16 is a man he's got neil has appearance
1:10:19 too he's a reasonably plain looking guy
1:10:22 um
1:10:23 tall little thin
1:10:24 has this sort of lank
1:10:27 like dark hair curtain that comes about
1:10:30 to his chin like
1:10:32 full-on 1990s johnny depp grease curtain
1:10:34 i'm imagining somewhere between johnny
1:10:36 depp and like rivers cuomo release
1:10:39 curtain that's very
1:10:41 yeah with a little with a little like uh
1:10:43 oh man what's his name doesn't matter
1:10:45 he's wearing like
1:10:46 like a polyester like rayon bowling
1:10:49 shirt and a pair of kind of loose levi's
1:10:52 silver tab carpenter jeans
1:10:55 just offend me by existing
1:10:57 uh
1:10:58 and a pair of just you know like
1:11:00 just sneakers just
1:11:03 um three boxes yeah uh
1:11:05 that one's pretty right he just kind of
1:11:07 looks over and points at the one that
1:11:08 you were just staring at breto looks
1:11:10 back and for a moment she stares and
1:11:14 sort of falls into it but she pulls
1:11:16 herself out again and
1:11:18 it's gorgeous everything no
1:11:21 not really my uh not really my
1:11:23 thing uh what were we talking about did
1:11:26 you hey uh
1:11:28 were you born today or yesterday
1:11:31 i
1:11:32 um i don't remember how old i am but i
1:11:35 don't think
1:11:37 what but when we were talking you we
1:11:40 were talking that's right that's what i
1:11:41 was doing yeah um
1:11:44 and i was looking for newspapers
1:11:47 no no and also shaw
1:11:49 i don't
1:11:50 want a boon from shaw
1:11:53 i didn't say anything about bones what
1:11:55 are boons
1:11:56 don't worry about it
1:11:59 but apropos of nothing yeah he he wants
1:12:02 a boom
1:12:04 like i said man like like we were
1:12:06 talking about you don't have anybody
1:12:08 else that can
1:12:09 with the kind of sway that you're
1:12:10 looking for look around man what like
1:12:12 what do you
1:12:14 who are you uh
1:12:16 you know like
1:12:17 it's there's a door that bangs open as
1:12:20 it's aggressively hip checked
1:12:22 uh by a woman with stark white hair
1:12:25 wiping her hands on her very much second
1:12:28 hand and very very old jeans these seem
1:12:31 to be men's jeans this woman has an
1:12:34 appearance of two she is not what you
1:12:35 would call ugly but she
1:12:38 her appearance is not what is remarkable
1:12:39 about her she has bright white hair that
1:12:43 is shaved off of both sides leaving just
1:12:46 a messy french braid down the middle her
1:12:49 eyes are about the color of a green
1:12:52 the color green of a seagull's eyes very
1:12:54 light very s almost sickening and she's
1:12:57 just she just doesn't fit with the rest
1:13:00 of the crowd in a few different ways
1:13:03 there is a soaking wet flannel shirt
1:13:06 that she is wearing none of the rest of
1:13:08 her clothes are wet beyond having dried
1:13:10 her hands on her pants she has a pair of
1:13:12 what look to be second hand doc martens
1:13:15 with many many miles on them and she
1:13:18 seems to be looking at her fingernails
1:13:20 as though she's not quite sure they're
1:13:21 clean enough remarkably they may be the
1:13:23 cleanest thing about her
1:13:25 wind comes out and sees the group
1:13:28 i clean them
1:13:29 see is that you you want you want me to
1:13:32 ask when to get pulled with the prince
1:13:34 or or uh

1:13:38 actually use your resources and find
1:13:40 something other than shaw what's your
1:13:42 problem with sean

1:13:55 bruja thing
1:13:57 look snakes are always friendly until
1:13:59 they uh not all right so that's not true
1:14:03 snakes have never been friendly to miles
1:14:06 that's true that we have not had a good
1:14:08 relief but regardless that's not the
1:14:10 [ __ ] point here man unfortunately

1:14:58 found the thing that killed dead should
1:14:59 we go out on the balcony or something
1:15:02 that's up to you guys like a chat here
1:15:05 are you guys uncomfortable because we
1:15:07 can go out on the balcony
1:15:09 there's just sort of a general level
1:15:11 like a volume are not miles is clearly
1:15:14 getting uncomfortable
1:15:16 yes could we either step off
1:15:18 yeah let's set the weight now let's head
1:15:20 out to the balcony i could use a smoke
1:15:21 anyways i want to look at this guy
1:15:22 anyways look who you walk out and
1:15:26 open the door to the balcony there's a
1:15:28 pair of individuals that are actually
1:15:29 whispering to one another the first one
1:15:32 is a
1:15:34 young man of african-american descent
1:15:35 he's got like a nice very sharp fade and
1:15:39 is wearing um kind of a loose suit that
1:15:41 has no tie the shirt's kind of unbucket
1:15:44 buttoned you can kind of see the glint
1:15:46 of like a silver chain just showing
1:15:48 underneath it he's got like a big like
1:15:51 kind of diamond stud in his left ear and
1:15:54 he is chatting with uh actually uh
1:15:58 johnny uh miles we actually recognize
1:16:00 this individual to be the young toyota
1:16:02 named romeo the person he is speaking to
1:16:04 is a an older woman just probably only
1:16:08 she looks maybe a decade older than
1:16:10 romeo himself he's pretty young he looks
1:16:11 like he's fresh out of high school
1:16:13 you recognize her to be elsa linden
1:16:16 and she is dressed in
1:16:19 gorgeous finery
1:16:21 probably the best dressed here the two
1:16:23 of them notice the group of you come out
1:16:25 and
1:16:26 there's a
1:16:27 kurt nod from romeo who steps back
1:16:30 inside and elsa gives the group of you a
1:16:34 little bit of an awkward wave
1:16:36 she seems keenly aware of your situation
1:16:39 she uh she actually leans in to win
1:16:43 not to draw attention to your situation
1:16:47 but the pistol should be kept outside
1:16:49 yeah sure and then she excuses herself
1:16:52 and heads on it
1:16:55 a really good point it's elysium you
1:16:57 might want to
1:16:58 oh you just i came right over
1:17:01 johnny johnny put the hand out i'll take
1:17:03 it to the uh to the office thank you you
1:17:04 got it well now you're carrying a gun
1:17:07 yeah but i'm one of the bully boys all

1:17:12 dad's got it oh okay well then if it's
1:17:14 sentimental don't throw it neil you
1:17:16 notice that it's a little cloudy
1:17:18 overhead
1:17:19 and just now you can see
1:17:22 snow very gently starting to come down
1:17:26 well just to make it work after stowing
1:17:28 the uh the handgun in his leather jacket
1:17:31 he retrieves a pack of marlboro reds
1:17:35 pulls one out takes out a zippo um
1:17:38 season it
1:17:40 watch that right
1:17:42 sorry about that this is the second time
1:17:44 tonight is that your is that your
1:17:45 preferred brand is not the ones that i
1:17:47 was carrying is it
1:17:49 no okay
1:17:50 neil pulls out like a little notebook
1:17:52 from his back pocket and you can see him
1:17:54 write american spirit and then cross it
1:17:57 off and puts his notepad back in his
1:17:59 back he was virginia slims actually was
1:18:01 it virginia yeah he writes virginia
1:18:03 slims white scratches it off and then
1:18:06 puts in his back pocket johnny turns and
1:18:08 and makes sure to light the uh the zippo
1:18:11 out of view
1:18:12 of Britta kind of with his head turned
1:18:15 into his jacket
1:18:17 so uh
1:18:20 right
1:18:22 so shaw's the only one that has it i was
1:18:24 fairly sure that myself this the only
1:18:26 one but he's the only one that we could
1:18:29 ask something this big of
1:18:31 and have him listen
1:18:33 and you know have him do you know what
1:18:35 he wants
1:18:36 look maybe we should we should
1:18:38 we should clue you into a little bit
1:18:40 here okay i know i know you're getting
1:18:42 the whole all kinds of things just
1:18:44 thrown at you tonight
1:18:45 with
1:18:46 chocolate traditions and boons
1:18:48 our whole society here kindred
1:18:52 it's weird all right
1:18:55 and
1:18:56 when you live as long as some of these
1:18:58 things have been around
1:19:00 things kindred when you live as long as
1:19:04 as they have money stops mattering
1:19:06 possessions you got plenty of time to
1:19:09 collect those things so what really
1:19:11 matters are boons
1:19:13 little
1:19:14 favors some of them are small
1:19:17 others
1:19:19 are worth
1:19:21 they're your your life
1:19:23 and some people get very good at using
1:19:25 small boons to do large things and guys
1:19:28 like shaw
1:19:30 happen to be collectors of these kind of
1:19:32 life boons
1:19:34 guys like shaw own half the city and are
1:19:37 willing to do horrible things with these
1:19:39 boomers so i'm not
1:19:41 i'm not inclined to give him another one
1:19:44 sure
1:19:46 on the flip side how much do you want
1:19:48 her not to get killed
1:19:50 johnny gives a kind of a sad and
1:19:53 sorrowful look over at uh Britta she's an
1:19:56 unsanctioned progeny man like
1:19:59 the kind of favors you're asking pull
1:20:01 for need a guy like shaw that's why i
1:20:04 asked you when i first thought about it
1:20:06 how much does it matter to you i agree
1:20:08 with neil i can't think of anybody else
1:20:10 that has it right now that would give it
1:20:12 to us right now so i'm gonna
1:20:15 call for a time out here because i'm
1:20:16 coming in a little bit coming in hot no
1:20:18 i can't that's yeah that's how i go
1:20:20 um how much have you been told about
1:20:24 what you are
1:20:26 not a lot yet all right maybe do we want
1:20:29 to back it up so she has a [ __ ] clue
1:20:32 not particularly
1:20:34 i'm mostly waiting to see how things go
1:20:37 at this point but if she doesn't know
1:20:38 what she is how does she know how to
1:20:39 behave
1:20:40 she is following our lead mostly oh
1:20:43 that's a terrible not all of our leads
1:20:45 yeah i was going to say don't get wins
1:20:47 wins right if if she has any chance of
1:20:49 making it through tonight let's just be
1:20:50 honest with her i'm gonna side with
1:20:52 miles but only because i like to see an
1:20:54 even split
1:20:56 if the obsessive compulsiveness weren't
1:20:58 a part of this what would you go with
1:21:00 look she's gonna have to go before the
1:21:01 prince that's what i'm saying and needs
1:21:04 to have the wherewithal to do it and
1:21:06 it's easier with ignorance
1:21:08 actually i'm i'm
1:21:10 not as a jest i i do kind of agree with
1:21:13 miles i think information overload can
1:21:15 be um
1:21:16 what do you want a little overwhelming
1:21:18 but yeah personal choice i should also
1:21:20 mention the fact that it hasn't been
1:21:21 brought up yet she can't remove her
1:21:23 anything before
1:21:25 she woke up as a kindred so she has
1:21:28 i don't like talking about her like
1:21:30 she's not [ __ ] here i understand i
1:21:31 know but it is the easiest way to do it
1:21:33 i can see that i'm sorry i just i don't
1:21:38 i don't sure i don't remember i don't
1:21:41 remember what happened i don't remember
1:21:42 how any of this came to be and i barely
1:21:45 understand
1:21:46 anything about what i am or why i've
1:21:50 done the things i've done tonight and
1:21:54 look whatever this is i've been thrown
1:21:55 in the deep end here okay yeah i
1:21:59 what will help you swim
1:22:00 what life preserver can we throw you
1:22:03 that will help keep you afloat for
1:22:05 tonight
1:22:07 whatever this is
1:22:09 whatever i don't understand
1:22:13 all i know is that
1:22:15 you all seem to be the only ones trying
1:22:18 to help me
1:22:20 so
1:22:23 look i want to know what the hell is
1:22:25 going on here i want to understand
1:22:28 i can't help but be curious but
1:22:32 if i need to talk to the
1:22:35 prince
1:22:36 then
1:22:39 tell me what i need to know and i guess
1:22:42 i'll follow your lead
1:22:45 all right that sounds like a good
1:22:46 compromise right right i've been filling
1:22:49 it in as short-term notice as i can
1:22:52 but there is way too much to go over in
1:22:55 such a small period of time i'm keeping
1:22:57 it to the things that i thought it's
1:22:58 necessary right now
1:23:00 and she's not currently going to be part
1:23:02 of any kind of boon deal or anything
1:23:04 like that so i hadn't brought the
1:23:06 details of that to her yet or the fact
1:23:08 that all this
1:23:09 is an exchange
1:23:11 and how are we going to deal with
1:23:12 tomorrow night
1:23:15 tomorrow night she's making it to
1:23:17 tomorrow i think we've all decided she's
1:23:18 making it till tomorrow night wow so
1:23:21 not if we don't get a boom from shaw
1:23:22 kind of the price deal right
1:23:25 and uh i'm not going to war yeah whoa
1:23:29 yeah
1:23:30 i mean we're like no offense so that you
1:23:32 seem nice
1:23:33 um
1:23:35 you
1:23:35 i it's more of a
1:23:37 uh
1:23:38 yeah the the you want to do this the
1:23:41 safe way for the kid or you want to you
1:23:42 want to but yes and essentially somebody
1:23:45 would need to be in charge for new
1:23:47 accounting
1:23:48 after this point and
1:23:50 we'll see how it goes
1:23:51 if they find the clan somebody might
1:23:53 pick her up otherwise i vote miles it's
1:23:55 on somebody
1:23:57 why can't i just
1:24:00 disappear not an option
1:24:02 i mean it's totally an option
1:24:04 it's not an option
1:24:07 because you had the [ __ ] luck to be
1:24:08 embraced in camaria territory and not
1:24:11 anarch i'm sorry what yeah too much
1:24:15 uh wrong place wrong time
1:24:18 do i need to know either of those words
1:24:19 can't camera camarilla is the territory
1:24:22 you're in now is it rhea
1:24:24 like i was never it's been 30 years and
1:24:26 i've never been told
1:24:28 and if we're starting her off on a good
1:24:30 foot
1:24:31 if we're starting her off on a good foot
1:24:32 i wondered it does not matter right now
1:24:34 kind of does let's go with camarilla
1:24:37 camarilla okay great so i hope that's
1:24:40 helpful and really illuminating for you
1:24:42 britta
1:24:43 look
1:24:46 that's where we're at right now i've
1:24:48 been filling information tomorrow night
1:24:50 is a whole different night we have this
1:24:52 night to get through first
1:24:54 yeah like i said we've all decided we're
1:24:56 getting through it one way or the other
1:24:58 we're rapidly opposed to shaw on
1:25:01 this
1:25:02 side are there other options no let me
1:25:04 why don't you talk to weathers
1:25:08 i owe him that
1:25:11 you already know what he's gonna say
1:25:12 though
1:25:13 is weathers
1:25:15 one of the good ones yeah
1:25:18 he doesn't have the pull that shaw does
1:25:19 and he doesn't like me as much as shaw
1:25:21 does
1:25:22 look
1:25:23 weathers is one of one of the few
1:25:25 kindred still keeping this city together
1:25:28 i can also talk to raven about adopting
1:25:30 her
1:25:30 yeah but adopting her still means making
1:25:33 it through the night
1:25:34 like
1:25:35 we need to give her that
1:25:37 do they have the pull that the prince
1:25:39 does this point is i owe it to weather
1:25:41 is to ask him if he's got anything that
1:25:43 he can do for me before i just go
1:25:45 running to shaw like every other kindred
1:25:47 in this city
1:25:49 if you want to
1:25:50 propose that and bring
1:25:52 that kind of potential political fallout
1:25:55 to weathers i mean that's your
1:25:59 but also sidestepping it through shaw
1:26:01 means weather says his hands clean
1:26:03 unfortunately i can't even talk to the
1:26:05 prince since the whole set thing so
1:26:09 not on the outs but not on the end
1:26:12 is there a way that
1:26:14 we can
1:26:16 whoever this weathers person is is it
1:26:18 just bad if you talk to him or
1:26:22 no
1:26:22 might might be a bad idea if you come
1:26:24 along weather is he's uh he's the
1:26:26 sheriff
1:26:28 not uh not a new haven he's the sheriff
1:26:31 of the camarilla in this city
1:26:34 still technically new haven but
1:26:38 does that clear things up
1:26:39 the police
1:26:41 in a sense yes of us yes
1:26:45 okay yeah
1:26:47 there are rules in order to this so
1:26:48 therefore there are positions to oversee
1:26:50 these things
1:26:52 look a few things to keep in mind
1:26:55 you're gonna get a whole lot of weird
1:26:57 words thrown at you
1:26:59 the number one thing to remember
1:27:02 is that there is a
1:27:06 agreement
1:27:07 that we all have
1:27:09 that none of this weirdness
1:27:12 leaves these places
1:27:14 that the regular types
1:27:17 the mortals
1:27:18 they don't learn about this stuff
1:27:21 because it can be bad for all of us
1:27:24 we keep it covered up
1:27:26 yeah yeah
1:27:27 um
1:27:28 a lot of the rest of the rules can kind
1:27:29 of be boiled down to like just listen to
1:27:31 what everyone else has to say because
1:27:33 you're the lowest run on the totem pole
1:27:34 is that i mean if we're gonna
1:27:36 if we're just sort of trying to get the
1:27:38 cliff notes is that
1:27:39 mostly keep it quiet listen to everybody
1:27:42 else because you're nothing
1:27:44 it's always taught to me hopefully
1:27:46 someone will be able to speak up for her
1:27:47 when she goes up there but otherwise jim
1:27:49 will need to be prepared to speak in
1:27:50 front of the prince and in front of the
1:27:52 elysium
1:27:53 i think weathers is here tonight though
1:27:54 and it might not be a bad idea if you
1:27:57 come over to say hi to him real quick
1:27:59 he's kind of like me
1:28:01 we're uh
1:28:02 people of our blood
1:28:04 we're a part of a clan
1:28:06 call us the bruja we get tend to get
1:28:08 kind of emotional about things and
1:28:11 sometimes you can pull on our heart
1:28:13 strings and it might not be a bad idea
1:28:16 if you were to maybe
1:28:18 lay it on a little thick with weathers
1:28:21 if you can do something for us that
1:28:23 might be the way to do it
1:28:26 if you're gonna talk to weathers and
1:28:27 clearly you're gonna talk to weathers um
1:28:29 unless i'm mistaken and didn't overhear
1:28:31 things right uh miles you gotta stick
1:28:33 close to her anyways yes and um
1:28:36 i do it sooner rather than later because
1:28:39 there is kind of a shot clock on this
1:28:41 i'm not going to say that you know
1:28:42 shaw's offer is going to run out but
1:28:44 prince might decide hey now's the time
1:28:46 and
1:28:47 if we still have to have those
1:28:48 conversations
1:28:49 or kind of be sol
1:28:52 right
1:28:53 i just you know i'm just trying to i
1:28:54 don't i'm not trying to be bad guy here
1:28:56 i just
1:28:58 do you know bush trying to keep things
1:29:00 bright whether it is china takes a last
1:29:01 drag on a cigarette flicks it off the
1:29:03 balcony yeah let me um hold on i'm gonna
1:29:06 turn around and there's like a big plate
1:29:08 glass looking out onto the thing i'm
1:29:10 going to just look in and kind of
1:29:13 relax my eyes a little bit
1:29:15 and
1:29:16 scan around and see if i can see that
1:29:18 particular weather's emotional state
1:29:21 kicking around real quick
1:29:23 where is he
1:29:24 you're looking around and
1:29:27 it is not long before you
1:29:30 see an individual storming through
1:29:34 the gathered kindred headed off in some
1:29:36 direction uh looks like he's headed to
1:29:39 the office that a lot of the bully boys
1:29:41 and the sheriff tend to meet in he looks
1:29:44 flustered
1:29:46 even by his standards
1:29:48 oh uh
1:29:49 there he is right there the uh roiling
1:29:52 storm cloud of emotions who looks really
1:29:53 pissed off
1:29:55 how else would he look if he's a roiling
1:29:56 storm cloud of emotion you can be a
1:29:58 roiling storm crowd of positive emotions
1:30:00 here don't usually use the word bro
1:30:02 anyways let's move on so what are you
1:30:04 guys doing hold the door open and
1:30:07 gesture johnny starts striding out first
1:30:10 and says just kind of turns to Britta
1:30:13 follow me
1:30:14 all right and goes heading up towards
1:30:16 the uh the ship should probably make
1:30:18 sure it's okay for us to go in there
1:30:20 briefing maybe because it sounds like
1:30:22 he's heading towards the sheriff's
1:30:23 office so i think gene and whatnot is
1:30:25 around here too as Britta walks past as
1:30:28 i'm holding the door open just i'm gonna
1:30:29 lean in real close just
1:30:31 actually do not listen to johnny at all
1:30:33 um
1:30:34 [Laughter]
1:30:36 uh follow miles
1:30:38 he's the one you were told to follow and
1:30:40 they get very particular about uh orders
1:30:43 but if miles is going that way that's
1:30:45 fine just just i want it he sometimes he
1:30:48 acts before he thinks
1:30:50 bretta looks very startled she listens
1:30:53 to neil uh with very carefully uh and
1:30:56 just looks much more confused than she
1:30:58 was before but she mouths the words
1:31:01 thank you great good
1:31:03 little lean back away from her yeah i'm
1:31:05 the what not to do guide
1:31:07 just for the record you see me doing
1:31:08 something you probably shouldn't be
1:31:10 doing it
1:31:11 thanks
1:31:12 i'm here to help and win enters the
1:31:15 building where most folks walk through a
1:31:18 classy gathering
1:31:19 as though they're walking on their high
1:31:21 heels in their shiny shoes wynn has a
1:31:23 tendency to walk like she's stomping
1:31:25 ants all the time
1:31:30 and she strides through the crowd and
1:31:32 seems to be off in search of someone
1:31:34 else
1:31:35 as you guys you guys are all heading
1:31:36 yeah there yeah uh bridges are going
1:31:38 through you can hear this cacophony of
1:31:41 whispers you know
1:31:43 everyone is talking about you but you
1:31:45 never seem to be able to make out
1:31:46 exactly what's being said it's like all
1:31:48 of the the individuals here are
1:31:51 very talented
1:31:53 at
1:31:54 whispering about whatever gossip they
1:31:56 might want to discuss and avoid avoiding
1:31:59 prying ears for the most part i try
1:32:02 harder to listen
1:32:03 for the past couple hours sometimes it
1:32:05 seemed like
1:32:07 my hearing's a bit better when you focus
1:32:09 on as you start to head up the stairs
1:32:11 there is
1:32:13 one thing that that catches your
1:32:14 attention actually towards where the
1:32:17 group's headed it looks like they're
1:32:18 actually heading towards the the the
1:32:20 conversation that you suddenly find
1:32:22 yourself in tune with there's a
1:32:24 conversation between what looks to be
1:32:26 this this
1:32:27 muscular though uh
1:32:30 a bit older gentleman uh this
1:32:32 african-american man with a well-trimmed
1:32:34 beard he's got kind of suit on it's like
1:32:37 it's like a suede
1:32:39 jacket
1:32:40 and this like kind of cream-colored
1:32:43 turtleneck
1:32:45 his pants are kind of baggy he's got
1:32:47 these really nice like uh kind of like
1:32:49 smoky gray boots
1:32:51 that are on and he just towers
1:32:54 over the other man that he's speaking
1:32:56 with but judging by their body language
1:32:59 it actually looks like the smaller man
1:33:01 is in control of the conversation the
1:33:03 smaller man is this diminutive kind of
1:33:06 professor looking individual he's
1:33:08 carrying a cane and he's got this tweed
1:33:10 jacket on and uh these kind of old dusty
1:33:14 old uh pants on
1:33:16 and these glasses that keeps adjusting
1:33:18 during the course of the conversation
1:33:20 his hair snake slicked back his nose is
1:33:22 is hawkish
1:33:24 and
1:33:25 you hear them whispering but to you it
1:33:28 booms from across the room
1:33:30 and what they are saying is
1:33:33 a touch disturbance the man of the cane
1:33:35 looks to
1:33:37 sheriff weathers
1:33:38 and says to him
1:33:41 the matter regarding the death of the
1:33:43 boy has been covered
1:33:45 it would seem that whatever took place
1:33:47 was so traumatic that a spirit remained
1:33:50 i've seen to this matter the boy is
1:33:52 resolved
1:33:53 it'll be added to a collection and
1:33:56 and
1:33:57 be put towards good use
1:34:00 the reference to this boy being used as
1:34:03 some some sort of tool
1:34:05 uh
1:34:06 visibly angers sheriff weathers and you
1:34:09 can you can feel this this palpable rage
1:34:12 grew from him
1:34:14 he glares at
1:34:16 mr Reiss
1:34:18 Seneschal with respect
1:34:20 i don't think that boy deserves any of
1:34:23 that
1:34:24 and
1:34:26 maybe there's something that can be
1:34:28 worked out
1:34:30 what what can i what can me and and the
1:34:32 bruha offer you
1:34:34 in exchange for this boy's freedom
1:34:37 senator Reiss gives the sheriff a smirk
1:34:41 i don't know that there's actually
1:34:42 anything you can offer me and the work
1:34:44 that i need done
1:34:45 is
1:34:46 beyond your reach
1:34:49 but
1:34:51 perhaps down the road
1:34:54 if you keep the boy in your thoughts
1:34:57 an opportunity may arise
1:35:00 until then
1:35:01 be aware that your office has been aided
1:35:05 the haunt that was to be created by the
1:35:08 the cruel murder of this boy has been
1:35:10 resolved
1:35:11 and
1:35:12 the masquerade remains intact you're
1:35:14 welcome sheriff
1:35:17 how loud is this discussion
1:35:19 just her yeah it just kind of looks like
1:35:21 they're kind of like
1:35:22 having this like quick little chat and
1:35:24 as you guys get closer
1:35:26 when that's when you notice something as
1:35:30 the seneschal
1:35:32 john Reiss begins to walk away actually
1:35:34 just striding right past the group of
1:35:36 you
1:35:37 you recognize the little boy
1:35:40 who's walking not three steps behind him
1:35:44 head down
1:35:45 and
1:35:46 judging by his his very body language he
1:35:48 is not in control of his actions
1:35:51 again his his body is emaciated it looks
1:35:54 like he he died a terrible death
1:35:58 and
1:35:58 the rest of your quartery almost
1:36:01 practically walks right through the boy
1:36:02 as they continue on towards
1:36:04 sheriff weathers
1:36:06 seneschal Reiss just one minute please
1:36:09 just hold still for one second
1:36:12 that is a bold request what do you want
1:36:14 oh nothing from you just to stand still
1:36:16 that's all
1:36:17 and kind of looks toward joey joey i'm
1:36:20 going to get you out of there
1:36:22 thank you that'll be all seneschal thank
1:36:24 you for your time
1:36:28 it is a cool thing to give a dead boy
1:36:29 false hope well i already did it so i'm
1:36:31 already cruel
1:36:32 there you are
1:36:34 not as cruel as some come
1:36:36 boy
1:36:37 stammers and
1:36:39 follows his master
1:36:41 the rest of the quarterback
1:36:43 sees an unusual conversation and then
1:36:47 senator charles wanders off
1:36:50 picking fights with rhys now that's not
1:36:53 smart
1:36:54 doesn't have to be smart but it kind of
1:36:56 does what were they talking about
1:36:59 the dead boy
1:37:01 yeah he came to me looking for help
1:37:03 tonight what about a dead boy you could
1:37:06 hear them from all the way over here
1:37:08 neil looks over at Britta and just gives
1:37:11 this sort of very piercing
1:37:15 kind of look
1:37:16 britta looks back at neil looking for
1:37:18 some form of anchor it seems like he
1:37:21 understands so
1:37:23 um you didn't you didn't hear that it
1:37:26 was i wasn't trying to um
1:37:29 has it been a little loud a little
1:37:30 bright for the last couple hours for you
1:37:33 sometimes
1:37:34 when things are important it feels like
1:37:37 i can
1:37:38 hear them better or
1:37:40 feel the feel the wind on your skin a
1:37:41 little too a little too raw
1:37:44 well it seemed like they were i mean

1:38:02 night conversation well regardless of
1:38:05 how
1:38:05 i'm i'm sorry brief overview
1:38:08 being embraced as kindred sometimes
1:38:10 comes with powers
1:38:11 well that's abilities
1:38:14 it's true it's like a comic book it's a
1:38:18 simplest explanation however any of this
1:38:21 works
1:38:22 they were talking about something like
1:38:25 covering up a masquerade and
1:38:28 covering up a
1:38:29 something to do with the
1:38:32 dead boy being under
1:38:34 being controlled maybe
1:38:37 yeah so before i came here tonight
1:38:39 little boy came and found me little dead
1:38:42 boy came and found me in my
1:38:44 haven said he couldn't remember how to
1:38:46 get home
1:38:47 we went into the woods we found the
1:38:48 thing that killed him we found the crime
1:38:50 scene where he had been killed
1:38:52 and i promised him that we would find a
1:38:55 way for him to say goodbye to mom before
1:38:56 he moved on what kind of thing so that's
1:38:59 the fun part i have it in my fridge so
1:39:01 yes i did cover up the masquerade breech
1:39:03 with a fridge yeah nice um well
1:39:07 um
1:39:08 i don't think they were talking about
