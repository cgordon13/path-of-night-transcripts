0:00:00 path of night is an actual play vampire
0:00:02 the masquerade podcast set in the
0:00:04 classic world of darkness we're all
0:00:06 friends we're here to have fun but our
0:00:08 story can include graphic violence drug
0:00:11 use sexual content and other mature
0:00:13 themes we've talked at our table about
0:00:15 safety comfort and consent both as
0:00:18 players and storytellers we know what to
0:00:20 expect we're all excited to be here and
0:00:22 we want you to feel the same so listener
0:00:25 discretion is advised
0:00:27 now
0:00:28 let's walk the path of night
0:00:32 [Music]
0:00:35 last time on path of night
0:00:37 secrets were revealed and thoughts were
0:00:39 laid bare as the quarterly drove to veto
0:00:41 zantos manor
0:00:43 they discussed the trouble they had been
0:00:44 hiding from one another and what terrors
0:00:46 might await them in the coming nights
0:00:49 now the quarterly is geared up and
0:00:51 ventures into the deathly quiet of a
0:00:53 snowstorm approaching the home of the
0:00:56 sabbath revenant they suspect is
0:00:57 responsible for both joey's feet and the
0:01:00 weeping bear's presence
0:01:11 [Music]
0:01:13 so
0:01:14 the group of you trek through the snow
0:01:17 and it's about a 10 minute walk you kind
0:01:19 of like it's crunching along you guys
0:01:21 are following in each other's footsteps
0:01:23 after this long kind of walk through
0:01:26 these howling winds because the storm is
0:01:28 just really like starting to ramp up at
0:01:30 this point and on top of that it's also
0:01:32 probably really muffled sounding because
0:01:33 it's like the snow storm and stuff like
0:01:35 that so it's kind of like this weird
0:01:37 enclosed feeling if you remember it's
0:01:38 the sound of like a quiet night it's
0:01:40 very uncomfortable
0:01:43 but in time you get to the house
0:01:45 when
0:01:46 you don't find yourself needing to check
0:01:48 for the address number because what you
0:01:49 see is very different from what everyone
0:01:51 else sees once you're close enough the
0:01:53 snow is this terrible
0:01:56 crimson color almost like right at the
0:01:59 property line as it comes closer to the
0:02:01 building itself the world is sicker and
0:02:04 sicker the house itself is covered in
0:02:08 veins that have grown like vines
0:02:10 the structure is like slowly being
0:02:12 crushed and consumed
0:02:14 by this these these veins coursing
0:02:17 through it it's around then that the
0:02:20 flesh that you see in the spirit world
0:02:23 kind of shifts as if made aware of your
0:02:25 presence and it's at that point i need
0:02:27 you to make a raw shrek check can i
0:02:29 spend the willpower yes
0:02:31 for the rest of you she's she's got her
0:02:33 red eyes going and she's moving and
0:02:34 she's moving and then she just stops and
0:02:37 stares she starts looking at down at her
0:02:39 feet
0:02:40 and then looks up towards the mansion
0:02:43 and her eyes become wider and wider when
0:02:46 are you
0:02:47 one success okay uh your beast
0:02:50 practically begs for you to turn and run
0:02:52 but you manage to stand your ground
0:02:56 this is bad this is this is jesus
0:02:58 [ __ ] christ this is bad johnny
0:03:01 reaches out and puts a gentle hand kind
0:03:02 of on on on your back
0:03:05 all right
0:03:08 it's not okay it's not okay here this is
0:03:10 this is bad this is
0:03:12 uh is it a reasonable can i make an
0:03:14 occult check to know more about what i'm
0:03:16 seeing yeah on the walk over here i
0:03:19 think i'm gonna start juicing up my
0:03:20 physical treats go ahead you guys can
0:03:23 feel free to mark off uh any blood
0:03:25 expenditures at this point up to six
0:03:27 right if you take yourself up to six the
0:03:29 last for the scene anything past that
0:03:30 less for three rounds what's the
0:03:32 difficulty rating uh seven
0:03:34 uh four successes okay
0:03:36 with four successes uh one
0:03:39 those rumors among the gangrel about the
0:03:41 strange things that they saw a lot of
0:03:44 this seems to have similar vibes to
0:03:46 there is nowhere in new haven like this
0:03:48 whatever this is it is bad it's not even
0:03:52 that these veins are a spirit in of
0:03:54 itself but there is something here that
0:03:57 is so terrible that it is warping the
0:03:59 spirit world around it and because you
0:04:02 can kind of get a sense for both the
0:04:04 spirit realm and the shadowlands the
0:04:06 realm of the dead
0:04:07 both of them are being negatively
0:04:09 impacted by whatever the [ __ ] is here is
0:04:12 this like the thing that xavier went to
0:04:14 go find the stuff that xavier talked
0:04:16 about the stuff that some of the other
0:04:17 gangrel talked about this is kind of in
0:04:20 that vein
0:04:21 so to whatever's in here
0:04:24 has changed
0:04:26 the spiritual landscape of both the dead
0:04:29 and the the spirit worlds um there's
0:04:32 there's veins it's constricting
0:04:35 this is this is the reason why xavier
0:04:37 left this is
0:04:38 this is the kind of hellish nightmare
0:04:40 that that none of the other justicariot
0:04:42 wanted to acknowledge this is this is
0:04:45 the [ __ ] this is bad this is
0:04:48 this is sick i don't know that we should
0:04:50 go inside
0:04:52 we don't have a lot of choice
0:04:53 we can try and lure it out what would
0:04:56 happen if we go in there i don't know
0:04:58 but
0:05:00 there is there is blood here and she
0:05:02 motions at the pure white snow and it's
0:05:05 darker and it's sicker and it's older
0:05:07 and the house is
0:05:09 wrapped in these sickening veins
0:05:12 in order to lure something out we need
0:05:14 bait right here i don't think we're good
0:05:16 enough and we got a whole pile of
0:05:20 goons that shaw's inevitably panned to
0:05:23 come here and they're going to get here
0:05:24 if we if we if we hold up and wait and
0:05:27 try to figure out a way to lure this
0:05:28 thing out
0:05:29 i think miles is right i don't think we
0:05:31 have a choice i don't think we do either
0:05:33 but we need to know that if we go in
0:05:34 here there's a chance we're not coming
0:05:36 out and we're definitely well there's a
0:05:38 knot coming out and there's a knot
0:05:40 coming out there's a not coming out the
0:05:42 same i think
0:05:43 there's things worse than dying and
0:05:46 that's what we're looking at here
0:05:48 meal sort of appears next to everybody
0:05:50 out of the snow
0:05:51 yeah but jesus
0:05:53 someone put a [ __ ] bell on you that's
0:05:55 even if we did you wouldn't notice the
0:05:57 bell
0:05:58 when we already know it's spreading yeah
0:06:00 those things in the woods the thing
0:06:02 that's up joey
0:06:03 right
0:06:04 the weeping bear
0:06:06 no this is this is it this is
0:06:08 yeah
0:06:09 this is the infection
0:06:11 sometimes you gotta cut a cancer huh
0:06:13 miles
0:06:14 yes
0:06:15 this is a scorched earth in case we do
0:06:17 get separated in there
0:06:19 or whatever happens
0:06:21 i contacted my buddy blake
0:06:23 right he works with the uh the state
0:06:24 highway patrol i asked him to keep a
0:06:27 lookout on these main roads here so if
0:06:29 he calls your phone he's probably
0:06:31 letting you know that that they caught
0:06:33 wind of shaw's boys moving this way
0:06:35 there's only a couple of ways they can
0:06:36 drive here and i don't think they're
0:06:37 going to take a chance to take back
0:06:39 roads
0:06:40 so if if blake calls
0:06:42 he's my friend and he's giving us a
0:06:44 heads up all right right
0:06:47 when you and neil try to mitigate
0:06:49 whatever we may get from in here look i
0:06:51 don't i don't know if you can
0:06:53 do what you can
0:06:55 okay
0:06:56 that's all we're asking
0:06:58 but we have to do this for multiple
0:06:59 reasons we
0:07:01 need to be prepared to lose each other
0:07:05 we know at least a little bit what we're
0:07:07 looking at
0:07:08 can you imagine if shaw sends a
0:07:10 truckload of brujack rampaging through
0:07:12 this place yeah i can
0:07:14 let's get our gloves on neil slaps on a
0:07:16 pair of latex gloves out of his pocket
0:07:19 it just looks like this isn't going to
0:07:20 do anything
0:07:22 like it's bows and arrows against the
0:07:23 lightning but here we go like there may
0:07:26 be
0:07:27 maybe more to it than just the physical
0:07:29 objects so we'll see what happens uh-huh
0:07:32 i'm meaning in protection there's a lot
0:07:33 to be said about
0:07:35 creating barriers what i know is true
0:07:38 look
0:07:39 we got to take whatever we can get yeah
0:07:41 so put your minds in the right place
0:07:45 yeah
0:07:46 let's gear up get ready and get the job
0:07:48 done
0:07:49 wind kind of puts our hand out we have
0:07:51 each other's backs i guess we'll reach
0:07:54 out to your guys
0:07:56 hand in the circle
0:07:58 you're like juvenile
0:08:00 struggles with the latex a little bit
0:08:01 and then and then puts his and then i
0:08:03 put my hand in the middle johnny does as
0:08:05 well
0:08:06 neil with his hand in there sort of like
0:08:07 squeezes a little bit like he's he's
0:08:09 definitely nervous but trying not to
0:08:10 show it okay let's um i don't know what
0:08:14 do we say team on three or is this is
0:08:15 this just should we just go
0:08:17 just make it out alive
0:08:19 make it out of life
0:08:21 make it out alive
0:08:23 make it out ourselves make it out
0:08:25 ourselves we're going to laugh about
0:08:26 this tomorrow night
0:08:28 [ __ ] hope so
0:08:30 let's go team so the group of you
0:08:33 climb up the rest of the hill
0:08:35 when
0:08:36 the snow is
0:08:38 it smells
0:08:40 like that horrible charnel scent like
0:08:43 like a slaughterhouse that has gone
0:08:45 unclean for generations
0:08:47 wind kind of pulls a bandana up over her
0:08:50 face
0:08:51 and as you draw closer
0:08:53 i need the group of you to make stealth
0:08:55 checks
0:08:56 oh boy i'm an obvious kid you still want
0:08:58 me to make one obviously uh you're
0:09:00 cheating and a-okay
0:09:02 six
0:09:03 six successes what a solid snake three
0:09:05 successes three
0:09:12 you're you're good
0:09:14 yeah but i'd like to count how good she
0:09:16 wants the very the numeric feel good i
0:09:18 get that yeah straight up
0:09:20 all right so what happens with the
0:09:22 graceful it's a tens explode 10 is two
0:09:24 yeah
0:09:26 okay so
0:09:28 therefore i have
0:09:29 seven success uh eight
0:09:34 three
0:09:38 i don't have stealth does that take away
0:09:40 from it three was that i don't have
0:09:41 stealth it makes it plus one difficult
0:09:42 to shoot if six instead of five okay
0:09:44 that will definitely
0:09:46 actually no silly
0:09:54 so the group of you creep up and you
0:09:56 actually make it towards
0:09:59 where there's this
0:10:00 massive garden that's kind of set up all
0:10:03 of the bushes are kind of like there's
0:10:04 no no green here everything's like a
0:10:07 dried out husk uh those of you who are
0:10:10 like more woodsy such as you know win hi
0:10:13 it's probably extra carton hasn't really
0:10:16 grown in a long time
0:10:19 this is all like dead plant life that
0:10:21 was probably dead in the summer it's
0:10:23 actually also
0:10:24 extra creepy because of the snow that's
0:10:26 covering everything the crimson snow
0:10:27 that she sees
0:10:29 covering this
0:10:30 is not great
0:10:33 it is
0:10:34 it is awful it has head up the stairs
0:10:37 towards the back entrance
0:10:39 uh to to this very rather beautiful
0:10:44 huge victorian style home
0:10:46 as you
0:10:48 get up to that point there's a layer of
0:10:51 snow caked over it
0:10:53 that pretty clearly indicates that no
0:10:55 one's been through this space for a bit
0:10:57 the lights
0:10:58 are
0:10:59 not on inside
0:11:01 i will
0:11:02 heighten senses hearing is to try to see
0:11:06 if there is noise within the house so
0:11:09 you hear howling wind and as you kind of
0:11:11 get closer to the house
0:11:14 it's very quiet at least in the next
0:11:16 room over just past that that back door
0:11:20 you don't hear any sounds of movement
0:11:22 basement or main door
0:11:24 clean dark johnny wouldn't take the door
0:11:26 me and peter outside
0:11:28 i'll get up to the door
0:11:30 and i'll try and kind of look around to
0:11:32 see if i can i mean
0:11:35 i'm guessing there's probably a small
0:11:37 glass section of the window to kind of
0:11:39 look in
0:11:40 it's uh the window itself it's it's kind
0:11:42 of got that like old kind of warping
0:11:44 shaped glass yeah it itself is
0:11:48 has like stained glass work uh do you
0:11:50 have any academics i do so i do actually
0:11:53 point of academics so why don't you guys
0:11:55 give me an intelligence academic role
0:11:56 okay
0:11:59 nope one two three
0:12:01 all right
0:12:03 two successes
0:12:05 that is two successes two as well for
0:12:08 one yeah okay the stained glass is
0:12:12 definitely uh an image
0:12:15 of the archangel michael kind of
0:12:18 standing in like a pious
0:12:20 position uh beside him is like that
0:12:23 his legendary weapon is a halo over him
0:12:27 and
0:12:28 it looks like
0:12:29 someone who has a very personal interest
0:12:32 and like stained glass work actually
0:12:35 took the time to make this
0:12:37 and put it here this is not like very
0:12:39 typical of like a victorian style house
0:12:41 at all this is this is like someone's
0:12:43 like personal choice that said can i
0:12:46 have self-control um from britto really
0:12:49 quick that's correct i think it's
0:12:50 natural that johnny doesn't notice it
0:12:52 because he's the main reason he's
0:12:53 looking at the door is he's actually
0:12:54 looking over to see if he can see any
0:12:56 traps or some kind of like wire
0:13:00 give me a perception plus alertness
0:13:01 difficult to eat it's very hard to see
0:13:02 through the
0:13:03 warped glass self-control is just the
0:13:05 one virtue correct
0:13:07 and am i able to use one of my
0:13:09 willpowers yes okay i will use one of my
0:13:12 free willpowers
0:13:15 counting the one willpower one success
0:13:18 okay with one success you resist the
0:13:20 urge to
0:13:22 uh bask in its glory
0:13:25 and
0:13:26 kind of like snap out of it just enough
0:13:28 to get out of johnny's way as like you
0:13:31 kind of got up close and like started
0:13:33 taking up all of the space he needed to
0:13:35 really kind of do the research he's
0:13:36 trying to do oh no
0:13:37 trap and
0:13:40 and
0:13:42 johnny when you peek through
0:13:43 you don't see anything that really
0:13:45 stands out as like some sort of booby
0:13:48 trap waiting to
0:13:49 hurt anyone or anything of the like
0:13:52 all right i think this door might be all
0:13:54 right
0:13:55 i'll grab the handle and i'll very
0:13:57 slowly try and try to handle
0:14:02 it is locked
0:14:04 yeah
0:14:05 anyone want to give this a shot the new
0:14:06 appears next to everybody again just
0:14:08 yeah i can
0:14:09 unless my hands where are you i'm not
0:14:12 great but i know enough to get in a lock
0:14:14 box so help me out sure we just do this
0:14:16 together yeah who's willing to help him
0:14:18 you are taking charge do you want to do
0:14:20 it i'll do it okay i will roll to help
0:14:22 you okay um
0:14:25 johnny backs off to give him some space
0:14:26 neil takes a little lock picking kit out
0:14:28 of like his fanny pack you judge me
0:14:33 while they're doing that i'm guessing
0:14:34 that this probably got like a wraparound
0:14:36 porch kind of thing yeah it kind of like
0:14:38 goes right along the outside and has
0:14:41 a pretty wide space like this is not
0:14:44 a cheap home stealthily kind of like
0:14:46 creeps around just kind of like checking
0:14:48 some of the other windows to like make
0:14:50 sure we are clear on this poor spot i
0:14:54 want you to give me another perception
0:14:55 plus alertness after they're done
0:14:57 resolving what's the difficulty we're
0:14:58 looking at here the difficulty for this
0:15:00 rule is def6 okay take five extra dice
0:15:02 one nice i'm starting to think that you
0:15:04 should have left them
0:15:06 yeah me too yeah she took the lead
0:15:07 though so
0:15:08 yeah i think this works fine
0:15:10 five successes there you go
0:15:12 the two of you combined casually pop
0:15:14 this lock
0:15:15 and
0:15:16 yeah one success okay
0:15:18 uh you casually pop the lock johnny when
0:15:20 you're slipping around looking in
0:15:22 through other windows
0:15:23 the sight inside you hear something
0:15:27 before you see it and what you hear are
0:15:30 the buzzing of flies like lots and lots
0:15:33 and lots and lots of flies like like you
0:15:35 get up to the window and at first you're
0:15:37 like wow i can't i can't see anything
0:15:39 and then the
0:15:40 flies move allowing you to see into the
0:15:43 window inside kind of posted up and
0:15:46 postured like
0:15:48 like everyone's kind of gathered for
0:15:49 some sort of party
0:15:51 are these corpses some of them are just
0:15:54 mounds of rotted meat that don't even
0:15:57 look human
0:15:58 are they moving at all
0:16:00 no
0:16:01 other than the the flies collected on
0:16:04 the surface of their of them right
0:16:07 like there's tons of movement but it's
0:16:09 not coming from the bodies
0:16:11 get you guys get get yourselves ready
0:16:14 guys you might not want to be smelling
0:16:16 in there
0:16:18 turn off heightened census what john
0:16:20 johnny what's the matter there's uh
0:16:22 looks as bad on the inside huh
0:16:25 yeah
0:16:27 me
0:16:28 bodies and corpses
0:16:31 just laid out get
0:16:33 just don't uh
0:16:35 get yourself ready show me let me see
0:16:38 motion's over to come here near the
0:16:39 window
0:16:41 can i see inside yeah okay
0:16:43 hey if i um
0:16:46 i start to forget a little bit just
0:16:47 shake me okay
0:16:48 yeah and i'm going to look at this like
0:16:52 mass of bodies
0:16:54 and
0:16:55 i'm going to try and gain
0:16:57 insight into the pattern of display and
0:16:59 the flies buzzing around
0:17:00 uh through eyes of chaos and see what
0:17:03 did this
0:17:05 or get an idea of like the architect of
0:17:07 this grizzly [ __ ]
0:17:09 if it's good it'll be helpful we don't
0:17:11 actually know what vito looks like
0:17:13 give me a rule for isocast
0:17:16 always comes with a potential downside
0:17:18 of just trancing the [ __ ] out and not
0:17:20 being useful anymore
0:17:22 [Music]
0:17:23 what's the difficulty i'm looking at
0:17:24 here man the difficulty of this role is
0:17:26 eight
0:17:27 five successes okay that's my best role
0:17:30 johnny he immediately begins to freak
0:17:32 out as he starts to stagger
0:17:34 stumble back eyes wide staring at this
0:17:38 this thing and
0:17:40 for you
0:17:41 mr foster
0:17:43 what you see is like
0:17:46 the trough used to feed pigs
0:17:49 this is this isn't like uh this isn't
0:17:52 regarded as a murder scene so much as
0:17:55 is a spot for like pets to eat their
0:17:57 food
0:17:58 as you kind of open yourself up to it
0:18:01 you can feel something about this place
0:18:05 aware of you and while you look at it
0:18:09 it looks back at you and while you
0:18:13 try to comprehend this this presence
0:18:15 that is beyond the scope of your
0:18:16 imagination
0:18:18 you feel you feel his fingers wrap
0:18:20 around the back of your neck
0:18:22 and pull you
0:18:24 against the siding of the house as he
0:18:26 gets in your face
0:18:28 with me neil
0:18:30 with me with me with me
0:18:32 neil was shaking and it has nothing to
0:18:34 do with the cold
0:18:36 this
0:18:37 whatever this is in that moment
0:18:39 attempted to communicate with you not
0:18:40 through words but some sort of
0:18:42 suggestion
0:18:44 beyond such a primitive form of
0:18:47 communication
0:18:48 and what it conveys to you
0:18:50 is
0:18:51 oneness
0:18:55 and a rejection of the
0:18:57 unnecessary existence of individuality
0:19:00 when did you get that door open yeah
0:19:03 i'm sorry i'm sorry when
0:19:06 why why are you sorry i didn't really
0:19:09 understand everything that you were

0:19:33 grotesque

0:19:40 move now watch your dragon no dragon
0:19:42 fire inside right

0:19:46 moves up
0:19:48 and open the door for me
0:19:49 the door
0:19:50 unlocked now wind kind of quietly throws
0:19:53 it open
0:19:54 she pulls out
0:19:55 a knife because she doesn't intend to
0:19:57 use claws if there's mortals in here but
0:19:58 she is prepared too and she'll let
0:20:01 johnny go first when the door goes open
0:20:03 johnny will kind of rush inside not
0:20:05 loudly but just kind of like get in
0:20:07 there so that there's something right
0:20:08 behind the door he's on top of it
0:20:10 [Music]
0:20:12 the door opens for you
0:20:14 [Music]
0:20:20 place is covered in like dust
0:20:23 and
0:20:24 lumps of like
0:20:25 fat that have like coalesced like candle
0:20:28 waxing areas as you make your way in you
0:20:32 pretty
0:20:33 initially this this space
0:20:35 whatever this room was it's kind of just
0:20:38 covered in like
0:20:39 stacks of junk and things that have been
0:20:41 collected a lot of it looks to be like
0:20:43 actually like ritzy fancy clothes from
0:20:46 over the years you know like cigarettes
0:20:49 and high heels and all sorts of things
0:20:52 jewelry
0:20:54 like from a lot of different kinds of
0:20:55 people yes
0:20:57 completely freaked out as soon as no one
0:21:00 is looking at him neil disappears again
0:21:02 johnny we clear this floor and then we
0:21:04 check upstairs i have a feeling it's
0:21:05 downstairs but all right yeah me too
0:21:08 we're not getting surprised i need a
0:21:11 perception plus an investigation rule
0:21:13 you've got this area
0:21:15 which means you may not rule it unless
0:21:17 you possess the ability thankfully i
0:21:18 have investigation all right i've turned
0:21:20 the flashlight on like it's all right
0:21:22 because i can't see in the dark
0:21:25 uh difficulty uh six plus two for in the
0:21:28 dark uh well i am in the dark nope he's
0:21:30 got a flashlight perfect either way it's
0:21:32 two successes great
0:21:34 so with two successes
0:21:36 uh johnny you find yourself kind of
0:21:37 crouching down
0:21:39 and
0:21:40 down on the like the dusty floor
0:21:42 there's like smears
0:21:45 of something that's moved through here
0:21:47 more probably more than one something
0:21:49 and sometimes it kind of like puts warps
0:21:53 in the dust like a moving snake
0:21:55 other times
0:21:56 they are like
0:21:58 size 28 shoe size foot falls
0:22:03 something like
0:22:05 big and whatever it is it's so heavy
0:22:06 that you can actually see
0:22:08 like the ripples and the dust from like
0:22:11 the ground
0:22:12 jumping up in response of its footfalls
0:22:15 it's probably spots on the walls where
0:22:16 it's actually brushed up against the
0:22:18 walls and stuff too then that big it is
0:22:20 big
0:22:21 the little chandelier that's in the room
0:22:23 is like knocked down and broken apart
0:22:25 just probably from whatever it is just
0:22:27 brushing up against it jenny kind of
0:22:28 waves a hand up so everybody sees and
0:22:30 then points at the spots on the ground
0:22:33 as he kind of moves deeper in wind
0:22:35 follows closely trying to keep an eye
0:22:37 out greta follows instructions and keeps
0:22:39 an eye out for her side i'm just getting
0:22:41 left on the way through and hopefully
0:22:42 neil's providing support neil walks in
0:22:44 the rear and is just looking around
0:22:48 waiting for something to jump out at
0:22:50 them does it look like the spots on the
0:22:52 floor go into like the dining room where
0:22:54 those uh
0:22:55 corpses were yes and does it look like
0:22:58 it it leaves from a different spot or
0:23:00 does it look like it comes back through
0:23:01 this way it looks like it's come back
0:23:03 and forth on many occasions so it looks
0:23:05 like this this is it's just a trail that
0:23:07 it goes down and comes back yeah and
0:23:09 it's not necessarily like uh
0:23:11 it's not necessarily like a circuit that
0:23:13 it's walking it's just that this is this
0:23:14 thing that lumbers around this huge home
0:23:17 uh
0:23:18 as a paranoid malkavian who still has
0:23:20 heightened senses up i am looking i'm
0:23:22 actively looking for like things or
0:23:25 people or stuff neil you see it first
0:23:27 but
0:23:28 over in the dining room there's the
0:23:30 movement of a shadow and
0:23:33 something moving on three legs
0:23:36 with eyes that kind of like hang uh like
0:23:41 like uh like like hanging disgusting
0:23:43 like glands down from like around its
0:23:45 neck
0:23:46 kind of wobble and shift looking around
0:23:49 the space
0:23:50 and with like a mall that has just rows
0:23:53 and rows and rows of teeth
0:23:54 uh this thing kind of creeps into the
0:23:57 dining room area and the flies give it a
0:24:00 wide berth as it enters
0:24:02 and it begins like sniffing the air
0:24:06 it does not seem to notice in a view and
0:24:09 instead focuses attention on
0:24:12 one of these uh corpses that remain and
0:24:16 it just
0:24:17 grabs onto the leg of this woman and
0:24:19 with
0:24:20 uh terrifying ease sloths flesh from
0:24:24 bone
0:24:25 and begins to eat when it pulls the
0:24:29 flesh from bone it is not by raw force
0:24:33 that it does this but it is the way the
0:24:35 flesh reacts obedient to the creature
0:24:38 that causes it to collect its meat and
0:24:40 begin eating
0:24:42 wind kind of raises a hand and makes eye
0:24:44 contact with miles and makes a symbol
0:24:46 like shoot it
0:24:48 uh johnny i think reactively is going to
0:24:51 put an axe in the back of its skull give
0:24:53 me a dex plus stealth as you creep up
0:24:57 i'm going to give
0:24:58 did you pop your decks at all oh yeah
0:25:01 i got you one in the middle
0:25:05 i'll come i'll basically
0:25:07 i'm covering johnny
0:25:10 oof well damn dude
0:25:12 uh that is
0:25:15 eight successes i have zero uh so all of
0:25:18 those are going to go into your ambush
0:25:19 to tackle all right
0:25:21 uh and attacking from behind so it's
0:25:22 plus you guys okay
0:25:25 so you're adding 10 dice to your tackle
0:25:27 adding 10 dice to my attack roll because
0:25:30 of surprise and you're doing it from
0:25:31 behind
0:25:34 from behind rogue style yeah barbarian
0:25:37 rogues not okay not okay i'm going to
0:25:39 roll this and then i'm going to roll the
0:25:40 plus 10 dice probably oh sure if i'm if
0:25:42 i'm hitting for the head would that be a
0:25:44 cold shot can i determine what the head
0:25:46 is on this thing i mean
0:25:47 the head and the torso are so deeply
0:25:49 intertwined with another that's fine
0:25:55 you're um for sixes okay so one two
0:25:58 three six successes
0:26:04 uh nine
0:26:05 three ones on that one
0:26:08 nine successes nine successes okay eight
0:26:10 will roll over into damage
0:26:12 should have given him an accident and an
0:26:13 axe is three damage
0:26:16 yes sir
0:26:17 comfortable straight rubber grip you get
0:26:19 your uh celerity for your attack right
0:26:22 matt black no i did not
0:26:25 and the two more ones
0:26:29 so that'll be uh
0:26:31 seven thanks alex
0:26:33 i thought i was helping
0:26:36 you're asking garrett to roll more dice
0:26:38 you're not helping
0:26:40 so you're looking at 10 plus whatever
0:26:41 your strength is yeah strength four
0:26:43 potents
0:26:45 plus three for the axe i mean if you're
0:26:47 straight up trying to mark this thing
0:26:48 you might want to think about using that
0:26:49 pose ability right or did you already
0:26:51 roll the dice yeah or the dice will why
0:26:55 isn't that the one where you just
0:26:56 straight all right successes for damage
0:26:58 i thought you i think you're just
0:26:59 rolling extra dice with bones unless you
0:27:01 spent a point of blood and making
0:27:02 automatic successes instead oh really
0:27:04 yeah oh
0:27:07 [Music]
0:27:09 so seven successes okay
0:27:13 you crack and it makes the loud snap
0:27:16 that like an axe going into like
0:27:18 chopped wood makes
0:27:20 and the thing shudders
0:27:23 in pain and lets out a sound that's kind
0:27:27 of something like uh
0:27:29 the squeal of a pig but significantly
0:27:32 more menacing and uh you begin to go
0:27:35 into rounds give me an initiative
0:27:43 oh my trash is still at 15. neil what'd
0:27:46 you get i got a one i'm a 16.
0:27:49 miles 16. win 12.
0:27:51 12. johnny 15.
0:27:54 monster's on 14.
0:27:55 neil miles do you guys care who goes
0:27:57 first i don't let miles do it i'm not
0:27:58 gonna be helping very much miles uh so
0:28:01 that made a really loud noise
0:28:03 yes okay cool i guess we're shooting
0:28:08 six successes jesus five carryover
0:28:10 damage
0:28:12 what are you shooting with assault rifle
0:28:14 yeah
0:28:23 that'll be six
0:28:25 oh boy you put a round in it let's turn
0:28:28 another squeal
0:28:29 and staggers looking around realizing
0:28:31 now that it's there's it's got more than
0:28:33 one opponent to deal with and uh then
0:28:35 we're gonna go right on to neil this
0:28:37 thing's in the dining room this is like
0:28:38 one of those old victorian houses
0:28:40 so i'm gonna stay in the hallway outside
0:28:43 the dining room my back against the wall
0:28:45 and obvious gate and hold in action in
0:28:47 case something else like comes down the
0:28:49 stairs into the hall or out of the
0:28:51 living room when you put your back to
0:28:52 the wall give me a perception plus
0:28:54 alertness jesus
0:28:58 okay
0:29:00 that seems bad what's the normal
0:29:01 difficulty on this the normal difficulty
0:29:04 on this is going to be
0:29:06 eight eight so it's a five yes
0:29:11 lex i need to know a thing that win
0:29:13 might know
0:29:15 does any of the intelligence gathered on
0:29:17 mr santosa indicate that this thing
0:29:20 could be mr santosa it's unclear what
0:29:23 this thing was before
0:29:25 but whatever it is it probably isn't
0:29:27 making sneaky side deals with shaw
0:29:31 uh three looks can be deceiving yeah
0:29:34 three successes okay so with three
0:29:36 successes as you kind of put your back
0:29:38 to the wall you can feel the vibrations
0:29:41 of
0:29:42 a lot of little things coming from the
0:29:44 other room can i who's next like who's
0:29:47 nearest to me
0:29:49 can i
0:29:50 like whisper to britain or something
0:29:52 something without breaking you have
0:29:53 advantage to the mind's eye yes [ __ ] all
0:29:55 right
0:29:57 all right um
0:30:01 if something's coming from that room i'm
0:30:02 still
0:30:03 british someone's come behind us and i'm
0:30:05 gonna just break out they're just gonna
0:30:06 appear like something's coming from from
0:30:08 in there a lot of little stuff and i'm
0:30:10 gonna
0:30:10 post up with a shotgun aimed at that
0:30:12 door and for when you know it's a lot of
0:30:14 little things maybe a shotgun will help
0:30:16 and wait until stuff shows up by the way
0:30:19 because i'm holding a shotgun attack i'm
0:30:21 dropping hiding senses
0:30:24 like
0:30:26 johnny i still have it's back correct
0:30:28 yep
0:30:29 let's try and
0:30:31 put this thing down
0:30:36 three successes
0:30:38 [Music]
0:30:39 two carry over to damage
0:30:43 [Music]
0:30:45 thankfully
0:30:47 that's three tens that's six seven
0:30:49 damage
0:30:51 with a resounding blow johnny comes down
0:30:53 with the axe and
0:30:55 this thing begins to spasm
0:30:58 slump to the ground and just twitch
0:31:01 every now and again when is this thing
0:31:03 dead or dying uh it is
0:31:06 on the ground eyes eyes
0:31:08 kind of
0:31:10 cease to move and it's twitching in that
0:31:12 case i'm going to wait and see if more
0:31:13 monsters show up
0:31:15 which room did he say out of game it's
0:31:17 probably a sitting room the the sitting
0:31:19 room like across the hall from the
0:31:21 dining room do i have a sniper rifle
0:31:23 which which gun did you give me for this
0:31:25 sniper rifle is no good here yeah should
0:31:27 probably take an assault rifle okay
0:31:29 redirect my gun towards that area more
0:31:32 in the group that that's where that's
0:31:34 coming from okay
0:31:35 sitting room
0:31:37 on
0:31:39 10
0:31:40 14
0:31:41 of these things uh no larger than the
0:31:44 size of a soccer ball still pretty large
0:31:47 begin
0:31:48 crawling in
0:31:50 a number of them have what looks to be
0:31:52 human intestines attached to them and
0:31:56 their legs while spindly are clearly
0:31:58 made from bone probably ribs
0:32:00 as they click
0:32:03 along the ground and walls headed into
0:32:06 the room looking for
0:32:07 signs of trouble
0:32:09 horrible little ticks made of human
0:32:11 pieces
0:32:12 yes cool if you had held actions yes uh
0:32:16 you may take them as soon as they show
0:32:18 up i'm just gonna fire with a shotgun
0:32:20 into the area that they are i'm on their
0:32:22 flank uh actually these things do not
0:32:24 have um the
0:32:26 orientation
0:32:29 all right
0:32:33 okay four successes okay
0:32:37 so four successes four damage
0:32:39 wave uh you open up and they keep moving
0:32:43 um
0:32:45 uh
0:32:46 um
0:32:47 this sort of just hits this bone
0:32:48 carapace scram and
0:32:51 these things made from like
0:32:53 femurs and rib cages and skulls and just
0:32:58 bone and meat uh harvested from humans
0:33:02 they just continue rushing in and it is
0:33:05 a lot
0:33:06 uh i scramble backwards a little bit as
0:33:09 much as i can and why don't we go
0:33:12 to win gonna split my action to take
0:33:15 swipes got it
0:33:18 first swing uh one success hit okay
0:33:22 one success okay uh one of them
0:33:25 splats
0:33:26 as your hand goes right into a rib cage
0:33:29 and you feel like brain matter and a
0:33:32 beating heart oh
0:33:34 it's the heart that did it yeah i try
0:33:36 not to feel that as i gear up for the
0:33:38 next swipe
0:33:41 uh one success to hit
0:33:44 okay
0:33:47 uh three successes for damage okay next
0:33:49 one dead
0:33:50 if you win
0:33:52 i don't know if you're familiar with
0:33:53 that you can hit a number of people in
0:33:55 an area with your gun you empty your
0:33:57 clip but you get 10 extra dice oh plus
0:34:00 two difficulty i assume you would have
0:34:01 given me additional ammo yeah
0:34:04 well i like to ask you since you're the
0:34:05 one uh supplementing oh you're my child
0:34:07 you've not insulted me so
0:34:10 look
0:34:11 okay
0:34:12 that sounds i will not ignore this one
0:34:15 go nuts
0:34:16 okay i'm gonna be honest i i did not
0:34:18 expect for the oh i have the perfect
0:34:20 amount of [ __ ] one of the come back
0:34:21 here
0:34:22 yeah yeah exactly whatever it's meant to
0:34:23 be
0:34:25 well celerity plus secret firearms
0:34:27 background you know i don't have the
0:34:28 perfect amount of though it's hands
0:34:30 [Music]
0:34:32 you look like you're
0:34:45 wow use the bucket i'm just going to
0:34:48 drop it because i can't really shuffle
0:34:51 i'm just looking i'm just looking
0:34:53 i'm impressed about your dice rolling
0:34:56 okay sort of like that's what it looks
0:34:58 like to be good at rolling dice okay so
0:35:00 this is six successes how would you like
0:35:03 to divide up those successes amongst uh
0:35:06 the 12 remaining targets you can do one
0:35:08 each and hit six of them you can stack
0:35:11 it all on one yeah let's uh let's risk
0:35:14 it six uh one for six okay we're gonna
0:35:16 do this uh a little simplified okay uh
0:35:18 you're gonna give me one damage roll i'm
0:35:20 gonna give one silk roll and we're gonna
0:35:21 apply it across the board okay
0:35:25 three success uh you killed six more
0:35:27 jesus
0:35:28 they scurry and screech but the screech
0:35:31 isn't like like the sound of vocal cords
0:35:34 it's like
0:35:35 air being pressed through like these
0:35:37 small like holes that they breathe
0:35:39 through
0:35:41 also it is super [ __ ] loud like a
0:35:44 full automatic fire inside indoors is no

0:37:59 to tell you
0:38:00 they are meant for you
0:38:03 they've waited over a decade for you

0:38:06 appreciation they've been working
0:38:08 since what 2006 2005 i got those
0:38:13 15 years they've waited 15 years
0:38:16 for you
0:38:27 uh eight okay eight or dead uh

0:38:34 can
0:38:35 add two successes to two of them
0:38:38 two dice two dice that's what i mean
0:38:42 one ones are killer

0:38:51 sorry miles brother still gets to be the
0:38:52 coolest
0:38:55 oh my god rebecca are you okay
0:39:00 basking that's what's happening over
0:39:02 there
0:39:04 everyone can hear it we laugh because
0:39:06 this is extremely tense i feel so
0:39:08 terrible for your blushing
0:39:11 she's got blush of health it's fine
0:39:15 she's just messing as [ __ ] the internet
0:39:17 can't hear how how much she's blushing
0:39:23 it's not basking if you don't enjoy it i
0:39:25 feel like they are fully aware yeah is
0:39:27 it is it basking if we're doing it
0:39:31 i think this is a very different target
0:39:32 for that word
0:39:34 hey man i'm on your own are they rolling
0:39:35 soak on that one by the way three one
0:39:37 one
0:39:38 i had two ones ugh yep
0:39:43 these up armored critters
0:39:45 you know obviously we wanted them all to
0:39:47 die because
0:39:48 they haven't gotten to act yet and i
0:39:50 don't want them to yep
0:39:51 because if you are correct and these are
0:39:53 giant ticks with human parts i can guess
0:39:55 what they're going to do
0:39:57 johnny
0:39:59 uh he's going to try and axe two of them
0:40:01 a question
0:40:02 get out of here
0:40:05 when did shaw get here oh my god
0:40:07 gareth's been playing shop the whole
0:40:08 time
0:40:12 um
0:40:13 look there's a sweet mechanic i'm like
0:40:14 oh wait now that's different here it was
0:40:16 me close his face over like i stopped
0:40:17 understanding your plan i don't know why
0:40:19 you're here wait shaw has had
0:40:20 vicissitude this entire time
0:40:27 two successes on the first attack
0:40:29 that's not a thing we need and two
0:40:31 successes on the second attack boom get
0:40:33 him get him jenny
0:40:37 oh there's them ones coming again two
0:40:39 successes on the
0:40:41 first damage swing
0:40:44 two successes on the second damage swing
0:40:48 dead dead so we got four more of these
0:40:50 things when you split them like it kind
0:40:52 of like cracks open like a coconut
0:40:55 and again you just see like
0:40:57 parts of people this time there's like
0:41:00 teeth and like a tongue
0:41:02 hey johnny johnny uh i got a savannah
0:41:05 absolutely
0:41:07 oh boy um so we're looking at
0:41:08 intelligence plus lore
0:41:10 it's only three dice
0:41:13 but i got two successes nice
0:41:15 when this is a suit is used there are
0:41:18 kind of telltale signs of it it's an art
0:41:21 it's crafted the wave is so like melded
0:41:24 together it looks like this just
0:41:26 happened like this is just like
0:41:28 droppings of something like lumps of
0:41:30 meat kind of fall less into a thing and
0:41:33 like took off like something horrible is
0:41:35 like just like shedding and these are
0:41:37 the things that are falling off of it or
0:41:39 something yeah yeah
0:41:41 johnny grits his teeth as he chops the
0:41:43 two in half how many of these things are
0:41:45 there there's four left yes i'm gonna
0:41:48 take a swing with one hand first at one
0:41:51 of the
0:41:53 three successes damage plus you does
0:41:58 five successes yeah second swing
0:42:02 uh no successes okay ready i believe i
0:42:04 have to put more ammo in i'm gonna say
0:42:06 you have three mags total three besides
0:42:08 the one that came with the guns or three
0:42:10 banks actually it's got the one magazine
0:42:12 and two extra do you have a sidearm on
0:42:14 you was i provided one i have one so i
0:42:16 imagine you do is that also a split
0:42:18 action because you're drawing your draw
0:42:19 you shoot well you don't have to rule
0:42:21 the draw okay then i will use my sidearm
0:42:24 give me dex plus
0:42:26 celerity plus firearms divided by two
0:42:30 yeah i whiffed on the second one
0:42:33 three success to carry over into damage
0:42:38 five successes
0:42:43 so good another one guys a bit of blood
0:42:44 squirting up into the ceiling and it
0:42:47 just falls limp two of them remain and
0:42:49 those remaining two will will take a
0:42:52 bite action
0:42:53 one on johnny not one on a win
0:42:59 i'm going to use one of my celerity
0:43:01 actions to dodge
0:43:02 [Music]
0:43:04 four successes
0:43:07 it leaps at you you weave out of the way
0:43:09 it just clings to the wall beside you
0:43:12 acts right up above mandibles and teeth
0:43:15 kind of like opening up into this like a
0:43:16 little mouth it's probably not that
0:43:18 little if it's the size of a soccer ball
0:43:20 well i mean yeah it's about like a
0:43:21 human-sized mouth like a tent yeah no
0:43:24 not at all like a cat
0:43:28 these are
0:43:29 cats imagined by h.r geiger
0:43:33 john carpenter's the cat
0:43:36 when yo it whiffs hot wes has celerity
0:43:40 actions i don't believe i have because i
0:43:41 didn't declare it johnny time to put in
0:43:43 some work
0:43:44 how many celebrity actions do you have
0:43:46 remaining this is the last one so the
0:43:47 one that tried to ju uh to bite me i
0:43:49 jumped out of the way and put an axe
0:43:52 into it instead johnny really was meant
0:43:54 to wield an axe
0:43:56 yeah
0:43:57 absolutely i'm not black axe colors are
0:43:59 important damn it
0:44:02 uh two successes okay uh one's gonna
0:44:04 carry over into damage give me a roll
0:44:08 actually unless unless swift counts here
0:44:10 yeah you've hit it with the quick let's
0:44:11 go oh no that would be uh four successes
0:44:15 so three carry over yeah
0:44:17 uh four successes dead uh one remains
0:44:21 neil i'm gonna dive into a coat closet
0:44:23 first can be careful yep
0:44:27 nope nope exact same role you
0:44:30 rush off into the next room the parlor
0:44:33 path go to the parlor you slam the door
0:44:35 shut behind you and
0:44:37 you would uh you
0:44:39 immediately realize that you're not
0:44:41 alone and
0:44:42 quickly with like a half smoked
0:44:45 cigarette at his mouth uh the sides of
0:44:47 his hair kind of like cut short and like
0:44:51 hair up top like just greased and gelled
0:44:54 back is this
0:44:56 man with like a pencil mustache
0:44:58 uh very very pale skin he's wearing like
0:45:02 like a little bit of like a large collar
0:45:04 button-down shirt and his sleeves are
0:45:07 rolled up and he's quickly shoving
0:45:10 these documents into like uh something
0:45:13 akin to like a messenger bag like a
0:45:14 backpack he has he like stops seeing you
0:45:16 when you see him
0:45:19 don't worry i i think we're safe in here
0:45:22 he uses dread gaze
0:45:28 but nice try
0:45:32 it just you like
0:45:34 bear he's like it makes a hissing noise
0:45:36 he does not have fangs and it tries to
0:45:39 force you to flee yes that's about right
0:45:42 yeah he'll spend a point of willpower
0:45:43 i'm sure he will
0:45:47 uh that is five successes yep plus one
0:45:50 six successes on the dread case cool
0:45:55 this is a bad place for neil
0:45:57 i run into the room he is using solarity
0:45:59 and has one additional action this run
0:46:01 once the target loses enough dice that
0:46:03 he cannot perform any action he's so
0:46:04 shaken and terrified that he curls up on
0:46:06 the ground and weeps well i'm not there
0:46:07 yet
0:46:09 but
0:46:12 deal so neil runs and terror into the
0:46:15 parlor slams the door and then
0:46:17 immediately tries to turn around and run
0:46:19 and terror back into the hallway
0:46:21 well yeah
0:46:22 plays in the background
0:46:24 oh boy oh boy
0:46:28 oh neil all right so
0:46:31 we'll laugh because we're all gonna
0:46:33 that's me

0:46:36 so i get back in the office i move
0:46:38 towards the last tick let the
0:46:41 the gun drop on the sling draw the
0:46:42 katana and attack and go brita after
0:46:45 kneel
0:46:48 four successes
0:46:50 give me damage how many days did you
0:46:52 roll four
0:46:58 you slice clean through like the rib
0:47:01 cage legs the little soccer ball sits
0:47:04 there for a second and then two halves
0:47:05 right apart anime style
0:47:08 i'm intending to go after him as well
0:47:10 you both can get to the door yeah i just
0:47:12 need a check for you to open up the uh
0:47:14 to reload okay my plan is to run to the
0:47:17 door and open it so you can shoot okay
0:47:19 if you want to not we'll have the she
0:47:21 won't have the she doesn't have the
0:47:22 action okay
0:47:23 you know what i still have bullets in
0:47:25 the handgun though right yes okay then i
0:47:27 will just full out run there i will not
0:47:29 split my action okay reload you were
0:47:31 going to form the initiative yeah so

0:47:44 celerity action
0:47:45 and then we should be good for next
0:47:47 round basically once everyone's back in
0:47:50 so
0:47:54 two successes to hit he rushes through
0:47:57 and the two of you see this he dips
0:48:01 his fingers
0:48:02 into
0:48:04 neal's back and presses his ribcages up
0:48:08 through his heart and a fountain of
0:48:11 blood bursts out of neal's chest onto
0:48:14 the two of you kneel lose half your
0:48:17 blood jesus i johnny actually didn't
0:48:19 take his action yet so he'd probably
0:48:20 just have moved with them you can move
0:48:23 with them just fine so he's with he's
0:48:24 with them when he sees that uh round it
0:48:26 up or down i've got five left run up so
0:48:28 i'm losing three then plus one for
0:48:30 bonecraft
0:48:36 uh he is dealing six levels of lethal
0:48:39 damage okay well here's the two dice
0:48:42 uh well i will take all of that damage

0:48:59 speak
0:49:01 god damn it
0:49:02 all that free willpower all that free
0:49:04 will power
0:49:06 like this this is the place it's 100 of
0:49:08 the places we use it well
0:49:10 the first time i've used this ability in
0:49:11 combat give me a minute huh what were
0:49:13 you suggesting
0:49:14 i've got four [ __ ] free willpower for
0:49:15 those courage checks yeah
0:49:17 one free success is all he needs
0:49:19 as long as he doesn't watch the role i'm
0:49:21 an idiot all right well this is what i
0:49:23 get my blood exploding out of my chest
0:49:25 sorry
0:49:27 what happens when you use blood magic
0:49:29 shut up
0:49:30 buddy not the tie
0:49:33 just saying okay
0:49:35 so i'm gonna go ahead and say that
0:49:37 wind's gonna need a frenzy jacket neil
0:49:38 lets out a gurgling scream i yeah
0:49:41 something like that two of you are just
0:49:43 three of you are just doused in your
0:49:45 friend's blood
0:49:46 i need friendship checks from all three
0:49:48 of you yep what's that real self-control
0:49:50 self-control uh diff six for the two of
0:49:52 you
0:49:53 eight for your boy johnny um i'm gonna
0:49:55 spend one of those free willpowers
0:50:11 i'm gonna test for longer frenzy your
0:50:12 cap that two dice three one one
0:50:15 all right
0:50:17 living dangerously yeah
0:50:20 now that i remembered and i'm not a
0:50:21 complete idiot i'm gonna spend one of my
0:50:23 [ __ ] willpower and i'm gonna for my
0:50:26 hunger frenzy
0:50:28 to success all right
0:50:29 actually next round vetoes on 17. oh
0:50:32 [ __ ] off that guy
0:50:34 that is after prepping three additional
0:50:36 actions this round
0:50:38 johnny yeah no you have claws yeah i do
0:50:42 uh he will uncage the ravenous beast on
0:50:44 you he is there making a social against
0:50:46 your willpower okay
0:50:50 current or total uh your actual
0:50:52 permanent rating uh i have six uh seven
0:50:55 willpower okay spider-man
0:50:57 fly
0:50:58 seven successes
0:51:00 okay
0:51:02 so
0:51:04 covered in blood the group of you
0:51:05 managed to maintain control just long
0:51:07 enough and then veto looks at you and
0:51:11 sends his beast into your body but his
0:51:13 beast is not like that of a regular
0:51:17 kindred because his is mutated with
0:51:20 vicissitude and as it enters you your
0:51:23 body begins to twist
0:51:25 and you begin to stand much taller than
0:51:28 you have as you start to black out as
0:51:30 this whatever this is in you seizes
0:51:31 control you'll immediately assume the
0:51:33 horde form and you want a berserk frenzy
0:51:36 um can i say one thing before it takes
0:51:38 over me yep
0:51:39 run
0:51:40 so what this does you receive a plus
0:51:42 three bonus to all of your physical
0:51:44 attributes
0:51:45 and uh your bowling attacks deal an
0:51:47 automatic extra level of damage hey guys
0:51:49 remember in the test combat before we
0:51:51 started recording when i got killed by a
0:51:53 party member because of stupid fist [ __ ]
0:51:55 yeah
0:51:56 believe me it's been flashing through my
0:51:58 head the whole time we are randomly
0:52:00 going to be determining who the target
0:52:02 of your frenzy is veto
0:52:04 is a viable target so it's gonna be
0:52:07 one two
0:52:09 three four because they're at your
0:52:10 flanks
0:52:12 five six seven eight nine ten roll the
0:52:14 d10 can i spend any amount of willpower
0:52:17 to narrow that field down because i was
0:52:19 looking at veto no okay rebecca blow on
0:52:21 this
0:52:22 thank you
0:52:24 that was a different instruction
0:52:29 [Applause]
0:52:31 what are you going on right now 15.
0:52:34 can i spell one of my slurry actions to
0:52:35 interpose she comes after me what's that
0:52:37 can i spend one of my celebrity actions
0:52:39 to interpret i'm gonna run away so she
0:52:40 comes after me dude you have a person's
0:52:42 hands on you he took him out because he
0:52:44 pointed at her she didn't point no he
0:52:46 glared oh so you can point with your
0:52:48 hands in a person yeah
0:52:50 you can use your hands
0:52:52 well i'm gonna try and run away anyways
0:52:53 that's fair that's fair
0:52:56 i
0:52:56 that was his 17 yeah we are on 16 right
0:52:59 now yeah that's me and miles
0:53:01 you made a terrible mistake coming here
0:53:04 and now you will die so his hands are
0:53:06 inside me i can't run away here right
0:53:08 what is that i can't just run away he
0:53:10 doesn't really have you grappled you can
0:53:11 just step forward in to win your
0:53:14 situation's not great no
0:53:17 just letting you know basically i have
0:53:18 plenty of use here he does not actually
0:53:20 have you grappled
0:53:22 him down what there's no places for me
0:53:23 to duck and hide so i'm going to get out
0:53:25 of a break
0:53:26 like within a few steps right uh you're
0:53:28 in a parlor so you can jump behind the
0:53:30 bar and like could i get there before
0:53:32 win axe that's my question that's your
0:53:33 action yes okay then i'm going to just
0:53:35 pull myself in a very bad situation yeah
0:53:38 i'm going to pull myself off of his
0:53:39 hands and just like dive over the bar
0:53:43 and
0:53:44 huddle in terror and hopefully disappear
0:53:48 okay if i can get off his hands i don't
0:53:50 know how easy they are yeah i don't
0:53:51 think he actually has what i do need
0:53:53 is a dex plus athletics rule
0:53:56 oh no wait
0:53:58 what's your dipole for that minus six
0:54:00 you spend [ __ ] minus
0:54:04 and then minus six yeah so here's that
0:54:05 minus 11 dice so you can't do anything
0:54:07 so i can't do it unless i unless cam
0:54:09 spending will power a lot of success
0:54:11 counts as anything can you walk around
0:54:12 can you like as long as you don't have
0:54:14 to make a deathletics world is there any
0:54:16 way i can get there without having to
0:54:18 make a rollie detent higher look
0:54:20 boy
0:54:22 because otherwise you try to take vault
0:54:24 it and you just fall down i'm just gonna
0:54:25 yeah yeah just run your shots
0:54:27 cool so the answer is no
0:54:29 uh
0:54:30 does blowing a willpower
0:54:33 let me get over the thing
0:54:35 we saw this more do not take that as uh
0:54:38 no it works no i totally get it i
0:54:40 totally get it
0:54:42 do you want me to blow multiple
0:54:43 willpower to be able to do this actually
0:54:45 how does uh penalties work
0:54:47 when you are
0:54:48 is there luck die in this or no because
0:54:49 in like new wad when your uh pool is
0:54:51 reduced below zero you can still roll a
0:54:53 single d10 yeah you know
0:54:55 there's no role in this you just don't
0:54:56 really gotcha and dread gaze also
0:54:58 specific yeah if you think straight up
0:55:00 says if you're if you don't have a nice
0:55:02 pool you don't do anything you just kill
0:55:04 him
0:55:04 it's good that you didn't spend those
0:55:06 previous willpower you needed them sort
0:55:08 of except we wouldn't be in this
0:55:09 situation if i had [ __ ] remember
0:55:12 you needed all right i blow three
0:55:13 willpower to like clamber over and hide
0:55:18 and just silently weep one two three
0:55:21 four five six
0:55:23 seven eight nine ten rolly d10
0:55:26 five okay johnny is your target now um
0:55:28 i'm going to move into that room yep
0:55:31 pull myself between her and him and be
0:55:33 like still
0:55:35 and so you get between win and johnny
0:55:37 right and then you well basically
0:55:38 between winning everyone you meet her
0:55:40 monstrous eyes yep
0:55:42 there's still something in there you
0:55:44 know um i'm also instead of the seagull
0:55:46 color yep
0:55:50 okay neil no
0:55:51 he predicted this two successes
0:55:55 that's two rounds that is two rounds win
0:55:58 yeah on your action on 15 you remain
0:56:00 still johnny hit him real hard
0:56:03 at this point [ __ ] kill him i don't
0:56:05 care this [ __ ] can't keep happening like
0:56:07 it basically is like hit him with
0:56:08 everything i don't know
0:56:11 this is bad
0:56:12 cut this [ __ ]
0:56:14 yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna lay him out
0:56:15 with a haymaker um i'm gonna spend for
0:56:18 potence so the potents will be auto
0:56:19 successes
0:56:21 don't do it you don't understand what
0:56:22 you're messing with
0:56:26 he didn't understand he's like real hard
0:56:28 until the axe comes up he's like no no
0:56:29 no
0:56:33 hey maker so he's just winding back a
0:56:35 meaty brewhof uh four successes okay
0:56:38 he'll dodge
0:56:39 [Music]
0:56:40 he burns his celerity action yep
0:56:43 one two three four five
0:56:46 weaves out of the way are you kidding me
0:56:49 you don't want to know what happens if
0:56:51 i'm not here to feed it
0:56:54 change my friend back and i'll let you
0:56:56 live this is who she is now
0:56:59 brother i think i'm doing the dumb thing
0:57:01 i'm gonna try to entrance him
0:57:03 okay
0:57:04 what do you say if you'll work with us
0:57:07 maybe we can prevent whatever happens
0:57:10 when you're not here we can work
0:57:12 together on this all right give me a
0:57:14 roll doe-eyed is uh exploding tense
0:57:17 correct
0:57:21 yeah she needs another person uh so his
0:57:24 current parting is a five yeah
0:57:27 what's the difficulty
0:57:29 uh div six uh three successes plus plus
0:57:32 one more from the ball so four okay so
0:57:34 you're one off okay so
0:57:37 i'll take care of that
0:57:39 it was real close
0:57:41 there's a lot of ones in that role
0:57:44 that's eight right miscounting that what
0:57:46 that's eight
0:57:48 how long is that well the five is the
0:57:51 math five is a year so what do you
0:57:55 okay so what's what's vito do
0:57:57 he kind of like
0:57:59 nods
0:58:00 like quickly he gets whammy to really
0:58:02 yeah
0:58:04 the thing that is underneath this place
0:58:06 is
0:58:07 dangerous
0:58:08 ancient
0:58:10 it is born the shard of what
0:58:12 my family brought here long ago
0:58:14 it must feed or they will pursue flesh
0:58:18 how often must it feed
0:58:24 this is your last frozen turn right yep
0:58:27 i'm watching this could go back this
0:58:28 could go wrong again real fast
0:58:31 i'm i'm holding essentially and i'm like
0:58:33 there with like the katana prep and like
0:58:37 i spend one to just engage in the role
0:58:39 right yeah okay and i'm spending another
0:58:41 one for an auto success
0:58:43 [Music]
0:58:44 that's good one success
0:58:47 [Music]
0:58:52 when vito the one responsible for this
0:58:54 hideous transformation you've undergone
0:58:57 gives you this
0:58:59 this look uh of of regret but you get
0:59:02 the sense that it's not regret because
0:59:03 he sees you as a person right it is
0:59:06 regret that he has offended brita
0:59:09 and
0:59:10 he calls his beast back from you however
0:59:13 just as you think that this is the end
0:59:15 of
0:59:16 of what you are experiencing you don't
0:59:19 leave hoarded form now mechanically
0:59:22 every night you are going to lose one
0:59:25 from your strength decks and stamina the
0:59:27 bonus the plus three
0:59:29 when all of the bonus is gone
0:59:31 you will have left horde for him okay
0:59:34 until then you cannot shift out of horde
0:59:36 form oh god when she shifts in the horde
0:59:39 form did that like tear all her clothes
0:59:42 and stuff yeah so she's got the rags
0:59:44 like of of what she was wearing like on
0:59:47 her yeah and she's just this this gray
0:59:50 uh gray-skinned monster that looms and
0:59:55 has arms that are longer than they
0:59:56 should be long talons at the end bone
0:59:59 spurs down her back rows and rows of
1:00:02 like saliva soaked teeth she's just this
1:00:06 brutal
1:00:07 monster
1:00:08 can i talk not easily but yes you are
1:00:11 capable of you're capable of some vague
1:00:12 communication okay i
1:00:14 reach out a hand and i grab him
1:00:17 oh he would like to dodge that
1:00:20 give me a tackle remember you have plus
1:00:22 three guys nope i don't know if she's
1:00:24 better i'm stopping as my held action
1:00:26 was to dominate her if she tried to move
1:00:28 oh yep all right
1:00:32 six successes it's just still not six
1:00:35 rounds it doesn't mean you can't talk
1:00:38 i'm fine but [ __ ] him

1:08:07 rifle on him she opens fire directly
1:08:10 into his back
1:08:11 bullet exit wounds
