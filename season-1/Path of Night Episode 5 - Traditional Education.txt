0:00:00 path of night is an actual play vampire
0:00:02 the masquerade podcast set in the
0:00:03 classic world of darkness we're all
0:00:05 friends we're here to have fun but our
0:00:07 story can include graphic violence drug
0:00:08 use sexual content and other mature
0:00:10 themes we've talked at our table about
0:00:12 safety comfort and consent both as
0:00:14 players and storytellers we know what to
0:00:16 expect we're all excited to be here and
0:00:18 we want you to feel the same so listener
0:00:20 discretion is advised
0:00:22 now let's walk the path of night
0:00:26 last time on path of night engaging
0:00:29 miles in a car chase through the streets
0:00:30 of new haven the followers of sat
0:00:32 attempted to assassinate their venture
0:00:34 enemy
0:00:35 thanks to johnny and wynn along with
0:00:37 brita's disturbing proficiency with a
0:00:39 gun the satites were foiled
0:00:41 the quartering managed to maintain the
0:00:43 masquerade despite all of the mayhem
0:00:45 while neil tied up loose ends with a
0:00:47 straggler among the sethites
0:00:49 wary and drenched in blood the corduroy
0:00:51 finally made its way to miles haven
0:00:55 so
0:00:56 miles we're going to pick up at your
0:00:58 haven can you give us a quick
0:00:59 description as to what that looks like
0:01:01 yeah it's a
0:01:03 converted brownstone which is basically
0:01:06 brought the property next to it it's
0:01:08 surrounded by
0:01:10 trees and shrubs giving it cover from
0:01:12 visibility uh all around it uh wrought
0:01:15 iron fence and stuff to keep things out
0:01:17 great so the group of you pull in
0:01:19 and the quarter starts to regroup as
0:01:22 they head in what's it like inside is a
0:01:24 very open floor plan it's a kind of a
0:01:26 mix of modern and antiques over the
0:01:28 place the dining room the the living
0:01:30 room the kitchen is all visible from as
0:01:32 soon as you enter in all right oh i
0:01:34 gotta i always gotta give it to you man
0:01:36 your house is really nice
0:01:39 it's really clean like shockingly clean
0:01:42 well you know it's presentation is a big
0:01:44 part of this before she gets inside wynn
0:01:47 uh stands outside and unlaces her boots
0:01:49 and rolls up the cuffs of her pants just
0:01:51 to make sure she doesn't track anything
0:01:52 in do you have a shower i can run to
0:01:55 real quick yes there's
0:01:57 appropriate showers in the basement for
0:02:00 you okay um
0:02:02 johnny you might
0:02:03 i mean you can take turns but
0:02:05 i think we all might need um
0:02:08 there's a lot of blood between all of us
0:02:11 yes
0:02:11 uh marco should be
0:02:14 coming along he's been prepared and we
0:02:16 should be able to start getting all
0:02:17 situated so that we can have a nice
0:02:19 relaxing talk almost on cue you guys can
0:02:22 hear the footfalls of an individual
0:02:24 heading downstairs
0:02:26 your retainer approaches the quartering
0:02:28 miles and
0:02:30 it seems that the group of your friends
0:02:32 have been through quite a night yeah
0:02:34 marcos we're gonna need a little bit of
0:02:35 uh
0:02:36 some clothes some cleaning up it looks
0:02:38 like uh we had an unfortunate
0:02:40 meet up with some separates
0:02:43 looks amongst the group of you ah
0:02:45 the settights again yes
0:02:47 very well i'll see to this right away
0:02:49 so you want to explain how you got in
0:02:52 this bad with the settings you guys
0:02:55 wondering after showers i mean or is
0:02:57 that going to be another tomorrow night
0:02:58 problem no no we can talk about it now
0:03:00 it's very
0:03:02 very
0:03:03 in two things going on because i feel
0:03:05 like based on what we just heard about
0:03:08 nosferatu and this particular attack
0:03:11 then norford now for it
0:03:15 whatever they want to call themselves
0:03:17 johnny kind of cracks a smile i'm sorry
0:03:20 but
0:03:20 those were sedites are they vamp i mean
0:03:23 um kindred like us
0:03:25 yes and no
0:03:27 cold call them vampires it's fine just
0:03:29 be careful because the the older types
0:03:31 in the camarilla get a little bit snotty
0:03:33 when you use those terms you can use
0:03:35 that word with us yeah that's what i was
0:03:37 going to say you can you can say it
0:03:38 around us it's fine but
0:03:40 you might want to get in the habit of
0:03:41 saying kindred yeah it's a good habit
0:03:44 it's a good idea they are a particular
0:03:47 type of kindred that is
0:03:49 more snake themed in a sense what do you
0:03:53 mean by
0:03:54 snake themed they have a particular set
0:03:56 of powers and such that seem to be all
0:03:59 about
0:04:00 snake stuff they have they get snake
0:04:03 skin
0:04:04 they get fangs they like to do snake
0:04:07 it's very
0:04:09 their gaze can be it's very it's a lot
0:04:12 they're very my buddy kabir explained to
0:04:14 me that like this they come from
0:04:17 out by egypt they worship old snake gods
0:04:21 in the desert it's like that uh it's
0:04:23 like that movie with uh schwarzenegger
0:04:25 you know where he fights the snake god
0:04:28 here conan yeah that one yeah
0:04:31 old ancient snake terminator
0:04:34 it's the first thing that came to mind
0:04:35 was i needed schwarzenegger i said
0:04:37 junior so but that's a funnier one one
0:04:40 of the clans
0:04:42 is that the word you're using it is a
0:04:44 clan of vampires yes and sometimes
0:04:46 you'll hear people say bloodlines
0:04:48 families there's all kinds of terms for
0:04:50 it but they are not
0:04:52 officially part of the camera
0:04:55 because
0:04:56 some of them don't like the rules that
0:04:58 the camarilla
0:04:59 instills they're an independent sect so
0:05:01 they get to not follow the rules but
0:05:03 they also don't really receive the
0:05:04 protections they kind of receive the
0:05:07 protections
0:05:08 because no one wants to start [ __ ] with
0:05:09 them well
0:05:11 i mean we just killed one of their
0:05:13 sorcerers well they were trying to kill
0:05:14 us first and like my daddy always said
0:05:16 when someone tries to kill you you kill
0:05:18 them back well about that
0:05:20 why were they after you in particular
0:05:23 well
0:05:24 it has come down that a particular
0:05:27 job this group took off upon ourselves
0:05:30 ended with the
0:05:32 death of a favorite ghoul of theirs
0:05:36 um a
0:05:37 very strong and terrifying cat thing we
0:05:41 may have mistook it for being tougher
0:05:43 than it was and it was killed
0:05:46 succinctly and messily i'm sorry i
0:05:49 thought you said they were snakes
0:05:51 yes but that's the whole egyptian thing
0:05:53 is i care apparently they do stuff with
0:05:55 cats i don't really understand it and
0:05:57 haven't had an opportunity to really
0:05:58 question them on it since you know
0:06:00 there's a lot you don't remember do you
0:06:02 remember any of the world's history at
0:06:04 all yes okay do you remember how
0:06:06 egyptians worshiped cats
0:06:08 yes think of that kind of dynamic
0:06:10 but the cat thing it was a ghoul a very
0:06:14 old ghoul and it may have destroyed a
0:06:16 wall or two before we decided that it
0:06:19 probably needed to be put down we uh by
0:06:21 the way when we say ghoul we don't mean
0:06:23 vampire
0:06:25 ghouls are another kind of creature that
0:06:29 our kind can make
0:06:31 make how are blood's addictive and all
0:06:34 you need to do is
0:06:36 feed a little bit of that kind of drug
0:06:37 to somebody and they get hooked
0:06:40 like nothing else
0:06:41 wait does
0:06:43 that mean
0:06:44 i'm a ghoul no i'm a mortal he's that's
0:06:47 somebody means a more like a regular
0:06:49 a regular person but the bloods are an
0:06:51 animal or an animal but the blood is
0:06:53 powerful enough to blood bond other
0:06:55 vampires that's why we were so mad about
0:06:57 that about the prince making you drink
0:06:59 his blood imagine what that can do to a
0:07:01 mortal that's why we call them ghouls
0:07:04 immortal a cat any other animal they can
0:07:06 all be turned into a ghoul through
0:07:09 feeding the blood i have one he's a
0:07:11 fisher cat his name is chaps he's really
0:07:13 helpful i always forget his name is
0:07:15 chaps it's chaps honestly the long the
0:07:17 longer that you live this weird on life
0:07:20 you'll find that that our blood can do
0:07:22 all kinds of crazy [ __ ] i mean marcos
0:07:25 himself is a ghoul
0:07:27 and this gives him
0:07:28 some of our strengths and
0:07:31 very little of our weaknesses by the way
0:07:32 is he taking my shirt or something like
0:07:34 that
0:07:36 i don't think that can be saved well no
0:07:39 but i mean
0:07:40 johnny takes off his his leather jacket
0:07:43 yeah he will be coming let's not move
0:07:45 too far from the entryway until he gets
0:07:47 here i don't mean i also don't think we
0:07:48 should talk too much more about this
0:07:50 before we've actually gotten fully in
0:07:51 the house
0:07:52 well yeah we're we're we're in the
0:07:54 entryway to the house we're still open i
0:07:55 mean like honestly anywhere on the
0:07:57 property here is generally pretty good
0:07:59 as long as you're not smooshing your
0:08:00 face up against the fence he heads back
0:08:02 with a couple chains of clothes a lot of
0:08:05 it actually out of miles's wardrobe
0:08:07 which one of you is taking so first the
0:08:10 three available bathrooms for it well
0:08:12 i'll go first i'm not that dirty so you
0:08:15 guys can
0:08:17 i haven't had a shower in quite
0:08:18 literally a month marcos this is brita
0:08:20 by the way
0:08:21 um
0:08:22 hi it's good to meet you hello britta
0:08:24 it's my very good pleasure to meet you
0:08:26 is there anything else you'll need
0:08:28 um
0:08:29 i'll probably need a shower and a change
0:08:31 of clothes later too but for now i think
0:08:34 i'd like to talk a bit more
0:08:36 sounds great i'll see you then johnny
0:08:37 just unbuttons his flannel he's got like
0:08:39 a black like a shirt undershirt he's
0:08:42 kind of used to this kind of dirty
0:08:44 business happening so prepares in
0:08:46 advance dark jeans so he just kind of
0:08:48 takes off the shirt wipes some of the
0:08:51 blood off of his uh leather jacket and
0:08:54 kind of tosses the the flannel to uh
0:08:56 marco it kind of like
0:08:59 slaps onto him
0:09:01 his face becomes one of revulsion
0:09:04 and then he plasters on a smile and
0:09:07 nods and then wanders off with the
0:09:09 bloody clothes oh um marco before you go
0:09:12 yes do you happen to have gloves
0:09:16 yes i was just going to go get them oh
0:09:19 thank you
0:09:21 uh if we want to talk a little bit more
0:09:24 before bathing and things like that do
0:09:27 you want to just like throw a tarp over
0:09:28 a couch or do you want us just standing
0:09:30 foyer here let them get cleaned up for
0:09:32 us it's a good let's
0:09:33 get a little
0:09:35 de-stressed out then we'll talk because
0:09:37 i don't particularly want all of this
0:09:38 crap all over my house
0:09:40 okay i get it i just bretta said she
0:09:42 wanted to talk some more i'm trying to
0:09:43 find a nice middle johnny pat's a hand
0:09:45 on uh miles back don't worry buddy i'm
0:09:47 sure you can afford to get a new couch
0:09:49 and go striding into the common room
0:09:51 pulling out of cigarettes i like that
0:09:53 couch uh miles is that all right if i
0:09:54 smoke a joint in your shower
0:09:56 in the shower it was fine thank you why
0:09:58 don't you guys go do it now we have
0:09:59 three bathrooms when
0:10:01 it goes down to the basement because
0:10:02 that's where she's been told the uh the
0:10:04 shower is she
0:10:05 definitely takes advantage of the fact
0:10:07 that this is a shower that is not cold
0:10:09 that there is shampoo and like body wash
0:10:13 if there's a loofah she doesn't use it
0:10:15 but do you even mind if a shower is cold
0:10:16 or hot this is a nice luxury it makes
0:10:18 her pretend that she's still human her
0:10:21 skin gets warm when she gets out she'll
0:10:23 take the surplus clothes that um
0:10:26 uh marcos has offered
0:10:29 she kind of looks
0:10:31 almost forlornly at the flannel shirt
0:10:33 she had been wearing that's now been
0:10:35 rendered
0:10:36 like she knows she has to throw it away
0:10:37 and she doesn't want to
0:10:39 from one of the rips she manages to tear
0:10:41 off
0:10:41 the button front
0:10:43 and she wraps it around her wrist and
0:10:44 then she just kind of takes the dirty
0:10:46 clothes and puts them in the garbage
0:10:48 definitely takes her time with the joint
0:10:51 as bruno's walking off not brita as wind
0:10:53 is walking off neil will sort of lean
0:10:55 over towards brynn and be like okay so
0:10:57 she's going to go downstairs and smoke
0:11:00 it doesn't actually do anything
0:11:02 she's kind of moving it around in her
0:11:04 body uh but
0:11:05 you know get a couple of mortals high
0:11:07 and feed off of them and you can still
0:11:08 get high
0:11:10 if that's something that you're
0:11:11 interested in i don't know i i don't
0:11:12 know you that well why would she do it
0:11:15 if it doesn't work habit it's relaxing
0:11:18 there's a mental
0:11:19 stimulation to it the same way same way
0:11:21 that johnny's smoking and he sort of
0:11:23 nods over towards johnny on the couch
0:11:25 he's not getting anything out of that
0:11:27 but just be for yourself but mentally
0:11:31 habits
0:11:32 do those sorts of habits
0:11:35 help
0:11:36 maintain what it's like to be human
0:11:38 sense of normalcy yeah
0:11:40 by the way how many times did you get
0:11:42 perforated back there
0:11:44 i got shot once
0:11:46 um where'd you get
0:11:47 um
0:11:49 she
0:11:49 pulls aside like what's left of her
0:11:51 shirt to find that it's like right in
0:11:54 the rib cage oh it's a good one
0:11:57 you might wanna
0:11:58 if you focus
0:12:00 on your on your midsection so really
0:12:03 think about that you can feel you can
0:12:05 maybe almost push your blood that way
0:12:08 britta closes her eyes and she focuses
0:12:11 uh
0:12:12 clearly not knowing
0:12:14 exactly what she's doing but she can
0:12:16 feel the blood moving in her body and as
0:12:19 she pushes
0:12:20 it does actually move towards the spot
0:12:23 by expending a trait of blood you can
0:12:27 heal levels of damage
0:12:29 on a one-for-one basis so long as it
0:12:31 isn't aggravated damage
0:12:34 so when british starts to focus
0:12:36 it isn't long before we kind of hear
0:12:38 that like
0:12:39 the metal sound of the bullet dropping
0:12:42 out onto the ground
0:12:44 as her wound is closed johnny goes over
0:12:46 snatches up the uh the bullet takes a
0:12:48 look at it doesn't look like it's
0:12:50 anything weird right nope tosses it over
0:12:52 to brita a souvenir for you
0:12:55 she catches it and looks down at it uh
0:12:57 still pretty shaken by the fact that it
0:13:00 was in her body
0:13:02 thank you
0:13:03 but these
0:13:04 sedites right
0:13:06 yes
0:13:07 they're
0:13:09 the same sort of
0:13:10 thing as
0:13:12 they're a clan like like ventrue yes
0:13:14 what are the other clans
0:13:16 oh there's a bunch yeah i mean there's
0:13:20 ones on the camera let's talk about the
0:13:21 camarilla first and foremost should we
0:13:23 just talk about ourselves is that it
0:13:25 might even be a better idea so started
0:13:27 ventrue um we have a tendency to be
0:13:31 in charge of many things in the areas
0:13:34 they're symbols of scepter
0:13:36 okay i think you could probably imagine
0:13:38 why partially because we're just
0:13:40 some of the most organized clans okay
0:13:43 that's fair
0:13:44 and don't you guys have merit badges or
0:13:46 something
0:13:47 we have our own structure
0:13:49 our own schooling our own learning
0:13:52 so he's a venture
0:13:54 i'm a bruja
0:13:55 we are uh
0:13:57 in contrast to the venture maybe not
0:13:59 quite as organized but uh what we lack
0:14:02 an organization we make up for and
0:14:04 passion
0:14:05 guys like weathers
0:14:06 did you meet jane
0:14:08 i think there was woman
0:14:09 standing next to weathers at some point
0:14:11 but we rolled together kind of like uh
0:14:14 looking more like a gang than a
0:14:17 corporation like the venture
0:14:19 and we uh tend to wear our hearts on our
0:14:21 sleeves and leather jackets
0:14:23 is that part of the power or
0:14:26 no it's just an aesthetic choice i don't
0:14:28 know it might actually be part of the
0:14:30 power
0:14:32 oh me
0:14:33 uh
0:14:34 i i looked over to win but she's not
0:14:37 here um
0:14:38 i'm a mulcavian
0:14:40 we're
0:14:41 i don't know i don't know how to do
0:14:44 we're pretty normal
0:14:45 people say that isn't true necessarily a
0:14:48 lot of people
0:14:50 talk about malkavians like we're all
0:14:51 crazy
0:14:53 don't really trust us too much talk
0:14:55 about organizational skills
0:14:57 but um i like to think of it like we
0:15:00 see things that
0:15:02 other people don't see
0:15:04 given to insight and odd behavior
0:15:07 is what people think
0:15:09 and it suits for people to think that
0:15:12 and
0:15:12 we are the clans we are because of our
0:15:15 desires
0:15:17 because of our blood because of our
0:15:19 blood and that's why we don't know
0:15:21 whatever
0:15:22 i am we don't know but i have suspicions
0:15:26 what are they
0:15:28 i mean
0:15:29 she might be a bruja she's not a bruja
0:15:31 what wynn comes back in the room and
0:15:33 she's towel drying her hair she has on
0:15:35 like a men's white undershirt pair of
0:15:38 pants that she's kind of taken a hair
0:15:40 tie and knotted so that they fit her
0:15:42 miles has surprisingly broad shoulders
0:15:44 right yeah yeah i think it's all the
0:15:46 shoulder pads by by the way we were
0:15:48 telling britta about our bloodlines oh
0:15:51 we all went that's your turn
0:15:53 so the name of my clan is gangrel um
0:15:56 we are
0:15:58 we're wanderers
0:16:00 uh we're very
0:16:01 in touch with nature
0:16:03 very survival based
0:16:05 the social scene it's not really our
0:16:07 thing we are tight as a group we will
0:16:10 support one another but right now we're
0:16:14 we're having some
0:16:16 problems with the camarilla
0:16:19 and i don't know how that's gonna shake
0:16:21 out right now
0:16:22 problems
0:16:23 like with the
0:16:25 traditions the the laws they were
0:16:27 talking about or
0:16:29 i don't
0:16:30 know that i should say
0:16:31 a whole lot about it to be perfectly
0:16:33 honest
0:16:34 because so there's a power structure in
0:16:37 the camarilla
0:16:38 it's
0:16:39 basically our our governing body is
0:16:42 the is the just to carry it
0:16:45 each clan has
0:16:47 a justicar who speaks for their clan
0:16:51 the Gangrel justicar
0:16:54 left
0:16:55 left the camarilla
0:16:58 but said that any of the clan who were
0:17:00 welcome to stay could
0:17:01 there aren't many of us who made the
0:17:03 choice to stay
0:17:05 a lot of us left to
0:17:07 help xavier
0:17:09 why did you say
0:17:11 neil kind of
0:17:13 positions himself so that he's directly
0:17:15 between miles and
0:17:17 johnny and kind of waves a hand
0:17:19 at the three of them
0:17:21 together
0:17:22 that
0:17:24 oh
0:17:25 i have been alone for
0:17:28 a long time
0:17:29 and that's not uncommon for my clan
0:17:34 as i said we're not overly social but
0:17:36 the people that we choose we stand by so
0:17:38 characteristics like that like
0:17:41 you not being
0:17:43 overly social or nail
0:17:47 appearing and disappearing those things
0:17:49 are normal
0:17:51 they are
0:17:53 consistent with the blood that we have
0:17:55 my
0:17:56 blood is much happier and better suited
0:17:59 towards fighting speaking with animals
0:18:02 and
0:18:03 yeah it's a neat trick and so that's
0:18:04 what i can teach you
0:18:06 well something like my
0:18:09 senses being on overdrive that hearing
0:18:12 things really well that might have
0:18:13 something to do with
0:18:15 my bloodline there's some crossover in
0:18:17 the venn diagram yeah
0:18:19 crossover and the venn diagram what does
0:18:21 that some of you share powers
0:18:24 some of us it's why i recognize the way
0:18:27 you were looking around that room
0:18:29 we can talk about it at some point but
0:18:32 the ability to hear
0:18:34 like that to sharpen your senses it's
0:18:36 something i'm familiar with
0:18:38 a lot of malkavians can do it
0:18:40 can't we talk about it now if there's
0:18:43 yeah i'm sure i don't know what i am i
0:18:47 don't know how to use
0:18:49 any of it and it seems like we'll need
0:18:51 to well chances are we could probably
0:18:54 figure it out considering the fact that
0:18:57 you were embraced
0:18:59 made made a vampire here in new haven
0:19:02 kind of limits some of the clans
0:19:05 i couldn't be
0:19:07 a said i
0:19:08 well based on what you've shown us but
0:19:11 you're probably not yeah like i said
0:19:14 i've i've got my suspicions i i assume
0:19:16 based on the way miles was looking
0:19:17 earlier he's got he's got some too based
0:19:20 on what you've said and based on how
0:19:22 you're moving in the car oh did she was
0:19:24 she doing the car the point is there's
0:19:27 not too many other clans that belong to
0:19:29 the camarilla and when another clan
0:19:32 moves in on a city it becomes
0:19:35 pretty clear that they're around
0:19:37 so really the the other clans that we
0:19:39 have to to look at are
0:19:41 the nosferatu
0:19:44 you mean one of them
0:19:47 yeah
0:19:47 yeah shark face yeah they all look like
0:19:50 that well not just like there's
0:19:52 something that happens to each clan it's
0:19:55 sort of the price of
0:19:56 the power of our blood curse
0:19:59 okay we can call it a curse that's a
0:20:01 good way to put it that seems makes it
0:20:03 seem like it's unworkable but that's
0:20:05 just me my clan we all right so if i
0:20:08 ever get too low on blood
0:20:10 i can enter a frenzy every vampire can
0:20:14 when i frenzy
0:20:15 i take on animal forms so eventually
0:20:19 i'm not gonna look like me anymore you
0:20:21 don't think she was born with those
0:20:23 beautiful little uh
0:20:24 blue green eyes of hers do you no we
0:20:27 could talk more about the curses but
0:20:29 let's focus on the rest of the clans
0:20:30 first yeah okay
0:20:32 so aside from the nosferatu there's the
0:20:34 tremere
0:20:35 that's rhys
0:20:37 yeah
0:20:38 premiere
0:20:39 focus on
0:20:40 blood magic win looks like she is
0:20:43 distinctly
0:20:44 angered by the knowledge of this man
0:20:46 existing it seems as though each
0:20:48 bloodline has their own powers but the
0:20:50 tremere focus on
0:20:52 unlocking
0:20:54 all of the potential of the of what
0:20:55 their blood can do
0:20:57 in weird ways i don't particularly like
0:21:00 to
0:21:01 think about it too much but uh sorcery
0:21:04 that they have their own structure too
0:21:07 so they have an internal structure to
0:21:09 themselves
0:21:10 but
0:21:11 because of what we're seeing you do
0:21:15 i don't think you're trimming her either
0:21:18 not if
0:21:19 it's true miles said you moved real fast
0:21:21 when you were in that car
0:21:23 yeah
0:21:24 i
0:21:25 i don't think i've ever done that before
0:21:27 also she apparently knows how to fire a
0:21:29 gun well
0:21:31 the
0:21:32 other clan that we uh
0:21:34 we didn't mention are the toreador
0:21:37 you remember uh remember elsa linden
0:21:40 yes that's uh
0:21:42 that's clantoriadore they um
0:21:45 they kind of sit in between all the rest
0:21:47 of the clans they uh they almost act
0:21:49 like a nice bit of glue
0:21:52 keep the camaria functioning and they
0:21:54 they kind of temper
0:21:56 all of the tempers of all the clans
0:22:00 well that's
0:22:01 good isn't it yeah but they're
0:22:03 insufferable in their own ways
0:22:05 they're
0:22:06 they see the beauty of creation
0:22:08 rules his eyes a little bit they see
0:22:10 themselves they can also see the beauty
0:22:13 in themselves they have a thing about
0:22:14 aesthetics yeah like
0:22:16 the same way they said i'd have a thing
0:22:18 about snakes or
0:22:19 kind of yeah yeah that's a pretty good
0:22:22 i said i'd do snakes i've heard stories
0:22:24 about old toyed or locking themselves
0:22:27 away in castles or mansions with
0:22:30 piles of art just going crazy
0:22:33 collecting massive amounts of paintings
0:22:36 or sculpture and
0:22:38 they just sit around withering away to
0:22:40 nothing looking at it wait art
0:22:42 specifically
0:22:43 all kinds of art sometimes i've heard
0:22:45 even even crazier stories about
0:22:48 weird kinds of art that tori don't get
0:22:51 obsessed with well when i was at the um
0:22:54 elysium right
0:22:56 i saw a painting and there was something
0:22:59 really
0:23:00 i mean it was gorgeous i don't think
0:23:01 i've ever seen anything like that before
0:23:04 in my life i wanted to keep staring at
0:23:06 it but we had something to beat
0:23:09 just that sound i was gonna say
0:23:12 i think there's something to be said
0:23:14 that you know your senses are heightened
0:23:17 in a similar manner to mine
0:23:19 if what miles says is true you can move
0:23:21 as fast as johnny can
0:23:23 and the first time i ever saw you
0:23:25 you were staring
0:23:27 wide-eyed with wonder at
0:23:29 a piece of modern art
0:23:31 didn't something similar happen to that
0:23:33 kid romeo a few years back yeah last
0:23:35 year yeah was it just last year it was
0:23:38 like a year ago
0:23:40 i don't know if we ever got confirmation
0:23:41 of what clanny believes he is he's oh
0:23:44 it's
0:23:45 yeah
0:23:46 that's why he's hanging around with
0:23:48 lyndon so much did she take accounting
0:23:50 on him
0:23:51 i can't i believe she took
0:23:52 responsibility yeah so then yeah so i
0:23:55 might be
0:23:56 a toreador that's a good guess oh you
0:23:59 you might
0:24:00 be romeo's broodmate for all we know i
0:24:02 mean two
0:24:04 young
0:24:06 teenage early twenties
0:24:08 good looking people suddenly getting
0:24:10 snatched off the street turning you know
0:24:12 embraced his toryador and let loose does
0:24:15 he have any
0:24:16 recollection of who he was or the events
0:24:18 leading up to his embrace i don't know
0:24:20 romeo didn't talk to me too much well
0:24:22 was he brought in in the same way that i
0:24:23 was without a known desire
0:24:26 yeah he was just found if that's the
0:24:28 case i bet you anything else linda knows
0:24:31 more about this than she was letting on
0:24:33 probably i mean we used we used
0:24:35 weather's connections that to get
0:24:36 information from her but it'd be just
0:24:39 like her to be using us like that
0:24:41 and using weathers who is his sire that
0:24:43 must have been discovered at some point
0:24:45 no not necessarily once the accounting
0:24:47 happens and somebody's taking
0:24:48 responsibility
0:24:50 they care a little bit less as long as
0:24:52 they don't screw up also some of these
0:24:54 folks think on a really long timeline
0:24:56 apologies for
0:24:58 interrupting uh ms britta did you want
0:25:01 that shower
0:25:02 um yes please uh if you all don't mind
0:25:05 no go ahead please read this way thank
0:25:08 you marco
0:25:11 [Music]
0:25:15 brita was it
0:25:16 um yes
0:25:18 marcus kind of
0:25:19 mentions while the two of you are headed
0:25:20 towards the bath that is prepared for
0:25:22 you
0:25:23 apologies for my forwardness but i
0:25:26 overheard a bit of a discussion about
0:25:27 the blood pond
0:25:28 um yes the prince had me drink from him
0:25:33 i see
0:25:36 well
0:25:37 i admit i have um
0:25:40 and admittedly
0:25:42 unusual relationship with the blood bond
0:25:45 what's unusual about it
0:25:48 miles has grinded me immortality
0:25:51 i will never age
0:25:53 so long as
0:25:54 his his vitae remains in my blood
0:25:58 so
0:25:59 you chose this
0:26:02 i'm sorry if that's too personal i
0:26:04 choose this
0:26:06 is it a choice that i must make
0:26:08 continuously however there is um
0:26:13 there is a loyalty that it instills into
0:26:15 those who drink you see
0:26:17 the blood bond is not something that can
0:26:19 be created in a single night
0:26:22 this is a process
0:26:24 on the first night you drink
0:26:27 and you will find that you think of this
0:26:29 individual more frequently
0:26:31 bring them up in conversations become
0:26:32 curious to find yourself in places that
0:26:35 you think they might travel through i
0:26:37 did seem
0:26:39 it felt more like he was trying to
0:26:40 protect me or bring me in after yes
0:26:44 that's not real
0:26:45 no
0:26:47 oh
0:26:49 no if this man sought to bomb to you
0:26:52 and hadn't bothered to tell you what
0:26:54 that even entails
0:26:56 i imagine this individual was a predator
0:26:59 seeking to take advantage of you you see
0:27:02 because on the second night it creates a
0:27:04 sense of loyalty you will seek to help
0:27:07 him
0:27:08 his
0:27:09 desires
0:27:10 will become your desires you will aim to
0:27:12 please him
0:27:14 and on the third night
0:27:17 you are bound
0:27:19 a slave to his blood
0:27:21 um
0:27:23 if you don't mind
0:27:25 me asking this
0:27:27 which are you
0:27:28 i am bound to miles
0:27:31 fully
0:27:32 yes
0:27:33 is it
0:27:34 you said you choose this
0:27:37 reversible
0:27:38 not that i know of
0:27:40 but as i understand it or i've come to
0:27:43 believe
0:27:44 this is the first step towards becoming
0:27:47 one of the kindred
0:27:49 if i perform well if i'm loyal
0:27:52 perhaps miles will one night find me
0:27:54 worthy
0:27:55 and
0:27:56 ask for the
0:27:58 right of creation
0:28:01 similar yes
0:28:03 progeny progeny right i'm sorry
0:28:06 no need to apologize to me
0:28:09 i just work here but yes
0:28:12 if if i prove worthy he may seek
0:28:14 permission from the prince
0:28:17 to make me
0:28:19 one of the venture like he is
0:28:21 and i will go from being a slave a
0:28:24 servant
0:28:25 to a king
0:28:27 he opens the door to the bathroom
0:28:29 and kind of like
0:28:31 see this this this bath that he ran for
0:28:34 you
0:28:35 very carefully prepared and there's a
0:28:37 towel and there's just clothing and
0:28:39 there's like a little scented candle it
0:28:41 looks like he went through a bit of
0:28:43 extra effort to help comfort you
0:28:46 perhaps he is noticing that
0:28:48 you look stressed thank you um
0:28:51 i really appreciate it
0:28:54 i'm happy to help she'll go in um
0:28:57 what clothing has been left for her
0:28:59 it's not exactly the height of fashion
0:29:01 it's like gym clothes
0:29:03 but it's clean
0:29:05 that's all she's folded it's
0:29:08 yeah it's it's going to give what you
0:29:10 need uh he excuses himself of course and
0:29:13 shuts the door behind him and for a time
0:29:16 you're left alone to
0:29:18 contemplate your new reality
0:29:21 well brita's in the bath the hot water
0:29:24 she takes a moment to try to heat up her
0:29:27 hands to see if she can make them feel
0:29:30 normal again you find that when focusing
0:29:33 on it
0:29:34 the blood stirs just like it did when
0:29:36 you were
0:29:37 healing yourself from that that bullet
0:29:39 wound
0:29:40 and in time
0:29:42 your skin becomes flush and warm and it
0:29:45 starts to regain some of the um
0:29:48 the tan if you will that i had
0:29:50 even
0:29:51 the touch of frost
0:29:53 that never quite goes away
0:29:56 but at the color like you become more
0:29:58 flush and alive looking
0:30:00 well after a moment of frustration
0:30:02 trying to get her hands to
0:30:05 resemble the blush of health on the rest
0:30:06 of her she'll bathe and she'll change
0:30:10 and she'll come back down
0:30:11 i mean this process takes
0:30:14 quite a while
0:30:15 but when it's done you tiptoe back
0:30:17 downstairs
0:30:18 and marcos is already waiting by the
0:30:21 staircase to kind of lead you down
0:30:24 he's actually uh he's very subservient
0:30:27 to non-threatening
0:30:28 kind of like an unobtrusive posture
0:30:30 while he guides you along
0:30:32 and you return to the quartering
0:30:39 [Music]
0:30:42 feel better
0:30:43 i definitely feel better yes
0:30:46 good i uh i'm over towards marcus i'm
0:30:48 like i think i'm going to need
0:30:51 some of the
0:30:52 local musicians called up
0:30:54 repaid it was an exciting night ah i see
0:30:58 how many preparations right away
0:31:00 very good thank you marcus of course
0:31:03 wanders off a little pep in his steps
0:31:05 because
0:31:06 you know miles asked him to do something
0:31:08 johnny's uh sitting
0:31:10 actually on a side chair by one of the
0:31:13 windows it's cracked open and he's
0:31:15 taking drags off his cigarette and
0:31:17 flicking it out the window he's actually
0:31:18 already changed into a pair of kind of
0:31:20 ill-fitting jeans
0:31:22 and uh a white shirt that look like
0:31:25 they're probably from some label that
0:31:27 doesn't really like
0:31:29 fit him
0:31:30 like
0:31:31 if they knew they were on him if they'd
0:31:33 be a little disciplined exactly
0:31:36 yeah my shredded shirt is gone and i am
0:31:38 now wearing a
0:31:40 shirt similar to the one he's wearing
0:31:41 but it fits me very well
0:31:44 i also picture him in a smoking jacket
0:31:47 a little off-brand
0:31:49 but like basically a white shirt that's
0:31:52 got it you know a couple buttons undone
0:31:53 and then
0:31:55 look at you kid very casual
0:31:57 shower did you well looks like you're
0:31:58 almost alive
0:32:00 i um
0:32:02 i don't know if i feel life's the right
0:32:04 word for it but no it's definitely not
0:32:06 the right word but
0:32:09 yeah close enough
0:32:10 we're listening to music later oh ooh
0:32:15 uh miles do you want to take this one
0:32:16 to your accounting
0:32:18 yes um
0:32:20 to be fair yes we'll probably listen to
0:32:22 some music because that is what we'll
0:32:23 pay them for
0:32:24 um but at the same time i use my
0:32:28 particular influence to
0:32:31 make feeding for myself easier
0:32:33 oh that's been explained right
0:32:36 feeding which part of it how often we
0:32:39 need to do it i'm not sure drinking
0:32:41 blood from people
0:32:43 um i kind of
0:32:45 figured out that part on my own but
0:32:48 how
0:32:49 how often how much how do we make sure
0:32:51 we don't kill them that takes practice a
0:32:55 what did you explain to her when you
0:32:57 were in that side room anything
0:32:59 i had time to assess the situation to
0:33:02 see if she could be
0:33:03 saved far be it for me i've never taken
0:33:05 anyone during my accounting but but damn
0:33:08 we got a lot to explain huh right well
0:33:10 if she wasn't going to make it through
0:33:11 the night it wasn't so it's kind of
0:33:13 worth it to explain to feeding it that's
0:33:15 her
0:33:16 hands to kind of be like yeah fair
0:33:17 enough
0:33:18 to answer part of that
0:33:20 you kind of have to gauge yourself and
0:33:23 how hungry you are
0:33:25 if you don't use much you're not going
0:33:27 to need to eat as much you'll have to
0:33:29 use at least a little bit to rouse
0:33:30 yourself every night yep every time that
0:33:33 you focus
0:33:35 your blood somewhere that's going to be
0:33:37 using a little bit of it
0:33:38 that gut wound
0:33:41 i'm guessing that blushing your cheeks
0:33:44 i think that's she's also brand new that
0:33:46 might be
0:33:47 shine hasn't worn off yet possible every
0:33:50 time every time that you move quickly
0:33:52 and there are people that never lose it
0:33:54 true there's also all these things could
0:33:57 be uh
0:33:58 draining you of vitae
0:34:00 but the reason
0:34:02 that you found me was that i was hunting
0:34:05 wrong that i was getting caught that was
0:34:07 the first time
0:34:09 everyone's first time starts with a
0:34:11 frenzy and depending on the
0:34:13 circumstances people
0:34:15 they put them in better situations yeah
0:34:18 they're controllable it doesn't always
0:34:20 lead to death in the first time no
0:34:22 beyond that though just moving forward
0:34:25 uh
0:34:26 it's better to take a little bit from a
0:34:28 lot than a lot from one the camarilla
0:34:30 likes to make it so that it's not so
0:34:32 traumatic but honestly i think uh
0:34:35 embrace tends to be more towards the
0:34:36 norm like you had kid and there are
0:34:40 things to it as you're counting i will
0:34:43 start a guide and then we'll see if a
0:34:45 particular way fits you or not but there
0:34:46 are a couple things that
0:34:49 we're predators and we have a couple
0:34:52 things that help us
0:34:54 make peop make it better for our prey
0:34:57 and make us less detectable so you don't
0:34:59 have to kill the musicians
0:35:01 i try not to very often
0:35:03 i like the musicians and their music
0:35:06 it's kind of my job the camarilla frowns
0:35:09 on creating too much public notice of us
0:35:13 so that means that if we kill people
0:35:16 that's going to bring attention for the
0:35:17 most part you fed
0:35:20 yeah
0:35:22 the first time yeah but also off the
0:35:24 prince and i know we were talking about
0:35:25 blood bonds and things but
0:35:28 do you remember and i know it's
0:35:29 different
0:35:31 but do you remember how it felt when you
0:35:33 were feeding off the prince
0:35:36 good
0:35:36 right yeah it's okay to say we're all
0:35:39 we've done it before well not that but
0:35:42 that's unless something's gone horribly
0:35:45 wrong
0:35:46 what it feels like for a mortal wait
0:35:49 it feels
0:35:51 good why wouldn't it be painful
0:35:54 it's um
0:35:56 yeah i don't know what it is about it
0:35:58 you know i'm sure you could talk to some
0:36:00 premier and they'd know or
0:36:02 all sorts of armchair philosophers but
0:36:05 yeah once you're in
0:36:08 now
0:36:09 how you get in
0:36:11 can
0:36:13 that can spark a lot of trauma but once
0:36:15 you're there
0:36:17 it feels good it's kind of like a poison
0:36:19 some say someone's spiritual or magical
0:36:22 but basically my buddy kabir put it like
0:36:25 this
0:36:27 when a kindred
0:36:28 feeds on a mortal it's like a lover's
0:36:30 embrace
0:36:32 they just want to be there
0:36:34 they want you to drink their blood
0:36:38 and you will do it differently like you
0:36:39 would use you said your influence to
0:36:41 call up musicians
0:36:44 i need my influence to make my job a lot
0:36:45 easier
0:36:46 everybody wants a little different
0:36:48 that's also something the toreador are
0:36:50 good at is because they're artists they
0:36:53 can develop a following also i mean not
0:36:56 to put too fine a point on it because
0:36:57 they're generally kind of hot it's a
0:36:59 little bit easier to get somebody to
0:37:01 you know come into a dark alley or
0:37:04 whatever but it's also a pretty good
0:37:06 judge of character yes you watch how
0:37:08 somebody
0:37:09 feeds
0:37:10 tells you a lot about the person
0:37:12 because
0:37:14 the fact that we can make it pleasant
0:37:16 and not have to kill somebody
0:37:19 well not all of our kind
0:37:22 like it that way
0:37:24 some of them like to make it messy well
0:37:26 to the end we're still people to certain
0:37:28 degrees and there are some people out
0:37:30 there who just like to cause pain the
0:37:32 people who do that aren't people anymore
0:37:34 is there a particular clan that does
0:37:36 that
0:37:37 none in the camarilla
0:37:39 sedites
0:37:41 no not the satellites it's i think it's
0:37:43 more like an individual choice
0:37:45 yes yeah
0:37:47 there's no particular clan that embraces
0:37:49 just causing
0:37:51 johnny johnny there's a really hard
0:37:53 stare for a bit
0:37:56 the sabbat like it messi
0:37:59 the saban
0:38:00 the camaria are one society
0:38:04 of
0:38:05 kindred
0:38:06 the other society that
0:38:09 are jealous
0:38:11 of
0:38:12 what the camarilla has
0:38:13 of the sabbat
0:38:15 they tend to be the worst of our kind
0:38:18 yeah but
0:38:19 generally just like little nomadic packs
0:38:21 and things you know groups of
0:38:24 zealous psychopaths you don't know them
0:38:25 like i do oh no i know i'm just talking
0:38:28 about generalities
0:38:30 but
0:38:31 they're not a clan they're not like it's
0:38:33 not like the sedites and the sabbath no
0:38:35 no they are made of multiple clients
0:38:37 much like the camera
0:38:38 some different ones that exist in the
0:38:40 camarilla
0:38:42 yeah i i don't know a whole lot about
0:38:43 the sabbat that's johnny knows more than
0:38:45 we do do they have traditions like the
0:38:47 camarilla probably
0:38:50 they have to have things to keep them
0:38:51 together otherwise it'd be pure anarchy
0:38:54 which is also a thing they're more like
0:38:56 a cult
0:38:57 a cult
0:38:58 yeah
0:38:59 i don't know their particular beliefs
0:39:01 but
0:39:02 they have a fascination with who they
0:39:04 are as monsters
0:39:06 i can tell you more about it
0:39:08 i don't know if you need to be scared
0:39:10 about them right now
0:39:12 and there's also
0:39:13 knowing too much about them is sometimes
0:39:15 problematic but if you're curious kid
0:39:18 ask away i won't hold back
0:39:21 would i know one if i saw them oh yeah
0:39:24 how
0:39:25 they don't revel
0:39:27 in
0:39:28 remembering that they were once human
0:39:31 they take all of the gifts that make
0:39:33 them monster and they accentuate them
0:39:37 how do they get by without
0:39:40 showing our existence
0:39:43 sometimes they just don't care about
0:39:44 that
0:39:45 and if there are any survivors
0:39:48 nobody knows they were there
0:39:50 just a massacre
0:39:52 and you've had to deal with them
0:39:56 yeah
0:39:58 it was a tough embrace for me
0:40:00 i'll run in with the sabbat that went
0:40:03 sideways
0:40:06 i'm sorry to hear that
0:40:07 that's all right
0:40:08 do they have anything to do with
0:40:11 you said that they revel in their
0:40:12 monstrous nature do they make other
0:40:14 things
0:40:15 monstrous
0:40:16 i have a feeling that there might be
0:40:19 some connection with that thing in
0:40:21 wynn's fridge
0:40:22 i agree um that's a
0:40:25 much longer talk you
0:40:27 had other questions about who you are
0:40:29 let's let's build this castle on stone
0:40:32 stand that's a good point speaking of
0:40:34 who you are
0:40:35 you still don't remember anything i was
0:40:38 hoping that it might come back in bits
0:40:40 and pieces but really all that's come
0:40:42 back so far is my name she might recover
0:40:44 some after her first sleep she might but
0:40:46 she also if she doesn't
0:40:49 you know i wasn't just reading newspaper
0:40:50 newspaper listings to check out the
0:40:52 funnies i never think you do
0:40:55 you found something
0:40:56 maybe you might want to read the funnies
0:40:58 once in a while it might help lighten
0:40:59 you up a bit marmaduke is just too big
0:41:04 um
0:41:05 yeah
0:41:06 there's um
0:41:08 you know i'm talking about
0:41:10 you can sort of see things it's just
0:41:12 more about being observational
0:41:14 there's a
0:41:15 place
0:41:16 an old an old cafe that's shut down a
0:41:19 while ago and somebody
0:41:22 matching
0:41:23 your very district description
0:41:26 purchased the deed to the property
0:41:28 when
0:41:29 not too long ago how exactly did you
0:41:31 figure this out
0:41:33 you know you look at the
0:41:34 uh
0:41:35 the real estate listings and uh you know
0:41:38 small town news
0:41:40 plus just you know
0:41:42 like i said she's a capricorn johnny
0:41:44 gives you a very puzzled look like yeah
0:41:46 right dude and continue smoking a
0:41:49 cigarette
0:41:50 so anyways it does doesn't matter it's
0:41:52 more about
0:41:53 uh yeah we've got i talked to miles a
0:41:56 little bit about it but we'll uh
0:41:59 if we just
0:42:00 pull some property deeds maybe send
0:42:02 somebody over to the uh
0:42:05 building and
0:42:07 uh department well neil that's
0:42:10 incredible did he get anything like
0:42:12 my last name or a birthday or no no
0:42:16 sorry no just just that just that
0:42:19 you
0:42:21 definitely you
0:42:22 probably
0:42:23 uh
0:42:24 definitely probably there's no such
0:42:25 thing as definites got it well
0:42:28 you did find that she's a capricorn
0:42:29 though and that does give a range of
0:42:31 birthdays i think it does
0:42:33 but it's based on her embrace yeah right
0:42:35 now it was captain all the time yeah
0:42:37 wait that's whatever
0:42:40 you're in a sense yes in a sense kinda
0:42:42 regardless something about this cafe is
0:42:45 there anything that stood out about it
0:42:47 anything important like anything it's a
0:42:49 nice property we haven't really
0:42:51 definitely a nice property but again
0:42:52 it's been a busy night we're gonna have
0:42:54 to do a little bit of digging um send
0:42:56 somebody over to building records and
0:42:59 hopefully pull a name off a deed and
0:43:01 maybe tomorrow night or sometime soon we
0:43:03 can just take an amble by
0:43:05 it worse comes to worse somebody sees
0:43:08 you and goes oh hey
0:43:10 brita what's her face it might not be
0:43:12 the best of things but also something i
0:43:14 was gonna bring out you may not want to
0:43:16 do that
0:43:18 for all intents and purposes you're dead
0:43:21 another thought kid you don't know your
0:43:23 last name right now but um
0:43:26 in some
0:43:27 some vampires take this opportunity to
0:43:29 remake themselves
0:43:31 if we don't find out who you are you can
0:43:33 at least decide
0:43:35 who you want to be
0:43:37 i'm
0:43:38 um it's hard to figure out where to go
0:43:41 when i don't know where i've been
0:43:44 and
0:43:45 right now all i really know is
0:43:48 that i don't want to be what i started
0:43:50 off as look at that i
0:43:52 want to figure out how to
0:43:55 how to feed without killing or how to
0:43:58 move forward in the camarilla with
0:44:01 without breaking these traditions i that
0:44:03 i don't even know
0:44:05 what the rest of them are what else
0:44:07 should i know when
0:44:09 so the rest of the traditions
0:44:11 my dear prince and his domain that's the
0:44:13 acronym for how you remember them or how
0:44:15 i do anyway
0:44:16 first one is the masquerade
0:44:19 we don't let the people that we used to
0:44:20 be
0:44:21 know what we've become or that we exist
0:44:23 at all
0:44:25 or that there are strange things in the
0:44:27 night
0:44:29 because that leads to questions
0:44:31 theoretically yes
0:44:33 what other creepy things
0:44:35 do in the night
0:44:36 there's only so much we can do about
0:44:38 that if we can cover it we do that's why
0:44:40 i shoved the thing in my fridge yes and
0:44:42 there are many different
0:44:44 kindred out there working to keep a lot
0:44:47 of this under wraps to varying degrees
0:44:49 what other creatures are there
0:44:51 you were dealing with something
0:44:53 take your pick kid there's all kinds of
0:44:56 weird [ __ ] out there on the road
0:44:58 so tonight
0:45:00 i wasn't gonna come to the party anyway
0:45:03 because [ __ ] a whole lot of that
0:45:06 um elysium politics
0:45:08 you've seen not much dick
0:45:11 the
0:45:12 what i
0:45:13 okay so
0:45:15 the part about becoming kindred for me
0:45:17 that was easy to accept was that there
0:45:19 were other monsters out there because i
0:45:21 have seen monsters and
0:45:23 things my entire life
0:45:25 i have a fairly working relationship
0:45:28 with creatures called raves
0:45:31 what is it that you think a wraith is
0:45:34 it sounds
0:45:35 i feel like i've heard of something like
0:45:36 a ghost that's more or less it
0:45:39 it's a the spirit of a dead person who's
0:45:43 lingering having trouble moving on
0:45:46 usually there's
0:45:47 their death was traumatic or
0:45:50 they had a strong tie to someone here
0:45:53 but either way they can't move along
0:45:56 and so sometimes
0:45:58 people like me who can see spirits and
0:45:59 ghosts and
0:46:01 other invisible things
0:46:03 they'll reach out to us we'll work
0:46:04 together
0:46:06 but
0:46:06 i
0:46:08 met a little boy tonight named joey
0:46:10 his face was all torn off and
0:46:13 he had run away from home
0:46:14 and some terrible creature had chased
0:46:16 him through the woods and killed him he
0:46:18 didn't know he was dead yet
0:46:20 but he knew that um
0:46:22 people couldn't see him and he wanted to
0:46:23 say goodbye to his mom
0:46:26 weren't you interacting
0:46:28 with
0:46:29 him during the elisa
0:46:36 yes
0:46:39 because there are some
0:46:40 [ __ ] some outright monsters in the
0:46:44 camaria 2 who will imprison wraiths and
0:46:46 use them
0:46:49 and they will take these little lost
0:46:51 children and they will use them when
0:46:55 it's nice maybe uh
0:46:57 bring it down a peg
0:46:59 neil walks over and like puts a calming
0:47:02 hand on
0:47:03 wind's shoulder
0:47:05 i'm sorry i um you don't got to be sorry
0:47:07 no i've been there myself again i don't
0:47:10 want to be one of the monsters she sees
0:47:12 when she looks at me though
0:47:14 you're okay
0:47:16 i don't think you're a monster
0:47:19 i appreciate that kiddo
0:47:22 but yeah there's um there's a few
0:47:24 active raves in the area um joey was new
0:47:29 um there's another member of my clan who
0:47:31 um
0:47:31 left
0:47:33 left the camarilla she works as an
0:47:35 independent now
0:47:37 um she probably knows more
0:47:39 about all this and we should talk to her
0:47:41 eventually
0:47:43 okay in terms of other monsters elsa
0:47:45 linden was
0:47:46 was chased out of
0:47:48 her domain by werewolves she used to be
0:47:50 a prince yeah
0:47:53 werewolves like
0:47:55 like in the movies
0:47:59 lupines
0:48:00 generally is heather o'farrell too
0:48:03 werewolves is this easier to
0:48:05 looks like the term vampires all sorts
0:48:08 of stuff out there so my my clan
0:48:11 can take on werewolf lupine-esque
0:48:14 tendencies
0:48:15 but these are actual
0:48:17 shape-changers
0:48:18 but
0:48:19 the dead boy the one that you are the
0:48:21 wraith joey yes
0:48:24 what kind of person
0:48:27 is it a clan that takes advantage of
0:48:29 wraiths or
0:48:30 you have to be able to see them so that
0:48:32 can strike anywhere
0:48:35 i heard there are families that are
0:48:37 specialized in that sort of thing there
0:48:38 are magics out there that can
0:48:41 bind wraiths
0:48:42 sorceries that can
0:48:45 bend them to your will who in the court
0:48:48 essential rhys had him
0:48:52 bound to him
0:48:53 there may be others but that's the one
0:48:55 we're aware of
0:48:56 not a lot of premier in the area
0:48:58 and are werewolves the current problem
0:49:01 not in new hampshire thankfully not
0:49:03 only for
0:49:05 elise some you should probably know
0:49:08 don't leave the city don't go on a road
0:49:10 trip
0:49:12 don't
0:49:13 even really get too far out into the
0:49:15 suburbs
0:49:17 is that part of the traditions no it's
0:49:19 just a really good tip not to die if you
0:49:21 need to go somewhere i know some of the
0:49:23 safe routes to get to get people around
0:49:25 between the cities johnny's like magic
0:49:27 when it comes to that kind of stuff he
0:49:28 can just get you a place to place the
0:49:29 world has become a very dangerous place
0:49:32 pretty much there's all kinds of things
0:49:34 that you can think of
0:49:35 monsters under the bed
0:49:37 it's probably something out there that
0:49:39 does that i saw a ufo once
0:49:41 well
0:49:42 now we're just being ridiculous
0:49:45 if you say so
0:49:46 well
0:49:47 back to the traditions there was the
0:49:49 masquerade and
0:49:51 domain domain
0:49:54 so technically
0:49:56 this is
0:49:57 miles's turf
0:49:59 without his permission
0:50:01 feeding around here
0:50:04 i think we're like poaching
0:50:05 it's uh it's kind of a no-no this is his
0:50:08 domain yes his domain within the domain
0:50:11 i know there's a lot of
0:50:13 lost nomenclature yeah i get a little
0:50:16 area that is designated to be mine and i
0:50:20 feeding rights are mine in that area but
0:50:22 he has that because the prince said you
0:50:25 this is my area i now gift it to you the
0:50:28 entire domain of new haven
0:50:31 belongs to the prince
0:50:33 he and the premier council kind of divvy
0:50:35 up feeding grounds and things like that
0:50:37 but this
0:50:38 this is miles so you all have domains in
0:50:41 the domain no no no some of us aren't
0:50:43 that cool
0:50:45 some of us have to make do where we can
0:50:48 there are areas that are much more open
0:50:52 and then there are places outside the
0:50:53 city to a certain degree that allow for
0:50:56 other people to feed iraq
0:50:59 anything else in the traditions that i
0:51:01 need to know oh yes
0:51:02 don't make other vampires
0:51:04 you i think you've we've nailed that one
0:51:07 home for you yeah that one should be
0:51:08 pretty obvious for you i think but you
0:51:10 can't make kindred without the prince's
0:51:12 permission
0:51:13 if we're going by the old traditions the
0:51:16 vampire that makes another vampire and
0:51:18 the vampire was made usually i both put
0:51:20 to death that's final death
0:51:23 that's why
0:51:24 johnny and miles were so vested in
0:51:26 trying to keep you alive and then on top
0:51:29 of that
0:51:30 not killing other vampires it's the flip
0:51:32 side if don't make them is don't kill
0:51:33 them not without specific
0:51:36 permission again or if there is that's
0:51:39 the right of destruction we got a little
0:51:41 bit of a pass today because technically
0:51:43 you know how we were talking about how
0:51:44 settites aren't actually in the
0:51:45 camarilla and not the sabbat they're
0:51:48 something else the traditions apply to
0:51:50 the camarilla
0:51:51 technically the domain thing if someone
0:51:53 is found wandering in another prince's
0:51:55 domain
0:51:56 they
0:51:57 are not necessarily obligated to keep
0:51:59 them alive for questioning it's good
0:52:01 policy because you never know who you're
0:52:03 going to piss off but
0:52:05 you want to go ask for hospitality yeah
0:52:07 things like that uh and that's why you
0:52:08 shouldn't leave this domain
0:52:10 is because you don't know yet whose
0:52:12 domain you're walking into and you
0:52:13 haven't called ahead to make
0:52:14 reservations and make sure that your
0:52:16 bidet is ready or whatever it is the
0:52:17 harpies actually do
0:52:20 yeah yeah if someone like miles would
0:52:22 wander around he might be in a little
0:52:23 bit better shape because he's he pulls
0:52:26 some water in new haven so other princes
0:52:29 might be
0:52:30 [Music]
0:52:31 unwilling to
0:52:33 touch him somebody like you
0:52:36 yeah you're barely being tolerated here
0:52:38 i think they'd have a
0:52:39 free reign to uh pick you apart
0:52:42 elsewhere yeah to be fair we'll be
0:52:44 teaching you this and then in the end
0:52:46 you'll be able to
0:52:47 know who to contact or even in this
0:52:49 domain or another one to you want to
0:52:52 get from one domain to another you don't
0:52:54 have to get everything out today right
0:52:57 but there are courtesies and niceties
0:52:59 and such like me right now let's stick
0:53:01 to stick to new haven
0:53:04 um
0:53:06 and to the creatures
0:53:08 and traditions that i need to know about
0:53:10 is that all the traditions um
0:53:13 my dear prince and his domain
0:53:15 and is for accounting you know what that
0:53:17 is yes
0:53:18 um
0:53:20 his hospitality
0:53:22 somewhat like toleration
0:53:24 yeah
0:53:25 you see a good example
0:53:27 i made a pretty decent
0:53:30 name for myself being able to travel
0:53:32 between domains
0:53:34 and the thing you really got to keep in
0:53:35 mind about that
0:53:37 is that a domain it's not just feeding
0:53:39 territory it's
0:53:40 the prince is like a medieval prince
0:53:43 their rules go if they decide that the
0:53:46 whole domain wears bread on saturdays
0:53:48 that's his law you wear red on saturdays
0:53:51 but
0:53:52 when you read your domain you can ask
0:53:54 for hospitality and
0:53:57 it is tradition
0:53:58 that that is given to outsiders
0:54:01 it's not always which is why you want to
0:54:03 be careful and
0:54:05 it helps to pull some weight
0:54:07 but
0:54:08 hospitality is respected and once it's
0:54:10 given
0:54:12 is not broken unless the person breaks
0:54:16 that trust first does that make sense
0:54:18 yes it does
0:54:20 i think i only have a couple more
0:54:23 questions that i know to ask right now
0:54:25 um
0:54:27 the first being
0:54:30 you mentioned
0:54:31 the
0:54:32 weird skinless beast before when yeah
0:54:36 what are they i haven't seen it
0:54:39 there are
0:54:41 we mentioned the sabbat and how there
0:54:43 are clans there that don't exist yes
0:54:45 some of them are
0:54:47 what we call zamitsy and what they can
0:54:50 do is work flesh like
0:54:53 a sculptor would work
0:54:54 clay
0:54:55 and they're the kind that would
0:54:58 embrace monstrosity trying to make
0:55:00 themselves they might embrace a human
0:55:02 and turn them into a monstrosity
0:55:05 they might embrace an animal or glorify
0:55:08 an animal like i said i i haven't seen
0:55:11 this one that you've got but i have
0:55:15 i've been close
0:55:17 to is amitsy before
0:55:19 and the things that they make they have
0:55:21 all kinds of weird names for them
0:55:24 but they
0:55:26 they treat them like
0:55:29 hunting dogs or hounds
0:55:31 cree all kinds of monstrosities that
0:55:33 they use for
0:55:35 all kinds of things
0:55:37 making war
0:55:38 hunting
0:55:40 sometimes just for fun shock factor does
0:55:43 that mean they're coming if wind found
0:55:46 one
0:55:48 so theoretically
0:55:50 there it's something to consider because
0:55:53 i hope not i hope not to but the animals
0:55:56 in east rock park are it's very close
0:56:00 and it's not a good sign
0:56:02 i know they they're frightened they're
0:56:05 quiet and i found the one i found one
0:56:09 stuck in a pit trap so that means
0:56:10 someone knows enough about them
0:56:13 that they're making traps for escaped
0:56:15 ones
0:56:16 and then there's the one that's in my
0:56:17 fridge
0:56:19 which is
0:56:20 dead both of them are dead completely as
0:56:23 far as i can tell neil kind of frowns
0:56:26 and starts chewing on his lower lip
0:56:28 what killed the other one
0:56:29 it fell into a basically a tiger trap
0:56:32 it was a spike pit there's two so you
0:56:34 have two in your fridge i have one in my
0:56:36 fridge wait who put a spike pit in the
0:56:38 middle that's what i would like to know
0:56:40 because i think someone is consciously
0:56:42 making them
0:56:43 the same person
0:56:45 trying to trap them as a as who would be
0:56:47 making them or they escape and he wants
0:56:49 to have a
0:56:50 plan b
0:56:51 how ill-timed
0:56:53 we really need to take a look at this
0:56:55 thing
0:56:56 we do don't know if we have time tonight
0:56:59 i am going to go back to my house
0:57:01 tonight and i'm going to stop by the
0:57:04 tiger trap
0:57:05 and see if it's still there i guess if
0:57:07 it's still there i'm going to grab that
0:57:08 one too and put it in the fridge with
0:57:10 the
0:57:11 of others there's a zamitsi
0:57:13 making things out there that means that
0:57:16 we have a whole pack of sabot right i
0:57:19 understand we don't have a loan but we
0:57:21 also have this problem with daylight and
0:57:23 that is coming
0:57:25 raven my former primogen has a lead on
0:57:28 some of this
0:57:30 we're gonna need to talk to her because
0:57:31 she is aware of
0:57:33 some folks in the area
0:57:35 who may be up to some of this
0:57:37 oh if you can make any phone calls you
0:57:39 wish from here but
0:57:40 oh raven i just do not recommend it at
0:57:43 this point i don't know if there's more
0:57:44 settings running around and right just
0:57:46 don't have a lot of time before dawn
0:57:48 miles is right
0:57:50 she's she's low on blood
0:57:52 help i'm low on blood yep
0:57:55 the sun tights are probably all
0:57:57 in a tizzy we can't afford to just be
0:57:59 tromping around
0:58:01 we really we really should just stick it
0:58:02 out here for the night don't hide in the
0:58:04 sewers sewers neil sort of like looks up
0:58:07 as if he just had a thought
0:58:09 uh yeah
0:58:10 we were talking before about um
0:58:13 monsters in new haven
0:58:15 uh sewers are shaw's territory
0:58:18 and
0:58:19 i'm welcome down there
0:58:21 they like me but uh he wasn't joking
0:58:23 about gators
0:58:25 gators are do they have anything to do
0:58:27 with the jihad he was mentioning
0:58:30 jihadist oh man that'd be funny
0:58:32 different jihad is
0:58:34 the political game of vampires which is
0:58:36 much
0:58:37 longer than the one most humans deal
0:58:39 with it is
0:58:41 stretches centuries and
0:58:43 everyone is a piece by looking shaw in
0:58:45 the eye today and
0:58:47 saying yeah i i'm going to play the game
0:58:49 and
0:58:50 i'm going to accept it it's sort of a
0:58:53 i don't know how much you you know i
0:58:56 don't want to oversell it and miles
0:58:58 isn't going to oversell himself but uh
0:59:00 he stuck his neck out real hard today to
0:59:02 make sure that you're okay
0:59:04 it's an opening shooter he didn't stick
0:59:06 his neck out at all
0:59:08 he he looked shaw in the eye and said
0:59:10 i'm going to play the game
0:59:11 oh i thought you meant no shaw didn't
0:59:13 you miles no i'm talking about miles oh
0:59:16 no no no
0:59:18 thank you i don't know man you get
0:59:19 really up like close up with shaw a lot
0:59:22 of they all
0:59:23 chill with they like me
0:59:25 but you're a likeable guy it means that
0:59:28 i did their clan a favor neil what game
0:59:30 did i agree to play you didn't agree to
0:59:32 play anything it's the stupidest game
0:59:35 well shaw looked back at miles and said
0:59:37 we all play and if you're part of the
0:59:38 club yet again i've taken responsibility
0:59:40 for something is this game important
0:59:43 yes and no
0:59:45 it's important to miles
0:59:47 miles what does this mean it means that
0:59:49 things are going to get more complicated
0:59:51 for me a lot earlier than i originally
0:59:53 intended what does shaw have to do with
0:59:55 that he's been playing for a long time
0:59:58 don't dance around look he's a bishop
1:00:01 explain what it is
1:00:03 unfortunately everyone keeps talking
1:00:05 over me
1:00:08 we finally get your beast out a little
1:00:10 bit there bud thank you what i was
1:00:12 saying is that the fact that he is a
1:00:14 player in the game he
1:00:16 collects boons as you heard from
1:00:18 weathers
1:00:19 and elsa and others and he is
1:00:22 gaining power due to this
1:00:25 he is
1:00:26 gaining control over others and their
1:00:28 actions because of these boons that
1:00:30 keeping
1:00:31 he collects and takes
1:00:33 and now that i'm in the game
1:00:35 he's going to see me as either a threat
1:00:37 or an ally and hasn't decided which yet
1:00:40 but we did threaten him so
1:00:42 probably not
1:00:44 every great start
1:00:45 everybody's trying to you know if you
1:00:47 play the jihad everybody's trying to
1:00:49 claw their way up the tower there's only
1:00:51 room for a few at the top it's the
1:00:53 predator game of predators essentially
1:00:56 and i think what my justicar xavier did
1:00:59 was basically to say i'm not playing
1:01:01 anymore there are bigger things
1:01:03 except by doing that it's still playing
1:01:05 the game to a certain degree
1:01:07 it doesn't sound like there's a way out
1:01:09 of the game that is
1:01:11 you're starting to get it yeah
1:01:13 it's just being in the structure of the
1:01:16 camarilla
1:01:17 not
1:01:18 not just the camarilla
1:01:21 everything
1:01:22 the the world the
1:01:25 uh just
1:01:27 the politics of the humans the things
1:01:29 going on there the it's about control
1:01:32 and one person controls everything
1:01:35 that person being sure
1:01:38 shaw would love that
1:01:40 shaw's big around here
1:01:42 but he is a small fish in a gigantic
1:01:44 pond i heard it described as a wheel
1:01:46 once
1:01:47 is it your same poet friend
1:01:49 yeah my buddy kabir he describes it all
1:01:52 as a wheel the whole world
1:01:54 and when you're on different parts of
1:01:56 the wheel you view it very differently
1:01:59 but it's trying to figure out
1:02:00 where the actual power is
1:02:03 and what the wheel is doing
1:02:05 and what road
1:02:07 the wheel is turning down and you want
1:02:09 to get as close as you can to be in the
1:02:11 hub and to be very careful about the
1:02:14 things that aren't on the wheel
1:02:17 and are very jealous about it and also
1:02:20 i'm not getting caught underneath the
1:02:21 wheel and crushed into paste
1:02:25 i think i get it probably not but that's
1:02:27 all right
1:02:28 i think you know about as much as i do i
1:02:30 mean none of us are players
1:02:32 except for miles now well by definition
1:02:35 we're all players whether we want to be
1:02:36 or not and being that you're closely
1:02:39 involved with me
1:02:40 you are no i i get it i was i'm just
1:02:43 trying to give perspective i appreciate
1:02:44 the compliment win but i'm pretty sure
1:02:46 i'm a piece
1:02:47 i know you're a tool
1:02:49 a white smile cracks
1:02:51 i lean forward and put a hand up for a
1:02:53 high five with nguyen with everything
1:02:55 that we're facing the
1:02:57 satellites the
1:02:59 samichi is that how you say it it's
1:03:01 amazing there's
1:03:02 so you're going to find out real quick
1:03:04 that none of us know how to pronounce
1:03:05 anything the same way
1:03:07 i know this ain't a tradition
1:03:09 but some a word the wise yes don't talk
1:03:13 about the sabbat
1:03:15 when you're in amongst the camarilla
1:03:18 they get real
1:03:19 real
1:03:21 upset hearing about things like that
1:03:23 it's like going to a fancy dinner party
1:03:25 and you're talking about a subject that
1:03:27 they turn their nose up to
1:03:29 except they might uh do more than just
1:03:31 throw you out of the dinner party
1:03:33 no talking about the sabbat at elysium
1:03:36 lots of illusions are allowed though
1:03:38 the thing i don't know has anyone
1:03:40 explained to you what an elysium
1:03:41 actually is we covered some of the brief
1:03:43 details earlier tonight but
1:03:46 essentially it is
1:03:49 a neutral zone
1:03:51 that is
1:03:52 ever no fighting that's why the weapons
1:03:55 were an issue
1:03:57 and everyone comes together and talk and
1:04:00 that's usually where the prince presents
1:04:01 himself makes proclamations it's a
1:04:05 it's functionally a demilitarized zone
1:04:08 it is a place where it's also a
1:04:10 tradition that's outside of the
1:04:11 camarilla the camarilla still are the
1:04:13 only ones that still uphold the elysiums
1:04:16 but
1:04:17 anybody's actually allowed as long as
1:04:20 they respect the hospitality being given
1:04:22 so we could be at elysium and
1:04:25 could walk in
1:04:27 that seems possible yes yeah and they
1:04:30 would be
1:04:31 under the protections of elysium until
1:04:33 they chose to violate it not likely to
1:04:36 uh and has happened in the past
1:04:38 is just trying to goad you
1:04:41 into
1:04:42 breaking elysium first
1:04:45 they'll insult you they'll threaten you
1:04:48 they'll insinuate this is not just
1:04:50 settings this is whoever as long as they
1:04:52 have the power to do so and the settings
1:04:55 in the city
1:04:56 have
1:04:58 pull with uh the prince
1:05:00 say anything to get your blood up so
1:05:01 that you make the first mistake because
1:05:03 if you violate elysium
1:05:05 that's why you will forfeit and you've
1:05:07 lost that's why i don't come it's part
1:05:09 of the reasons why they are
1:05:11 brazen enough to attack in the domain
1:05:13 is because they do have enough pull but
1:05:15 nominally when you are in elysium you
1:05:18 should not fear harm coming to you
1:05:20 directly physically
1:05:22 you are
1:05:24 you stared down shaw tonight that's
1:05:26 pretty good it's a good start i have no
1:05:28 doubt that if someone tries to get your
1:05:30 hackles up you're gonna be fine for now
1:05:32 until they learn where your hackles are
1:05:37 is that what that is yeah the hackles
1:05:39 are just a kind of a sign
1:05:41 until they find
1:05:43 where to hit you to get your hackles up
1:05:45 yes there you go thank you miles very
1:05:47 good i appreciate that but
1:05:50 if shaw and the jihad is another thing
1:05:53 that we ought to be handling
1:05:55 the said
1:05:56 that
1:05:57 michi uh
1:05:59 what do we tackle first
1:06:01 well the nights are gonna be interesting
1:06:03 i have a monster in my fridge and
1:06:05 another in my yard i feel like that
1:06:07 should take some priority probably that
1:06:10 seems reasonable especially with those
1:06:11 other signs and get out of and go
1:06:14 outside of the main town would probably
1:06:16 be i
1:06:17 think our very first task
1:06:19 is to listen to some music and try and
1:06:22 make sure that you have a much easier
1:06:24 time feeding than last
1:06:27 do i
1:06:29 have to or can i just
1:06:31 i don't want to hurt anyone again it
1:06:32 would be good if you could learn with
1:06:34 all of us here to watch you
1:06:36 don't worry kid i'll make sure it goes
1:06:38 all right
1:06:40 thank you johnny
