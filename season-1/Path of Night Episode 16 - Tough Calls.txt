0:00:45 they managed to capture the xantosa when
0:00:47 bruta fully entrances him

0:01:08 waiting you see brita marching
0:01:10 vito zantosa towards the vehicle and as
0:01:14 he kind of draws closer with his hands
0:01:16 over his head and obeying your
0:01:18 instructions to to keep your hands where
0:01:20 you can see them uh you notice that
0:01:21 brita pauses
0:01:23 calculating takes a knee crouching so
0:01:26 that she's harder to detect and then
0:01:29 after training the assault rifle on him
0:01:31 she opens fire directly into his back
0:01:33 bullet move exit wounds
0:01:36 riddle his chest and he collapses to the
0:01:39 ground and she quickly draws her sidearm

0:01:47 starts charging everyone can hear the
0:01:49 gunshots i mean i'm following right

0:02:20 okay finish
0:02:22 i'm just gonna go ahead
0:02:26 11 13 20 20. 20 for my initiative okay
0:02:30 uh you're actually at the top of
0:02:31 initiative

0:02:38 space 10 plus larry who's going on an
0:02:41 18. i'm a tan uh yeah you are charged up

0:02:47 range okay i charge toward her full
0:02:49 goddamn correction better yes there
0:02:52 isn't a whole lot going on as far as
0:02:54 thoughts this is all like one fluid
0:02:56 motion it's like taking a deep breath
0:02:58 her eyes go cold
0:02:59 and
0:03:00 she is absolutely just trained on the
0:03:02 objective another willpower spent on the
0:03:04 attacker she's got plenty due to calling
0:03:06 down the hunter's moon god damn it
0:03:08 eight nine ten successes to hit she's
0:03:10 still firing at zentanza
0:03:12 uh so that's gonna be uh 14 dice of
0:03:15 damage
0:03:18 the report of a pistol goes off in the
0:03:20 snow you can see like blood seeping and
0:03:23 he goes still better you drop the gun in
0:03:26 faint and all of a sudden it's very
0:03:29 quiet
0:03:30 on the dark snowing night
0:03:35 johnny's gonna rush over uh to to veto
0:03:38 if i gave him vitae is there any chance
0:03:41 that he might still make it through this
0:03:43 if you give him a bite you'll be
0:03:44 embracing it i know but i have i have
0:03:46 right of progeny right now you do
0:03:49 yeah we need we need him alive
0:03:52 we need him talking johnny in a moment
0:03:54 of desperation
0:03:56 cuts himself open and johnny uses his
0:03:58 axe and runs his runs his wrist along or
0:04:02 his arm along the uh the blade of the
0:04:04 axe drops it and cradles his head and
0:04:07 kind of starts flexing so that so that
0:04:10 some of his blood actually starts
0:04:12 dripping down dead his body reacts
0:04:15 drinking how much volatile we have to
0:04:16 give him the blood one
0:04:18 so i am
0:04:19 seeing that johnny's doing that i kind
0:04:21 of like nod and then i kick the gun out
0:04:23 of britta's hand like from already
0:04:25 dropped it well like i take it away i
0:04:27 kick it away disarm her
0:04:29 through gritted teeth put her in [ __ ]
0:04:32 yeah yeah of the
0:04:34 zip ties are in my jacket yeah
0:04:36 grab them and just like what the hell is
0:04:38 she i don't [ __ ] know get
0:04:41 gone
0:04:42 and then i like i will drag her into the
0:04:45 the vehicle and then zip tie her legs
0:04:48 while all this is going on having no
0:04:50 idea that johnny was gonna embrace this
0:04:51 guy neil quietly
0:04:54 opens the like trunk area and grabs the
0:04:57 presumably document bag that you left
0:05:00 behind i put it on i put it in the car
0:05:02 yep and just sits in the back in
0:05:04 obfuscate and starts rifling through
0:05:06 seeing if any of this can be salvaged by
0:05:08 what's in the bag when you go through
0:05:10 what's in the bag uh it looks like
0:05:13 actually i'm sorry what languages can
0:05:14 you read english okay it looks like
0:05:17 actually like a lot of pictures of cuny
0:05:20 form cover tablets and like old
0:05:23 parchments and it's it's just it's a
0:05:25 very confusing eclectic collection of
0:05:28 occult stuff you see
0:05:30 you need less linguistics to read it and
0:05:32 more academics to read it
0:05:34 kind of like a wombo combo of academics
0:05:36 occult and linguistics
0:05:38 gives like a frustrated sigh looking
0:05:41 through it and stays sitting in the back
0:05:43 uh he does have some notes uh but that's
0:05:45 all i'm gonna go through that like some
0:05:47 eastern block language you're not even
0:05:49 sure yeah he gives a frustrated sigh
0:05:51 closes the bag tucks into an arm and
0:05:53 just stays in the like the trunk area in
0:05:55 obfuscate okay
0:05:57 we got to get out of here
0:06:00 i'm ready for one more fight but if we
0:06:02 go into a fight i'm not coming out of it

0:06:29 up at him after i put him in the car
0:06:33 uh johnny kind of reaches out and kind
0:06:35 of like puts a hand like up on your
0:06:37 massive overgrown head kind of like
0:06:39 pulls you close and like touches the
0:06:41 forehead yep when wind leans in and
0:06:44 bonks her head against his get out of
0:06:45 here stay safe it's got like the
0:06:47 solidness of like when you bump into
0:06:49 like a bull or a cow like just
0:06:51 muscle like that that humans just aren't
0:06:54 really made for neil if you're here we

0:07:47 ability to just be like slip bonds kill
0:07:48 you all totally possible
0:07:50 yeah especially since zip ties i know

0:08:56 no
0:08:57 we're not ready for that we're not even
0:08:59 we can't take it to the prince the dope
0:09:01 as far as the domain is concerned we
0:09:02 weren't supposed to be there the
0:09:04 archon's gonna watch our back but who
0:09:06 knows how long it's gonna be before he
0:09:07 actually comes to comes to help us out
0:09:09 yeah but when those brujas show up and
0:09:11 he's not around and there's evidence of
0:09:13 a gun fight they're going to come after
0:09:14 us immediately oh that reminds me we
0:09:16 need to call them we can go to amaya to
0:09:18 the an orcs yeah that's not going to
0:09:20 look good either
0:09:22 yeah but it's gonna take them time to
0:09:24 investigate that and all the bruja that
0:09:26 went with amaya are not in shaw's pocket
0:09:28 we could go wait at win's place i think
0:09:30 nobody knows where that is except for us
0:09:32 and
0:09:33 the gangrel
0:09:34 i got it i know where we can go where we
0:09:37 could bring bretta home it's a cafe it's
0:09:40 closed down nobody knows where it is i
0:09:42 had to dig real hard to find it and it
0:09:43 was only because i was looking it's not
0:09:45 connected to any of us as far as
0:09:46 anybody's concerned but it's empty
0:09:48 johnny shoots a look over to miles
0:09:50 sounds pretty good to me all right where
0:09:52 am i going i give johnny directions to
0:09:55 the cafe okay
0:09:57 you guys head to the cafe to lay the low
0:09:59 until you hear back from the archon
0:10:04 [Music]
0:10:06 once they leave
0:10:08 takes a minute to try and assume one of
0:10:10 her new animal forms it does not work
0:10:12 when that doesn't work she goes about
0:10:15 brushing away some of the evidence that
0:10:17 people were here okay so you kind of
0:10:18 start moving handling the snow let me
0:10:20 give me a a survival check survival plus
0:10:23 uh intelligence
0:10:27 if you still have a little party the
0:10:28 extra willpower you're probably down at
0:10:29 this point oh no i do i will spend one
0:10:32 might as well they go away at the end of
0:10:33 the night anyways so uh two successes
0:10:36 you clean up actually really well in the
0:10:38 distance you can hear
0:10:39 extremely loud
0:10:42 biscuit music and
0:10:44 like the occasional gunshot as these
0:10:47 expensive suvs are poorly driven into
0:10:51 the area
0:10:52 and piling out is over a dozen vampires
0:10:57 what kind of wooded area is nearby uh so
0:10:59 the woods
0:11:01 you know it's actually a decent amount
0:11:02 of forest area a lot of the trees around
0:11:04 here are like dead like diseased trees
0:11:07 when i guess for lack of a more
0:11:10 terrifying word scampers into the woods
0:11:15 lumbers no because she moves quicker
0:11:16 than a lumber oh god you're right and
0:11:19 she's not expecting to find animal life
0:11:21 around here yeah it's animals avoid this
0:11:23 place yeah this is this is the place
0:11:25 they avoid and for good reason but as
0:11:27 you as you're heading into the woods
0:11:29 like off of the distance once you're
0:11:31 like safely away
0:11:32 from she does turn to watch
0:11:35 what comes of this once you're safely
0:11:37 away they get out uh it looks like
0:11:39 they're prepping weapons they have a ton
0:11:41 of automatic weapons kind of like you
0:11:43 guys did and there's way more of them so
0:11:46 it looks way more [ __ ]
0:11:49 we look professional yeah
0:11:52 crack team in and out so you know some
0:11:54 parts of nail art looks like them
0:11:56 prepping to storm the mansion
0:12:01 [Music]
0:12:04 you play a single phone call yeah okay
0:12:06 i'm calling sean
0:12:08 there is an answer is this miles uh
0:12:11 miles are you alive of course
0:12:14 wow

0:12:19 yeah well too bad for them what you're
0:12:21 calling for miles call your people off
0:12:23 it's too late too late
0:12:26 why would it be too late because you
0:12:27 can't get what you want anymore no
0:12:30 no
0:12:31 why is that i don't think he's there
0:12:33 anymore
0:12:34 oh how insightful miles
0:12:37 you want speakerphone by chance no why
0:12:39 would i risk that oh because you're
0:12:40 going to want to hide this from your
0:12:42 friend but
0:12:43 we did find his daughter
0:12:46 and
0:12:47 if
0:12:47 if i'm going down
0:12:50 there's going to be to be a new
0:12:51 nosferatu in town
0:12:54 maybe she can
0:12:56 inherit what i leave behind
0:12:58 [Music]
0:12:59 a loyal child
0:13:01 maybe i'll send her to the sabbath
0:13:04 i did hear that the killing spree is on
0:13:07 their way
0:13:08 and they tend to use shovelheads if you
0:13:10 know what i mean
0:13:12 johnny knows what i mean no doubt
0:13:14 so what are you telling me
0:13:16 i'm telling you
0:13:17 that you have something that i want
0:13:19 and i have something that you want
0:13:22 and maybe
0:13:23 i still can get what i want
0:13:27 i'll let you think it over hangs up
0:13:36 what shall i have to say
0:13:38 we have a complication
0:13:40 yeah obviously what did you say what
0:13:41 kind of complication
0:13:43 stop the car
0:13:44 johnny keeps driving stop the [ __ ]
0:13:46 car
0:13:48 why because i can't have you driving
0:13:51 when i tell you this
0:13:52 johnny kind of closes his eyes
0:13:55 open some really kind of carefully
0:13:57 we got to get to where we're going
0:13:59 then you can tell me what's going on but
0:14:01 i just told him to call off his people
0:14:02 because i can't have them being we can't
0:14:05 we can't afford to lose them even if
0:14:06 there are shaw's that's debatable
0:14:09 now with everything shit's coming man
0:14:11 we're gonna have to play this
0:14:12 politically from here on in we have a
0:14:13 lot of [ __ ] going on here
0:14:17 you need to tell me what's going on
0:14:19 after we get to this cafe
0:14:22 put santosa and brit in a safe place i
0:14:24 am not in any condition to be hearing
0:14:26 any kind of bad news right now oh great
0:14:28 that's the thing he gives you a look of
0:14:30 like don't [ __ ] push me fine but
0:14:34 he's expecting a call back you can see
0:14:35 that he
0:14:36 johnny thinks he knows what you're about
0:14:38 to say but
0:14:39 hearing it vocalized would probably
0:14:42 break his last bit of self-control
0:14:47 [Music]
0:14:49 bretta
0:14:50 you wake up what do i last remember
0:14:54 uh heading to the car i do not recall
0:14:57 shooting anyone no
0:14:58 brita wakes up but her first movements
0:15:01 are towards the zip ties uh you kind of
0:15:03 see her hands switch before anything
0:15:05 else
0:15:06 as she gains more consciousness
0:15:08 she
0:15:09 automatically struggles at the zip ties
0:15:13 tries to sit up uh depends on how she's
0:15:15 tied you're on the difficult that is
0:15:17 with your hands and your legs zip tied
0:15:19 and
0:15:19 if i start noticing movement i'm going
0:15:22 to dominate her as soon as beretta
0:15:24 starts to move you'll kind of nervously
0:15:25 from from the trunk it's just like uh
0:15:28 hey
0:15:29 guys brett is awake yeah and then
0:15:31 basically just
0:15:32 still
0:15:35 so sick successes her hands
0:15:38 stop resisting her turbines
0:15:40 what's going on you [ __ ] just killed
0:15:42 zantosa that's what's [ __ ] going on
0:15:45 and i'm not pleased

0:16:15 truth to all my questions and you will
0:16:18 respond to my whims
0:16:20 until i am done with you and i will tell
0:16:24 you when that is
0:16:25 while she's talking
0:16:27 from the back seat with the gun still
0:16:29 leveled at zentosa
0:16:31 i'm just gonna wash her aura
0:16:33 okay
0:16:34 [Music]
0:16:38 seven
0:16:42 to watch her aura for like her emotional
0:16:45 states and stuff i got two successes
0:16:47 which should give me like her mate her
0:16:48 primary color and general emotional
0:16:51 state right now
0:16:52 at five success as a greater the vampire
0:16:54 can implant nearly any sort of command
0:16:56 her emotional her main emotional state
0:16:59 at this moment is
0:17:00 turmoil confusion
0:17:03 you what you see
0:17:04 is uh
0:17:06 modeled shifting shades
0:17:09 of uh
0:17:11 orange
0:17:12 that kind of roll and
0:17:14 kind of move when
0:17:16 she's targeted with uh miles's use of
0:17:19 dominate
0:17:20 everything kind of goes still for a
0:17:22 moment
0:17:22 and then it kind of continues along the
0:17:25 same pattern that it was using before
0:17:27 okay and then as soon as i know that's
0:17:29 taken
0:17:30 who are you
0:17:32 either brita or brittany ashcroft
0:17:35 what just happened the last 20 minutes
0:17:38 i must have been unconscious
0:17:41 all i remember is
0:17:43 is walking back to the car after after
0:17:46 everything and then it just goes black
0:17:49 what do you know that you're not telling
0:17:51 us
0:17:52 i was helping neil keep a secret but now
0:17:54 he's told everyone and
0:17:57 miles she doesn't know she's scared
0:18:00 right now confused
0:18:02 just as much as the rest of us
0:18:04 let me tell you something
0:18:06 you just unloaded a full clip in a
0:18:07 santosa followed by drawing your firearm
0:18:09 and firing twice into him
0:18:11 after crouching and taking the most
0:18:13 advantageous position you could
0:18:15 you are now bound in the car
0:18:19 with a gun trained at you
0:18:21 can you see where we are at
0:18:23 i don't disagree with where you're at
0:18:25 great
0:18:27 i don't know what's going on here yet
0:18:29 and i don't like it i don't like it
0:18:31 either
0:18:33 i don't
0:18:34 want to
0:18:35 be like
0:18:36 this
0:18:39 maybe it's time to start searching and
0:18:42 figuring out what's blocking you
0:18:45 at around this point
0:18:46 johnny you pull up to the location
0:18:51 [Music]
0:18:54 when
0:18:55 they do begin heading out as the
0:18:58 caravan starts moving away
0:19:00 wind
0:19:01 now actually does start lumbering
0:19:03 further into the woods
0:19:05 she tries to put up her
0:19:07 brodian eyes and she starts looking for
0:19:10 raptors predators you see one predator
0:19:14 raven
0:19:15 i
0:19:16 was looking for you
0:19:18 just kind of standing among the trees in
0:19:20 the dark
0:19:21 eyes glinting bright red as she watches
0:19:24 you
0:19:25 we need to fix this
0:19:28 when
0:19:29 the world
0:19:31 is dying
0:19:33 and this
0:19:34 what you see now
0:19:36 is
0:19:37 a piece
0:19:39 such a small
0:19:41 small piece
0:19:43 of the thing that is responsible
0:19:46 i understand
0:19:47 your pain
0:19:49 and your fear
0:19:50 and your turmoil
0:19:53 but in time all that remains
0:19:56 is the mission
0:19:59 we're not ready
0:20:00 you are not ready your friends weren't
0:20:02 ready you did what you did because of
0:20:05 politics
0:20:06 i did what i did to protect the people
0:20:09 that i care about are they any safer
0:20:12 yes
0:20:13 yes they are then you have grossly
0:20:15 misunderstood your situation and i think
0:20:17 you have grossly misunderstood what it
0:20:19 means to be a gangrel you whimpering
0:20:21 little [ __ ] to be a gangrel is to
0:20:24 survive
0:20:26 you're not surviving of course i am you
0:20:29 are moving look at you what
0:20:32 i know what i am
0:20:35 do you really think gallivanting around
0:20:37 with a quarter in the camera is going to
0:20:39 solve this
0:20:40 do you really think
0:20:42 morality
0:20:43 is
0:20:45 the compass you should use when
0:20:46 navigating this i think it's better than
0:20:49 hiding like a [ __ ] coward
0:20:52 change what you can and save the bigger
0:20:54 fights
0:20:56 there's a difference
0:20:57 between seeking to change something and
0:20:59 then now
0:21:01 feudally struggling
0:21:03 and waiting
0:21:05 learning
0:21:06 and doing what it takes to actually
0:21:09 strike at the heart of this
0:21:11 how long have you been waiting
0:21:14 we've been investigating
0:21:16 veda santosa for some time so maybe you
0:21:19 could have taken it out before this but
0:21:22 what xavier found blows everything out
0:21:24 of the water
0:21:26 this
0:21:27 this thing that i've been struggling
0:21:29 with for years now
0:21:31 is just a piece of a much greater puzzle
0:21:36 do you really think
0:21:38 that this mansion
0:21:41 burning it trying to eliminate it is
0:21:43 actually going to change the outcome
0:21:45 this mansion might be our best chance of
0:21:47 understanding what it is that we're
0:21:48 dealing with
0:21:49 it's not gotten you very far has it it
0:21:52 has
0:21:54 then how
0:21:55 do we fix it you're asking questions to
0:21:59 which there will never be an answer
0:22:01 there is no fixing it
0:22:03 there is surviving wind just kind of
0:22:05 glares at her
0:22:07 as though she is
0:22:08 her definition of survival is so
0:22:10 radically different from what wins is
0:22:13 that this is just never going to be a
0:22:15 point on which they can contend
0:22:17 and with that win just kind of shakes
0:22:19 her head
0:22:21 and charges at raven
0:22:23 and tries to headbutt her she just
0:22:26 collapses into a fog
0:22:29 coward once again
0:22:31 and reforms kind of like up in the trees
0:22:33 crouched watching with like
0:22:36 in a way that like a cat stares at a
0:22:39 mouse
0:22:40 you're wasting your energy
0:22:42 i've got three days of this fun
0:22:45 and then what
0:22:48 and then maybe i'll have time on my
0:22:49 hands to think about how to fix this
0:22:52 since you
0:22:53 won't fix this this piece of
0:22:55 of something so vast yes because if we
0:22:58 learn how to fix something smaller we
0:23:00 can learn how to fix the bigger one
0:23:03 you start on a smaller scale that's how
0:23:05 science [ __ ] works do you think this
0:23:07 is a matter for science i think that
0:23:09 everything is a matter for science and
0:23:11 magic in equal parts
0:23:13 this is foretold in the book of not go
0:23:16 [ __ ] yourself
0:23:18 like rigorously with a cattle prod
0:23:21 sorry when
0:23:22 but this isn't going to go the way you
0:23:24 want it to
0:23:25 and
0:23:26 i will keep my people safe your people
0:23:31 your people
0:23:33 have placed their trust in xavier
0:23:35 myself and others
0:23:38 maybe that trust was misplaced raven
0:23:41 because if your solution is to wait
0:23:44 then that's the wrong choice this can't
0:23:46 wait anymore then by all means act now
0:23:50 i hoped
0:23:52 that you'd be more cunning
0:23:54 there's a place for cunning raven
0:23:56 there's a place in cunning wind just
0:23:58 turns and she just like punches the tree
0:24:00 that raven is sitting in before turning
0:24:01 back she's like
0:24:03 all right then tell me what you know
0:24:06 the stanovich family moved something
0:24:08 into the north yeah he blabbed about
0:24:10 that
0:24:11 it's a god a piece of a god it is the
0:24:14 peace
0:24:15 of the corpse
0:24:17 that corpse has been
0:24:20 doing things
0:24:22 underneath new york city
0:24:24 hunting and gathering food growing
0:24:27 though it is dead there is a sentence to
0:24:30 it
0:24:31 it is dangerous
0:24:32 that mansion what's there is just a
0:24:34 piece of it
0:24:35 a hair off the back of a great beast
0:24:38 and what xavier is pursuing is the rest
0:24:40 of it
0:24:41 another piece of it he hopes
0:24:44 but if the stories are true
0:24:47 then thing
0:24:48 is the corpse of the first dragon
0:24:51 yeah he mentioned that too
0:24:53 which means
0:24:54 that if those legends are true
0:24:57 the answers lie in ancient texts the
0:24:59 book of nod secrets of our kind
0:25:02 and those answers will not be found
0:25:03 through the camera and they will not be
0:25:05 found inside of that mansion
0:25:07 can't you see what it's doing to the
0:25:09 realm around it
0:25:11 i know what it's just doing
0:25:13 but can you see it
0:25:15 what's the point of staring at this
0:25:17 so you can maybe understand that maybe
0:25:19 we need to be a little more proactive
0:25:20 about this proactive yeah
0:25:23 i think xavier has made
0:25:25 significant strides in the short period
0:25:27 of time
0:25:29 i wouldn't know
0:25:31 you stayed yeah
0:25:32 because i have people
0:25:34 and that makes me the luckiest gangrel
0:25:36 in the world then you should go see to
0:25:38 your people
0:25:39 not until i have a way to keep them safe
0:25:42 so where do i need to [ __ ] go
0:25:45 she looks at you and makes a social
0:25:47 challenge
0:25:48 uh she kind of hops down and presses her
0:25:50 hand against you
0:25:54 wow
0:25:55 eight
0:25:57 she forces you into your human form and
0:26:00 you may not leave it for eight nights
0:26:02 wind just kind of falls to her knees
0:26:04 because she's just not expecting to
0:26:06 carry the weight of herself again
0:26:09 okay thanks for that
0:26:12 shaking is like just the ghost of a nod
0:26:15 if you share the secrets that i've told
0:26:17 you what you think is so little
0:26:19 we will be haunted by the camera
0:26:22 do not speak of it and she kind of just
0:26:24 turns heading off raven yes
0:26:28 i need more
0:26:29 tell me where to go
0:26:32 when you're ready
0:26:33 and she just kind of goes off
0:26:35 disappearing into the dark
0:26:37 wind just kind of lets out a huge scream
0:26:39 of frustration and just start to lay it
0:26:41 into the tree for as long as she can
0:26:43 yeah it's not great and then when she's
0:26:46 when she is completely exhausted
0:26:48 probably about the time the sun starts
0:26:49 coming up she melts with the earth
0:26:52 before she slips under ground wind just
0:26:55 kind of
0:26:56 cries a little bit and whispers i'm
0:26:58 sorry joey as her head just disappears
0:27:00 under the ground
0:27:07 uh we will cut back uh to the group who
0:27:10 are heading into the cafe now
0:27:13 sorry i ruined everything i'm sorry
0:27:17 inside it's dark no lights are on
0:27:20 there's a very thin film of dust there's
0:27:23 a lot of these like white coverings on
0:27:26 everything kind of meant to kind of like
0:27:28 shield it from dust
0:27:29 and it looks like this place has been
0:27:31 left alone for quite a bit blocks are
0:27:33 secure there's a security system though
0:27:35 it's not active
0:27:37 perhaps then tulsa johnny brings in toe
0:27:39 side of the side
0:27:40 turn to brita come with me
0:27:42 isn't she hog tied yeah i'm kind of i'm
0:27:44 cutting her legs loose
0:27:46 bretta
0:27:47 gets her feet slowly um
0:27:50 unsure of
0:27:52 almost her own steps kind of her own
0:27:54 independent movement
0:27:56 testing her willpower and follows her
0:28:01 and we just move inside and maybe head
0:28:03 towards the basement or something like
0:28:05 that does any of this look familiar
0:28:08 does it no
0:28:10 where are we
0:28:11 this is yours
0:28:12 this is the place
0:28:14 neil found yes bretta
0:28:17 will look very intensely around at
0:28:20 uh what she can see she can't interact
0:28:22 with it with her hands but her eyes are
0:28:24 scanning everything and
0:28:26 there is not a response uh
0:28:29 there's just increasing desperation
0:28:31 neil follows them all in and just starts
0:28:33 looking around the cafe
0:28:35 i own a business that has hidden doors
0:28:38 and
0:28:38 like secret little bunkers and [ __ ] in
0:28:40 it so i'm going to start investigating
0:28:43 this place to see if there's any like
0:28:45 clues lock boxes hollowed out basements
0:28:47 just something give me your wrong dad so
0:28:50 i'm at a minus five still because i
0:28:51 can't heal that [ __ ] because it heals
0:28:53 like ag yeah minus five dice yup so i
0:28:55 have two
0:28:56 i'll spend more power and i'm gonna hold
0:28:58 up heightened senses
0:29:01 tip five
0:29:03 three successes okay with three
0:29:05 successes you kind of make your way
0:29:07 around it looks it's like it's a very
0:29:09 pretty cafe very very modern there's
0:29:12 space where there's like computers set
0:29:14 up
0:29:16 eventually you do find your way to what
0:29:18 looks like maybe like a small security
0:29:20 room
0:29:21 when you open the door to it it actually
0:29:22 opens up to a much larger space than you
0:29:24 would expected and
0:29:27 this area is actually well decorated
0:29:30 much more classy and it kind of has
0:29:32 something of like a speakeasy like quiet
0:29:35 vibe there's like a bar area it
0:29:37 definitely looks like it's meant for
0:29:40 secret weird toreador parties you're not
0:29:42 really sure why why this would be here
0:29:43 but it's certainly here for kindred
0:29:45 affairs
0:29:47 the paperwork said that you bought this
0:29:49 place before new year's
0:29:52 hey check this out go on in okay
0:29:55 let's get santos in and i'm out of the
0:29:57 front
0:29:58 wait i thought i
0:30:00 santosa we have his body okay a little
0:30:03 bit more than that stop okay
0:30:05 brita bites down the curiosity and
0:30:08 goes see where neil is
0:30:10 she looks around nothing familiar in
0:30:12 that either
0:30:13 you look around
0:30:15 you remember
0:30:17 you remember uh
0:30:19 some like a feeling of safety
0:30:21 like you've been here before and you've
0:30:23 laid low here
0:30:25 in fact you kind of like
0:30:27 walk over to the bar
0:30:29 and you find like
0:30:32 a small sleeping bag
0:30:34 and a pistol bretta will walk over to
0:30:37 the bar she'll find those things but she
0:30:40 will
0:30:41 stay take a step back when she sees the
0:30:44 pistol
0:30:45 not willing to get close to it at the
0:30:47 moment but she'll look back after
0:30:51 looking more at the sleeping bag and
0:30:53 gaze lingering on the pistol to kneel
0:30:56 this feels like
0:30:59 a place i've been it's maybe the first
0:31:01 place that
0:31:03 really feels this way i
0:31:06 i think i spent
0:31:07 time
0:31:08 hiding
0:31:10 here
0:31:11 that's what's weird to me
0:31:13 i mean this feels like
0:31:15 a secret kindred gathering spot and i
0:31:17 know i'm a little biased after 30 years
0:31:19 of hanging out in secret kindred
0:31:20 gathering spots but
0:31:22 it feels like a place where kindred hang
0:31:24 out but you bought this place
0:31:27 before you were embraced and it was
0:31:29 already here
0:31:31 but if you've been in here
0:31:33 i feel like i have been timeline's not
0:31:35 really matching up here bro
0:31:37 i'm not accusing you of anything i just
0:31:40 something doesn't track
0:31:42 a lot of things don't track at this
0:31:44 point what time is it right now it's
0:31:47 like 2 a.m 3 a.m
0:31:49 johnny carries santosa into the back
0:31:52 puts him down
0:31:54 pulls out a cigarette lights it kind of
0:31:56 looks around a bit
0:31:59 you guys going to be fine here
0:32:01 i don't know where are you going i need
0:32:03 to feed
0:32:04 you me too
0:32:06 can it hold no
0:32:08 how much is more dangerous to you here
0:32:09 as hungry as i am
0:32:11 looking at him he looks like he might be
0:32:14 about to break into like hunger frenzy
0:32:17 his his fangs are definitely coming in
0:32:19 his his mouth kind of hangs in a low
0:32:21 kind of
0:32:22 open
0:32:23 i mean give yourself like an hour or two
0:32:25 and then come back i don't think we
0:32:27 should be separate tonight that's just
0:32:29 me
0:32:31 i mean i need to
0:32:32 i mean
0:32:33 go together
0:32:35 okay
0:32:36 are you gonna be okay here alone with
0:32:38 britta no offense but
0:32:41 keep the zip ties on me
0:32:43 and zantosa you you okay with the two of
0:32:45 them in here
0:32:47 just be quick
0:32:48 johnny turns on his heel and just heads
0:32:50 out
0:32:51 neil gives like one last
0:32:54 concerned look at the two of them
0:32:56 but then
0:32:58 also is barely in control of himself and
0:33:01 sort of hobbles out the door his chest
0:33:03 still like kind of splayed open
0:33:05 so
0:33:06 would you have you step off
0:33:08 don britta miles
0:33:11 the two of you remain
0:33:12 at british haven and
0:33:15 accompany the corpse of vito zantosa
0:33:19 that you head out to hunt and once
0:33:20 gathered up a group of you hold down
0:33:23 down in british haven for the night go
0:33:25 for the day i'm going to say you guys
0:33:27 gained uh
0:33:29 five traits of blood each just kind of
0:33:31 that's fine going from person to person
0:33:32 i just can't i know it's a lot of work
0:33:34 today i know i can't go to sleep i'm one
0:33:35 because waking up will be real real bad
0:33:39 uh
0:33:40 so i based on what you had said
0:33:43 i guess i will remain at three and heal
0:33:45 myself out of crippled yep we're no
0:33:47 longer crippled and that is it
0:33:50 this sucks
0:33:53 [Music]
0:33:56 the next night starts with
0:33:59 neil
0:34:00 slipping off away from british haven and
0:34:03 looking for wind it isn't long just as
0:34:05 just about as planned when is waiting uh
0:34:08 at our haven she's sitting on her little
0:34:12 army cot she doesn't have a whole lot of
0:34:14 clothes left at this point she has she
0:34:16 pulls out a pair of jeans they don't fit
0:34:18 well there was a fire in here i don't
0:34:20 know if you have anything left there
0:34:20 yeah question
0:34:22 the beast power caused her frenzy um
0:34:25 it's not her beast okay just i wasn't
0:34:27 sure if that actually yeah no when when
0:34:29 someone uh throws their beast
0:34:32 into you it's not the same as you
0:34:33 entertaining yourself so she know no uh
0:34:35 beast feature yeah
0:34:36 so she's sitting in there she's wearing
0:34:38 a pair of very ill-fitting jeans um
0:34:41 some kind of very used pit stained
0:34:44 t-shirt just kind of sitting there with
0:34:47 her head and her hands her knees pulled
0:34:49 up like she's just kind of trying to
0:34:51 make sense of things
0:34:53 neil
0:34:54 just appears
0:34:56 in winshaven uh with his back turned his
0:34:59 hand is over his eyes and he's holding
0:35:00 like a little grocery bag out behind him
0:35:03 towards win i'm decent meal well i
0:35:06 wasn't sure that's why i brought these

0:40:52 you guys kind of like
0:40:54 the night lightens up a little bit and
0:40:56 you guys head over uh to the secret cafe
0:41:00 it's really on the nose name for a cafe
0:41:04 wait that's the name of it no no no
0:41:08 rob is just being unhealthy
0:41:12 [Music]
0:41:16 this is it
0:41:17 they're all probably in the back is it
0:41:19 going to be locked
0:41:20 no i gotta have it okay
0:41:21 all right
0:41:24 uh
0:41:25 walking it's uh there's a
0:41:27 there's a false door in the secret room
0:41:28 in the back
0:41:31 you guys hear the sound of someone
0:41:32 stirring into consciousness
0:41:35 santosa
0:41:36 hungry
0:41:37 britta has been pacing uh back and forth
0:41:41 you can tell she's kind of antsy maybe
0:41:43 kind of hungry but as she hears the
0:41:45 stirring noises just kind of pauses
0:41:48 her hands still in the zip ties i need a
0:41:50 socket
0:41:51 oh neat
0:41:52 yeah actually i as soon as i started
0:41:53 hearing i would watch her and put my
0:41:55 hand on my sword
0:41:58 one success
0:41:59 with one success
0:42:02 you
0:42:03 find yourself suddenly feeling the urge
0:42:06 to
0:42:07 execute orders and to kill
0:42:09 the zantosa
0:42:10 but you're not blindsided this time with
0:42:13 that sudden urge and manage
0:42:15 to resist it and maintain control of
0:42:17 your mental faculties she kind of
0:42:19 shudders and
0:42:21 stiffens and just
0:42:23 sits herself down on the floor
0:42:26 where she was
0:42:27 i'm just standing probably nearby with
0:42:29 like
0:42:30 the hand wrapped around the hill
0:42:32 is it possible that when i went hunting
0:42:35 last night that i was able to get gather
0:42:37 some blood to have for zantosa that's
0:42:40 perfectly fine okay
0:42:41 you should feed him in your blood
0:42:45 what did he do to me
0:42:46 he bites
0:42:48 the second your or your arm is
0:42:49 outstretched he goes straight to your
0:42:51 wrist and bites and starts feeding
0:42:53 i give him a little bit but when he
0:42:55 inevitably he probably starts to try and
0:42:57 take too much i'll grab him by the head
0:42:59 and potence him off you pull him off
0:43:04 and he makes that sound again when you
0:43:06 like manhandle them
0:43:09 johnny goes goes over grabs the the
0:43:11 blood that he collects i imagine he
0:43:13 could maybe get like a
0:43:14 like a jug or something yeah it's like
0:43:16 three traits worth
0:43:17 he takes and she's shrinking you have
0:43:19 made me a vampire
0:43:21 yes
0:43:26 you should be fun
0:43:28 and you
0:43:29 i trusted you
0:43:30 you lived is he still is that what you
0:43:33 call him is he still in trouble yeah
0:43:36 oh he is
0:43:38 i wasn't sure
0:43:40 it's kind of why i've been like sitting
0:43:42 with my sword being like well we'll see
0:43:44 how this goes
0:43:47 i'm
0:43:49 sorry i
0:43:50 don't know why that
0:43:52 happened
0:43:58 your phone rings
0:44:00 watch them
0:44:01 i answer the phone
0:44:03 miles
0:44:04 yeah sure you still have something that
0:44:06 belongs to me
0:44:07 yeah
0:44:08 i'm headed to the elysium
0:44:10 the domain has been made aware of your
0:44:12 actions
0:44:14 but
0:44:16 i can call it off
0:44:18 meet me at the elysium for the exchange
0:44:21 i'll wait two hours
0:44:23 great and if you're not there
0:44:26 i hang up
0:44:27 we're talking to shaw now
0:44:29 i know it's not everybody's favorite
0:44:31 move
0:44:31 but i couldn't let those brew hobbies
0:44:33 slaughter by whatever was in that
0:44:34 basement yeah we should talk about
0:44:36 what's in that basement we have two
0:44:38 hours to meet shaw
0:44:40 wait so the thing hasn't fed
0:44:42 we had a week it has a week
0:44:44 approximately let's give it four days
0:44:46 miles what's the ore or
0:44:48 well one he's turned in my transgression
0:44:52 to the domain though he has zero proof
0:44:54 on that
0:44:55 so good luck
0:44:56 and
0:44:58 neil sort of looks directly at the
0:45:01 zantosa and then back at you like you
0:45:03 might have come to us
0:45:04 miles it's also his word against yours
0:45:07 yeah i know
0:45:08 yes it's a different arena look we'll
0:45:10 handle that when we get there there's a
0:45:12 bigger issue which is
0:45:15 he has your daughter
0:45:19 [Music]
0:45:20 gonna spend that willpower yep
0:45:23 um
0:45:25 neil you might have got a pointed look
0:45:26 at the same time as an appointed get the
0:45:28 hell out of the way look
0:45:31 johnny
0:45:32 stay calm man
0:45:34 you can just
0:45:35 no
0:45:36 johnny
0:45:37 [Music]
0:45:39 um hey a 10 plus the will power will be
0:45:41 two successes there you go i knew that
0:45:43 you're coming
0:45:45 it's true he goes rigid
0:45:47 we have two hours to make the exchange
0:45:49 at the elysium
0:45:50 which is an interesting battleground for
0:45:52 him to choose
0:45:53 that means everybody's got to play
0:45:54 square it means johnny can't freak out
0:45:56 or if johnny does freak out and he can
0:45:58 provoke it then we're done it means
0:46:00 there's no
0:46:01 things are about to come dominate
0:46:03 there's no
0:46:04 this is wordplay now yep
0:46:07 so what's the play here
0:46:08 what do we want to do
0:46:10 we have a lot of pieces moving here
0:46:12 bretta pulls her knees in closer to
0:46:14 herself she hasn't gotten up she's just
0:46:16 kind of
0:46:17 not looking at the santosa
0:46:20 and
0:46:20 finding the floor very interesting
0:46:23 is there a way
0:46:24 we can get
0:46:26 her away from him without giving the
0:46:29 zantosa up
0:46:30 not if he's already at the elysium he
0:46:32 can't do anything to her on the elysium
0:46:36 absolutely she can she's a because she's
0:46:38 immortal it's a
0:46:40 yep he can do whatever he wants
0:46:43 now the good news is that she's still
0:46:44 immortal
0:46:47 that's right on the table yeah that was
0:46:49 part of the table
0:46:50 jesus
0:46:52 so
0:46:54 i think it's time to start making some
0:46:56 calls johnny please don't touch me but
0:47:00 there are three
0:47:03 potential likely outcomes here all of
0:47:05 which end with you upset no
0:47:09 one is she dies
0:47:10 i know
0:47:12 one is that shaw embraces her
0:47:14 i know
0:47:16 one is that you
0:47:18 claim your second right of progeny
0:47:20 and then that's on the table and then
0:47:22 you can get the prince involved and talk
0:47:24 about how you are supporting the prince
0:47:26 in what he wants
0:47:28 and
0:47:29 as far as we know shaw would have to
0:47:31 pull strings to get right of progeny and
0:47:34 miles
0:47:35 could talk to the prince about shows of
0:47:37 power while i delay shaw
0:47:40 those are the
0:47:41 three outcomes that i can see
0:47:44 this isn't a sorcery thing this is just
0:47:46 a
0:47:47 how it works thing
0:47:48 is there no end to this where she stays
0:47:52 alive not if shaw already has her i was
0:47:55 thinking about that before
0:47:56 i have ways of
0:47:59 finding her having people get her get
0:48:01 her out of the city but if she already
0:48:02 has her
0:48:03 no
0:48:04 i'm going to make some calls i need to
0:48:05 know the situation before we get there
0:48:08 i am so i assumed the
0:48:10 archon would call me back by now if he
0:48:12 was available so let's not call that
0:48:15 um i'm gonna call elsa
0:48:18 okay hello hello elsa
0:48:22 hello miles
0:48:24 how's it going
0:48:25 it is
0:48:27 an eventful evening
0:48:29 we try to spice it up around here
0:48:31 so i've
0:48:32 heard know what i'm calling about well
0:48:36 miles to be perfectly honest with you
0:48:39 no
0:48:40 there's a handful of reasons you might
0:48:42 be calling me that's true and i'm not
0:48:44 sure which one it is
0:48:46 but
0:48:47 i am curious to find out i'm going to
0:48:49 start off with the obvious thing neither
0:48:52 one of us wants shaw anywhere near being
0:48:53 in charge
0:48:55 she does not say anything in response
0:48:58 are you being listened to
0:49:00 what else miles right
0:49:03 what's the lay of the land there
0:49:05 it
0:49:06 would seem
0:49:08 that
0:49:09 his grace
0:49:13 has not arrived to court and there are
0:49:17 rumors
0:49:19 that his child has betrayed him
0:49:22 whether or not this is true or
0:49:24 how far along things are is
0:49:28 unclear all right
0:49:31 what we do know
0:49:33 is that his grace's haven
0:49:35 was struck during the day
0:49:39 interesting
0:49:41 it is being discussed right now as to
0:49:44 whether or not his child intends to
0:49:46 declare praxis over the domain of new
0:49:48 haven
0:49:49 what is the stance
0:49:51 of clan venture
0:49:54 that until
0:49:55 it has been determined upton distilled
0:49:57 prince
0:49:58 but clan ventures
0:50:00 made its wish clear that they wish to
0:50:02 keep upton
0:50:03 as prince for now
0:50:05 very good thus far
0:50:08 the primition council
0:50:09 has called for an investigation as to
0:50:11 the whereabouts of prince roland's
0:50:14 and
0:50:14 [Music]
0:50:16 knowing that the venture clan will not
0:50:18 retaliate against the permission council
0:50:21 will go a long way
0:50:23 no that is our wish here
0:50:25 excellent
0:50:26 what is the less obvious reason for your
0:50:28 calling
0:50:30 jaws playing a game and he wants a very
0:50:32 dangerous piece
0:50:35 to keep his ass out of the fire
0:50:38 and so you've called me
0:50:40 yes
0:50:42 why
0:50:43 because you're the only other capable
0:50:44 ally in the court that i like
0:50:49 i appreciate that you like me i don't
0:50:51 know whether or not that's a good thing
0:50:52 right now
0:50:53 that you do it will be
0:50:55 it can be that's true
0:50:58 depends on how we play this out i
0:50:59 suppose does
0:51:01 what are you asking for
0:51:03 we need to maneuver this this piece can
0:51:06 destroy shaw but we need to keep it on
0:51:08 our hands then keep it
0:51:10 he's got a hostage of course he does
0:51:13 he'll always have a hostage that's what
0:51:15 shaw does supposedly on elysium grounds
0:51:18 right now
0:51:19 what are you asking me to do i need to
0:51:22 know if we can make a play you'll back
0:51:24 us
0:51:25 what is the play i'm not sure yet i need
0:51:28 to know what we can bring to bear well
0:51:29 in order for you to know that i'll back
0:51:30 you all need to know what the play is
0:51:33 we need to buy
0:51:34 time but
0:51:37 to prevent what exactly to prevent the
0:51:39 unfortunate
0:51:41 change of immortal
0:51:43 i see
0:51:45 michelle's good with the information and
0:51:47 the black male but he's terrible at the
0:51:49 game
0:51:50 i don't have any resources and i just
0:51:52 got into it
0:51:53 miles
0:51:54 offer her a boot i put my hand on the
0:51:56 phone i know how this is handled this
0:52:00 don't make me make crass maneuvers i got
0:52:02 this
0:52:03 sorry uncut then
0:52:05 this works out favorably for both of us
0:52:07 if we can
0:52:08 and you know right now do you have
0:52:10 this thing that yes michelle wants
0:52:14 this initial wanted to yes
0:52:16 and so long as the prince is missing the
0:52:17 cena shawl controls the domain
0:52:19 i'm afraid of what the center shot will
0:52:21 do with it the only good news
0:52:24 is it might be a citizen if it's ever
0:52:27 acknowledged
0:52:29 the writer progeny has been used
0:52:33 i don't know how that's a useful thing
0:52:35 essential wants
0:52:37 what do you have
0:52:40 he has the power to blood hunt you he
0:52:42 hasn't yet though no he is not
0:52:45 i don't know why he's waiting for this
0:52:48 what is your plan
0:52:50 because right now
0:52:52 shaw wants it gone
0:52:53 the seneschal wants it if shaw
0:52:57 accepts the seneschal remaining in
0:52:59 possession of it even if it's
0:53:00 blackmailed material the center shell is
0:53:02 going to support anything the shaw does
0:53:04 which includes right of progeny and you
0:53:07 being blood hunted so we need to put the
0:53:09 center cell in a stronger position so
0:53:12 for now
0:53:13 you need to outbid shaw
0:53:15 right so i came to you
0:53:18 tell her conch leaves on the way if we
0:53:21 keep this the conflict happens
0:53:23 no tell her it's on the way it doesn't
0:53:26 matter if it's not they don't know that
0:53:28 you speak for vet clan been true the
0:53:31 prince is in hiding
0:53:32 and
0:53:33 his child's is in hiding you're the one
0:53:35 speaking for the clan
0:53:39 the archon is on his way and he has
0:53:42 declared that this evidence brought to
0:53:44 him
0:53:45 will conclave shaw
0:53:47 how successful does it conclude without
0:53:49 the evidence
0:53:50 unsuccessful
0:53:52 i'm going to talk to the center cell you
0:53:53 need to let go forward it is that he has
0:53:55 sausage
0:53:57 it's the only right move at this point
0:53:59 i can't think of anything else keep your
0:54:01 eyes and ears open okay thanks elsa
0:54:04 good luck
0:54:05 she hangs up
0:54:06 the like good luck has an unusual amount
0:54:09 of sincerity from her like you said this
0:54:11 cafe was set up kind of like a cyber
0:54:13 cafe they had like computers yeah we
0:54:15 have power here
0:54:16 is that is there power to the building
0:54:18 there is not okay
0:54:19 then
0:54:21 as all this and everybody's looking
0:54:23 around and talking neil is gonna grab

0:54:42 he read it and brita
0:54:44 does not like look at the santosa she's
0:54:47 still trying to she's afraid of the
0:54:50 instinct popping up again it's possible
0:54:52 and if we have time for a chat about
0:54:54 ancient q a form that's great uh while
0:54:56 i'm gone if you want to get a cliff
0:54:58 notes version that would be
0:55:00 i mean sure but i'm gonna
0:55:02 this passage is from the book of mod
0:55:05 [ __ ] cool
0:55:06 cool
0:55:08 so what
0:55:10 somebody else explained that and i will
0:55:12 happily explain it i'm gonna go to a
0:55:14 different room and make a call to the
0:55:15 finish hall
0:55:17 you can do that
0:55:21 [Music]
0:55:24 someone picks up hello
0:55:26 hello this is miles i am looking for the
0:55:28 senator the center shoulders in the
0:55:30 meeting right now would you like to
0:55:32 leave a message tell him we have what he
0:55:34 wants
0:55:35 i will be certain to relay that you
0:55:37 might want to do it immediately
0:55:39 it's important
0:55:41 very well
0:55:42 kind of like a monk and uh
0:55:45 some conversation on the other side
0:55:48 you then hear the sound of a door and
0:55:49 then the sound of the phone changing
0:55:51 hands
0:55:52 hello is that us all
0:55:54 yes miles
0:55:56 my ears are burning as i understand it
0:55:58 you defied the will of his grace now his
0:56:01 grace has come under attack
0:56:03 i don't think that's how that came down
0:56:05 but
0:56:06 i don't think you really care one way or
0:56:07 another
0:56:08 the narrative is
0:56:10 quite important in situations like this
0:56:13 one
0:56:14 i'm sure you understand that you being
0:56:16 on the outs for the germaine and his
0:56:18 grace having come under attack
0:56:20 it all
0:56:21 looks quite terrible that's true
0:56:24 but
0:56:25 we have the zantosa
0:56:27 alive
0:56:28 not only that we can make sure he stays
0:56:31 alive
0:56:32 because shaw wants the opposite
0:56:34 and i know you don't want that
0:56:37 i will tell you this
0:56:39 i am not upton roland's
0:56:41 no
0:56:42 until the moment that i see you
0:56:45 mr zantosa
0:56:47 and he is in my possession
0:56:49 i may as well consider you to have
0:56:51 nothing
0:56:52 fine but we need to talk about things
0:56:53 before i get there i don't need to talk
0:56:56 about anything miles but you have a
0:56:58 moment and i'll hear you
0:56:59 do you really want sean as your
0:57:02 background
0:57:03 because he's shown himself to be
0:57:05 so very loyal and so very
0:57:07 trustworthy and ridiculous none of you
0:57:10 are loyal
0:57:11 some of us are better than others
0:57:13 and you know it
0:57:15 yes but i count all of those among my
0:57:17 clan yeah
0:57:19 stop being obtuse do not make demands of
0:57:22 me miles
0:57:23 i'm not i'm saying that it's had a very
0:57:25 long evening already and i am not in the
0:57:27 mood to tolerate those [ __ ] a hair's
0:57:30 breath from the blood hunt
0:57:32 a giant mistake if i've ever heard one
0:57:35 it's not about demands it's about
0:57:36 looking at the facts shel is just going
0:57:38 to wait for the opportunity and you know
0:57:40 it and you can prepare all you want but
0:57:43 he's gonna come for you
0:57:44 this
0:57:45 staying alive playing this play with me
0:57:49 puts shaw out of play
0:57:51 and makes you
0:57:52 much stronger in the domain and you know
0:57:55 it
0:57:56 is there something you're trying to
0:57:57 offer me miles yes
0:57:59 we work together we stop shaw
0:58:02 from doing whatever he's doing we figure
0:58:04 out what the hell happened to upton and
0:58:07 we wait for the archon to show
0:58:09 because he's on his way and he knows
0:58:12 that we have the zentosa
0:58:14 so the deal is that we stop shaw
0:58:16 together from declining praxis
0:58:19 an exchange you will provide me with
0:58:23 that which
0:58:25 is mine
0:58:27 very well
0:58:28 it needs to stay alive and the archon
0:58:30 needs to be able to get to it oh don't
0:58:32 worry it'll stay alive
0:58:34 and unfortunately currently we need to
0:58:36 stay near it or it becomes
0:58:38 no you will turn it over to me
0:58:41 what i intend to do to it is unkind
0:58:44 you will not want to be there
0:58:46 and you are not welcome to be there
0:58:49 it is hard to control
0:58:51 we have it i will manage
0:58:53 there's a couple more things at stake
0:58:54 here for you
0:58:56 forever
0:58:57 tell me what is at stake for everyone
0:58:59 there's more coming than this
0:59:01 instability of the domain would be huge
0:59:04 right now are you speaking of the threat
0:59:06 of sabbat i am
0:59:08 the name killing spree is being thrown
0:59:10 around
0:59:11 what are you proposing regarding the
0:59:12 killing spree
0:59:14 we need to work together here
0:59:16 for all of us in domain and that
0:59:17 includes
0:59:18 good relations
0:59:20 so i'm talking in the future you realize
0:59:22 that shaw
0:59:24 is probably this greatest chance that
0:59:26 this domain has of surviving
0:59:29 shah by himself no shall and what he
0:59:32 controls maybe but if we can convince
0:59:34 everyone that shaw is not
0:59:36 what he appears to be
0:59:37 then all of what he controls corrupts
0:59:39 egomaniac who pays well he's all of
0:59:41 those things and we pay just as well
0:59:43 mercenaries are easy i think we're that
0:59:46 true we would have them
0:59:48 i'd be careful underestimating shaw i'm
0:59:50 not
0:59:51 the sabbat issue is going to be an issue
0:59:53 no matter what right
0:59:55 and it is an issue that is not part of
0:59:57 what we're dealing with now no
0:59:59 so
1:00:00 you
1:00:01 will provide me
1:00:04 with what i want in an exchange you will
1:00:07 not be blood hunted
1:00:09 and you will be allowed to play whatever
1:00:10 political game it is you intend with
1:00:12 shaw
1:00:13 fine deal your original deal with win
1:00:15 stands too does you already offer that
1:00:18 didn't you i recall being did it not get
1:00:21 logged in the book sneered at
1:00:23 so are you saying that i
1:00:25 i just want to confirm i shouldn't
1:00:26 bother treating the rest of you
1:00:28 no but you might as well do it be swift
1:00:32 and i'll honor this
1:00:34 we'll be on our way soon no disruptions
1:00:36 he hangs up we need to go
1:00:39 go
1:00:41 i'll where
1:00:41 you and do what start playing a game
1:00:44 buddy no specifics
1:00:46 i don't know yet
1:00:47 what if this what the seneschal intends
1:00:50 to do will make it
1:00:51 not what the arkhan's asking for
1:00:54 khan
1:00:57 kind of have to deal with it at this
1:00:58 point
1:00:59 otherwise does the center shell realize
1:01:02 what blood hunting you would put in what
1:01:04 kind of position that would put him into
1:01:05 i don't know yet because think about
1:01:07 that who is your sire yeah i know your
1:01:10 sire is already aware of what's going on
1:01:12 here but just needs the proof
1:01:14 i don't think it would be that smart of
1:01:15 an idea for for the seneschal to blood
1:01:17 hunt you his child effectively you're
1:01:20 working for his office right now right
1:01:22 now the seneschal is in charge upton
1:01:25 rollins is missing another reason why
1:01:27 that doesn't look good if he actually
1:01:28 decides to basically declare war on clan
1:01:30 venture i get it but right now he's in
1:01:32 power so we need to deal with the right
1:01:34 now i think they're hollow threats
1:01:36 miles to certain degree
1:01:38 but i need the safety to move in there
1:01:40 first
1:01:41 and i need that backing
1:01:43 so we're going in
1:01:44 and we're gonna do what we can to save
1:01:46 everyone
1:01:47 we can but we move quickly or we don't
1:01:50 get joey
1:01:51 joey
1:01:53 don't worry your daughter is on the list
1:01:54 too
1:01:56 yeah do you not believe me
1:01:58 because yet again what have i done wrong
1:02:00 to any of you that keeps doubting what
1:02:01 i'm trying to say
1:02:03 miles i've i always have your back
1:02:05 but
1:02:07 i'm going to do everything in my power
1:02:09 to prevent her from entering this life
1:02:12 that still means she loses hers doesn't
1:02:14 it
1:02:15 i don't know
1:02:16 there's a lot of options
1:02:18 and you need to consider which ones are
1:02:20 best but unfortunately what it sounds
1:02:22 like is we're walking into elysium
1:02:24 without much of a plan
1:02:27 i don't know what shaw's going to do
1:02:29 next that's the part of the problem
1:02:31 shaw's cunning and shaw's seen some of
1:02:33 this coming so we need to go in
1:02:35 and be prepared to be flexible
1:02:37 can we get the arkhan to act against
1:02:40 shaw if
1:02:41 what they both want they're both trying
1:02:43 to pull for
1:02:44 if we hand the zantosa over to the
1:02:46 seneschal
1:02:48 he's
1:02:49 i don't think he's going to be in any
1:02:50 state to be used against shaw
1:02:52 i don't know i still don't think we can
1:02:54 hand him over to the senate show i think
1:02:56 right now
1:02:57 i really wish that neil hadn't left i
1:02:59 think we are running down the barrel of
1:03:02 two
1:03:03 separate
1:03:04 not equally bad things if we don't turn
1:03:07 him into the seneschal we are probably
1:03:08 going to be blood hunted and as stupid
1:03:10 as that would be for him it's a lot
1:03:12 easier to put the word out than it is to
1:03:14 call the word back right the only thing
1:03:16 we need
1:03:18 really we could change the situation
1:03:19 quite quickly if we can get upton back
1:03:22 where would he be he's missing his haven
1:03:25 was attacked during the day what kind of
1:03:28 kindred could do that kindred can't but
1:03:31 their retainers can venture can
1:03:34 let me call weathers let me see what he
1:03:36 knows about any of this and they think i
1:03:38 don't know man um
1:03:40 arabella is
1:03:42 also seemingly missing the primitive
1:03:44 council is looking into it i don't know
1:03:46 what that means
1:03:48 how do they
1:03:50 where miles where's the phone you were
1:03:51 using in my hand oh is there a phone in
1:03:54 this place
1:03:55 i would imagine not you can use my cell
1:03:57 phone takes it miles
1:04:00 what is the likelihood how do
1:04:03 both of the rollins rank compared to you
1:04:07 in terms of ventrue hierarchy
1:04:10 one's higher the other one is lower
1:04:12 arabella is lower than me is there a
1:04:14 chance you are being thrown under the
1:04:16 bus here i think something was done to
1:04:19 cause the confusion to allow the center
1:04:20 shell to be in a bigger position i don't
1:04:23 know by who yet
1:04:25 throwing me under the bus
1:04:26 this is part of shaw's thing
1:04:29 some of this stuff
1:04:30 let's hear what
1:04:32 but shaw also doesn't quite know who my
1:04:34 sire is and that will give us a leg but
1:04:37 not a lot yeah it's not going to do us
1:04:39 any good until he gets here if he would
1:04:41 call you back yeah but that's a game we
1:04:43 can't play so
1:04:46 elysium is a little bit better but
1:04:48 if we can get neil to locate somebody i
1:04:51 don't know if he can
1:04:53 he has a lot of weird powers right now
1:04:55 to locate his grace correct
1:04:57 he might be the only one to domain if
1:04:58 those powers work if those weird things
1:05:01 he's been doing is of that same set i
1:05:02 don't know if we can get vito to
1:05:06 the ark pun then shaw will be handled
1:05:09 and if we can get upton back to his
1:05:11 court then maybe we can help the
1:05:13 daughter well we can we won't be blood
1:05:16 hunted so then from there on in we're in
1:05:18 a stronger position we have some of the
1:05:20 backings and then we'll see what we can
1:05:22 do from there these things sound like
1:05:24 things that need time
1:05:26 we don't have a lot
1:05:27 and if we decide that we're going to
1:05:29 take the time we are losing both joey
1:05:33 and johnny's daughter i know we got a
1:05:35 little bit we gotta wait for neil and
1:05:37 then see what he gets and then we'll be
1:05:38 on our way
1:05:42 [Music]
1:05:46 johnny yeah you make a call i do
1:05:49 hey how you doing tonight
1:05:51 it's not good i know
1:05:54 how secure is your location
1:05:56 secure enough how about you
1:05:59 are you at the sheriff's office yeah i'm
1:06:01 at elysium right now well that's what's
1:06:03 going on with the main right now i got
1:06:04 eyes on the inside the center shell and
1:06:06 shawl working together together
1:06:09 yes do you know where upton is
1:06:11 no
1:06:13 this show i have my daughter there
1:06:16 yeah she alive
1:06:20 yeah
1:06:22 if we show up to the the elysium are we
1:06:24 walking out of there
1:06:25 i don't know
1:06:28 jane sat in and watched a meeting
1:06:30 between
1:06:31 arabella
1:06:32 reese
1:06:33 and shaw
1:06:34 the coup is underway
1:06:36 by the end of the night they're gonna
1:06:38 turn fangs on
1:06:39 they're gonna turn the fangs on linden
1:06:42 put her down and things are gonna get
1:06:44 real one-sided for a bit so
1:06:46 upton's probably already dead though i
1:06:48 don't know
1:06:51 elsa know about all this
1:06:53 she's got an idea
1:06:55 all khan came to town last night
1:06:58 arkham
1:06:59 john peterson
1:07:00 he came back
1:07:02 where is he now he was with roland's
1:07:05 with rollins
1:07:07 yeah
1:07:08 are you sure
1:07:10 yeah
1:07:11 i met with the two of them myself
1:07:13 we received information
1:07:15 that a pack called the killing spray is
1:07:16 operating in the area
1:07:18 yeah
1:07:19 that's the uh
1:07:21 it's the same pack weathers
1:07:23 damn it sorry the one that did me
1:07:26 the uh
1:07:27 people we've been hanging out with
1:07:28 lately also confirmed that
1:07:30 you know who i mean right
1:07:32 i do
1:07:33 so you haven't you have no idea where
1:07:35 the uh archon is now
1:07:37 no
1:07:38 but i know he's alive
1:07:39 and you're sure it was him he wasn't
1:07:41 active funny or anything no not at all
1:07:46 you see any way of of keeping the domain
1:07:48 together after tonight the only way we
1:07:50 were beating them as if they think i won
1:07:53 and even then i don't know it's not good
1:07:56 johnny
1:07:57 all right
1:07:58 i'll do what i can help you
1:08:00 whether you stay safe
1:08:02 new haven's got precious few people who
1:08:04 are worth the worth of damn you're one
1:08:06 of them
1:08:07 if
1:08:08 if this domain is going to survive
1:08:10 it needs people like you
1:08:12 i'm not good at this game johnny
1:08:17 yeah i don't know why
1:08:19 i got i got a couple ideas
1:08:22 okay is jane all right
1:08:25 yeah johnny she's okay i think i
1:08:27 misunderstood why she uh
1:08:29 she left with them
1:08:31 that's right
1:08:33 i think that helped her
1:08:36 all right if you uh if you need to get
1:08:38 in touch with me just uh
1:08:41 either call miles or
1:08:43 his child's cell phone
1:08:44 okay
1:08:45 take care of your supplement
1:08:47 you too hey yeah
1:08:50 you'll be all right he hangs up
1:08:53 johnny comes walking back into the room
1:08:55 and he looks over at vito
1:08:57 vito what do you do you want to survive
1:08:59 the next few nights
1:09:01 yes
1:09:02 of course
1:09:03 because there's not many many scenarios
1:09:05 where you do
1:09:07 you understand that right
1:09:09 i do
1:09:10 most of this domain wants you dead
1:09:12 you're looking at the very few people
1:09:14 here who want to see you live a few
1:09:16 nights
1:09:18 you understand that
1:09:19 i do
1:09:20 mostly kind of like watches
1:09:25 i can definitely feel that he's looking

1:12:01 territory

1:12:05 does that sound like they're working
1:12:06 with killing spree it sounds like they

1:12:10 shaw might be
1:12:12 he's part of the web right
1:12:14 yes the web
1:12:15 the web works for warwick
1:12:17 does it
1:12:19 the web also is not bound to a sect is
1:12:22 it webb is kamaria is it a discovery
1:12:26 information network used by nosferatu
1:12:29 it is how they get information for icons
1:12:32 it is probably how they know that the
1:12:34 killing spree is in town for me i helped
1:12:37 camarillo also um weather said he saw
1:12:41 young peterson in in the domain last
1:12:43 night
1:12:44 with upton rollins i don't know whether
1:12:47 that's good news or whether that's very
1:12:49 bad news
1:12:50 if
1:12:51 is it actually peter zoo
1:12:54 i don't know i
1:12:55 i can't tell i don't have i'm getting
1:12:57 the striking suspicion that there have
1:12:59 been a lot of people masquerading around
1:13:01 as not who they are in this city i don't
1:13:04 know
1:13:04 i can make a call again and see what
1:13:06 happens but there were bruja at the rant
1:13:08 that i don't think were actually brouha
1:13:10 looking back on it i think when i ran
1:13:12 into a beer the other night it wasn't
1:13:13 actually a couple weeks ago that wasn't
1:13:16 actually kabir call neil we need him
1:13:18 back now and i need to see if i can get
1:13:20 in and talk with john again you should
1:13:23 let it else have been to know i'll do
1:13:24 what i can

1:14:31 see you next time kendrick
1:14:37 there's always talks
1:14:39 i haven't seen anything concrete i don't
1:14:41 want [ __ ] gargoyles back
1:14:43 nothing set in stone
1:14:45 oh
1:14:47 gargoyles joke do you wear the bad guy
1:14:49 talon
1:14:50 gargoyles it's been forever he was such
1:14:52 a [ __ ] dupe edgelord
1:14:54 they tried to see the hunter guy no
1:14:56 that's uh that was macbeth who is
1:15:00 so edgy oh yeah
1:15:01 like
1:15:02 i mean it's a story about gargoyle so i
1:15:04 think pretty much there's a lot of edgy
1:15:06 going on
1:15:11 it was basically vampire like but there
1:15:13 was a character who uh was an
1:15:16 amalgamation of different animals that
1:15:18 they were using to try to replicate uh
1:15:20 through science like gargoyles and more
1:15:24 like gargoyles gather energy while like
1:15:26 during the time like there's this they
1:15:27 exist in stone uh for them they were
1:15:30 like eels it was it was very strange um
1:15:33 but this dude had like the head of a
1:15:36 panther and it was like this hulking
1:15:38 like jacked like mixed animal thing with
1:15:41 like a feathered wings and his name was
1:15:44 talon
1:15:45 and like he was just so [ __ ] edgy and
1:15:48 he was like the bio-gargoyled equivalent
1:15:51 of goliath
1:15:53 and they had like this huge rivalry it
1:15:54 was [ __ ] great such a great show the
1:15:56 best
