0:00:00 path of night is an actual play vampire
0:00:02 the masquerade podcast set in the
0:00:03 classic world of darkness we're all
0:00:05 friends we're here to have fun but our
0:00:07 story can include graphic violence drug
0:00:09 use sexual content and other mature
0:00:11 themes we've talked at our table about
0:00:13 safety comfort and consent both as
0:00:15 players and storytellers we know what to
0:00:17 expect we're all excited to be here and
0:00:19 we want you to feel the same so listener
0:00:21 discretion is advised
0:00:23 now let's walk the path of night
0:00:28 last time on path of night during a
0:00:30 rooftop rant in downtown new haven
0:00:32 johnny tried to convince the rest of the
0:00:33 barra to stay loyal to weathers the city
0:00:35 and their clan but in the face of shaw's
0:00:37 overwhelming influence johnny weathers
0:00:39 and the anarchs under baron amaya fled
0:00:42 as the vote turned sour and the riled up
0:00:44 raw prepared to gleefully head out into
0:00:46 the city to embrace more to their ranks
0:00:48 and mass meanwhile wynn met with senator
0:00:51 Reiss of claimed tremere at an
0:00:52 increasingly tense elysium in an attempt
0:00:54 to reclaim the enslaved soul of joey for
0:00:57 the price asked for the boy's salvation
0:00:59 may be too much for wind to be able to
0:01:01 pay now the quartering meets up at miles
0:01:03 haven to prepare for the bloody work of
0:01:05 laying an ambush for the followers of
0:01:07 seth
0:01:08 [Music]
0:01:10 miles after a few hours pass by one by
0:01:14 one
0:01:15 your kindred allies arrive to the haven
0:01:18 and uh the group of you when you get
0:01:20 there there are these uh large
0:01:23 containers
0:01:24 one of them is already opened up
0:01:25 revealing what looks like a row of
0:01:28 assault rifles and ammunition lined up
0:01:30 and it looks like miles is ready to wage
0:01:34 a war against the entire goddamn city
0:01:36 his uh loyal servant invites the group
0:01:39 of you in one at a time and then kind of
0:01:42 just like walks away and stays away from
0:01:44 the group of you
0:01:46 for a moment particularly
0:01:48 britta you kind of notice that he's
0:01:50 giving you these like almost derisive
0:01:53 looks
0:01:54 and when he finally catches himself
0:01:56 doing it he wanders off to give you guys
0:02:00 some space to make preparations um miles
0:02:03 what are you dressed in buddy what's
0:02:04 going on well i heard they were coming
0:02:06 over so i decided to gear up to get
0:02:08 things moving quicker so i have at this
0:02:10 point you know done the
0:02:12 you know black slash black
0:02:14 turtleneck uh tactical neck tactical
0:02:16 okay um
0:02:18 the body armor with the long leather
0:02:20 trench coat i've worn before
0:02:22 the katana is nearby and i've pulled out
0:02:25 one of the assault rifles and loaded a
0:02:28 couple clips and put a couple things in
0:02:29 the belt there and
0:02:31 started putting out some of the other
0:02:32 armor and other things that i've got for
0:02:33 these people and then waiting for them
0:02:35 to open up these uh christmas presents
0:02:37 so yeah the group of you noticed that
0:02:39 miles has gone the extra mile
0:02:42 and
0:02:42 uh has
0:02:44 arranged for uh packages for each of you
0:02:49 has a bit of um personalized armor and
0:02:53 weapons
0:02:55 uh
0:02:55 damn miles this is uh
0:02:58 i mean what the hell do you expect to be
0:02:59 going on here with this oh no we're not
0:03:01 making all of these
0:03:03 that's a lot of stuff
0:03:05 about the weapons yes yeah yeah what
0:03:08 what's the uh what's the occasion
0:03:11 besides the settings the sabbat
0:03:14 oh this is
0:03:16 wait are these the things that you were
0:03:17 going with johnny and zantosa i mean
0:03:20 yeah we have
0:03:21 ability to use these things
0:03:23 okay but yes also we've been gearing up
0:03:25 for this so
0:03:26 you all find uh
0:03:28 some armor in there and a couple weapons
0:03:30 for each of you uh we decided to pick
0:03:32 now we got ugly types coming out of the
0:03:33 woodwork it's gonna be real helpful to
0:03:35 have this gear
0:03:36 okay i'll uh i'll try i'll trust you on
0:03:38 that
0:03:39 Britta would have come pretty early she
0:03:41 would have come directly after
0:03:43 finishing up feeding british dressed for
0:03:45 it she's got a plum silk dress on and
0:03:49 she's sort of slipping off her heels
0:03:51 into some shoes she keeps by the
0:03:53 entrance of miles his house more
0:03:55 practical shoes as soon as she sees the
0:03:57 crate full
0:03:59 of guns she picks one up sort of tests
0:04:01 the weight of it
0:04:02 whether it's it's it's an automatic
0:04:04 gesture to see how good the quality is
0:04:07 a little uncomfortable to like
0:04:10 with how like practiced
0:04:12 she holds an assault rifle
0:04:14 neil walks over and kind of tries the
0:04:16 same thing
0:04:18 clearly is not at all adept at it but
0:04:20 it's like sort of watching what brett is
0:04:22 doing like oh oh that's okay and that
0:04:24 just puts it down awkwardly he's wearing
0:04:27 similar clothes to when he went out into
0:04:29 the field with Brittain and win like a
0:04:32 burgundy zip up cardigan
0:04:34 tight black pants and just a pair of
0:04:36 like brown leather shoes with uh like
0:04:39 quarters there's like pennies stuck into
0:04:42 the
0:04:43 into like the loafer part they're not
0:04:45 they're not loafers they have laces but
0:04:48 still into the tongue of the shoe he's
0:04:49 stuck some coins classic meal
0:04:52 uh
0:04:52 so
0:04:54 you remember where we're going and what
0:04:55 we're doing
0:04:56 yes we're going to the docks we're going
0:04:58 to set up the ambush and then we're
0:04:59 going to wait for the satellites to
0:05:00 arrive
0:05:01 did you decide who you wanted waiting in
0:05:03 the open with you was bait i decided i
0:05:06 didn't think i was going to have anybody
0:05:07 else wait with me out in the open i
0:05:09 didn't think well i thought we had
0:05:10 talked about you being somewhere
0:05:13 sort of on purpose to draw them in
0:05:16 because especially if they're sorcerers
0:05:18 oh i'm going to be out in the open okay
0:05:19 but
0:05:20 you don't think they would find it
0:05:21 suspicious that you're just standing out
0:05:22 in the open by yourself in the middle of
0:05:24 a warehouse no they'll probably either
0:05:26 arrive early or whatnot thinking they'll
0:05:28 get the jump on me and take the stuff
0:05:30 and part of the deal probably so
0:05:33 me waiting out there would probably not
0:05:35 be terribly different yeah but like
0:05:37 what's the reason you're out there like
0:05:39 what is your motivation
0:05:41 as a character because you're play
0:05:43 acting
0:05:44 i'm waiting for the people to make the
0:05:46 supplies johnny's uh sitting at the
0:05:48 table he's got his the gear that miles
0:05:50 provided laid out in front of him um
0:05:53 he's actually uh has his leather jacket
0:05:55 that he usually wears off and he's
0:05:58 actually
0:05:58 mending a uh a stab wound in the uh in
0:06:02 the back of the jacket his flannel that
0:06:04 he usually wears is kind of discarded in
0:06:06 the corner um and he's still got a hole
0:06:09 in the un and like the the kind of just
0:06:11 old like athletic undershirt that he has
0:06:13 on
0:06:14 from where the knife wound was
0:06:16 he kind of looks up from his work with a
0:06:18 sour face and it's like uh neil you
0:06:21 gotta stop asking questions about
0:06:23 motivation and stuff
0:06:24 if you overthink this thing it's gonna
0:06:27 go to hell that is not my experience
0:06:29 the door slams i think you can think
0:06:32 thanks i believe wins here and win walks
0:06:34 in um she's wearing flint she actually
0:06:37 looks like she has cleaned up a little
0:06:39 bit since the first time she's gone out
0:06:41 hunting with the with the crew she's
0:06:43 still wearing flannel steel jeans she
0:06:46 has new boots she has a hood up to
0:06:48 conceal all the snake markings on her
0:06:50 head
0:06:50 and when she pushes the hood down it's
0:06:53 clear because there is some staining
0:06:55 that she was crying
0:06:56 and she just kind of
0:06:57 stands in the corner and waits to be
0:07:00 told what to do as soon as he sees that
0:07:02 wynn has clearly been crying because i
0:07:04 kind of assume
0:07:05 this might not be old hat but like we've
0:07:07 known each other long enough neil just
0:07:09 gets up and goes over and just gives her
0:07:11 a hug
0:07:12 and whether or not she wants him to and
0:07:14 then leaves like just and then space she
0:07:16 kind of like puts her head down but
0:07:18 can't muster the energy to put her arms
0:07:19 around him this is like a pat pat yep
0:07:22 like old practice emotional support
0:07:27 i will signal from marcos to bring her
0:07:28 something so she can wipe the
0:07:30 off her face and like no words have
0:07:32 really exchanged at that point
0:07:34 johnny you'll see uh marcus heads over
0:07:36 and tosses win a towel and then he
0:07:39 leaves she catches it Britta sort of
0:07:41 tilts her head during the interaction
0:07:44 previously she had gone and gotten the
0:07:46 leather jacket that johnny had gotten
0:07:48 her sort of gathered some things to
0:07:49 change into out of her hunting clothes
0:07:52 and she's been noticing marcos being odd
0:07:56 and she
0:07:57 shoots miles a questioning look
0:07:59 he basically kind of waves it off right
0:08:02 now um essentially kind of like we'll
0:08:04 deal with this later breta nods still
0:08:07 looking confused but continues with her
0:08:10 preparations
0:08:11 as i was saying you'll find an upgrade
0:08:12 to your no no
0:08:15 rewind what what is this nodding back
0:08:16 and forth here johnny pulls a cigarette
0:08:19 out lights it up and kind of expects an
0:08:21 answer looking back and forth between
0:08:23 miles and Britta Britta looks
0:08:28 somebody's speaking [ __ ] words please
0:08:29 marcos looks really upset he points he
0:08:31 points over to Britta that every night he
0:08:33 points over to win that somebody speak
0:08:36 right okay my personal issue i'll deal
0:08:38 with it later are we really going to
0:08:40 start interfering in that no no
0:08:42 no
0:08:43 i just
0:08:44 britta wanted to know something and
0:08:45 you're just kind of waving it away and
0:08:48 is this going to affect us going into a
0:08:50 fight
0:08:51 if the guy who knows where you sleep is
0:08:53 upset maybe that's something we need to
0:08:55 figure out wait who are we talking about
0:08:57 marcos marcos what's happening with
0:09:00 marcos i don't think he's going to do
0:09:02 anything and
0:09:04 also
0:09:05 my business
0:09:06 our business Coterie you all keep
0:09:08 switching the topic on me you guys were
0:09:10 looking at each other kind of like doing
0:09:11 this wink and nod thing and now we're
0:09:12 talking about something you guys ask me
0:09:14 a question about marcos
0:09:15 why
0:09:16 is it okay if i
0:09:18 it seems like the cat's out of the bag
0:09:20 on this one
0:09:21 all right i will go deal with it how's
0:09:23 that sound you first upgraded
0:09:26 crowbar i want to finish what i was
0:09:28 saying
0:09:29 this is not a crowbar it is a [ __ ]
0:09:31 axe
0:09:32 miles i have a really hard time
0:09:34 understanding you when you use that much
0:09:35 emotion right so i saw that you were
0:09:38 using a crowbar before not terribly
0:09:39 effective against vampires anticipating
0:09:41 when was i using a crowbar uh
0:09:44 during when we were fighting the
0:09:46 satellites yeah yeah but that was just
0:09:47 on hand yeah i got my boot knife i
0:09:49 thought it was a tire iron it's the same
0:09:51 thing i'm just kidding that is not the
0:09:53 same thing uh anyways
0:09:55 yeah i wanna think we're gonna go into
0:09:57 some hairy stuff i figured you might
0:09:59 want something a little bit better for
0:10:00 up close and fresno
0:10:01 so you got me an axe
0:10:03 yes it's matte black
0:10:08 made out of steel dude
0:10:11 let it out
0:10:17 fire axe tight
0:10:19 highly adorable
0:10:21 egg ripped prevent slipping in case
0:10:22 you're covered in blood
0:10:24 he scratches at the at the matte black
0:10:26 finish was that spray paint no it's
0:10:29 black and metal
0:10:30 kind of looks questioningly at you do
0:10:32 you really want to place the cigarette
0:10:34 back into his into his mouth depending
0:10:35 on what we're doing do you really want a
0:10:37 bright red one
0:10:38 i don't think a big guy with a leather
0:10:40 jacket wielding an axe is going to make
0:10:43 things uh
0:10:44 less noticeable whether it's matte black
0:10:47 or f or fire axe red depends on the
0:10:50 shade of red really is what it boils
0:10:51 down to oh yeah maybe uh maybe maybe we
0:10:54 can get a nightshade red one can we do
0:10:55 that
0:10:57 that's it for crimson but
0:10:59 i like your where you're going with this
0:11:02 look you find the color we could
0:11:03 probably get it done that's really
0:11:05 important to you no
0:11:06 it's absolutely not
0:11:09 i don't know it seems like a big deal
0:11:10 you keep talking about it
0:11:13 i love this passive aggressive trend now
0:11:15 i know why marcos was upset
0:11:18 would you just take the goddamn thing oh
0:11:20 yeah i got it okay
0:11:22 this is why you shouldn't leave they're
0:11:23 too emotional
0:11:24 do you have any anything
0:11:26 miles i
0:11:39 that's a
0:11:40 box okay
0:11:42 so
0:11:44 uh
0:11:46 everyone roll initiative
0:11:48 the second waiting like
0:11:51 this is why Ventrues shouldn't lead
0:11:52 they're too emotional you look at
0:12:06 you're not spending
0:12:10 i am such an [ __ ] yeah
0:12:14 uh we're actually going to pick up with
0:12:16 initiative 17 that is Britta britta uh
0:12:19 you see miles as fangs bear and he lets
0:12:23 out this monstrous hiss
0:12:25 and begins to lunge for a katana so that
0:12:28 he may subdue and kill win Britta is not
0:12:30 entirely sure what to do but she
0:12:32 remembers getting the attention of the
0:12:34 people when she needed to distract them
0:12:37 from the earlier emergency one of many
0:12:40 so she's going to try using ah okay give
0:12:43 me an aw rule to affect uh miles
0:12:47 because he's in such a blind state of
0:12:49 rage
0:12:50 is actually at a plus two difficulty
0:12:53 three successes okay
0:12:55 miles win is from here are not the
0:12:57 target of your frenzy sorry i mean all
0:12:59 right is the target of your frenzy
0:13:02 i will spend that will power to ignore
0:13:04 it done uh he gives you this like a
0:13:06 feral look and bears his fangs but
0:13:09 there's something about you he
0:13:10 recognizes just enough to turn away and
0:13:13 stay his hand from you
0:13:15 we are on miles so yeah i'm drawing the
0:13:18 katana and slicing okay so uh
0:13:21 drawing the weapon
0:13:22 is one action so you're going to need to
0:13:24 split your dice pool into two halves
0:13:26 cool uh so you draw and now you can make
0:13:29 the attack roll great uh remember that
0:13:31 you're gonna factor your total dice pool
0:13:33 with the bonus from your blood and then
0:13:34 you're going to have it
0:13:39 five successes
0:13:40 [Music]
0:13:42 you're gonna die
0:13:43 i'm gonna try okay
0:13:47 i got a one and no successes
0:13:50 sure die
0:13:51 six
0:13:52 uh six is a six guys right six is a six
0:13:54 oh six is okay but not a bunch
0:14:00 generally if someone a dodge roll i give
0:14:01 a plus three die bonus to damage okay
0:14:04 well that's good to not have that's
0:14:05 brutal four roll over four roll over
0:14:08 and then do i roll to soak yes yes
0:14:10 you're gonna roll stamina plus 42.
0:14:14 not bad
0:14:18 she's good i have six successes okay
0:14:20 these moments are so weird when you're
0:14:21 like
0:14:22 slices into you with blinding speed like
0:14:25 drawing the weapon
0:14:26 carving into win uh but when seems to
0:14:30 resist and holds together uh next on
0:14:32 initiative is going to be kneel uh neil
0:14:35 is not going to get within sword
0:14:37 striking range just in case but like
0:14:39 we're in your living room right yeah
0:14:41 okay from the other side of the couch
0:14:44 uh those are miles miles i know you're
0:14:47 pissed i know it's not what you need to
0:14:50 calm down okay
0:14:52 you just this is not the time for this
0:14:55 we're about to go get into a big fight
0:14:56 let's not tear each other apart all
0:14:58 right i'm going to use passion to try
0:15:00 and calm him the [ __ ] down true and
0:15:03 lower so the goal is to lower his
0:15:05 emotions here empathy plus charisma
0:15:08 difficulty equals your humanity rating
0:15:10 one success succeed so like all the
0:15:13 demonstration powers there's not a
0:15:15 specific thing that happens uh well so
0:15:17 what i suggest
0:15:19 is uh
0:15:20 you may
0:15:21 make a self-control check difficulty
0:15:23 seven uh if you succeed you may control
0:15:26 your next action i'm deciding on the
0:15:28 willpower yeah i figured you probably
0:15:30 were making a willpower decision
0:15:32 let's do it
0:15:35 three it was weird that i failed i
0:15:37 checked it was so weird because i was
0:15:38 like towards uh
0:15:41 yeah five successes you'll need to take
0:15:42 yourself out of frenzy uh for now miles
0:15:46 pauses arm outstretched with like the
0:15:50 katana in his hand that he just kind of
0:15:52 like went to take someone's head with
0:15:54 and
0:15:55 for the moment it seems like there might
0:15:57 be a lull in the infighting with that
0:15:59 the initiative goes to win so i actually
0:16:01 did you aborted to dodge so we go to
0:16:03 johnny uh johnny actually just kind of
0:16:07 stands up from from the uh the table
0:16:10 doesn't make a move to go anywhere and
0:16:12 points over it when and goes you need to
0:16:14 apologize now i know you've had a knight
0:16:18 but this guy opens our his house to us
0:16:20 he corrals us we constantly give him
0:16:23 [ __ ] and he is under a lot of stress
0:16:25 right now you need to apologize and
0:16:27 that's his action we will go
0:16:30 to
0:16:31 Britta is verbally talking down without
0:16:33 the use of a discipline mechanically
0:16:36 useful if you are attempting to use like
0:16:38 empathy or expression i will absolutely
0:16:40 allow you to make a role that would help
0:16:42 uh miles along well i'd like to use
0:16:44 empathy not in the way of using presence
0:16:47 just trying to catch his eye sort of
0:16:49 interpersonally
0:16:51 and she'll look to
0:16:53 miles and say
0:16:54 you were able to stop miles you're a
0:16:56 really good leader all right please calm
0:16:58 down give me
0:17:00 manipulation
0:17:02 plus empathy
0:17:06 the manipulation part hurts
0:17:13 what's uh what's the level six and does
0:17:16 enchanting voice count absolutely differ
0:17:19 all right so this would be then
0:17:22 has that voice five successes
0:17:25 yeah all right so miles you're up next
0:17:28 uh why don't you give me a self-control
0:17:29 check and you're gonna go ahead and add
0:17:30 her successes to your dice pool
0:17:36 four kind of roll my fire tonight
0:17:38 with that mile stops
0:17:41 sheets his weapon and seems to be in
0:17:43 control we are exiting combat unless
0:17:46 anyone is taking any actions in three
0:17:48 two
0:17:49 one
0:17:50 returned rp okay we good johnny gives an
0:17:53 expecting look at when when disappoints
0:17:55 him
0:17:56 so
0:17:58 um
0:17:59 everybody good
0:18:01 now
0:18:01 miles you were you were gonna show us um
0:18:04 our gear kits that you made
0:18:07 just blinks over at you for a minute
0:18:10 wind steps back outside spent a lot of
0:18:13 time on him yes we're going to open the
0:18:15 boxes or yes let's open the boxes
0:18:18 johnny pats you on the shoulder gives
0:18:20 you kind of a knowing nod and then
0:18:21 actually follows out after when neil
0:18:23 looks like he's going to give miles a
0:18:25 hug like he does with win
0:18:27 like reassesses himself and does not
0:18:31 roll my neck like let's get something
0:18:34 good out of this
0:18:36 [Music]
0:18:39 outside wynn's hands are shaking as
0:18:41 she's trying to light a cigarette johnny
0:18:43 will flip open his zippo lights up for
0:18:46 you it's cold night you guys actually
0:18:47 while your lights are outside it starts
0:18:50 to snow and now like a little bit of
0:18:52 snow like it starts really coming down
0:18:55 he likes his own cigarette
0:18:57 i'm guessing you had a real rough night
0:18:59 that would be accurate
0:19:01 all that aside
0:19:03 truthfully
0:19:05 miles does a whole lot for all of us
0:19:08 i'm real tired of people explaining to
0:19:09 me why i should be grateful
0:19:11 i'm not saying you should be grateful
0:19:13 i'm just saying that we take him for
0:19:15 granted a lot and he puts his neck on
0:19:17 the line for us
0:19:18 in ways that we don't necessarily see
0:19:21 and we [ __ ] talk each other all the time
0:19:22 and the one time he falls apart maybe i
0:19:25 need to apologize it's not going to be
0:19:26 now
0:19:28 we're about to go and fight
0:19:30 who knows what the settings are coming
0:19:32 for us that's weighing on him i can see
0:19:35 it then we got to go to zantosa who
0:19:37 knows what's going to be there that's
0:19:39 weighing on him then the sabbat's coming
0:19:42 and they're they're gunning specifically
0:19:44 for his sire
0:19:46 and the people that his sire told them
0:19:47 he has to defend even though he doesn't
0:19:49 want to that's weighing on him he's got
0:19:52 brother in there that he's watching out
0:19:53 for that's weighing on him
0:19:55 me and you
0:19:57 we we think we're invincible but he's
0:19:58 watching out for us in ways that we
0:20:00 can't see that's weighing on him all i'm
0:20:03 saying is is that yeah he leads us and
0:20:05 he does a pretty damn good job we gotta
0:20:08 we gotta watch his back sometimes and
0:20:09 sometimes that's just massaging his ego
0:20:12 johnny i condemned a kid to die in an
0:20:14 eternity of torture tonight
0:20:16 so that i could uphold my loyalty to
0:20:19 this Coterie
0:20:21 he kind of settles back into what that
0:20:23 little dead kid
0:20:25 i promised him i would get him home to
0:20:27 his mom
0:20:28 and Reiss has him um
0:20:31 and the way i free him is giving Reiss
0:20:33 santosa
0:20:35 you're saying a lot of things that i'm
0:20:36 not sure i understand
0:20:38 you had a meeting with Reiss stein i
0:20:40 dropped by to see if i could find joey
0:20:43 joey
0:20:44 he was there who's joey
0:20:47 you remember the night we found britta i
0:20:49 came in saying that i had been helping a
0:20:52 kid find his way home that night was
0:20:53 kind of a blur for me i had a lot going
0:20:55 on there's this little dead kid who
0:20:57 found me in the woods i see ghosts you
0:21:00 know that they find me sometimes
0:21:02 yeah this little boy
0:21:04 he came and found me he'd been mauled by
0:21:06 one of those creatures that zantos is
0:21:07 making and i he said that the one thing
0:21:09 he wanted to do before he left
0:21:12 he wanted to be able to say goodbye to
0:21:14 his mom
0:21:15 and i told him i promised him we would
0:21:17 be able to say goodbye to mom and then
0:21:19 Reiss found him and do you know what
0:21:21 they do to ghosts that don't aren't
0:21:22 particularly useful
0:21:24 no
0:21:25 same thing we do to animals when we skin
0:21:27 them
0:21:28 and this little boy is going to be used
0:21:30 as meat and he's going to be used as
0:21:33 as clothing he's probably going to be a
0:21:35 jewel on Reiss's hand
0:21:38 and do you know what that feels like
0:21:40 imagine the animals were alive when we
0:21:42 did this to them you see johnny's face
0:21:44 kind of scrunch up in this weird
0:21:46 expression of anger but then confusion
0:21:49 like he doesn't want to believe it
0:21:51 as he kind of rolls around the idea of
0:21:54 Reiss doing something that unpleasant and
0:21:56 you can see that he knows that he should
0:21:59 be outraged but he's kind of
0:22:02 unable to bring himself to express that
0:22:04 and that's kind of grinding his gears in
0:22:07 a way that looks like an engine might
0:22:09 actually seize up and break
0:22:11 and johnny this isn't just this is the
0:22:13 threat that faces ghosts this is the
0:22:16 thing that they have to
0:22:18 that is their struggle
0:22:20 is any at any point they could end up
0:22:22 like this
0:22:23 this is not just a Reiss thing this is
0:22:25 an anyone who
0:22:26 sees ghosts thing
0:22:28 and
0:22:29 it won't be quick
0:22:31 and this kid is gonna be
0:22:32 tortured he's gonna feel every bit of
0:22:35 that pain for i don't know how long
0:22:38 unless i give zantosa to him
0:22:42 look
0:22:44 being put in a rotten situation with no
0:22:46 good out
0:22:47 and then blowing up on your friends in
0:22:49 the wrong way i didn't blow up hey hey
0:22:53 he drew he drew steel and came at you
0:22:55 that that happened but
0:22:58 you're very good at needling people and
0:23:00 you know that but the point is
0:23:03 being put in rotten situations and then
0:23:05 letting the fallout blow back on your
0:23:07 friends is something i'm all too aware
0:23:10 of
0:23:11 and it's something we always got to be
0:23:13 working against
0:23:14 right now
0:23:16 miles needs us to back him more more
0:23:18 than ever
0:23:19 and if this [ __ ] is going on with you
0:23:22 you gotta let us know
0:23:23 because maybe we can help
0:23:26 i don't know what to do with this whole
0:23:27 [ __ ] with Reiss i don't know if we
0:23:29 can't give him santosa
0:23:31 we can't that's why i condemn this kid
0:23:33 to die
0:23:35 i don't like that option either no i
0:23:36 don't either but if you let us know
0:23:38 about it
0:23:39 we can come up with other solutions and
0:23:41 options
0:23:42 miles is clever neil is especially
0:23:45 clever and [ __ ] like this
0:23:46 i don't know what british can bring here
0:23:48 but i'm
0:23:49 i'm learning that we shouldn't
0:23:50 underestimate what she can do
0:23:52 you need to start telling us about this
0:23:54 stuff rather than saying miles
0:23:57 you're emotional and can't lead
0:23:59 i was also condescended to pretty hard
0:24:01 by Reiss
0:24:03 that makes sense
0:24:04 and maybe i needed to blow that off in a
0:24:07 safe place with people who aren't going
0:24:08 to take it personally
0:24:10 any other night i think you'd be
0:24:12 more than welcome to get blow off a
0:24:14 little steam on miles i mean he's a good
0:24:16 target for it but i'm just reminding you
0:24:18 about what we got ahead of us and what
0:24:20 he's been dealing with
0:24:22 because that guy usually doesn't crack
0:24:24 it's weird to see that he did tonight
0:24:26 that was weird to see that he did very
0:24:28 weird really glad he came for me so
0:24:31 maybe not apologize i'm sorry because
0:24:33 that would look weird coming out of your
0:24:35 mouth yep but especially with the things
0:24:37 keep in mind he needs that he needs us
0:24:39 tonight
0:24:40 real bad
0:24:41 yeah puts a hand in your shoulder
0:24:43 take your time out here and then heads
0:24:45 back inside wind stays outside and
0:24:47 finishes our cigarette
0:24:48 [Music]
0:24:54 all right i wanna know what's in these
0:24:56 boxes i feel like i deserve it now
0:25:01 oh my god
0:25:03 yeah yeah yeah i'll uh here let me let
0:25:05 me give you a hand here and
0:25:07 i'm going to try my best to open these
0:25:08 crates for you
0:25:10 please do
0:25:12 i mean
0:25:13 it's probably just like i'll take a
0:25:14 string plus athletics
0:25:16 ooh
0:25:18 uh there's no penalty for not having a
0:25:20 talent right right cool
0:25:24 nobody
0:25:26 one success
0:25:27 [Music]
0:25:29 oh two dice i mean if you've got a
0:25:30 crowbar
0:25:32 how long are you willing to wait for him
0:25:33 to try
0:25:34 like five seconds
0:25:36 [Laughter]
0:25:38 i think i'm getting this corner
0:25:40 you go to interjecting but please stop
0:25:43 uh it's like as you're getting the words
0:25:45 out that he manages to crack it open
0:25:47 hold on give me a second it's like
0:25:48 someone opening a pickle jar and you're
0:25:50 like just give it to and then it opens
0:25:52 yeah exactly exactly put a foot on it
0:25:55 he's accidentally pushing it down with
0:25:57 his foot
0:26:00 what's inside
0:26:01 what you see
0:26:03 is it's actually very
0:26:05 well organized
0:26:06 there's a set of shotguns uh all of them
0:26:09 already sawed off and like properly
0:26:11 modified and ready for like
0:26:13 you know your classic world of darkness
0:26:15 street to street combat
0:26:16 and in addition to that there's like
0:26:19 surveillance equipment and
0:26:22 in addition to that there's these little
0:26:24 red
0:26:25 uh containers that are like
0:26:28 like six by eight when you pick them up
0:26:31 to examine it says the word dragon's
0:26:34 breath yeah i knew it
0:26:37 the barrels on the shotguns uh are like
0:26:39 they seem to be made of this like
0:26:41 ceramic material it looks like they're
0:26:42 intended to keep from overheating uh
0:26:45 this is like the fancy box pretty
0:26:47 clearly
0:26:48 miles does any of this mean anything to
0:26:50 you what kind of gun is that i mean it's
0:26:52 just it's a sawed-off i mean just look
0:26:54 at this the end of it it's like yeah
0:26:55 like a professionally done sawed-off
0:26:57 they're very beautiful wait what do you
0:26:58 mean the end of it the end of it the
0:27:00 ceramic bit i haven't seen that in a gun
0:27:02 ceramic bit
0:27:03 start poking at it
0:27:05 yeah you kind of like it it's like uh
0:27:07 it's some kind of material that's not
0:27:09 steel it's not the gun
0:27:11 as far as i know yeah it's it's
0:27:13 these are specifically designed to
0:27:16 handle these particular rounds
0:27:18 which are
0:27:20 fire they shoot fire oh god oh yeah uh i
0:27:24 wouldn't use regular rounds and i'm
0:27:25 gonna ruins the coating wait so these
0:27:27 are speci
0:27:28 ruins
0:27:30 okay you two clearly know a lot more
0:27:31 about guns than i do yes so does it work
0:27:34 as more of a flamethrower or more of a
0:27:36 grenade launcher flying through
0:27:38 that was an invitation to explain okay
0:27:41 what gotcha no i got it i got it because
0:27:43 rounds shoot a large flame burst out of
0:27:45 the end of the the gun typical shotguns
0:27:47 will warp under the heat and pressure
0:27:48 usually one round or so
0:27:50 these ones are specially designed to
0:27:51 fire multiple times and that's
0:27:53 terrifying
0:27:54 win at this point kind of opens the door
0:27:56 and kind of peeks in like
0:27:58 is it safe to come back in are we we
0:28:00 cool she looks at miles she looks a
0:28:02 little bit cowed apologized

0:29:32 site britta walks over to her box and
0:29:34 immediately starts assembling the gun
0:29:37 very practice motions no hesitation look
0:29:40 at that i recognize it's really hot
0:29:41 color booking okay
0:29:42 neil starts looking around for his
0:29:44 package here's yours well i don't need
0:29:46 that binoculars
0:29:50 it's like a squeaky toy
0:29:52 and a lucky whistle
0:29:58 don't worry your whistle is matte black
0:30:00 a sensate comes from me and i just have
0:30:02 a note that's like oh no i have a
0:30:03 doctor's note i don't do combat i don't
0:30:05 do that no you you'll
0:30:10 okay well the body armor is heavy i
0:30:11 don't know put the goddamn armor on did
0:30:13 we not just see a gigantic bear
0:30:15 seemingly like uncle not much sooner for
0:30:18 me than you uh i actually had a very
0:30:20 specific question
0:30:21 um for stuff does anybody have a couple
0:30:24 like cheap bic lighters that i can have
0:30:26 yeah uh when kind of pats or pockets
0:30:28 like two or three of them like as many
0:30:29 as you can get she pulls out one why
0:30:32 because i might need it puts it in like
0:30:33 a little satchel
0:30:35 anyways when we get there on site neil
0:30:38 you can set yourself up where you think
0:30:39 is best so just the one then we're
0:30:41 nothing it should be somewhere else up
0:30:43 top that might be best johnny and wynn
0:30:45 you'll set yourselves up down below i
0:30:47 think it's best well i could i can i can
0:30:49 haul ass across the street pretty
0:30:51 quickly well we'll be inside so so um
0:30:54 but uh i'm gonna check out this third
0:30:55 box while you guys put that on put your
0:30:58 stuff on did you really walkie-talkies
0:30:59 or anything just so like because ideally
0:31:02 i should probably be outside to keep an
0:31:04 eye out for
0:31:05 incoming so that you know if i manage to
0:31:07 get a good high position i'll have some
0:31:10 vision on what's going on as well yeah
0:31:12 because remember this we're ambushing
0:31:13 them but they think they're ambushing
0:31:15 you so they're going to come in as quiet
0:31:16 as they can right probably maybe
0:31:19 they have very much that is a good point
0:31:21 though
0:31:22 neil should be on the lookout
0:31:25 for anyone trying to sneak in the way he
0:31:27 does
0:31:29 keep us on on a walkie-talkie in case
0:31:31 you see something that way we can uh we
0:31:33 can get the drop on them i mean part of
0:31:35 this is the settigs really want me to
0:31:37 know that they beat me before they do
0:31:39 whatever they're going to do to me so
0:31:41 well let's play let's play it safe
0:31:43 regardless yeah
0:31:45 i mean they're going to learn after this
0:31:46 one it's going to be way worse next
0:31:48 actually um yeah i'll help you guys get
0:31:49 some of your vests on johnny starts
0:31:51 getting the armor on himself and then
0:31:53 and then we'll go over and kind of check
0:31:54 everybody else to make sure they're
0:31:56 armored walkie-talkie means i have to
0:31:57 actually talk um i'm gonna open the
0:31:59 third key
0:32:01 the third container has things that you
0:32:02 [Music]
0:32:04 are given pause about right
0:32:07 one of them is a black with like dark
0:32:11 purple trimmed corset and the corset is
0:32:15 like armored and in addition to this
0:32:17 there's like a choker some jewelry a
0:32:20 small container of like makeup a lot of
0:32:22 it's like kind of like very dark moody
0:32:24 makeup there is an assortment of weapons
0:32:26 some of them are rather unusual
0:32:29 this uh over like about a dozen knives
0:32:32 of various shapes some of them made with
0:32:35 strange materials like silver gold in
0:32:37 addition to this there's like a very
0:32:39 nice mp5 that's been arranged the
0:32:42 briefcase container for that mp5 extra
0:32:44 ammunition and it's not like there's
0:32:47 copies of this it's all like a setup for
0:32:50 one person there are smoke grenades in
0:32:53 addition to the smoke grenades uh there
0:32:56 is another suitcase but it looks like
0:32:58 it's designed and when you like kind of
0:33:00 crack it open and get a look you kind of
0:33:02 get the feeling the feeling that like a
0:33:04 man gets when he realizes he's holding a
0:33:06 bear at like 50.
0:33:08 and very special time in a man's life
0:33:11 what the [ __ ]
0:33:13 in it there is an envelope it has a
0:33:17 scepter unlike a wax seal you actually
0:33:20 recognize it to be like
0:33:23 is like a mark
0:33:25 and on the envelope it simply says to
0:33:28 lucita
0:33:29 then you close the box up
0:33:32 i was like apparently i'm holding this
0:33:34 for one individual person and uh based
0:33:37 on this kid i don't want to [ __ ] with
0:33:39 that person that's a very interesting
0:33:40 name
0:33:41 britta had gone over to help johnny with
0:33:44 the final details on his vest since he
0:33:46 had already been helping others and she
0:33:49 kind of looks over and notices the uh
0:33:51 maybe the top layer is what she can see
0:33:53 from her position confusion on her face
0:33:56 actually there's a wooly you have to
0:33:57 make the second you look at the corset
0:33:59 oh
0:34:01 oh i was actually going to ask how well
0:34:02 crafted it was oh boy
0:34:05 i think it's self-control difficulty
0:34:09 miles you shouldn't have
0:34:12 those are mine now this is like a give
0:34:14 like a nice silver ankh
0:34:16 who's associated with the egyptian ship
0:34:18 oh everybody that's awkward one success
0:34:21 general okay you managed to keep control
0:34:24 of yourself but the the clever design
0:34:28 that they use for like the bits of steel
0:34:31 kevlar and silk kind of come together in
0:34:35 such a way that you are given paws Britta
0:34:37 lingers looking at what she can see but
0:34:39 she manages to pull herself away and
0:34:41 finish the loop that she's tying as
0:34:43 Britta is looking at it neil's just kind
0:34:45 of comes up behind her and also looks
0:34:47 over and i would like to try and discern
0:34:49 if i can any sort of patterns as to this
0:34:52 arrangement and why this is here
0:34:54 absolutely
0:34:55 i'm not telling you the difficulty
0:34:56 you're just going to totally i'm going
0:34:57 to look at what you rolled and then i'm
0:34:58 going to yep yep yep yep
0:35:00 i have an die pool exploding tents
0:35:02 okay uh you
0:35:04 there there is a duality into this on
0:35:06 one hand you clearly get the sense that
0:35:10 this is uh
0:35:12 the the loadout for a world-class
0:35:14 assassin and not an assassin who is
0:35:17 trained to kill mere mortal men but this
0:35:19 is like
0:35:20 these are the belongings of a huntress
0:35:23 you don't make fancy knives out of weird
0:35:24 materials if you're just gonna go kill a
0:35:26 guy right
0:35:27 in addition to that the letter is
0:35:30 one written and longing miles where did
0:35:33 where did this box come from yeah about
0:35:35 the others yeah where did they come from
0:35:37 again i don't know
0:35:39 hey does anyone want me to be a
0:35:40 wolverine for this oh
0:35:43 i feel like the answer to that is you
0:35:45 want to be a wolverine for this i'm
0:35:47 dying to try it out but this it's not
0:35:50 combat efficient this might be a strange
0:35:53 question but you can't wear the armor
0:35:56 for that right probably not yeah Britta's
0:35:59 got a point yeah but i'm a wolverine
0:36:01 i've got armor
0:36:02 i feel like i feel like start off the
0:36:04 way you look now but then as the combat
0:36:07 goes feel it out and do what feels right
0:36:09 play it by ear yep you could do that
0:36:12 this might be another strange question
0:36:14 but do you fit in the box you wanted to
0:36:16 start in if you're not a wolverine
0:36:18 that's also part of it it's a big enough
0:36:20 box it's a big enough box that i can i
0:36:21 had not planned on there being a
0:36:23 wolverine win they're in this particular
0:36:24 situation
0:36:26 oddly coffin
0:36:28 it's a big shipping container in the box
0:36:30 you know basically what
0:36:32 ships things like art and things okay
0:36:34 follow-up question to my previous
0:36:36 question miles um closes the box yeah
0:36:39 are you just supposed to hold these or
0:36:41 oh yes
0:36:42 i was supposed to hold these but i was
0:36:44 also told that i could use whatever i
0:36:45 wanted okay because
0:36:47 if the person here that stuff is oh yeah
0:36:50 no i'm not touching this stuff no this
0:36:52 is no i'm just more worried that someone
0:36:53 like that is in the city at all well
0:36:56 when somebody wears a corset somebody
0:36:58 who they require has an entire loadout
0:37:01 to specifically kill
0:37:03 not people johnny kind of looks over the
0:37:06 stuff kind of unconvinced that that's
0:37:08 true but then kind of looks back at neil
0:37:10 and kind of shrugs i [ __ ] hate new
0:37:12 haven yeah i'm uh this is
0:37:15 not for us tomorrow probably okay uh
0:37:17 somebody said the weather was getting
0:37:18 bad we should get going yeah for
0:37:20 yourself throw the keys over to johnny
0:37:22 let's get it going johnny snatches the
0:37:24 keys and
0:37:25 he's got his
0:37:26 boot knife matte black axe
0:37:28 shotgun oh one last thing body armor
0:37:31 with a mended leather jacket over top
0:37:34 win grab some something do me a favor
0:37:36 and
0:37:37 give miles your paper win holds out her
0:37:40 very tattered probably has some duct
0:37:42 tape on it vapor you don't know why
0:37:45 miles but it's sticky does does anyone
0:37:48 besides us have that number it's not
0:37:50 going to accidentally randomly go off
0:37:52 isn't it okay logged with
0:37:55 no even is that how you got called in
0:37:56 the first place yeah i mean i assumed
0:37:59 you met us like camarie and kindred yeah
0:38:01 i mean us ask
0:38:03 johnny do you mind sending a message or
0:38:05 something to weathers being like don't
0:38:07 don't call win for the next couple hours
0:38:09 yeah i could do that i can also just put
0:38:11 it on silent i don't want it on silent i
0:38:13 want it to buzz oh because if miles has
0:38:16 it and it buzzes it means i sent it a
0:38:18 message and i don't have to talk to send
0:38:21 it a message
0:38:22 well my cell phone is pretty new i think
0:38:24 the only people who would have it would
0:38:26 be
0:38:26 miles and you all yeah but if you're in
0:38:28 a separate location i want you to have a
0:38:29 cell phone if the beeper buzzes it's me
0:38:31 telling you great okay you're gonna want
0:38:33 some goo gone for your hands that way i
0:38:35 don't have to talk i'm wearing gloves
0:38:36 okay well come on i'll contact leather
0:38:38 weathers and uh let them know that we're
0:38:40 gonna be going silent for a little bit
0:38:43 let's not
0:38:44 no i just don't okay i just don't want
0:38:47 to dump the sick let's just go just
0:38:48 let's talk about this overcomplicate
0:38:50 things again i'm not over complicating
0:38:51 things i'm planning for eventualities
0:38:53 yeah no i
0:38:55 weather's as good as his job but i'm not
0:38:56 sure how tapped his stuff is everybody
0:38:59 knows his position
0:39:00 miles is a good point well let's hope
0:39:02 for the best then right that's what we
0:39:04 do let's [ __ ] [ __ ] up
0:39:11 all right so you guys head out what's
0:39:13 the vehicle you're taking for this trip
0:39:14 i think a older chevy blazer but it is
0:39:17 like
0:39:18 like raised up large tires kind of deal
0:39:21 yeah
0:39:24 blacked out windows
0:39:27 so the group of you get into the blazer
0:39:29 who's wheel man
0:39:30 johnny give me a drive check diff7 the
0:39:33 roads are a little slick as you head out
0:39:35 to the location that you guys are
0:39:36 planning your uh attack from sure thing
0:39:39 if they call a snowman almost open road
0:39:41 just lets me get there you got open road
0:39:43 let you get there done the group of you
0:39:44 pull up and immediately uh you kind of
0:39:47 look around there's like an old barbed
0:39:49 wire fence that's kind of been like torn
0:39:52 apart and rusted out this whole area is
0:39:56 just dilapidated and falling apart
0:39:58 there's graffiti everywhere there's
0:40:01 uncomfortable crevices and like walls
0:40:04 and potholes everywhere this place is
0:40:07 honestly the perfect spot for a shootout
0:40:10 as you move through and investigate uh
0:40:12 that layer of snow that's starting to
0:40:15 cake on everything shows no signs of
0:40:17 footprints that have recently moved
0:40:19 through the area aside from the group of
0:40:23 yours heightened senses vision once we
0:40:25 get to the location also putting i'm
0:40:28 heightened sense is everything we get
0:40:30 compensating we got to be careful
0:40:31 because if if if they notice that
0:40:34 there's a lot of tracks here they're
0:40:36 going to know you're not alone how heavy
0:40:38 is the snow can you do something about
0:40:39 that pretty heavy yeah so it should be
0:40:41 good it should go away soonish if we
0:40:43 just sweep it give me a survival check
0:40:45 if you want to know how that would be
0:40:46 well there's other things
0:40:48 there is one thing we could do if we
0:40:51 step in each other's footsteps i was
0:40:53 just hoping that wind could cover it up
0:40:54 and then join us no that's actually
0:40:55 really well that's true i guess just
0:40:58 sweep afterwards yeah
0:41:00 okay um do that do that now so that you
0:41:02 know where mine are so wind's gonna be
0:41:04 never used this before so i don't know
0:41:05 how wind's gonna be a barnell
0:41:08 so cody and four so the group of you
0:41:10 watch wind change shape uh
0:41:13 that's new
0:41:15 i mean i was kind of hoping you'd take
0:41:16 care of the tracks first and then
0:41:18 turn the part out but you know whatever
0:41:21 after watching her bones twist around
0:41:23 and like they're all scared
0:41:25 feathers it does it bonds right into her
0:41:27 that's crazy
0:41:30 that's uh
0:41:31 that's a hell of a thing she kind of
0:41:33 nods toward the building for all of you
0:41:35 werewolf in london feel from that
0:41:39 okay go get set up inside guys leave it
0:41:42 to win
0:41:42 all right okay
0:41:44 that's fine uh just in case just just
0:41:47 i'm going to just take the like scraper
0:41:49 for the car and just i'm going to walk
0:41:51 last and just
0:41:53 hit the footprints just in case so that
0:41:55 even when they fill in it should just
0:41:57 even out would you give him something
0:41:58 it's not perception so i don't blow 10
0:42:00 so that's just that's successful easily
0:42:02 what about six
0:42:03 so um and body armor and kneel
0:42:07 we should all write down the body armor
0:42:08 if you're looking this up three dice of
0:42:10 soap yep yep applies to egg so that's
0:42:12 the rating that gives me almost as much
0:42:14 as wins base and johnny what does your
0:42:17 jackie at the reinforced jacket do
0:42:20 does that stack with the uh
0:42:22 leather jacket
0:42:23 one soak well the dragon is the only
0:42:24 thing that will stack because this is a
0:42:27 world of darkness game and the most
0:42:28 powerful piece of equipment you can get
0:42:30 is a leather jacket because britta has
0:42:32 definitely placed her uh newly gifted
0:42:34 leather jacket over her body armor once
0:42:37 people have gone inside alwyn will kind
0:42:39 of swoop over a few times at 20 miles an
0:42:42 hour sweeping snow and distorting the
0:42:45 prince and covering them okay
0:42:47 and he actually also has like uh he's
0:42:49 following the he's holding behind the
0:42:50 trail and kind of covering them up
0:42:52 making it like better yeah and then
0:42:54 she'll fly into the warehouse and she'll
0:42:56 just kind of perch somewhere high sounds
0:42:58 good neil is staying outside but just
0:43:00 walking like behind that's freezing out
0:43:02 here i'm also wearing like a big metal
0:43:04 leather coat but like a pea coat you
0:43:06 just go behind fate from sight brett is
0:43:08 looking for a place in the high ground
0:43:10 to stake out and uh be subtle okay
0:43:14 so
0:43:15 for Britta there's a set of rafters that
0:43:17 probably look pretty good i need a dex
0:43:18 plus althought extract to get up there
0:43:20 okay
0:43:20 neil you're hanging out outside the
0:43:22 building off it obviously okay done
0:43:24 you're you just easily yeah through a
0:43:26 window and people she shows a bird yeah
0:43:28 she shows uh britta some good spots
0:43:32 british spots win as she's looking
0:43:33 around and
0:43:35 just climb up the rafters
0:43:48 like a cat burglar kind of very easily
0:43:51 makes her way up through like ice and
0:43:53 snow up into like rafters down below
0:43:56 i imagine there's some like regular
0:43:58 crates and stuff like that and it kind
0:43:59 of like the similar cases that we kind
0:44:01 of got from the sedex before like laid
0:44:03 out as like a transaction sounds good
0:44:06 other than that is this place got lights
0:44:08 or anything like that it is very poorly
0:44:10 lit i'll just tuck him amongst the
0:44:12 crates then yeah it's probably the best
0:44:14 so johnny just finds a spot kind of in
0:44:16 amongst the crates out of line of sight
0:44:18 where he can just kind of like easily
0:44:19 come up and join the fray with miles
0:44:21 yeah because i mean like it's not even
0:44:23 like there's no like like when you flip
0:44:25 the light switch
0:44:26 nothing happens this place has been
0:44:28 abandoned for a little bit but there's
0:44:30 these like huge open broken windows
0:44:34 up top and because it's like snowing out
0:44:36 there's a ton of like light pollution
0:44:37 outside and it's kind of filtering in to
0:44:40 kind of cast all of these very
0:44:42 interesting shadows inside of the
0:44:44 warehouse itself
0:44:46 and johnny finds a nice like spot are
0:44:48 you laying stealth i i could i have a
0:44:51 decent decks like yeah what would it be
0:44:53 dexterity stealth yes okay
0:44:57 two successes great uh johnny actually
0:44:59 plugged in really well miles you find
0:45:01 yourself alone i pop open one of the
0:45:03 canis the cases stack a rifle there
0:45:05 that's just quick to hand but out of
0:45:07 sight now wait for the arrival of the
0:45:10 set heights
0:45:11 looking bored
0:45:13 you find yourself just kind of
0:45:15 contemplating maybe meditating a bit
0:45:23 after about 15-20 minutes those who are
0:45:26 outside see
0:45:28 pair of
0:45:29 black
0:45:30 suvs so similar to the ones you've
0:45:34 already dealt with before all my points
0:45:36 made it one time
0:45:37 pull in uh miles from outside uh from
0:45:41 rather from inside looking out like
0:45:43 those those big windows i described you
0:45:44 can actually see the shine of their
0:45:46 headlights you then hear the sounds of
0:45:49 the suvs doors opening and closing those
0:45:52 who are outside see eight individuals
0:45:54 climb out they've got these like cocky
0:45:56 expressions on them they're loading up
0:45:59 weapons and they're striding in pretty
0:46:03 pretty clearly uh not with any intention
0:46:06 of like bartering or offering quarter to
0:46:09 miles some of them have like gold teeth
0:46:11 they all have like these these these
0:46:13 very like interesting uh
0:46:16 appearances about them like uh thick
0:46:18 jewelry uh some dreads some of them have
0:46:21 like red colored mohawks uh there's
0:46:24 piercings all over the place the thing
0:46:25 that they really uh do definitely all
0:46:28 have in common is that as they approach
0:46:30 the warehouse their skin starts to
0:46:33 change
0:46:34 to that of like a cobra and that's when
0:46:36 you realize that all eight of these
0:46:38 people are kindred as they pull up and
0:46:40 get out i will
0:46:42 hit the text the beeper thing eight
0:46:44 times okay so they're just in succession
0:46:47 as they approach they kind of start to
0:46:50 split up and head off in different
0:46:51 directions once some of them round the
0:46:54 corner you don't hear from them anymore
0:46:56 um until the client senses up even with
0:46:58 heightened senses up interesting and
0:47:01 eight becomes five miles inside you get
0:47:05 to a point where you can now actually
0:47:06 hear
0:47:07 someone uh
0:47:08 right by the emergency exit door and one
0:47:12 of them
0:47:13 from outside you guys can see reaches
0:47:16 grabs the door handle yanks it off the
0:47:19 door tosses the metal behind him
0:47:21 sticks his finger like into the hole and
0:47:23 just pulls the metal door open and you
0:47:25 can hear like a metal pop and scrape
0:47:27 from the door frame itself and they
0:47:30 start barging in before we roll into a
0:47:33 fight not a question from my position
0:47:35 outside with heightened senses up and
0:47:37 stuff can i tell if those cars totally
0:47:39 emptied out or if there's anyone still
0:47:41 waiting for cars those cars are totally
0:47:43 emptied out okay they are just going for
0:47:46 miles to hit and hit him as hard as i
0:47:48 want to make sure that like kalis or
0:47:49 whatever wasn't hanging out waiting in
0:47:51 the car that's that was this isn't
0:47:52 really kalisa's i would just double
0:47:54 check it or just some kind or some kind
0:47:56 of weird sorcerer who's sitting in the
0:47:57 car doing [ __ ] yeah exactly sorcery yeah
0:48:00 so i'm going to blood up as i hear them
0:48:02 coming up yes
0:48:04 yeah
0:48:10 miles door swings open and very quickly
0:48:14 you find a group of followers of set
0:48:15 rushing in they have skin of the outer
0:48:17 active all of them are armed with
0:48:19 automatic weapons and the room starts to
0:48:22 fill with with gunshots and
0:48:26 it is then that the group of you spring
0:48:28 your trap so at the top of initiative
0:48:31 is Britta with heightened vision can i
0:48:34 see any pendants or anything like the
0:48:37 one the guy in the back of the car had
0:48:39 before like a pendulum yeah uh this
0:48:42 group does not seem to have the occult
0:48:44 fixings that that person had all right
0:48:47 so then i will be taking the gun that
0:48:49 miles gave me and i'll be aiming it for
0:48:51 the person closest to the door out of
0:48:53 our enemies that's it now i
0:48:56 you
0:48:57 train your weapon center mass and then
0:48:59 you find yourself tilting the weapon up
0:49:01 getting a beat on the head you're gonna
0:49:03 take a plus two difficulty to your
0:49:04 attack roll but you're gonna shoot for
0:49:05 the head
0:49:06 okay yes and what's the
0:49:08 benefits of surprise again uh
0:49:11 so you roll your stealth
0:49:12 versus their awareness
0:49:14 you get to add your successes yeah to
0:49:16 your attention before you make your
0:49:18 attack roll uh can i have a dex plus
0:49:20 stealth check please yep and that is
0:49:22 with the uh higher decks that we spent
0:49:24 blood for it is okay that's why i bumped
0:49:26 it
0:49:28 did you bump
0:49:32 no handicap for not having self-esteem
0:49:34 ability uh
0:49:35 no there is uh scale plus one death plus
0:49:38 one okay
0:49:42 two successes okay uh add another uh two
0:49:44 dice to your tackle
0:49:47 three successes okay all right yes three
0:49:50 two will carry over into damage all
0:49:52 right sir you're looking at a plus
0:49:53 eleven nice step
0:49:56 [Music]
0:49:58 oh my god
0:50:02 uh he searched one and immediately
0:50:03 collapses to end cap his guy's like what
0:50:06 the hell like he just dragged all
0:50:08 straight to the ground beautiful okay so
0:50:13 uh johnny johnny also leaps out of from
0:50:16 behind the crates was selfless carrying
0:50:18 two dragon's breath shotguns in either
0:50:21 hand
0:50:22 off a sawed-off in either hands or two
0:50:25 of them like sawed off pistol grip
0:50:26 monsters only one success coming out
0:50:28 from uh stealth okay he will split his
0:50:31 action to unload one of the uh barrels
0:50:34 from a from a dragon's shotgun and then
0:50:37 another are you ambidextrous oh i don't
0:50:40 think i am so so then he would actually
0:50:42 just be wanting to do one right well it
0:50:43 just means that the second tackle has a
0:50:45 higher def that's fine let's do it
0:50:48 uh are you a point blank range uh so
0:50:51 it's gonna be
0:50:52 diff five
0:50:55 because he's he's doing two gun so it's
0:50:57 going to be diff 5 diff 6 okay
0:51:02 the uh splitting my dice pool is we're
0:51:03 just just right down the middle right
0:51:05 right down the middle perfect video so
0:51:08 so we're not we're not that they're not
0:51:09 that great i got four dice on each
0:51:11 attack okay are you spending any
0:51:13 willpower for them yeah yeah i think i
0:51:15 will
0:51:17 i'll spend a willpower in each attack i
0:51:18 guess yeah first one
0:51:20 well i am swift and that putting these
0:51:22 rounds where i want does uh come up
0:51:24 right
0:51:25 index so that's going to be three
0:51:27 successes four with the willpower on the
0:51:29 first one okay so why don't we go
0:51:31 straight to damage on that one okay
0:51:32 that's three rolling over i need eleven
0:51:34 dice of damage as
0:51:36 a
0:51:37 spray of flames erupts with like a long
0:51:42 roar
0:51:43 we have jumped right aboard this crazy
0:51:45 trick i love it okay so we're looking at
0:51:48 five successes okay uh he will take five
0:51:50 levels of aggravated damage clean
0:51:52 through everything and uh
0:51:54 scream spinning around on fire beautiful
0:51:57 and then uh the next guy
0:52:01 that's also gonna be three successes
0:52:02 okay dude uh first one
0:52:05 raw track second one
0:52:08 raw track wow double watch and that'll
0:52:11 be three levels of aggravated damage on
0:52:13 the next guy okay because once you
0:52:15 subtract yes uh both of them scream in
0:52:18 pain and are spinning to turn and run
0:52:20 away from this
0:52:21 this altercation uh while continuing to
0:52:25 emulate
0:52:26 stop drop and roll guys so that's that's
0:52:29 johnny
0:52:30 when
0:52:32 so
0:52:33 when is timing coming out of her bird
0:52:35 form so that as she flies from the
0:52:37 rafters she lands on the guy who said
0:52:40 what the hell as win do i get the
0:52:42 stealth
0:52:43 yeah okay
0:52:46 three successes all of those carry over
0:52:48 into your attack roll three extra am i i
0:52:50 am splitting my dice pool did you add
0:52:51 your owl bonus no i did not i mean i
0:52:54 would i would assume i didn't see one in
0:52:56 the book but i'm going to give you a
0:52:58 three-dime bonus to yourself roll
0:53:00 they're kind of like
0:53:01 specifically known to be silent flyers
0:53:03 okay
0:53:04 would be two more successes okay so
0:53:06 we'll add five dice to your attacker
0:53:08 five to be fair i don't think anyone's
0:53:10 expecting an owl a a Gangrel to fly
0:53:13 out of the rafters no
0:53:15 it's a legitimate surprise yeah
0:53:17 i would be surprised oh no oh lady like
0:53:20 it's
0:53:21 all close
0:53:22 yeah exactly
0:53:24 what do you hurt me so
0:53:26 so first attack roll
0:53:28 that's so many for a split yeah
0:53:31 um and since i am using claws that
0:53:33 counts as two i believe or so four
0:53:36 seven uh for the first hit oh my god so
0:53:38 uh six will carry over into damage okay
0:53:40 uh what's your strength currently six
0:53:42 okay uh so that's going to be uh 13 dice
0:53:45 of aggravated damage uh he will roll so
0:53:49 yeah
0:53:49 that's probably definitely has soaked
0:53:51 against this okay is that the outer step
0:53:54 yep okay
0:53:58 all right just just moment of pause uh
0:54:00 so that is the sound that i only hear
0:54:02 when playing exalted
0:54:05 you know just like like
0:54:11 all right well that's a lot of ones and
0:54:13 i'm not happy about that works so hard
0:54:14 two damage
0:54:16 no yeah three you slash in the first one
0:54:18 for three levels of aggravated damage
0:54:19 there's no successes on soak and now i
0:54:20 roll my second claw
0:54:22 yep uh two successes one carries over
0:54:26 into damage
0:54:28 three more the second attack he actually
0:54:30 seems more resistant to you find like
0:54:31 your claws scraping against these scales
0:54:34 that is uh when uh he does like [ __ ]
0:54:37 howl in pain
0:54:39 from that first claw probably some
0:54:40 surprise
0:54:41 lots of surprise
0:54:43 uh after that it is on miles miles are
0:54:46 we not real stealth nope are they now in
0:54:48 the way in the way of what if i was just
0:54:51 going to pull up with a gun and start
0:54:52 open fire and get this crowd of people
0:54:54 but
0:54:55 oh you want to go full on yeah that's
0:54:56 not going to happen so i will pick up
0:54:59 the gun and go for a head shot sounds
0:55:01 good so how many targets do we actually
0:55:03 have left who are on
0:55:05 is there one single guy who's uninjured
0:55:07 at this point
0:55:08 five going in the front so
0:55:10 one of them has three eggs one of them
0:55:13 is in raw trek another one is in
0:55:15 rochester and then there's two who are
0:55:17 unharmed well there's one that she's
0:55:22 so there's one who is on this has gone
0:55:24 horribly wrong for who well they still
0:55:26 have three running around so i'm gonna
0:55:28 shoot the unharmed ones i'm gonna look
0:55:29 for him sounds good lex did um when i
0:55:32 landed on this guy did he take any
0:55:33 damage from me landing on him uh so it's
0:55:36 actually you kind of like leaping in
0:55:38 from the surprise okay that gives the
0:55:39 damage bonus on that cool well one
0:55:41 success but i'll take it give me damage
0:55:46 five go take four levels of lethal
0:55:47 damage as a section of his skull is
0:55:50 blown completely off it's a little
0:55:52 unsettling because he stays on his feet
0:55:54 most people would be not on their feet
0:55:57 anymore at this point and uh from there
0:56:00 uh we're gonna go to neil who's creeping
0:56:02 around
0:56:03 i have a question those guys who
0:56:04 disappear around the back i know how
0:56:06 this works can i see any sign of their
0:56:08 footprints can we just rebel check
0:56:10 titans senses fly to this still yep
0:56:14 so that's five successes nice okay
0:56:18 i'm basically just trying to figure out
0:56:20 whether or not they're an obvious skate
0:56:21 because if they are i have a plan but if
0:56:23 they're not or i can see them anyways
0:56:24 i'm just gonna progression eyes of chaos
0:56:26 man two of them you kind of pick up on
0:56:29 jaclyn but again they have to be kind of
0:56:30 like a little older tracks because the
0:56:31 way obviously works you're pretty sure
0:56:33 everyone here involved is an obvious
0:56:34 game okay one of them you have
0:56:36 completely lost cool but they were
0:56:38 moving around sort of the back of this
0:56:41 place if i were to because i'm
0:56:42 reasonably close to where the cars are
0:56:44 right if i were just to swing the car
0:56:45 around could i just light up the back of
0:56:47 the building where they're supposedly at
0:56:49 with headlights because then obfuscate
0:56:51 don't work no more sure that is what i'm
0:56:52 going to do i'm going to run over their
0:56:54 car
0:56:54 start it up rather than shooting
0:56:57 much more importantly
0:56:58 on
0:56:59 your action next round you can make your
0:57:00 move to the car that is what i will be
0:57:02 doing looking around trying to make sure
0:57:04 and i want to make sure nobody gets
0:57:05 jumped so i'm going to go over the car
0:57:06 sounds good to me uh we're going to
0:57:08 start with regular initiative on
0:57:11 two characters are going to act Britta
0:57:13 and one of the raw trekking uh satites
0:57:17 uh turns and brushes out the door what
0:57:20 are you doing oh your target seems dealt
0:57:21 with well uh for now uh but there's more
0:57:25 let's see
0:57:26 undamaged guy
0:57:28 so there's no undamaged guys anymore
0:57:31 one of them has a cracked skull from
0:57:33 where miles shot him
0:57:36 and the other one has this
0:57:38 horrible slash down along his chest
0:57:41 uh from where wind got do i know
0:57:44 anything about raw shrek would have been
0:57:46 taught anything about that by this point
0:57:48 uh i mean it's uh so what what it looks
0:57:50 like to you right and and uh you can
0:57:53 defer what you will they are hissing and
0:57:55 screaming uh not like people this is
0:57:58 clearly the sounds that like monsters
0:58:00 make they're kind of like turning around
0:58:03 not completely aware of their
0:58:04 surroundings and they are fleeing
0:58:07 desperately from the fire that they are
0:58:09 engulfed in okay i'm gonna
0:58:11 even youth like kind of feel your beast
0:58:13 recoil with fright when johnny unleashes
0:58:16 what he does on the crowd well i'm
0:58:17 aiming to shoot someone least damaged
0:58:20 and leased on fire it is kind of a toss
0:58:22 up between uh the two that win and miles
0:58:25 are fighting especially who do you want
0:58:26 to back up being in the rafters can i
0:58:28 only see in the building or can i see
0:58:29 out of the building as well like is this
0:58:31 how structurally how's the building
0:58:33 structure like can i see out of the
0:58:35 building there are some pretty big like
0:58:37 open windows that are like old glass
0:58:39 like that old foggy glass that's largely
0:58:41 smashed in all right let's shoot the guy
0:58:43 that's in rush that's inside sounds good
0:58:45 his back is to you uh she'll gain the
0:58:47 bonus for that plus you guys
0:58:51 yeah i'm always concerned about the way
0:58:52 that she sets dice aside what
0:58:55 so much yeah it's a lot of dice uh four
0:58:57 successes okay uh that's gonna be three
0:59:00 that rolls over damage
0:59:03 for success uh so he's gonna go to
0:59:06 torpor and he's on fire so
0:59:08 according to my math he is [ __ ] dead
0:59:11 okay britta
0:59:13 it's just
0:59:14 the slow methodical sniper fire is like
0:59:18 it's actually a little unsettling yeah
0:59:20 opposite to this
0:59:23 is it with a with a big almost
0:59:25 uncharacteristic smile uh is johnny your
0:59:29 action so who do i have for targets left
0:59:31 at this point so okay you have
0:59:33 one person who's been caught by wind one
0:59:36 person who has a
0:59:38 horrible head wound one person that is
0:59:41 just burning the ash on the ground one
0:59:43 person who just ducked out the door uh
0:59:45 in full blown rock shack and another
0:59:46 person that's on the ground in torpor it
0:59:48 is a [ __ ] show okay please don't fire a
0:59:51 dragon's breath at me oh no no no no i'm
0:59:53 not i'm i'm actually debating firing
0:59:55 dragons right at this point because i
0:59:57 think has came on that strong just
0:59:59 having extra dragons brother in my
1:00:00 chambers is actually worthwhile it is at
1:00:02 this point it is so i think what
1:00:04 johnny's gonna do is he's just going to
1:00:07 the guy who has a section of his head
1:00:08 missing from uh miles shot he's
1:00:10 basically just gonna gonna like step up
1:00:13 on that guy and give him a vicious like
1:00:15 uh just like
1:00:17 yeah basically like just uh
1:00:21 no because that's gonna not get a
1:00:22 feeling that those guns are good uh
1:00:24 being used to splinter no because
1:00:26 because the fact they have that skin up
1:00:27 yeah yeah well that and you're so strong
1:00:30 you're going to shatter this ceramic gun
1:00:32 you also do have a matte black axe
1:00:34 though yeah yeah but i got to drop that
1:00:35 and draw that
1:00:36 um you'd be basically splitting dice
1:00:38 cool not to up slinging i'm just going
1:00:40 to finish i'm i'm gonna empty one uh one
1:00:42 of the guns and just finish that uh that
1:00:43 guy off with a blast from my uh from my
1:00:46 good hand sounds good
1:00:48 so
1:00:50 wow the difference between this fight
1:00:53 oh no i don't think i got the background
1:00:58 uh close range just uh putting this guy
1:01:00 out of his misery yeah you diff you're
1:01:03 looking at a different for your tackle
1:01:05 sir this is not great i mean
1:01:09 so that's going to be five successes
1:01:12 okay four will carry over you're like
1:01:14 looking at twelve dice of aggravated
1:01:15 damage
1:01:17 so not okay
1:01:19 i'm very okay with this running fleeing
1:01:22 six levels of aggravated damage okay
1:01:24 he's dead and that shotgun's empty and
1:01:26 jenny doesn't bother reloading so he
1:01:27 just drops it ceramic breaks
1:01:32 [Laughter]
1:01:38 did i say
1:01:39 so he's frenzied on two Coterie mates
1:01:41 today
1:01:43 daddy's just in the [ __ ] zone gun to
1:01:46 the head blows his brains out
1:01:48 incinerates him completely like like the
1:01:50 blade like ash on the wind against him
1:01:54 casually drops the gun but i feel like
1:01:56 he at least tosses it up over his
1:01:58 shoulder
1:01:59 yes yeah i mean just you know done with
1:02:02 that
1:02:03 and and miles just
1:02:05 watches this perfect weapon
1:02:08 mean untimely demise
1:02:11 you didn't have to fist them
1:02:14 you could have had the axe out already
1:02:16 yeah but then i couldn't have shot four
1:02:18 times
1:02:19 did you need to
1:02:21 i'm thinking about it
1:02:25 oh my god
1:02:27 all right that was 18 we're going to 16
1:02:30 win first hand
1:02:34 saw fade strong uh two successes to hit
1:02:37 one carries over uh you're looking at
1:02:38 eight times the aggravated damage
1:02:40 sure am
1:02:42 one carries over eight dice a bag
1:02:46 uh four okay uh he's going to eat some
1:02:48 more egg he's actually uh still up his
1:02:52 scales actually seem pretty resistant to
1:02:54 claws yeah
1:02:55 go ahead and give me the next one
1:02:58 uh no successes one of these days we're
1:02:59 gonna fight somebody who's not resistant
1:03:01 to claws and it's not going to be okay
1:03:03 it is not going to be okay
1:03:05 no successes to hit okay he kind of like
1:03:08 staggering and watching his friends get
1:03:10 annihilated he manages to get his guard
1:03:12 up in time to avoid death after win we
1:03:14 will go to miles um i'm gonna say
1:03:17 there's three more i can't see them and
1:03:19 i'm gonna draw my sword and just be
1:03:21 ready okay after miles we
1:03:24 go to neil okay i'm gonna run over the
1:03:27 car and high beams yeah straight up like
1:03:30 no more options regular headlights
1:03:31 probably isn't going to no the high
1:03:32 beams high beams do you guys who are
1:03:34 inside kind of see like the one of the
1:03:35 windows like very bright light coming in
1:03:38 and
1:03:39 you see
1:03:40 a
1:03:41 crew of a trio of satellites guarding
1:03:44 the back door kind of waiting for miles
1:03:45 to run out the back so that they can put
1:03:48 them in the dirt and then they kind of
1:03:49 like turn and hiss they are
1:03:52 hyper sensitive to the sun bright light
1:03:54 and
1:03:54 kind of like try to cover their eyes and
1:03:56 like kind of panic well speaking of that
1:03:58 i still have heightened senses vision on
1:04:00 you're inside the problem you're inside
1:04:02 you're actually okay all right
1:04:04 i hope
1:04:06 i will actually drop hide senses before
1:04:08 i do that that's probably a good idea
1:04:11 i will drop it as i see light
1:04:13 um yeah and i will getting over there
1:04:15 and doing that's probably my whole turn
1:04:16 so that's that's it okay on initiative
1:04:19 10
1:04:20 meal the guy turns and with an assault
1:04:23 rifle unloads uh his magazine into uh
1:04:27 the suv looking for you
1:04:32 i have no idea what cover does yeah
1:04:34 i mean keep going i don't like that
1:04:36 sound when it's you rolling i think i
1:04:38 knew exactly
1:04:50 yeah you've got body armor right yeah
1:04:52 nope the armor's gone yep
1:04:54 i need a stamina to soak
1:04:57 our armor piercing round here's my
1:04:58 stamina soak you guys hear all those
1:05:01 dice
1:05:02 okay mine sounds similar
1:05:04 one uh after the damage is halved you'll
1:05:06 take one level of action damage oh
1:05:07 really yeah yeah i'm not used to getting
1:05:09 into fights you're punched full of a ton
1:05:11 of holes it was actually pretty decent
1:05:12 damage roll but between one soak and
1:05:14 then halved and rounded down yeah you
1:05:16 end up actually pretty okay your body
1:05:19 jerks like a [ __ ] cartoon there's a
1:05:21 reason why when they all came in with
1:05:22 adder are like oh head shots now
1:05:24 we will go to the beginning of celebrity
1:05:26 actions
1:05:27 are you taking any celebrity actions
1:05:28 right now i spent for two celebrity
1:05:31 actions so i believe i still have one
1:05:32 left right you haven't taken any of
1:05:34 yourself you have taken no celery
1:05:36 actions yet either of you all right neat
1:05:38 uh you do see one uh guy who's burning
1:05:42 and fleeing the raw shrek one that ran
1:05:44 away previously
1:05:45 that seems like a masquerade rage
1:05:48 uh yeah
1:05:51 let's go ahead and handle that
1:05:52 i got a question here
1:05:54 miles uh while you're kind of doing
1:05:55 anything you uncomfortably see her just
1:05:57 kind of like snap the weapon and like
1:06:00 brace against like the window frame and
1:06:03 take a shot like this is no she is not
1:06:06 new no these rifles have great one oh
1:06:09 she can only fire with spring uh but you
1:06:10 can take his already to reload it and
1:06:12 then your second celery to shoot him
1:06:13 can't do that all right if you're cool
1:06:14 with that yeah all right so uh right now
1:06:17 you're reloading yep yep we will go to
1:06:20 johnny
1:06:21 so i just heard an automatic weapon from
1:06:24 outside the back door goddamn right and
1:06:26 at strength nine i can punch through
1:06:28 concrete walls that is absolutely
1:06:30 strength 10 so i figure i could put my
1:06:32 whole body through a concrete wall yup i
1:06:35 agree with that so i'm going to i'm
1:06:36 going to draw i'm going to draw my ax
1:06:39 with my free hand and move through the
1:06:41 concrete wall with Celerity action 1.
1:06:43 he's far you might want to jump then we
1:06:45 will we will leap through the the
1:06:48 kool-aid oh my god well i have two
1:06:50 celebrity actions so i could move and
1:06:53 draw and then move and attack right yeah
1:06:56 or would that just be no what you're
1:06:57 doing right now is for the type of move
1:06:59 you're doing i need a jump check
1:07:02 and you're just writing web uh so
1:07:04 athletics uh strength it is uh a
1:07:07 strength plus athletics check at
1:07:09 difficulty four uh remember you do add
1:07:11 your potence oh yeah okay
1:07:14 well that's five successes okay so you
1:07:16 go
1:07:17 uh three yards per success if it's
1:07:20 vertical double that horizontal okay so
1:07:23 you are going 30 yards
1:07:26 clean through the cement all right and
1:07:28 emerge on the other side covered in dust
1:07:31 shotgun in one hand axe in the other oh
1:07:33 yeah the exposed followers of set look
1:07:37 extremely alarmed
1:07:39 does he get surprised for this
1:07:42 he does not he's not he's not kool-aid
1:07:44 man and gets surprised but he does
1:07:47 kool-aid man
1:07:49 that's the that's the one i'd rather
1:07:50 have miles you see this
1:07:53 outside the window uh your chambers are
1:07:54 ready to go why don't you take the shot
1:07:56 okay uh you're behind him so get a plus
1:07:58 two die bonus okay i've never seen you
1:08:00 with a more proud
1:08:02 important moment
1:08:05 carol needs to shoot somewhere in the
1:08:06 back i'll shoot him in the back of the
1:08:07 head yep
1:08:08 so that is only one success
1:08:12 give me uh nine dice or damage
1:08:15 i only got one success on my aimed
1:08:17 headshot from the rafters of a building
1:08:20 at a man outside running his full speed
1:08:22 on fire
1:08:26 five okay he crumbles ash johnny
1:08:29 all right i got one x
1:08:31 for these guys who's gonna get it i got
1:08:34 three targets do you have to ask them a
1:08:36 question i gotta i gotta ask him one who
1:08:38 is actually really the guy with the gun
1:08:40 that
1:08:41 jumped his magazine into your pal neil
1:08:44 who is still squealing in
1:08:47 the [ __ ] cabin truck okay his uh
1:08:49 friends what do they have for weapons uh
1:08:51 they're outfitted with the same weapons
1:08:53 same weapons okay am i behind the guy
1:08:56 who uh who emptied this clip or am i in
1:08:58 front of him you could also be on his
1:09:00 flank
1:09:01 honestly i i just guessed where they
1:09:03 were so he's gonna say that when you
1:09:05 emerge uh everyone turns to look at you
1:09:08 okay perfect that's fine did they though
1:09:10 because i'm i'm on celerity right here
1:09:12 oh that's true they're not moving you
1:09:14 know i'm gonna give that to you uh you
1:09:15 may emerge behind the guy that uh took
1:09:18 his shots that's two dice so
1:09:20 and you can't split though no no no i
1:09:22 realize
1:09:23 it's you know let's let's be fair here
1:09:26 all right
1:09:29 that's not any ones with subtracting
1:09:31 that's good that's right and i am swift
1:09:34 so we are looking at six successes
1:09:36 all right five will carry over okay now
1:09:39 i am strength six currently but i've got
1:09:42 four levels of potence plus five am i
1:09:45 missing anything else
1:09:47 three from the x can i have two more
1:09:48 dice i think you need bigger hands for
1:09:50 all those types there's a lot of things
1:09:54 a single one eight levels of damage oh
1:09:56 that guy is paced he like puts his hands
1:09:59 up off
1:10:01 futility and just
1:10:03 crumple straight to the dirt johnny
1:10:04 bears his fangs and looks expectantly at
1:10:07 the next two settings uh we will go to
1:10:10 round two oh my god
1:10:14 hey looks like Britta gets to act again
1:10:16 as eight settings
1:10:22 i reduced to two uh Britta through the
1:10:24 hole
1:10:25 that johnny has conveniently punched uh
1:10:28 into the wall uh you can see a pair of
1:10:31 uh followers of set kind of turn to look
1:10:33 at him you're just kind of backing up
1:10:35 slowly raising their weapons even from
1:10:37 your perspective you can see the weapons
1:10:40 are clearly shaking in their hands
1:10:42 this fight has gone terribly wrong and
1:10:44 they're aware of it oh it's about to get
1:10:46 worse
1:10:47 they didn't say anything about miles
1:10:48 being like this
1:10:49 they were watching the wrong door
1:10:52 they are facing me so i did not get the
1:10:54 flexibility the hole in the wall
1:10:56 right there i mean
1:10:59 if they weren't walking into a trap this
1:11:01 is a really good plan that they had
1:11:03 yeah dude eight on one for four miles
1:11:06 this is a bad fight thank you for the
1:11:07 night two success yeah one carries over
1:11:09 you're looking at ten days of damage
1:11:12 bouncing on me and then then they need
1:11:14 it
1:11:18 i am still mad
1:11:20 difficulty
1:11:22 six gonna be mad for days you're gonna
1:11:24 be mad
1:11:26 yeah
1:11:26 miles actually got a pair of headphones
1:11:28 on we can't see but he's listening to uh
1:11:30 duran durant
1:11:32 and just kind of like conducting this
1:11:34 whole thing
1:11:38 five five damage yep uh okay he'll take
1:11:41 four of that
1:11:42 and he stumbles back sliding on the snow
1:11:46 he is alive
1:11:48 well you know undead but not looking
1:11:50 great at all
1:11:52 johnny
1:11:53 so one of them just stumbled from from
1:11:55 around yeah you hear it you hear like
1:11:57 the report of a gunshot just right in
1:11:58 the head and his neck snaps back and he
1:12:01 takes like three steps back all right
1:12:03 the guy i hit is he torpor yeah that
1:12:05 guy's done cool he's on timeout he ain't
1:12:07 really dead
1:12:08 um yeah i'm gonna spend one point of
1:12:10 celerity just to have it have the extra
1:12:11 action in my back pocket in case i need
1:12:13 to dodge or something stupid
1:12:14 um let's not get cocky here um
1:12:18 just jump through a [ __ ] wall it's
1:12:20 not get cocky guys let's take it easy
1:12:22 let's not get ridiculous eighteen
1:12:25 thousand damage guys guys don't get guys
1:12:27 just saying man
1:12:29 before he can get a chance to bring
1:12:31 bring the weapon actually on to bear me
1:12:32 i will leap on top of the guy who's
1:12:34 undamaged uh and put an axe into his
1:12:37 torso area they haven't acted yet does
1:12:39 he still have the back strike bonus yes
1:12:41 do i yeah oh geez
1:12:44 damn super speed
1:12:45 [Music]
1:12:47 unfortunately for him i am very swift
1:12:49 and so that's going to be
1:12:50 seven successes to hit him six roll over
1:12:54 hey they're doing all right one guy got
1:12:56 one action
1:12:59 that means 19 dice the damage correct
1:13:02 so that's six successes okay he has
1:13:04 nothing on soak so
1:13:06 he will take six levels of damage and
1:13:08 kind of still be in the fight all right
1:13:10 he does not raw track
1:13:12 uh he is stunned that is regular
1:13:14 initiative we are one
1:13:18 slapping a [ __ ]
1:13:19 all right two successes one rolls over
1:13:22 uh give me eight damage
1:13:24 [Music]
1:13:26 six damage okay he has no successes on
1:13:29 soak take six eggs your claws go clean
1:13:31 into a skull and you just kind of pull
1:13:34 matter out
1:13:35 slap it off
1:13:37 it loudly slaps against the ground i
1:13:39 think i got in his head guys
1:13:44 all right timeout
1:13:50 that guy died a horrible death yeah he
1:13:51 did it wasn't even from the ag it was
1:13:53 from the pun yeah
1:13:55 that's how you got to make sure they're
1:13:56 dead this is the last thing i want you
1:13:58 to hear
1:14:01 [Laughter]
1:14:07 the initiative goes to miles can i
1:14:10 the dude took the bullet to the brain
1:14:12 can i get within line of sight yes i
1:14:15 would like to dominate to be still okay
1:14:18 that does make this extremely cool that
1:14:20 miles does not move the entire time and
1:14:23 just stands in the middle of the room
1:14:25 like the ring leader
1:14:33 yeah that'll be five successes right uh
1:14:35 he becomes still uh you can kind of see
1:14:38 like the fear in his eyes as he's
1:14:39 basically now just standing in front of
1:14:41 a firing squad after miles goes kneel ah
1:14:45 you just filled this car with automatic
1:14:47 gun fire
1:14:48 this car's not running yeah headlights
1:14:50 are not on anymore no okay i know these
1:14:52 guys still have sk i'm just gonna like
1:14:53 lean over to the other car and turn on
1:14:55 the headlights again cause i know tricks
1:14:57 and i know what i would do to run away
1:14:59 and i don't want that to happen
1:15:00 headlights go back on rendering uh uses
1:15:02 of obvious skate useless and
1:15:04 yeah no that's a good move the guy who's
1:15:07 hurt and still on his feet johnny
1:15:11 he gives you a look and his eyes become
1:15:14 that of cobras a cobras and he attempts
1:15:16 to hypnotize you in place all right
1:15:19 let's do this
1:15:20 he is at a higher difficulty because of
1:15:22 iron will i believe yep when was just
1:15:24 getting this into practice earlier
1:15:26 it starts at diff nine so he's now
1:15:28 active twelve all right what does that
1:15:30 mean he needs three successes to count
1:15:32 as one yep run four will fire
1:15:34 now he just needs two success
1:15:38 he has the ten he needed and uh johnny
1:15:42 you are hypnotized in place
1:15:44 is there any resistance to that or no no
1:15:46 okay it's just like a really high diff
1:15:47 to affect vampires that's good
1:15:49 well that's him so they're kind of
1:15:51 locking each other down at this point
1:15:52 yes because these guys got pretty ass
1:15:55 next is britta he actually makes it to
1:15:56 round three
1:15:58 what a cool guy
1:16:00 do i have a cool ice
1:16:05 do i have a clear shot on him or is
1:16:07 johnny sort of on him johnny's a little
1:16:09 in the way you're giving me a plus one
1:16:10 diff to hit this guy
1:16:12 all right
1:16:13 spend the willpower
1:16:14 right
1:16:15 uh to be able to hit you get confused
1:16:17 for a second you shoot johnny give me an
1:16:19 attacker do i have any pluses if
1:16:20 johnny's not looking at me you're not
1:16:22 trying to take advantage of anything uh
1:16:24 you're gonna rule your regular tackle
1:16:25 okay uh no increased difficulty you're
1:16:27 not aiming for the head
1:16:31 five successes okay you're not gonna
1:16:33 roll any uh damage dice over just give
1:16:35 me damage flat weapon rating johnny will
1:16:37 soak
1:16:38 you
1:16:43 three successes johnny would you get uh
1:16:46 seven successes okay you soak the hit
1:16:48 and you're out of the hypnotized uh
1:16:49 effect
1:16:50 your action
1:16:52 and we'll uh pull his axe down on top
1:16:55 that's a follow-up question yeah the
1:16:57 fact that you thought to do that
1:16:58 instinctually is very worrying and i'm
1:17:01 starting to have questions
1:17:03 unfortunately i don't know if any of us
1:17:05 nope we sure don't do i no miles you
1:17:07 kind of see her like aim and then she
1:17:10 like turns shoots uh johnny square in
1:17:14 the back of his body armor and then you
1:17:16 see him kind of like oh [ __ ] bam and
1:17:18 like well he's glad that him got his
1:17:20 back and it's just knocking him out of
1:17:21 hypnotism that's obviously what this was
1:17:23 what happened
1:17:24 it's more worried if that is what
1:17:26 happened i don't know that about
1:17:28 hypnotism
1:17:29 yeah but she like specifically yeah i
1:17:31 see you
1:17:32 i see you rebecca i've really got his
1:17:34 back i did that
1:17:36 i'm sorry we jumped over that and yet
1:17:38 i'm not sorry we dropped off this
1:17:40 more
1:17:42 do i know that i've done this yes okay
1:17:44 but i am not aware you realize you've
1:17:46 done it after you've taken the shot by
1:17:48 the way lex this is a very cool way of
1:17:50 playing up the amnesia flaw yeah thank
1:17:51 you
1:17:53 i agree five successes to hit him
1:17:55 uh yep
1:17:59 [Music]
1:18:02 yeah well that's a lot of successes oh
1:18:05 boy we're looking at ten successes
1:18:08 all right he will soak two take eight
1:18:09 you will rap and lob his head off he
1:18:12 actually dies dies he does not go to
1:18:14 torment straight to jail
1:18:17 do not pass go yeah lastly johnny's eyes
1:18:20 kind of flash a little bit aggravated
1:18:22 over his shoulder towards where brito uh
1:18:24 fired from it is just steel confidence
1:18:27 uh is everyone dead no no there's just
1:18:30 one guy staring wide eye and completely
1:18:34 like remaining still and a couple of
1:18:36 them were i think johnny recognizes him
1:18:38 as being under miles if you start moving
1:18:40 towards there be like yeah right i put a
1:18:42 hand out to uh to stop you okay no no no
1:18:45 we can't just kill them all there'd be
1:18:47 no message in that
1:18:53 but it will take the moment to
1:18:55 climb down from her perch oh you find
1:18:57 yourself collecting your shells and then
1:18:58 you sixteen fangs in the blue casino
1:19:02 yeah i don't know where to send it and
1:19:04 um he's clearly out of the fight and i
1:19:06 like pluck the gun from him uh
1:19:10 so
1:19:11 uh johnny will uh we'll jog over to
1:19:13 where neal is
1:19:15 and check on neil uh neil's looking
1:19:17 through the cars and stuff now that like
1:19:19 things seem to be mostly in hand uh hey
1:19:21 is everything wrapped up inside i think
1:19:23 so yeah i just ruined my sweater all
1:19:25 right
1:19:26 there's a case like a cooler and inside
1:19:29 the core is uh what looks like eight
1:19:32 canopic jars oh hey i don't know sentai
1:19:35 stuff but i know a bunch about weird
1:19:37 sources even intelligence a goal check
1:19:39 those weird egyptian thermoses
1:19:41 no
1:19:43 i mean
1:19:43 sort of
1:19:45 uh what's my difficulty we're gonna hear
1:19:46 six uh seven different paradigm cool uh
1:19:49 then three successes with three
1:19:50 successes these are actually uh weird
1:19:52 egyptian thermises uh each one of them
1:19:54 uh has a uh never tell johnny that yeah
1:19:57 each one he's probably gonna figure it
1:19:59 out each one has a hermetically sealed
1:20:02 uh amount of vitae that is intended to
1:20:05 be stored indefinitely this is like
1:20:07 basically them being able to re-up after
1:20:08 a fight
1:20:13 once once the the seal is cracked uh it
1:20:16 will age normally up until then that is
1:20:19 perfectly preserved blood
1:20:21 free sun johnny i'm uh i'm loathed to uh
1:20:24 i'm loath to admit this but uh yeah
1:20:26 these are just phytate thermoses this is
1:20:28 um i don't know whose blood it is but
1:20:30 this is this is fresh eternal vitae
1:20:33 until you correct the seal at least
1:20:35 seems like an awful lot of effort to go
1:20:36 through jazzing them up and writing
1:20:38 stupid symbols on the outside could have
1:20:40 just gotten a bottle no you couldn't
1:20:42 this is this is arcanely sealed like you
1:20:44 can't just put vitae in the thermos
1:20:46 watch me it's two such coolers and
1:20:48 they're sixteen total six to eight in
1:20:49 each just pop open the other one and
1:20:51 just see this that yeah that's um this
1:20:53 is a lot of vitae probably so that after
1:20:55 they expend themselves
1:20:56 they're fine again if you're uh you
1:20:59 think you think we could take it for
1:21:01 ourselves there would be minimal risk
1:21:03 involved all right well let's let's not
1:21:05 worry about that right now uh you get
1:21:07 that to the rest of them you want to
1:21:08 take this with you uh i'm gonna move i'm
1:21:10 gonna move these suvs out of here uh
1:21:12 well i mean we're right by the i think
1:21:14 we're just pushing into
1:21:15 the bay yeah but okay yeah so johnny
1:21:18 pushes the suv the broken down suv into
1:21:21 the bay with his jacked up
1:21:23 blood frame and you can probably just
1:21:26 pick it up drag it and then yeah yeah
1:21:28 shove it in
1:21:29 and then uh and then he'll actually move
1:21:31 the other suv into like a park position
1:21:33 outside so that these guys can take
1:21:35 their their vehicle back with them okay
1:21:37 yeah i'm assuming we're giving it are
1:21:38 you guys taking the coolers out yeah
1:21:46 yeah uh along with their [ __ ] if they
1:21:49 have and it would be stupid if they did
1:21:50 but you know i don't want to take it for
1:21:51 granted if they have any form of id on
1:21:54 them they have no id they do have cell
1:21:57 phones cool i'm taking those okay those
1:22:00 are mine now marquette same with the
1:22:01 canopic jars so how many of them are
1:22:02 still in how many of them are
1:22:04 incorporated uh you have
1:22:06 two that are in torpor one that is
1:22:08 dominated and one two three four five
1:22:11 who are dead just piles of ash uh well
1:22:13 the ones that burned the one that was uh
1:22:15 clawed that is just a gooey mess with
1:22:17 his head removed is just a head remover
1:22:19 well he then ashes he does not ash he's
1:22:22 not old enough to ash
1:22:23 uh he rots as though he's been lying
1:22:26 there for like four or five years
1:22:28 so he's just kind of like this
1:22:30 disgusting lump of like gooey botted
1:22:33 meat johnny will lay out a tarp put some
1:22:35 of the other remains on the tarp and
1:22:37 then look over at miles for to make the
1:22:39 call so yes so we'll leave the torped
1:22:41 individuals because this gentleman here
1:22:43 will be going back with this particular
1:22:45 message
1:22:47 but he did raise a hand against me i was
1:22:49 under and i just cut through
1:22:51 arm flops to the ground uh like for a
1:22:54 brief second like it keeps moving he
1:22:56 grabs on to the stump and howls in pain
1:22:59 johnny definitely gives a look that's
1:23:01 somewhere between being impressed and
1:23:03 also being kind of terrified of miles i
1:23:05 will shoot the sword and grab the arm
1:23:07 and throw it over in the the pile of goo
1:23:09 over there
1:23:11 what do you want me to do leave and if i
1:23:13 see you again it'll be way worse you
1:23:16 like nods tell your friends with one arm
1:23:19 he tries to collect his torped fringe
1:23:22 johnny well johnny will grab the torpor
1:23:24 guys and put him in the suv for him okay
1:23:26 unless anyone stops him he is going to
1:23:30 one armed drive out of here with an suv
1:23:34 full of five torpor vampires two sorry
1:23:36 two torpor vampires and some
1:23:38 miscellaneous parts and ashes yeah i
1:23:40 said we chucked those in the water it
1:23:41 looks like the plan is work you guys
1:23:43 victorious but it's unclear how you feel
1:23:46 about that i need some humanity checks
1:23:48 yeah boy [ __ ] guns uh i need one
1:23:50 humanity check from everyone for plane
1:23:52 to murder
1:23:53 conscience defeat you ain't not spending
1:23:55 willpower for this [ __ ] all right
1:24:00 no bueno i had a success but uh my one
1:24:03 took it away same one success okay
1:24:06 johnny
1:24:07 you
1:24:08 don't know how you feel about the
1:24:09 success of amount of force i think this
1:24:11 is a feeling that johnny is pretty used
1:24:13 to oh yeah like he goes through this
1:24:16 hole
1:24:17 never felt this about your team yeah the
1:24:20 fact that my friends who i usually like
1:24:22 to keep out of this kind of stuff now
1:24:24 are like acting like a bully boy too
1:24:26 right
1:24:27 they're now playing the game you play
1:24:29 everyone else feels vindicated these
1:24:32 guys ask for this
1:24:33 payback's a [ __ ] maybe next time they
1:24:35 won't try to hurt you guys while you're
1:24:37 minding your own business
1:24:39 and do we lose that one humanity you
1:24:41 will lose that one humanity kneel yeah
1:24:44 you have botched your humanity check i
1:24:47 sure did and you feel exhilarated and
1:24:51 you will lose an additional point of
1:24:53 humanity that draws me from an a206 uh
1:24:56 the group of you almost don't recognize
1:24:58 him as he becomes pale and kind of loses
1:25:02 that that blush that made him stand out
1:25:04 before
1:25:05 miles i need a second conscience check
1:25:08 cool
1:25:09 one success the arm thing was a little
1:25:11 much
1:25:13 so that's that what are we gonna do now
1:25:15 i'm hungry and we need to talk before we
1:25:17 go to the before we go and take on
1:25:19 zantosa
1:25:20 okay um here's the question is this like
1:25:23 the 31st essentially like we're going to
