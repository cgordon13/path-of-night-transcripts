0:00:43 tragedies to come wynn johnny and miles
0:00:47 tried to coach brit on feeding with
0:00:49 young torridor got cold feet during her

0:04:28 people

0:04:32 of people we are obviously that would be
0:04:34 a breach of the masquerade but
0:04:36 he knows a certain kind of people and
0:04:40 what whatever man uh
0:04:42 it's
0:04:43 i'm trying to find that ghoul oh
0:04:46 it's that tight yeah
0:04:48 and you're calling your uh connections
0:04:51 connections yeah why are you making air
0:04:53 quotes
0:04:54 he's one of my connections
0:04:56 he hooks me up with you know favors and
0:04:58 stuff and he's got ears out i hook him
0:05:00 up
0:05:01 all right are you looking at me like
0:05:03 that
0:05:04 no reason
0:05:05 all right i'm gonna go
0:05:07 love you
0:05:14 [Laughter]
0:05:22 miles when you're getting ready to head
0:05:23 off to do errands you do receive a
0:05:25 message
0:05:26 it is a message from upton Rowlands
0:05:29 prince
0:05:30 however in this scenario he seems to be
0:05:33 referring to himself as strategos
0:05:34 Rowlands
0:05:35 what this means to you
0:05:37 is that you have been summoned for an
0:05:40 objective that has been passed down
0:05:42 within the clan
0:05:43 this is the directorate got it the
0:05:45 message is very simple
0:05:47 you and any armed retainers you possess
0:05:51 are expected to head towards the western
0:05:54 border of new haven
0:05:55 where you will rendezvous with
0:05:58 upton Rowlands and other members of your
0:06:00 clan for the purposes of a meeting
0:06:02 to
0:06:04 see an important transaction resolved
0:06:06 okay
0:06:07 our members you save my commander coder
0:06:09 either right is that this is not
0:06:12 something other clans may participate
0:06:14 this is directorate business okay so
0:06:16 it's me coming on you essentially armed
0:06:19 your retainers armed they're bringing
0:06:21 their retainers armed got it pass out so
0:06:24 many business cards okay i will
0:06:27 inform marcos that we have a
0:06:29 thing to do and we need to gear up for
0:06:32 action marcos loads up the car with smg
0:06:36 and some weapons just in case
0:06:38 he needs to lend you support um i get to
0:06:41 bring the katana this time
0:06:43 feel better already you ready your
0:06:44 katana for war
0:06:47 no
0:06:53 oh
0:06:54 boy
0:06:56 so good
0:06:57 katana machine team pistol yeah yeah
0:07:02 tell me at least you're wearing the
0:07:03 trench coat too of course
0:07:04 80s actually little [ __ ] right here
0:07:06 leather trench coat you know
0:07:09 probably some body armor this time when
0:07:10 you arrive straight to vhs everyone's in
0:07:13 suits right
0:07:15 like power suits
0:07:16 i mean that's given but you know you've
0:07:18 read this other stuff too and
0:07:21 it would seem that
0:07:23 arabella uh Rowlands and upton Rowlands
0:07:26 are present it's the three of you making
0:07:28 up the uh venture that are present for
0:07:30 this meeting
0:07:32 each of them has brought three armed
0:07:34 retainers
0:07:35 um that don't know there's a pensiveness
0:07:38 so they're very unsure right this is not
0:07:41 they're not showing off
0:07:43 some things up opt-in kind of gives you
0:07:45 a look
0:07:46 come here man
0:07:47 now strategos
0:07:50 there has been a purchase that's been
0:07:51 made all we have to do is receive the
0:07:53 purchase
0:07:55 um
0:07:56 however should warn you that
0:07:59 and this purchase was made from uh
0:08:02 norfolk
0:08:03 all right do you really
0:08:05 think it's best to
0:08:06 have meow knowing that she's not super
0:08:09 pleased with me at all right now it
0:08:11 doesn't really matter what anyone else
0:08:13 thinks of you if your client needs you
0:08:14 you'll be there of course very good you
0:08:17 guys kind of go to this like really old
0:08:19 lot that's been abandoned by by the
0:08:22 highway for
0:08:23 probably quite some time
0:08:25 and
0:08:26 four cars start pulling in from the
0:08:29 other side like the old school
0:08:31 black lincoln town cars and a pair of
0:08:33 black suvs so on origin when they pull
0:08:37 up out of each of the vehicles each
0:08:40 vehicle
0:08:41 four people get out all right and it
0:08:44 seems that the followers of set have
0:08:47 brought a greater show of force than the
0:08:49 venture have i mean yeah otherwise it'd
0:08:51 be super outclassed amongst the
0:08:53 individuals that are all gathered there
0:08:55 for you you you actually do recognize
0:08:58 two of them this
0:09:00 hulking titan of a man
0:09:02 with a tattoo on his neck you recognize
0:09:05 cobra
0:09:06 who is stoic
0:09:08 and uh just kind of quietly watches from
0:09:11 the suv
0:09:12 one of them
0:09:13 and the other
0:09:15 very calmly approaching the group kind
0:09:17 of looking to um
0:09:20 seemingly it looks like she's actually
0:09:21 gravitating towards you
0:09:23 and uh
0:09:24 shifting the way all of the followers of
0:09:26 set gather so that you become like the
0:09:28 center piece of conversation instead of
0:09:30 strategist rulings awesome and
0:09:33 so khalees she's kind of like stands
0:09:36 directly facing you big smile on her and
0:09:40 she is dressed uh very well the rest of
0:09:43 the those who are present a lot of them
0:09:45 are kind of like wearing like black
0:09:46 fatigues and like combat boots and
0:09:50 they're not really rocking the suits
0:09:51 like The Ventrue in this lot of
0:09:53 turtlenecks here a lot of turtlenecks
0:09:56 but she is actually in like a very nice
0:09:58 uh dark dark red dress
0:10:00 then
0:10:01 coming out
0:10:03 of the middle town car is a very petite
0:10:07 woman
0:10:08 who has
0:10:10 black hair
0:10:11 dark eyes she's adorned with like a
0:10:13 great deal of like gold jewelry
0:10:16 and she carries herself
0:10:19 in a way that
0:10:20 very clearly indicates to you that she
0:10:22 is not
0:10:23 from the modern world right this is my
0:10:25 first meeting with non-spread
0:10:27 this is the first time you have seen
0:10:28 knock writing i've dealt with khalees
0:10:30 before essentially yes yeah i probably
0:10:33 tense up a bit like that and really want
0:10:35 to check my weapons but no that's a
0:10:36 really bad idea right now bad time to
0:10:38 check your weapons right marcos kind of
0:10:40 like gives you a reassuring nod ready to
0:10:42 lay his life down for you
0:10:44 i give him a nod back and
0:10:46 make sure he's just like a little bit
0:10:48 farther back because he is
0:10:50 definitely not he's here to do whatever
0:10:52 it takes i got it he's
0:10:54 super good but he's also super not as
0:10:56 good with weapons as he is like books
0:10:58 and people he's courageous yes that's
0:11:01 true he is very from the two fcvs there
0:11:03 are these
0:11:05 big ass metal containers that are pulled
0:11:08 out and they are carried
0:11:10 uh
0:11:11 to the trio of
0:11:13 and they're set down khalis
0:11:15 turns to the servants and she's like go
0:11:17 ahead and open it up they open it up and
0:11:20 inside there are
0:11:23 automatic weapons stacked on top of each
0:11:25 other tons of ammunition
0:11:27 it looks like enough weapons to like arm
0:11:30 a small militia that's
0:11:32 very odd i haven't heard that much
0:11:34 movement it's very odd indeed
0:11:36 you see
0:11:38 we haven't made a sale like this in
0:11:40 quite some time the vend driver needed
0:11:41 it but your sire
0:11:44 has a great deal of interest in these
0:11:45 weapons we were hoping you might be able
0:11:47 to explain to us why they are needed
0:11:50 was that part of the deal
0:11:53 well
0:11:54 the deal was made in a bit of a rush
0:11:57 and as i understand it we're the only
0:11:59 ones who can complete our side of the
0:12:01 deal that's possibly true but at the
0:12:03 same time you also did agree to it based
0:12:06 on the original term set out did you not
0:12:08 i should warn you that norford isn't um
0:12:13 a lady who negotiates
0:12:15 i think you're misunderstanding the
0:12:16 relationship here
0:12:19 we
0:12:20 keep The Ventrue clan in power
0:12:22 and in exchange
0:12:24 we are provided aid when we seek it
0:12:27 and the aid we seek right now
0:12:29 is to know
0:12:31 what has happened in new haven to
0:12:33 warrant this
0:12:34 often
0:12:35 actually gives you a little bit of a
0:12:36 nervous look
0:12:38 it seems there's been increased violence
0:12:41 on the streets and
0:12:42 random carjackings and such it's
0:12:45 who knows what exactly my sire wishes
0:12:48 with these guns per se but
0:12:51 they're delivered
0:12:52 i imagine the price has been paid
0:12:54 already
0:12:55 she
0:12:56 gives
0:12:57 a
0:12:58 cynical
0:13:00 mean-spirited laugh
0:13:02 and points at you
0:13:05 you
0:13:07 don't know
0:13:08 and she looks at the other two avengers
0:13:10 like who here actually knows why
0:13:13 you're at this meeting
0:13:15 and
0:13:16 arabella
0:13:17 completely stoic
0:13:19 shows no indication that what she is
0:13:21 saying is affecting her at all
0:13:23 upton gives this like embarrassed side
0:13:27 eye
0:13:29 god he's such an embarrassment
0:13:32 please tell me that was not said out
0:13:34 loud
0:13:35 no no no
0:13:36 that was a lot of internal monologue
0:13:39 there was a huge inward sigh
0:13:43 i see
0:13:44 norfolk requires this information what
0:13:46 the hierophant seeks she shall have
0:13:49 i give you these weapons
0:13:51 i hope you brought enough men to
0:13:53 actually move them
0:13:54 but very soon we require answers to our
0:13:57 questions
0:13:58 or we will begin entertaining
0:14:01 offers that have been made the kindred
0:14:03 of your domain are not so loyal
0:14:06 as you might think
0:14:07 we will see what we can do
0:14:08 no you will do it
0:14:12 of course
0:14:13 she turns and like
0:14:15 walks swaying her hips
0:14:18 just completely
0:14:19 full of herself
0:14:22 and
0:14:23 over the course of a minute or two the
0:14:24 followers are set back up
0:14:27 and they drive off
0:14:29 opt-in looks pretty concerned
0:14:32 miles
0:14:33 why does josiah want this
0:14:36 does it matter
0:14:37 yes
0:14:39 then you must put it through to him the
0:14:41 only reason that you might want weapons
0:14:43 stocked up here in new haven if he
0:14:45 thinks there's going to be some sort of
0:14:46 fight here in new haven
0:14:48 possibly or they're moving through
0:14:50 look i can try to find out
0:14:52 but
0:14:53 we cannot just let the settings keep
0:14:55 pushing us around here
0:14:57 hope you understand what i'm going to
0:14:59 explain to you
0:15:00 but
0:15:02 i don't know that i'm in complete
0:15:03 control of the city anymore
0:15:06 that's
0:15:07 unnerving to hear
0:15:09 there seems to be other players very
0:15:11 dangerous
0:15:13 yes
0:15:13 what would you like to do about it i
0:15:15 would like to kill them but i don't know
0:15:16 that that's actually
0:15:18 terribly viable no it would create a
0:15:20 vacuum and
0:15:21 and
0:15:22 um
0:15:24 i think they would go into it more
0:15:26 problems than that into the vacuum
0:15:28 what other problems would you see
0:15:32 killing people
0:15:34 begets more killing
0:15:36 what does that even mean they can kill
0:15:37 anyone
0:15:38 they're dead
0:15:40 yeah
0:15:42 regardless it's not always and usually
0:15:44 not the most viable solution
0:15:47 hello miles
0:15:48 let's try to go sign placing you in
0:15:50 charge of the situation
0:15:51 that's right please you to it and that
0:15:53 we are
0:15:55 no longer in need of the aid of the
0:15:56 fellows are set
0:15:58 i will do my best and that we don't lose
0:16:00 power
0:16:02 of course
0:16:03 we should never lose power
0:16:05 yes agreed
0:16:08 i'm going to need help loading these
0:16:10 go ahead friends he goes and he gets in
0:16:13 the car
0:16:14 and
0:16:15 and i look at him he [ __ ] leaves you
0:16:18 and arabella and arabella is just like
0:16:21 she's shaking
0:16:23 and
0:16:24 forces her hands down at her side
0:16:28 and looks at you
0:16:30 maintaining her composure
0:16:33 but letting just enough slip to kind of
0:16:36 make it clear that she is
0:16:39 not in support of what she is seeing
0:16:41 i look at her i'm like
0:16:43 i'm not
0:16:44 close enough you need
0:16:47 to either protect him
0:16:49 or move
0:16:51 because he's getting worse
0:16:55 i don't know that either of those are
0:16:57 true options
0:16:59 but i'll tell you this
0:17:03 my son has leaned on clan loyalties for
0:17:06 quite some time
0:17:09 and he has used them to his benefit
0:17:13 but has not provided very much to those
0:17:15 who would lend their aid
0:17:18 despite the illusion

0:23:07 telemarketer or something they call

0:23:14 looks to me like a telemarketer was
0:23:17 selling bad feelings
0:23:19 johnny just kind of storms off to like
0:23:22 the uh the foyer area and starts rooting
0:23:24 through
0:23:26 uh
0:23:26 miles of stuff looking for like a white
0:23:29 pages yeah he'll go through looking for
0:23:32 uh
0:23:33 some names in the white pages from from
0:23:36 a time bef uh
0:23:38 long past i don't know if his wife is

0:23:56 no it was a little younger
0:23:59 jenny you okay i gotta talk to weathers
0:24:02 to weathers yeah
0:24:05 sounded a little dainty to be weathers
0:24:10 yeah
0:24:12 if you don't want to talk about it you
0:24:13 don't have to talk about it everybody's
0:24:14 got their secrets but if there's a way
0:24:17 we can
0:24:18 help the hell did you come from she's
0:24:20 been sitting on the couch right there
0:24:22 you just walked past them to go to the
0:24:23 get the phone back here he looks really
0:24:26 startled that there are other people in
0:24:27 the room you need a breather i need to
0:24:30 know why the [ __ ] weathers is giving out
0:24:31 my phone number to people
0:24:34 is he the only one who has it
0:24:36 no
0:24:38 there's no such thing as secrets you um
0:24:40 you also have a business card that you
0:24:42 tried to get ramirez despite what i just
0:24:44 said if you've given out any of those
0:24:46 it's out there
0:24:47 the beeper goes off it starts buzzing
0:24:52 he crushes the beeper in his hand
0:24:54 okay
0:24:55 um because i think johnny needs a little
0:24:57 alone time yeah um what did miles need
0:25:00 he's got some something weird going on
0:25:02 he's got he needs a couple of cases or
0:25:05 something moved somewhere one was being
0:25:07 real cagey about it i guess marcos is
0:25:09 coming by with a truck or something
0:25:11 all right are you good to take that on
0:25:13 your own or do you need a hand no i can
0:25:15 uh i'll i'll be fine getting uh taking
0:25:17 care of that can the two of you help
0:25:18 make sure she gets something inside of
0:25:20 her yeah yeah i guess so bruta you're
0:25:23 gonna feed tonight right
0:25:25 yeah johnny i'm gonna do it remember
0:25:27 what i said
0:25:28 if talking to people is gonna be a
0:25:30 little too much we can do it my way
0:25:32 what's your way i don't want to hear it
0:25:36 he heads out and goes over to where the
0:25:37 uh the garage is wherever marcos would
0:25:40 pull in a truck
0:25:41 because i'm sure this is not the first
0:25:42 time that no johnny has moved things for
0:25:45 uh for miles or it's it's honestly not
0:25:48 too long of a wait before
0:25:50 uh marco shows up with like a 16-foot
0:25:52 u-haul and he's like here's your truck
0:25:55 he said they were six foot cases
0:25:59 you think this is what we need
0:26:02 all right
0:26:04 the
0:26:05 marcos what exactly am i getting into
0:26:06 here all right he this is way too much
0:26:09 for like a truck to move to six foot
0:26:12 like but
0:26:13 he seems to think so what's that
0:26:16 do i don't need to know anything about
0:26:17 what i'm getting into here i think he's
0:26:18 just moving to containers does he still
0:26:20 have weapons or anything on him yeah he
0:26:21 does
0:26:23 starts off loading the gun
0:26:25 there's like a [ __ ] like big knife in
0:26:28 the hand like hidden
0:26:30 [Music]
0:26:31 all right marcos
0:26:33 kind of pat him on the shoulder hop up
0:26:35 in the truck and we'll head to the
0:26:37 location that miles asked me to
0:26:39 to go to okay
0:26:40 [Music]
0:26:46 it's pretty uneventful uh he picks you
0:26:48 up well considering the fact that i
0:26:50 actually uh have the advantage
0:26:54 of open road
0:26:56 it certainly is uneventful yeah he just
0:26:59 picks up your package i'm also geared to
0:27:01 boot and power suit and just full on
0:27:03 attack are you wearing a katana yeah
0:27:05 it's not the first time you've seen me
0:27:06 yet so you were really expecting things
0:27:08 to go down what the hell's in these
0:27:09 cases
0:27:10 automatic weapons johnny opens them up
0:27:14 gun running now no
0:27:17 we're gun holding
0:27:20 is there anything else about this i need
0:27:21 to know
0:27:22 this is a
0:27:24 things might be happening in new haven
0:27:26 possibly
0:27:27 using his potence of three giant loads
0:27:30 up the cases onto the uh truck oh yeah
0:27:33 it's pretty easy i don't know yet to
0:27:34 tell you the truth where'd you get these
0:27:36 from
0:27:38 Setites
0:27:40 i didn't set it up i was just a receiver
0:27:42 this this all seems janky so
0:27:46 well things are probably going to get
0:27:47 worse so you did this deal all on your
0:27:50 own on your lonesome i was called in
0:27:52 last minute it's clan business um
0:27:55 all right i'll keep my i'll keep my the
0:27:56 rest of my uh questions to myself then
0:27:58 anything else going on
0:28:03 that's a yes
0:28:07 i don't know how she found it i think my
0:28:08 daughter found my pager number
0:28:11 no she didn't find it someone gave it to
0:28:12 her
0:28:14 he pissed off somebody
0:28:16 a few somebodies quite recently who
0:28:18 knows which one
0:28:20 but that is quite easily the
0:28:22 biggest pressure point for you
0:28:26 he starts kind of like rapidly blinking
0:28:29 and you can
0:28:30 feel that he's starting to actually get
0:28:32 a little bit worked up
0:28:35 are you saying that people know about
0:28:36 her someone like shaw
0:28:39 it's a good bet
0:28:46 but you had a deal worked out with
0:28:47 weathers didn't you yeah
0:28:49 we need to check on that
0:28:52 if not we'll get maybe a pi
0:28:55 where are we bringing these
0:28:57 they're going back to my place for now
0:28:59 apparently i get to hold them you want
0:29:01 to
0:29:02 do you want to call
0:29:03 weathers and see if you can
0:29:06 figure out if he knows about any of this
0:29:08 [ __ ] before i go storming into his
0:29:10 office and make a mess
0:29:11 yes
0:29:12 though i'm betting weathers doesn't know
0:29:13 a lot
0:29:15 but i can have him
0:29:16 check on his resource
0:29:18 we'll see what we can do from our side
0:29:20 all right
0:29:22 you riding with me yeah yeah i don't
0:29:25 have any other way to get out of here
0:29:26 miles and johnny
0:29:28 load up into the uh
0:29:31 16-footer and start heading back uh
0:29:34 towards his place okay
0:29:37 [Music]
0:29:40 so
0:29:41 as you're waiting for everyone to
0:29:42 regroups that you can lead them back uh
0:29:45 when
0:29:46 you find yourself hearing the sounds of
0:29:49 a diesel engine
0:29:50 pulling up as the ual returns i suppose
0:29:55 since probably most of those shops are
0:29:57 closed today this would be and also i
0:29:59 don't really want to put this off much
0:30:00 longer we should go look at what's in my
0:30:02 fridge
0:30:03 yeah i i don't i don't disagree with you
0:30:06 we get a lot of problems and a lot of
0:30:08 things to look into but some of them
0:30:09 require either the shops to be open or i
0:30:12 got to go to the
0:30:14 town hall tomorrow tomorrow night but
0:30:15 it's new year's eve i guarantee they're
0:30:17 closed yeah it's new year's um
0:30:19 but that being said um
0:30:21 we're also probably gonna need to call
0:30:22 in some reinforcement on this there's
0:30:25 more than
0:30:26 like you and johnny yeah
0:30:29 there's some
0:30:31 there's some stuff the gangrel has been
0:30:32 working on
0:30:33 for a while um i want to call in raven
0:30:36 like
0:30:37 the local Gangrel or like as a clan
0:30:40 little column a little column b
0:30:43 yes raven
0:30:45 raven is
0:30:48 it's hard to explain what she is in
0:30:50 terms of what she represents in the
0:30:52 gangrel society versus what she
0:30:54 represents to
0:30:56 kindred society
0:30:58 she is a very old gangrel
0:31:00 she knows a great deal
0:31:02 and she always
0:31:05 she seeks to protect
0:31:08 and she has done an awful lot to
0:31:09 preserve the masquerade in new haven
0:31:11 without
0:31:12 the
0:31:13 camaria ever knowing about it i know
0:31:16 your first night was a little bit of a
0:31:17 rush
0:31:19 of
0:31:20 experiences and emotions
0:31:22 but
0:31:23 do you recall the prince
0:31:26 calling
0:31:28 wen up to ask about stuff
0:31:30 yes raven related to that when
0:31:33 raven used to be our religion
0:31:35 she
0:31:36 she has always been more than that
0:31:40 but when xavier
0:31:41 left
0:31:43 she knew her place wasn't in the
0:31:45 camarilla anymore
0:31:46 and there's an
0:31:48 there's an awful lot
0:31:49 going on that i don't even
0:31:52 we forgot to tell her about the sun i
0:31:54 don't know how to start talking about
0:31:56 some of the xavier things that are going
0:31:58 on nearly fair well then let's
0:32:01 start with we with what we can handle
0:32:03 right i mean
0:32:04 so what do we need with the thing in the
0:32:06 fridge
0:32:07 you think we need to talk to raven i
0:32:09 think we're going to need to talk to
0:32:10 raven about it and that means we're
0:32:11 going to need to get into contact with
0:32:12 raven how do you
0:32:15 how do you plan on even doing that isn't
0:32:17 i mean
0:32:19 the prince was throwing a hissy fit
0:32:21 about not being able to find the game
0:32:22 role recently like how are you going to
0:32:23 do it i have a messenger
0:32:26 okay that's for i don't know why i have
0:32:28 to talk about that
0:32:29 i think you hear some banging and stuff
0:32:30 from downstairs as we we brought
0:32:32 containers through the back like seller
0:32:35 entrance
0:32:36 the bilco doors
0:32:37 and then we'll probably clamp back up
0:32:38 upstairs before everybody is around do
0:32:41 you um
0:32:43 you know before they come back upstairs
0:32:44 in a couple of seconds here do you
0:32:47 eat messengers and stuff and you can be
0:32:49 as honest as you're capable of being in
0:32:52 this uh do you
0:32:54 need us to walk out of the room for you
0:32:56 to do some stuff or is it no okay i just
0:32:58 wanna i wanna give you your privacy if
0:33:00 you like everybody's got their things
0:33:02 they don't wanna talk to people about i
0:33:04 appreciate that speaking of which are
0:33:06 you okay today you didn't join the party
0:33:07 last night um you were missing for hours
0:33:12 yeah
0:33:13 we don't have to talk about it right now
0:33:15 so probably about this time i come
0:33:16 upstairs and i'm still
0:33:18 gear dog
0:33:20 just like
0:33:21 full-on battle again wow
0:33:26 it was a meeting hey my sword you've
0:33:28 seen it before why does everybody keep
0:33:29 saying that because you don't bring it
0:33:31 out for for company like you did well
0:33:33 yeah i can't drag it around the streets
0:33:35 all the time i know which means when you
0:33:36 bust it out something's going on and you
0:33:38 came in here
0:33:43 he dresses up for the occasion doesn't
0:33:44 he yep speaking of which since um since
0:33:47 the stores were closed we were thinking
0:33:48 we should go check on the thing in my
0:33:50 fridge yes better to deal with that
0:33:53 before it gets worse
0:33:55 that's happened to it yeah that's really
0:33:57 i'm hoping it's still there
0:33:59 i'm hoping it hasn't done anything
0:34:01 different since you put it in the fridge
0:34:03 stay there
0:34:04 no i'm just hoping it stayed dead
0:34:07 that's really kind of what i'm hoping
0:34:09 for as well um but anyway i i think i
0:34:12 was telling britta and neil that we need
0:34:14 to get in touch with raven because she's
0:34:16 gonna have more insight on um
0:34:19 on this situation
0:34:21 is she wanted going to want to get
0:34:22 involved
0:34:23 i suspect she she knows a lot about it
0:34:28 based on some of the projects she's
0:34:29 worked on in the past all right
0:34:31 there is a storm coming to new haven so
0:34:34 let's try and head it off this means

0:34:55 physical storm like a tornado it's tough
0:34:57 to tell
0:34:58 that i'm not talking about a physical
0:35:00 storm look i it's going off the rails
0:35:03 for me at this point about exactly what
0:35:05 we're talking about so i'm going to go
0:35:07 and i just want to know what
0:35:08 one can be a herald of the other
0:35:11 i am not talking about a weather
0:35:12 phenomena storm neither am i okay i
0:35:14 don't know if i am or not all right well

0:35:56 oh boy wow
0:35:58 that being said i am going to go find my
0:36:00 fisher cat whose name is chaps do we

0:36:04 the city you want to
0:36:06 head out to the park or yeah she's
0:36:07 probably fine i could also just find any
0:36:09 random animal but chaps is gonna work a
0:36:11 lot better

0:36:14 manage to get her out to get to get her
0:36:16 fed
0:36:17 not yet um
0:36:19 johnny makes a sour face
0:36:21 we'll get around to it we've been up for
0:36:22 like an hour
0:36:24 we've got time
0:36:25 we need to do it along the way somehow
0:36:27 all right i don't want to go into an
0:36:29 unknown situation with
0:36:31 a old gangrel
0:36:33 with somebody's
0:36:35 well we don't if he on the couch
0:36:37 yeah
0:36:38 all right well i'm gonna
0:36:39 let's go to the park we can start
0:36:41 heading to my place
0:36:43 there's usually
0:36:44 there's usually kids hanging around east
0:36:46 rock park camping um even at this time
0:36:49 of year they go out to get away from
0:36:50 their parents especially if they want to
0:36:52 try stuff does anyone need anything i
0:36:54 don't have a
0:36:56 lot of
0:36:57 concealable
0:36:58 hardware currently
0:37:00 i'm going to look really out of place
0:37:02 walking around january in a t-shirt i
0:37:05 have coats yes okay
0:37:07 are they leather
0:37:08 it's probably a peacoat
0:37:10 that's fine wool's fine
0:37:12 we'd probably use a jacket too right
0:37:14 um do you know if uh
0:37:16 marcos ever found the gloves i'm sure he
0:37:19 did
0:37:20 he's very capable all right we'll get
0:37:22 you geared up it looks like you're
0:37:23 pretty handy with a gun so
0:37:26 you might as well have one i guess so
0:37:28 yeah
0:37:29 oh um
0:37:31 does anyone know where my shoes are
0:37:33 where did you laugh now you know where
0:37:34 your shoes are did you have them sort of
0:37:37 looks sheepishly down at his bare feet
0:37:38 and back up like i had not been betting
0:37:40 there in the backyard since you came in
0:37:42 full of mud you could have done that
0:37:44 with shoes on that makes sense i'm
0:37:45 excited i'll be right back i am berating
0:37:47 you right now for doing so okay well
0:37:50 consider myself berated all right i just
0:37:52 want her out of the backyard
0:37:54 you guys uh you guys gonna take a few
0:37:56 minutes to get geared up before we head
0:37:57 out yeah a couple things i'm gonna walk
0:37:59 down to the corner and grab back of
0:38:00 cigarettes be back
0:38:02 johnny heads out mm-hmm find some
0:38:05 clothing for them not a script and then
0:38:07 win still pulls on her old boots um and
0:38:10 she tucks her dad's gun into her hand i
0:38:12 need to take a moment britta has we've
0:38:15 talked about a couple of the things that
0:38:16 your blood can do and stuff
0:38:18 i've seen you use this unconsciously
0:38:21 you can
0:38:23 also it seems
0:38:24 exert
0:38:25 a presence you can use
0:38:29 a supernatural
0:38:31 charm of sorts
0:38:34 this might help you in hunting in the
0:38:36 future it will help
0:38:38 it's
0:38:39 just like a prey a predator animal it
0:38:42 use its ability to help you
0:38:45 feed the same way that i
0:38:48 managed to get the people to turn away
0:38:50 from the car right
0:38:51 it seems like an unconscious effort i
0:38:53 think if you use that and possibly focus
0:38:55 it
0:38:56 it may help you take control of the
0:38:58 situation
0:38:59 i think that could help yeah um that
0:39:02 very much puts the power back in your
0:39:03 hands also here's a heavy pistol
0:39:07 there's a shoulder rig goes in there
0:39:09 very nicely do i know how to put on a
0:39:11 shoulder right yeah she just slings it
0:39:12 right on tucks the weapon checks the mag
0:39:15 like all of it do you
0:39:17 remember anything else do you know how
0:39:19 to use anything else
0:39:21 um
0:39:22 this seems um
0:39:24 comfortable
0:39:25 very
0:39:26 you said you
0:39:28 when you
0:39:30 kind of
0:39:31 saw things before
0:39:33 you said there was a man with you
0:39:35 yes um he i mean it was kind of hard to
0:39:39 tell because everything was
0:39:41 well black and white but
0:39:43 um
0:39:44 he
0:39:45 had a beard his skin seemed very dark
0:39:50 very dark or
0:39:52 well i mean it looked like when
0:39:55 it looked completely black but
0:39:58 the whole thing was black and white too
0:40:00 guys i found my shoes
0:40:03 good job buddy what are you talking
0:40:05 about i'm sure uh her vision oh very dry
0:40:09 please don't
0:40:10 did you just stand over there
0:40:12 do not come inside i bring you a towel
0:40:15 uh brittany you ever want to talk about
0:40:18 seeing patterns and things uh
0:40:20 you know
0:40:21 i'm around if these visions
0:40:24 Britta sees
0:40:26 yeah mile miles is basically like
0:40:28 slightly out of eye line being like
0:40:30 shaking his head
0:40:33 britta like
0:40:34 uses her peripheral vision pretty well
0:40:37 probably using a smidge of aspects
0:40:40 and
0:40:41 just
0:40:42 dips her head a little uh not in the way
0:40:44 that would seem like a communication but
0:40:47 trails off as she says
0:40:50 if these visions continue to happen um
0:40:53 we can look into it
0:40:55 okay
0:40:58 neil has enough empathy to just
0:41:01 okay
0:41:02 and he sort of like quietly backs off
0:41:04 and cleans his feet and puts his shoes
0:41:07 on everybody ready so once when johnny
0:41:09 gets back we get to go
0:41:10 yeah um lex is east rock park within
0:41:13 walking distance of
0:41:15 uh miles's place a little bit of a long
0:41:16 walk but okay like it can be done it's
0:41:18 just kind of an inconvenient one okay
0:41:21 um would that provide us more
0:41:22 opportunity to find
0:41:24 uh food for Britta uh not in january okay
0:41:28 at night in january the streets are kind
0:41:30 of
0:41:30 we're just gonna have to take multiple

0:49:39 vehicle and said all five of us yes okay
0:49:42 fine
0:49:43 i don't know why we just don't take that
0:49:44 one all the time you're the only one
0:49:46 with a car because it's boring
0:49:49 boring is okay for certain occasions if
0:49:52 it means we all take one car i'm not
0:49:54 johnny banks in the front door but he
0:49:56 stays outside because he's still smoking
0:49:58 no one's gonna accuse you of being
0:50:00 boring yes i grabbed the bmw keys you're
0:50:03 i don't know
0:50:05 you're not gauche or whatever you're
0:50:07 just using words that you have a twelve
0:50:08 dollar
0:50:09 fresh stat i
0:50:12 yeah they're arguing about cars i i
0:50:14 think we were heading out towards him
0:50:16 hey uh when i was down at the corner
0:50:17 store i bumped into uh kabir that's
0:50:19 where your warrior poet friend with all
0:50:22 the advice yeah yeah uh he's kind of
0:50:25 just lucky like that i guess uh he was
0:50:28 actually asking about you when did i
0:50:30 piss him off no no no yeah he was
0:50:32 actually wondering if he could talk to
0:50:34 you i guess the uh i guess his his uh
0:50:36 his clan the rabnos they have a problem
0:50:39 that
0:50:41 yeah i know i know he's i know you guys
0:50:43 have some kind of beef going back but he
0:50:46 actually wants to talk to you about
0:50:47 something i guess they have a problem
0:50:50 that might be a gangrel problem the
0:50:52 ravnos have lots of problems look
0:50:54 kabir's is he's on the level
0:50:57 he's the he's the whole reason that i
0:50:59 cert that i survived to be the wonderful
0:51:01 example of a kindred that stands before
0:51:03 you oh so we have him to blame that's
0:51:05 right good to know
0:51:06 look if it wasn't for him i'd i'd be
0:51:08 dead in a ditch somewhere near chicago
0:51:10 all right do we have a way of getting in
0:51:12 touch with him he'll call me once we
0:51:14 have our information
0:51:16 maybe he'll call
0:51:17 and we can talk about eventual problem
0:51:19 solving he generally shows up or is
0:51:23 heard from right when he needs to be
0:51:25 he's charmed that kind of way all right
0:51:28 i would rather hear what uh
0:51:30 what information we have first
0:51:32 so maybe his semi-charmed kind of life
0:51:34 will uh bring him back our way at a
0:51:36 convenient point i told him i was going
0:51:37 to see you now but he said he had
0:51:40 something else to take care of yeah he
0:51:41 doesn't actually want to talk to me or
0:51:42 be in my presence what is the what is
0:51:44 the deal between your uh your clients
0:51:46 long story we have a refrigerator to go
0:51:48 investigate all right yeah concrete
0:51:51 tactile proof of
0:51:53 tangible problems would be good right
0:51:54 now but
0:51:56 by the way
0:51:57 the corner store is pretty empty right
0:51:59 now
0:52:00 there's one guy behind the counter
0:52:02 who is pretty bored looking and there is
0:52:06 a bathroom
0:52:07 that maybe somebody could
0:52:09 convince him to go into for a little bit
0:52:12 he looks over at britta
0:52:15 um
0:52:16 give it a go
0:52:17 just pretend like you're going in to get
0:52:18 a coke except you're going in to seduce
0:52:21 the uh cashier to the bathroom so you
0:52:22 can drink his blood he's just a coke
0:52:26 i mean that is factually what she's
0:52:28 doing it's a really
0:52:30 grotesque way to put it for somebody
0:52:32 who's i mean that's not my problem with
0:52:33 it i just don't johnny i just wouldn't
0:52:35 do it from like a store clerk i promise
0:52:38 i'm not trying to distract from the
0:52:39 point it's just that
0:52:41 you said that kabir right yeah
0:52:44 you said that he's always exactly where
0:52:46 he needs to be when he needs to be
0:52:49 and he
0:52:50 left
0:52:51 as in he didn't think he needed
0:52:53 something from you
0:52:55 no he asked me to talk to go talk to
0:52:57 wind to put in a good word with him
0:52:59 with her yeah it's funny he just
0:53:01 randomly bumped into you on the street
0:53:02 and then walked off that's kabir did
0:53:05 something change would you make me feel
0:53:07 any better at all he got reassurance
0:53:09 that he was gonna talk to me i'm
0:53:10 guessing look we have to make one stop
0:53:12 for this the robnos are one of those
0:53:14 families that's not necessarily part of
0:53:16 the camarilla
0:53:18 they don't tend to just stick around the
0:53:20 uh the domain
0:53:22 and
0:53:23 does he have hospitality
0:53:26 probably let's go with yes for now let's
0:53:29 assume yes until we know otherwise
0:53:32 hospitality works no it's not but i
0:53:35 don't oh i'm trying to set good examples
0:53:37 for bretta okay okay fair enough but at
0:53:39 this point i don't really have the let's
0:53:40 get her fed the group of you segway out
0:53:43 of the house
