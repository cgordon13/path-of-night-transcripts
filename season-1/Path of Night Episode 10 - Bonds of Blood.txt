0:04:05 point out that Johnny is a big fellow
0:04:07 your strength three do not have potence
0:04:10 and you only have one blood currently
0:04:13 with which to pump your uh nothing
0:04:16 because free strength is pretty good it
0:04:19 is but to carry a large unconscious dead
0:04:23 weight person up a ladder I mean you
0:04:26 don't have any body fluids maybe that'll
0:04:28 help no you're dried out you're all dry
0:04:30 inside
0:04:31 stretching for prayers here I know I'm
0:04:34 just saying it's you can get them up
0:04:35 there but you have an hour to do so cool
0:04:37 well I'm ordering newspapers so good

0:04:44 you need help when I'm not as strong as
0:04:46 you are but
0:04:47 I might need you to push while I pull
0:04:50 from up top all right let's do that so
0:04:52 when will carry him as far up the ladder
0:04:54 as she can
0:04:56 all right Brita move closer yeah put
0:04:58 your hands on his ass and just kind of
0:05:00 hold him against the ladder
0:05:02 um okay man we put our bodies on the
0:05:05 line and this is what we get for it you
0:05:07 were very tenderly lowered down okay
0:05:08 they just dropped you on your face
0:05:10 apparently
0:05:11 you wouldn't take them down a hole
0:05:14 thank you
0:05:15 uh wind will kind of still try and keep
0:05:18 an arm up him but kind of like move her
0:05:20 body awkwardly up the ladder and try and
0:05:23 keep an arm around Johnny okay Brita why
0:05:26 don't you give me a strength plus
0:05:27 Athletics rule just the two for strike
0:05:29 yep okay
0:05:31 oh boy
0:05:33 one success hey great win give me
0:05:37 strength plus Athletics and add plus one
0:05:40 die
0:05:42 one success all right
0:05:46 A Little Help from Britta you got the
0:05:48 big fella up on top yeah
0:05:51 [Music]
0:05:55 you swear he's doing it on purpose you
0:05:58 are such a [ __ ] John Saxon I'm gonna
0:06:00 kick your ass when you're awake
0:06:03 I know you hear me and she'll go and
0:06:05 she'll just kind of prop him up on the
0:06:06 cot as he was before or no he can't she
0:06:09 can't she just drops him on the floor
0:06:11 is everything okay up there more papers
0:06:14 yeah he's an [ __ ] no no no no no no
0:06:16 no no all right let's start with Miles
0:06:18 he's at least a slight man all right
0:06:21 same system yep the frown on Tim's face
0:06:24 does not translate to audio but it might
0:06:28 with I don't know
0:06:31 the two of you bring miles up with no
0:06:35 issue all right I think you're taller
0:06:36 than Johnny but you're more spelled yep
0:06:39 I'll take that Johnny's a beef man yeah
0:06:42 the old finish is putting the newspapers
0:06:45 in numerical order and then starts Brita
0:06:48 come on up ordering the clip outs of
0:06:51 horoscopes going back to like 1983. Neil
0:06:54 also got scattered
0:06:56 how do we lock this proper I have uh
0:06:59 keys and to have maybe a rug or
0:07:02 something to put over it yeah I that and
0:07:04 then usually the blanket kind of hangs
0:07:06 over the side of the bed okay and he
0:07:08 points out and gives the keys to win as
0:07:10 he keeps ordering the papers wind takes
0:07:12 the keys and figures out which one it is
0:07:14 and locks everything up tight I find the
0:07:17 blanket or the rug and move the blanket
0:07:20 as directed okay set them on on the cot
0:07:24 so their legs are also overhanging no
0:07:26 bring them up bring them upstairs keep
0:07:27 them behind the counter okay okay the
0:07:29 shutters are closed it's fine okay you
0:07:31 find yourself having to move Johnny
0:07:34 again it stares not a ladder this time
0:07:36 is less frustrating yeah but it is not
0:07:40 not frustrating I don't have to move him
0:07:42 up a vertical
0:07:43 surface right and his body just it
0:07:45 constantly leans the wrong way every
0:07:48 time and again it's as though he's doing
0:07:50 this on purpose you are such a [ __ ] what
0:07:55 not you honey okay and she'll she'll
0:07:58 drag him to an easily available spot and
0:08:01 she'll just set the set him on the
0:08:03 ground there's a place like behind the
0:08:05 counter near the register uh if you're
0:08:07 knocking Johnny down there you'll also
0:08:08 see that there is a shotgun mounted
0:08:12 under the counter Neil is this shotgun
0:08:15 alarmed I don't know what his emotional
0:08:17 state is all right that that was a lot
0:08:20 to ask my bad like the moment you
0:08:22 apologize the windows shatter and you
0:08:26 can hear the staccato of gunfire as
0:08:28 bullets
0:08:29 fill the shop and chunks the walls are
0:08:32 falling papers are getting tipped over
0:08:34 everywhere things hanging from the wall
0:08:37 are completely destroyed by this hail
0:08:40 fire of bullets and you hear these these
0:08:44 car wheels
0:08:45 Screech to a stop right by the car
0:08:48 that's outside and more and more and
0:08:52 more ammunition is dumped
0:08:55 straight into the the uh the the car you
0:08:58 guys arrived is there a hand grenade
0:09:00 behind here uh yes but it's drilled out
0:09:03 it's a collector's item you're loud loud
0:09:06 loud gunfire customers take a number
0:09:09 yeah definitely one of those it quiets
0:09:12 down and way off of the distance we're
0:09:15 coming for you miles
0:09:18 and the cars take off
0:09:21 course it's them is everyone okay I'm
0:09:24 fine what's going on up there I think
0:09:26 the set Heights again are you sure this
0:09:28 is a rough neighborhood
0:09:30 they were yelling for miles and they
0:09:32 definitely shot up his car
0:09:33 I don't think they're gonna notice the
0:09:34 wiring
0:09:37 once again the frown on Tim's face
0:09:39 doesn't Translate
0:09:42 nor the lifted fists
0:09:46 his sweater is the exact color of the
0:09:49 Hummer Twilight maroon Twilight maroon
0:09:55 hold on I checked my phone to see if I
0:09:57 have any missed messages uh you don't
0:09:59 hmm well I told miles it was like a 50
0:10:02 50. were either of their husks hit yes
0:10:06 it looks like Johnny took one of the arm
0:10:08 that's about it is that anything we can
0:10:10 do anything about or that's gonna hurt
0:10:12 him more it's irrelevant yeah he's at a
0:10:14 state where
0:10:16 only a handful of things really make a
0:10:18 difference just had to put another hole
0:10:19 in my jacket though didn't you just one
0:10:21 we're getting new stuff soon don't worry
0:10:23 about it look at that new jacket for
0:10:25 Johnny that'll be better
0:10:27 I don't it's a new opportunity for a
0:10:30 patch now now we're thinking there we go
0:10:34 there's a reason he likes Brita she gets
0:10:37 it he can't just replace a jacket
0:10:43 actually speaking of dress better are we
0:10:45 still wearing our I haven't changed
0:10:49 it's been a while we could have gotten
0:10:50 your new clothes okay
0:10:51 I mean the shop has a bunch of clothes
0:10:53 in it that's fair
0:11:01 you tell us what you found in the shop
0:11:03 yeah what kind of clothes are available
0:11:05 in your shop uh it looks like just
0:11:07 literally the clothes you can find in a
0:11:09 pawn shop like a mishmash at a low end
0:11:11 pawn shop yeah a ton of stuff that was
0:11:14 like taken from estate sales or someone
0:11:16 may have robbed someone and then tried
0:11:19 to be fair I would imagine that your
0:11:21 place gives less of a Vibe of pawn shop
0:11:23 and more of a Vibe of like weird vintage
0:11:26 curio shop kind of except for all like
0:11:29 the guns and
0:11:31 shutters and graffiti it is kind of like
0:11:34 that but most of the best vintage curio
0:11:36 stuff is downstairs and boxes and not
0:11:38 for sale so like maybe a wedding dress
0:11:41 or two I actually quite like the 80s
0:11:44 prom dress thing maybe something like I
0:11:46 imagine like a black lace over a satin
0:11:49 overlay like something maybe somebody's
0:11:51 quinceanera dressed like
0:11:54 but they have to be in like a real goth
0:11:57 prom dress or maybe like a leather
0:11:59 jacket to go over it just full-on yeah
0:12:04 this is hysterical because I feel like
0:12:06 the you know the princes are not
0:12:08 necessarily the prince but uh Kindred of
0:12:10 note are showing up and you guys got
0:12:12 dressed up like six-year-olds thinking
0:12:15 that they're going to a fancy party like
0:12:17 you've got like a big fat 60s tie you've
0:12:20 got a problem no I'm wearing a sweater
0:12:22 you found that he thought was it was
0:12:24 pretty I don't think that there's like a
0:12:25 big selection of women's clothes it is
0:12:28 very eclectic but there's not like a I I
0:12:31 imagine it's like this blue thing with
0:12:32 like a seafoam green sash as part of it
0:12:35 like just like why because under the
0:12:38 Sheep I am super okay
0:12:43 leather jacket like you definitely have
0:12:45 those I think
0:12:47 most appropriate thing and stuff with
0:12:50 that low bass line Neil actually looks
0:12:53 more comfortable in his clothes than he
0:12:54 did when he was wearing like a bowling
0:12:56 shirt and oversized jeans these were
0:12:58 like tight black slacks like a button-up
0:13:01 shirt like a mandarin collar that comes
0:13:03 to just under his Adam's apple and uh a
0:13:06 zip up sweater like cardigan
0:13:08 like a zip up sweater it's a deep maroon
0:13:12 with a collar and a shirt pocket
0:13:14 burgundy yeah like a burgundy it's like
0:13:17 a burgundy zip up card and sweater with
0:13:20 a pocket Wynn has found a men's leather
0:13:22 jacket and has put it on over whatever
0:13:24 she's wearing not because she wants to
0:13:25 look nice but because she's fairly
0:13:27 certain she'll get her ass kicked
0:13:28 Marlboro on the back
0:13:30 oh yeah this is the 90s there's
0:13:32 definitely a lot of like that send away
0:13:34 from Marlboro [ __ ] yeah
0:13:37 after a couple of minutes after the
0:13:39 gunfire Neil will come upstairs Neil
0:13:41 before you come up here you should know
0:13:43 that the said I'd shot out a bunch of
0:13:45 your windows and there's a bunch of
0:13:46 papers that have been knocked out and
0:13:47 the shutters do he comes upstairs
0:13:50 yeah Neil looks around the remains of
0:13:52 his shot up shot like the bullet holes
0:13:55 and the steel and just I
0:13:58 um make you have a self-control chick
0:14:00 probably yeah I I don't know difficulty
0:14:04 eats
0:14:06 begins
0:14:08 uh I'm gonna spend a willpower this is a
0:14:11 really bad time for me to freak out
0:14:15 that's something no because I didn't
0:14:17 think the ones could take away from The
0:14:18 Willpower buy the book by the way we've
0:14:20 been playing okay they still take away
0:14:24 okay
0:14:26 two successes yes exceptional instead of
0:14:31 being like yeah I control myself Neil
0:14:33 essentially starts to cry which is
0:14:37 probably where both of you will find out
0:14:38 it's very easy for Neil to slip into
0:14:41 Humanity or blush of Health it doesn't
0:14:43 actually cost him any blood to do it
0:14:44 okay so he just he just starts crying
0:14:48 and like slowly sweeping
0:14:51 piles of glass and my blood tears not if
0:14:55 you're human not if you spend to be a
0:14:57 human oh okay Neil do you need a hug
0:15:01 he doesn't answer but also doesn't push
0:15:03 you away if you get closer when kind of
0:15:05 comes closer and takes the broom gives
0:15:07 him a big Gangrel hug buddy it's gonna
0:15:10 be okay we're gonna get it fixed I feel
0:15:12 like that's a different meaning a Gangrel
0:15:14 hug
0:15:22 feel the power of my love as the floor
0:15:25 is covered in broken glass and loose
0:15:28 newspapers and all sorts of just refuse
0:15:31 the door opens and you can hear a little
0:15:33 bell Ding and first walking in
0:15:38 is the sheriff who seems quiet and has a
0:15:43 little bit of a morose expression the
0:15:45 trouble you guys have been having over
0:15:47 the past you know couple weeks
0:15:50 it looks like he's been getting it just
0:15:52 as rough it's not in any words or
0:15:54 anything like that he says he says
0:15:55 nothing
0:15:57 upon entering then there are two Kindred
0:16:00 that follow him in one of them you
0:16:03 immediately recognize as senatorial
0:16:04 Reiss who has a smarmy expression
0:16:07 adjusting his glasses and kind of
0:16:10 looking between the group View and has
0:16:14 this derisive expression particularly
0:16:16 when he settles on Win Win Returns the
0:16:19 expression and then behind him is Upton
0:16:22 Rowlands oh God who he looks like a a
0:16:28 ruler who has accidentally stepped into
0:16:32 a field of cow [ __ ] because everything
0:16:35 around him is disgusting
0:16:37 and he does not want to touch anything
0:16:38 and he he looks around as though there's
0:16:42 this horrible pungent smell in the air
0:16:44 that he can't get away from and he is
0:16:47 completely uncomfortable
0:16:49 but then he gets out of the way
0:16:52 and stepping in looking much much more
0:16:56 graceful
0:16:58 than any of the individuals that have
0:17:00 already come inside
0:17:01 is a very handsome
0:17:04 Charming young man with blonde hair
0:17:06 that's swept back his suit is likely
0:17:10 worth more than the entirety of
0:17:13 everything on this block combined and in
0:17:17 his hand is a cell phone that's probably
0:17:20 smaller than any cell phone you've ever
0:17:22 seen my God
0:17:24 just very easily fits into the palm of
0:17:27 his hand and the group stops and sort of
0:17:30 just looks around
0:17:32 at the chaos that that's unfolded and
0:17:36 the stranger the perfect stranger the
0:17:38 one that you guys have never seen before
0:17:40 sets his Gaze on Neil
0:17:43 where is Miles
0:17:46 uh right here sir uh when Britain can
0:17:51 you can you help me with he is not so
0:17:53 you'll call him all Khan the Seneschal
0:17:55 says
0:17:57 fresh with uh human fluids and features
0:18:00 uh Neil throws up in his mouth a little
0:18:02 bit and then
0:18:04 goes uh yes archon he's he's right he's
0:18:08 right here uh and the wind leans down
0:18:10 and just kind of lifts him up
0:18:12 um as gracefully and as with with as
0:18:15 much dignity as she can manage
0:18:17 he walks over to Miles who's being held
0:18:21 in the air by a Gangrel who's like I
0:18:24 have things for you here cradled
0:18:26 lovingly I'd like to think meanwhile
0:18:28 Johnny's just heaped in a pile
0:18:30 I'm actually just stepping up
0:18:34 I'm just kicking him out of the way oh
0:18:37 sorry we put Johnny on top get out of
0:18:39 here Johnny just grab him by the leg
0:18:42 the Seneschal makes his way over to
0:18:44 Miles and he goes to
0:18:47 draw a very small thin ritual dagger
0:18:51 that's covered in these kind of
0:18:53 excessive runes
0:18:55 and before he can cut himself open the
0:18:58 archon gives him a look and the center
0:19:01 shall instead decides to reach out and
0:19:05 place his hand on Miles like right
0:19:08 across the chest and he whispers words
0:19:11 in Latin and invokes hermetic
0:19:14 pharmaturgy and Miles finds himself
0:19:17 expanding one point of blood to heal one
0:19:19 point of lethal okay and becomes
0:19:21 conscious the blood wash is painful but
0:19:25 it quickly subsides and Miles you find
0:19:28 yourself in a very strange situation
0:19:31 with your sire present and looking over
0:19:34 you with not a judgmental expression but
0:19:38 definitely he's definitely giving you
0:19:40 that look when when there's business to
0:19:43 be had work to be done and you're not
0:19:46 in position you're napping in the break
0:19:48 room slacker
0:19:50 when I got this please uh let me down
0:19:53 all right when gingerly kind of puts his
0:19:55 feet down first make sure he's stable
0:19:58 before she actually let's go I dust
0:20:01 myself off
0:20:02 straighten up
0:20:04 give The Sire a bow then proceeding
0:20:07 along the lines and to Upton and then
0:20:09 the center Solomon and I give a nod to
0:20:12 Weathers miles joined me outside please
0:20:14 yes sir miles on the side as soon as he
0:20:17 says the word sire after they said
0:20:19 archon feels just looks between the two
0:20:22 of them like what the [ __ ] and the two
0:20:26 step outside
0:20:27 the prince the Senate shawl the sheriff
0:20:31 have deferential Expressions as they get
0:20:36 out of your way and a lot of miles to
0:20:38 walk by in a costume so we go outside
0:20:41 hi miles
0:20:43 there are a few matters that need to be
0:20:45 discussed right away
0:20:48 [Music]
0:20:51 meanwhile inside weathers gives the
0:20:54 central a look take care my boy and
0:20:57 there's a bit of a like a an exchange of
0:21:00 Expressions between the two of them that
0:21:02 aren't completely cordial but definitely
0:21:04 they definitely seem to be on the same
0:21:05 side okay
0:21:07 Windows while they're weddings mentions
0:21:10 that she goes and she lifts Johnny up
0:21:16 the big bro thumbs up onto the counter
0:21:19 and the Seneschal takes out that
0:21:22 Dagger of his
0:21:24 cuts his his wrist open
0:21:26 and gingerly
0:21:29 feeds Johnny his blood
0:21:33 and Johnny
0:21:34 you find yourself aroused by the taste
0:21:37 of kindred vitay
0:21:40 that's nice in fact he actually gives
0:21:42 you
0:21:43 three pints of his own blood
0:21:46 more than he needed to so Johnny are you
0:21:49 okay blood traits I get from him allow
0:21:51 me to spend to heal or how does that
0:21:54 work so you will immediately heal one
0:21:56 and then you will gain three blood okay
0:21:59 the Seneschal and Sheriff weathers
0:22:02 having another exchange of looks back
0:22:05 and forth why this doesn't seem overly
0:22:08 happy to know that he didn't have to do
0:22:10 that to wake you up but is grateful that
0:22:14 you're moving at all the Seneschal
0:22:17 and his Prince turned without very much
0:22:20 fanfare simply walk out uh his grace
0:22:23 does cast
0:22:25 a glance at Brita
0:22:29 should be speaking in soon of course
0:22:31 your grace and they saunter on outside
0:22:34 to the sidewalk stepping over the glass
0:22:36 lady and kind of crunching into their
0:22:38 heels but it will hold his uh hold his
0:22:41 gaze uh watch him as he goes but when he
0:22:44 goes she'll run over to Johnny
0:22:47 are you okay
0:22:49 Johnny's eyes flip open and kind of look
0:22:54 a lot like somebody who's been uh been
0:22:58 hit a little bit hard in the face
0:22:59 there's a lot of blood in the eye and he
0:23:03 vibrates for a second and immediately
0:23:06 faster than you would expect is on his
0:23:09 feet well well Johnny take it easy
0:23:12 hey bud
0:23:15 you're safe we got it he kind of looks
0:23:17 down at the ruin of his chest yeah it
0:23:21 does not look great
0:23:23 Johnny literally [ __ ] we're
0:23:26 um we're in Neil's Haven I will spend
0:23:29 blood to start healing he just starts
0:23:31 knitting the process of knitting himself
0:23:34 back together good Johnny heal we're
0:23:36 gonna need you what the heck oh
0:23:41 we uh we did it that you did it you and
0:23:44 you and miles and wind and the bear is
0:23:47 dead and you're alive and the Weeping
0:23:50 bear is dead you got it how long has it
0:23:54 been a couple of weeks how do I get back
0:23:56 up the Reiss sent a Shoal he closes his
0:24:00 eyes and kind of like
0:24:03 sets his jaw and then gives a very hard
0:24:06 stare at Weathers you don't want to know
0:24:09 what it cost me
0:24:11 and it costs you it cost you something
0:24:13 it's going to cost me something too now
0:24:16 yeah if there have been enough I'm sure
0:24:19 the sheriff would have
0:24:21 you'll start false quiet and goes back
0:24:24 to sleeping we would have if we could
0:24:25 have Johnny
0:24:27 where's miles talking to the desire did
0:24:31 I recognize who the Argon is no not at
0:24:34 all okay did you know that his sire is
0:24:36 an archon think he had uh he had
0:24:39 mentioned it once or twice maybe to you
0:24:42 I had no idea it's not really my
0:24:44 business to be talking about his
0:24:47 whatever
0:24:49 what's
0:24:51 um what's an archon
0:24:53 a conversation for later and he sort of
0:24:55 looks and throws glances towards the
0:24:57 door as if he's terrified to say it
0:25:00 wrong and get murdered to hell with that
0:25:03 argons are just they're the boss's boss
0:25:06 they all we all report to rolands and he
0:25:09 has domain here
0:25:11 well [ __ ] rolls down from somewhere Neil
0:25:15 as the entire time that Johnny's talking
0:25:18 is like moving a hand across his throat
0:25:20 like shut up when I gotta
0:25:25 I'm on edge and I don't think that right
0:25:27 now is maybe the time to
0:25:29 um I'm sorry I can ask more about it the
0:25:33 hell happened to your Haven
0:25:36 said they're coming for Miles apparently
0:25:38 they found out he was here oh
0:25:41 God miles is probably looking at his car
0:25:43 right now the weapons what
0:25:46 more weapons miles and I uh we took some
0:25:50 delivery from the setites if we've been
0:25:53 out at a commission for two weeks
0:25:55 they're probably none too happy that
0:25:57 that's up and well they haven't
0:25:59 necessarily found themselves in the
0:26:00 right spot are they in the right spot
0:26:02 let's put who who's the buyer at the
0:26:04 satis are selling look I don't know man
0:26:06 I suspect things are okay but Rowlands
0:26:10 knew about the damn thing he's just been
0:26:11 sitting on this we don't know Johnny
0:26:13 Prince is literally outside he's he's
0:26:15 here oh to hell with him I'm not saying
0:26:17 it to his face what the hell do you mean
0:26:19 the prince is in on it
0:26:22 look maybe this isn't for me to talk you
0:26:24 should ask miles he walks over on The
0:26:27 Courier shop door and closes it and
0:26:31 twists the lock
0:26:33 no Johnny I'm asking you
0:26:37 Neil goes over and not a stranger to
0:26:40 having clandestine conversations in this
0:26:42 location puts on the radio Power Man
0:26:45 5000 search for it
0:26:50 [ __ ] that is Neil's radio there's a
0:26:52 whole bunch of Blue Oyster Cult settings
0:26:54 in The Ventrue got together for a little
0:26:56 meeting Clan Venture was buying a lot of
0:26:58 weapons from the Setites and I got
0:27:00 called into uh to help move him I heard
0:27:04 that it was the whole clan and just it
0:27:06 got got uh once again [ __ ] rules down
0:27:09 the peg on to miles's head so I didn't
0:27:13 actually see him there but I figured
0:27:15 that uh it wouldn't just be miles to
0:27:17 deal with the setites otherwise we
0:27:18 probably would be missing our
0:27:20 Venture front they probably would have
0:27:22 picked someone else to do the deal so
0:27:24 the event you're buying guns
0:27:26 what the hell is going on I don't know
0:27:28 Johnny I got bad news more yeah
0:27:32 there's some sort of trouble afoot and
0:27:34 I've been given right of progeny so as
0:27:38 every Bara on the domain we're all
0:27:40 required to embrace two
0:27:42 required to embrace to embrace two the
0:27:46 [ __ ] inspired that that's not whatever's
0:27:49 got them buying guns are you the only
0:27:51 Clan that's been asked to do that yeah
0:27:52 well there's this ain't our style no
0:27:55 it's not
0:27:57 something really really nasty whatever's
0:28:00 going on with that zantosa that you guys
0:28:02 are working on do you remember how I
0:28:04 told you about how I got embraced Johnny
0:28:06 I'm not doing that Johnny you're not the
0:28:08 only story I've ever heard of being
0:28:10 embraced that way and if we don't do
0:28:12 this there's a good chance that a lot of
0:28:15 people are gonna find themselves
0:28:16 crawling their way out of ditches just
0:28:19 like you
0:28:20 so yeah I'm not a fan but there's got to
0:28:23 be a reason this is happening
0:28:25 Johnny they shovelheaded you
0:28:30 yeah
0:28:31 Jesus [ __ ] happens on the road out
0:28:34 towards Chicago
0:28:36 maybe maybe we'll talk about that some
0:28:38 other time right now
0:28:40 I'm
0:28:42 I'm not doing that weather's I'll I'll I
0:28:45 will back you up in any kind of fight
0:28:47 you want to go into but I am not
0:28:50 just making two new bruja to fill in the
0:28:54 The Trenches here Johnny you can't think
0:28:57 for a second that Upton's not gonna
0:29:00 Crush any form of resistance he sees
0:29:02 right now
0:29:03 especially one with your story
0:29:07 you need to toe the line harder than
0:29:08 anyone else
0:29:10 are there any other clans being forced
0:29:12 into this [ __ ] no they're not
0:29:15 but it's not like this is the first time
0:29:17 you found out that the camera is not
0:29:18 fair
0:29:20 [Music]
0:29:22 so you can be a [ __ ] about it and whine
0:29:24 or you can do your [ __ ] job
0:29:28 but any other choice is just going to
0:29:30 get us all [ __ ] but that's not
0:29:32 um sorry sir would that mean that
0:29:35 they're under his accounting no
0:29:38 the conscripts for Roman pendragon's
0:29:41 army what so I'm supposed to embrace two
0:29:44 people and not even watch out for them
0:29:47 just hand them over to Pendragon yeah
0:29:53 Neil turns as if he's like still
0:29:56 sweeping so that only Brita can see him
0:29:58 right now and mouths many faced demon
0:30:01 what with a weird sort of panicky manic
0:30:04 look on his face
0:30:06 but it will lower her eyes and
0:30:08 understanding and
0:30:10 swallow back questions
0:30:12 whethers I have eaten a lot of [ __ ]
0:30:15 working for this domain but this crosses
0:30:19 a line there is no way I am taking
0:30:21 orders from that cowardly piece of [ __ ]
0:30:24 Prince making two vampires handing them
0:30:27 over to Pendragon and then just what
0:30:29 getting in the trenches to do the
0:30:31 bidding of just this there's got to be a
0:30:33 better way that's what being camera
0:30:35 means sometimes
0:30:37 and yeah it's not great but think about
0:30:40 the [ __ ] options
0:30:42 Neil turns the radio up as the two
0:30:45 brujas start to get louder you know at
0:30:49 this point I feel like getting blood
0:30:51 hunted is a better option running off
0:30:53 and finding some anarchs and getting
0:30:55 that getting just out of this [ __ ]
0:30:57 Johnny what do you think's gonna happen
0:30:59 when they show up to New Haven and start
0:31:02 going after innocent people and you're
0:31:04 not there
0:31:07 what if they get the wrong one
0:31:10 you're gonna let that happen Johnny
0:31:15 no
0:31:17 I don't like this any more than you do
0:31:19 I'll assure you the supply is coming
0:31:21 we're pretty sure
0:31:23 Johnny
0:31:24 at least
0:31:26 you'd be their sire
0:31:28 and it wouldn't be someone
0:31:31 else
0:31:33 someone who wouldn't care about them
0:31:37 for whatever that's worth
0:31:40 Johnny gives you a look that you're not
0:31:42 used to seeing on him
0:31:44 you see his heart kind of breaks a
0:31:47 little bit
0:31:49 at that notion
0:31:51 and he just has this really remorseful
0:31:54 sad kind of look on his face
0:31:57 the sheriff lowers his head
0:31:59 kind of defeated
0:32:02 take your time
0:32:04 and he turns and just walks out weathers
0:32:07 did you find the carcass
0:32:09 ah yeah
0:32:11 is it dealt with it's dealt with
0:32:14 thank you you did good
0:32:16 we could have done better that goes for
0:32:19 all of us and he just walks out
0:32:22 weathers is right about something Johnny
0:32:26 there is something coming
0:32:28 something really bad coming to New Haven
0:32:31 whether it's the Sabbat or
0:32:34 I don't know a lot about this about
0:32:35 that's your that's your thing but
0:32:38 there is something coming I know that
0:32:40 much
0:32:42 I'm not saying anything that they're
0:32:44 asking you to do is right but
0:32:47 he's not blowing smoke up your ass
0:32:48 doesn't matter if the spot is coming how
0:32:51 we respond to it is what's going to
0:32:53 bring hell to the city I don't disagree
0:32:56 embracing new Kindred like this and mass
0:33:01 Graves that's what the Shabbat does yeah
0:33:05 it's the princess orders
0:33:08 care if it's the prince's orders he's
0:33:10 acting like a goddamn Bishop is what
0:33:12 he's acting like
0:33:13 what
0:33:15 when I was embraced I was embraced by a
0:33:17 pack of Sabbat
0:33:18 I was on the road out to Chicago
0:33:21 and I was in a truck stop and this group
0:33:24 of young kids was getting bullied by
0:33:26 these
0:33:27 large dark goons I I just took them for
0:33:32 a
0:33:33 for a a group of just gang bangers or
0:33:37 some I had no idea what I was dealing
0:33:39 with at the time but I thought I could
0:33:41 be the upright Knight and
0:33:44 help these young kids they couldn't have
0:33:46 been older than 17 these kids
0:33:48 well I picked a fight with the Sabbat
0:33:50 pack and they happened to like the fact
0:33:53 that I was willing to go toe-to-toe with
0:33:55 them
0:33:56 so they embraced me and they don't do it
0:33:58 like the camera
0:33:59 it's a dirty
0:34:01 ugly process and they just
0:34:04 they'll Embrace 10 12 Mass Graves of
0:34:09 Kindred thrown together and the ones
0:34:11 that rise to the top rise to the top and
0:34:14 get thrown into the army they don't have
0:34:16 coderies they're like wolf packs they're
0:34:19 led by religious zealots they have
0:34:23 priests that tend to the to the hounds
0:34:26 that they in Mass embrace you know who
0:34:29 you know who my brood mates were there
0:34:31 was at least 12 Gangrel that they don't
0:34:35 treat like people they treat them like
0:34:37 dogs I don't even know if if they
0:34:39 remember how to be people anymore
0:34:41 they keep them in in kennels during the
0:34:44 day and at night they just hunt the
0:34:46 streets Johnny and they hide Johnny stop
0:34:50 point is I don't want to go down that
0:34:53 road again I know
0:34:55 and a prince that makes directives that
0:34:58 we have to go down this way to protect
0:34:59 the the domain
0:35:01 I think he's out of control maybe but
0:35:04 it's his domain capital D he makes the
0:35:07 rules well then maybe somebody should
0:35:09 practice with a capital P cool it's what
0:35:12 it's gonna be you it's not gonna be me
0:35:14 it's not gonna be any of us Praxis
0:35:17 Johnny sits back with having been kind
0:35:19 of Thoroughly defeated by the fact that
0:35:21 he completely agrees that he is not the
0:35:23 person to practice
0:35:25 uh practice
0:35:27 contesting for the Princeton
0:35:30 becoming a new Prince
0:35:32 but
0:35:33 bloodless Praxis is rare let's put it
0:35:37 that way and the prince is powerful and
0:35:39 has a lot of allies and we shouldn't be
0:35:42 talking about the [ __ ] p word with a
0:35:44 door that won't shut when he's on the
0:35:46 sidewalk talking to Miles let him let
0:35:48 him come back in and ask him if you ask
0:35:50 me if I want to rethink what I just said
0:35:54 Neil keeps throwing super nervous looks
0:35:57 at the front door like please don't open
0:35:59 please don't open look Johnny I I'm not
0:36:02 I'm not saying this is okay I'm not
0:36:05 saying
0:36:08 this I I don't
0:36:11 this ends
0:36:13 something ends in the next year with
0:36:16 tragedy for you and I don't know if it's
0:36:18 stoppable or not and I don't know if
0:36:20 this is involved or not but what the
0:36:23 hell are you talking about just
0:36:25 like Miles said I get insights sometimes
0:36:28 right he looks like guilty nervous
0:36:31 Scopes no
0:36:33 sure let's go with that
0:36:35 I just I'm worried about you
0:36:38 and
0:36:39 what all this means and if the Sabbat
0:36:42 are coming here if the Sabbat or the
0:36:44 many face demon
0:36:46 I don't know but they're if they're
0:36:49 coming I don't want you not here
0:36:53 I don't think I could make it Johnny
0:36:56 reaches out and puts a hand on your
0:36:58 shoulder
0:36:59 thank you
0:37:01 he looks over at the uh the rest of you
0:37:03 guys gives you a pretty heartfelt stare
0:37:07 I'm sorry that my temper gets the better
0:37:10 of me a lot you guys have probably been
0:37:12 through hell watching out for me and
0:37:13 Miles yeah you're a real [ __ ] coming
0:37:15 up the ladder
0:37:18 it's okay Johnny
0:37:19 we're glad you're back yeah thank you
0:37:23 all let's get miles back in here and see
0:37:26 what he has to say is it okay to I mean
0:37:29 we should just wait right
0:37:31 for miles but he's talking to an archon
0:37:34 we're just gonna stay inside We're Not
0:37:35 Gonna interrupt that okay the group of
0:37:38 you wisely decide to stay inside and not
0:37:40 interrupt the Arkham that being said two
0:37:42 of you do have all specs yeah
0:37:45 no no
0:37:47 is Brita going to spy on the icon I
0:37:50 don't think I can there's a radio on
0:37:52 that doesn't matter you can tune it out
0:37:53 oh Neil is choosing not to because he's
0:37:56 having a panic attack you can do
0:37:58 whatever you want yeah if no one tells
0:38:01 me directly not to drive it like you
0:38:03 stole it yes yes yes yes hearing uh
0:38:07 hearing all specs yes sorry uh the I
0:38:11 turned the radio down after weathers
0:38:13 leaves anyways it was just a cover for
0:38:14 the shouting bruja but it won't like
0:38:16 stand and by a bullet hole in the wall
0:38:18 or anything like that but she'll help
0:38:21 sweep quote unquote with some heightened
0:38:23 hearing all right so you're listening on
0:38:26 the conversation between miles the
0:38:29 archon and the prince
0:38:34 [Music]
0:38:36 outside miles uh the first thing that
0:38:39 happens is your sire takes out a
0:38:43 cigarette for one of those nice like
0:38:45 silver cigarette holders and offers one
0:38:49 to you I take it you light your
0:38:51 cigarette for you thank you why it's one
0:38:53 for himself I understand things have
0:38:55 been rather trying lately I walked into
0:38:57 a situation I didn't know was happening
0:39:00 until it was basically that yes well
0:39:02 unfortunately it seems that the domain
0:39:04 that you call home is undergoing a
0:39:07 similar situation oh it's a good thing
0:39:08 to wake up to New Haven Bridgeport New
0:39:12 York it seems all along the east coast
0:39:15 there are signs appearing more and more
0:39:17 that the Savant intends a complex
0:39:21 assault the likes of which that we have
0:39:24 never seen we've been intercepting
0:39:26 missives where we can but it would seem
0:39:28 that Archbishop Polonia in association
0:39:30 with numerous other archbishops and an
0:39:33 organization known only as the black
0:39:35 hand and and a massive Crusade along the
0:39:37 east coast
0:39:38 fantastic we do not suspect we will win
0:39:41 many battles and so we must seek to win
0:39:45 those that are most important
0:39:48 the weapons cache yes where is it should
0:39:51 be it my heaven good
0:39:54 as of right now his grace he kind of
0:39:57 he's a little like aloof when he refers
0:40:00 to the princess his grace
0:40:02 he doesn't throw air quotes around it
0:40:03 but almost yeah
0:40:05 is assembling Kindred who will be able
0:40:08 to function as something of a smoke
0:40:10 screen as this Force makes its way up
0:40:12 North Roman pendragon's forces are Roman
0:40:16 spend dragons forces have been
0:40:17 struggling with what they're already
0:40:18 engaged with once this whatever this is
0:40:21 sweeps up from new from Mexico City I
0:40:25 don't know that it's going to hold
0:40:26 smoke screen will allow us to convince
0:40:28 this about that we are Waging War
0:40:30 against them when in truth we are
0:40:33 conserving resources and waiting for a
0:40:35 more important Target
0:40:36 do I get to know this target or was that
0:40:38 you don't okay but your position is no
0:40:42 accident
0:40:43 I did not think so
0:40:45 New Haven is one of the major locations
0:40:46 that we're looking to see defended it's
0:40:48 good to hear I would like
0:40:51 to see to it that I've been Rowlands his
0:40:54 grace the prince kind of smiles at that
0:40:56 that his domain remains secure very good
0:40:59 see to it that it remains
0:41:01 um a successful source of resources as
0:41:04 we need them and you must keep the
0:41:07 Sabbat presence out this zentosa
0:41:10 situation that you're dealing with yes
0:41:11 we need to know everything about it
0:41:13 because whoever this zentosa fellow is
0:41:17 has been feeding information to the
0:41:19 Sabah all right uh do we need to know
0:41:22 that right now or what do you know so
0:41:24 far not a lot what do you know the last
0:41:28 I'd heard there are a sort of Remnant
0:41:32 family living vampires of sorts
0:41:36 creating these Abominations
0:41:40 that seem to be raging out there the
0:41:42 Gangrel in the area have been dealing
0:41:44 with it for a while apparently
0:41:47 I don't know if they knew the family
0:41:49 existed but these
0:41:51 Abominations have been known this name
0:41:54 zantosa appears frequently in
0:41:57 association with the zimmy c
0:41:59 we're looking to learn more about them
0:42:01 how bad would it be if somebody had been
0:42:04 in talks with them for a while inside
0:42:07 the domain it would potentially be
0:42:09 treason I have an idea that that
0:42:12 somebody might be but I don't have
0:42:13 anything concrete yeah we can then I'll
0:42:16 crucify the bastard and have him
0:42:17 conclave to myself they are a player in
0:42:20 this town well my request States very
0:42:23 good
0:42:25 what do you need I have no idea what
0:42:28 this thing is but it needs to be put
0:42:29 down it sounds like and possibly know
0:42:32 what is the service you are providing
0:42:33 what do you need
0:42:36 unsure I don't know what to do with it
0:42:38 yet I imagine they've been gathering
0:42:40 information since I've been out okay
0:42:41 your team properly equipped xantosa
0:42:44 I Wanna Live okay what's alive
0:42:47 if possible yes I recognize that that
0:42:50 might not be something that we can
0:42:52 accomplish and if not dead
0:42:54 but preferably live got it if they'll
0:42:57 take a deal offer it to him
0:42:59 so okay
0:43:02 we'll do what we can furthermore the u4
0:43:05 is highly interested in this conflict
0:43:09 if the Sabbat can take the East Coast
0:43:11 that gives them a a very potent
0:43:15 springboard into the Western Europe
0:43:18 so
0:43:20 Prater Rowlands is going to see too that
0:43:23 New Haven is a success story you shall
0:43:25 service his liquor and you shall ensure
0:43:28 that Upton molens remains safe
0:43:31 secure and successful
0:43:35 I see as soon as I can we'll celebrate
0:43:38 your
0:43:39 promotion oh
0:43:42 but that might be some time yes well it
0:43:44 seems like we'll be very busy very soon
0:43:46 yes we have a time frame we don't great
0:43:50 I'm headed to DC to get some more
0:43:52 information right now I have a plane to
0:43:54 catch with awkon bell can I trust New
0:43:56 Haven in your hands Upton Rowlands looks
0:43:59 deeply offended that he just said that
0:44:00 to you
0:44:01 of course me and Prince Rowlands will
0:44:04 keep New Haven safe yes yes of course
0:44:06 yes of course icon you need not worry
0:44:08 excellent
0:44:10 I wish you well good luck
0:44:13 he turns and heads off
0:44:15 the Rowlands turns and looks to you and
0:44:17 he offers his hand to shake
0:44:20 well lick door
0:44:22 see to it that my Affairs are in order
0:44:24 I'm taking the night off yes Peter and
0:44:27 he turned to me
0:44:28 heads off to the car where the Santa
0:44:31 Shaw and a couple of his uh ghoul
0:44:33 bodyguards are waiting to escort him
0:44:34 home I take a moment around where the
0:44:37 [ __ ] are we
0:44:41 miles has never been to Neil Simmon uh
0:44:46 like from outside you hear Brita softly
0:44:49 laugh inside
0:44:53 okay
0:44:54 are you listening in this is the moment
0:44:57 where he looks around a gas and he's
0:44:58 like oh God am I in Fair Haven
0:45:01 should I
0:45:03 and for a second okay I'm like are you
0:45:06 listening yes
0:45:09 that's awesome I like I look at the
0:45:13 shirt I just like kind of rip it off
0:45:15 just like just
0:45:18 just [ __ ] it
0:45:22 [Music]
0:45:24 they've done with their conversation
0:45:27 I think so
0:45:28 as miles seeing his car yet I haven't
0:45:31 heard anything about it okay
0:45:33 oh my God I was like is there a car out
0:45:36 here I feel like uh there's definitely
0:45:39 something that fits the color
0:45:42 but it's just a lump of metal and bullet
0:45:46 holes no wheels
0:45:50 I kind of Pat it like Goodbye old friend
0:45:55 I had you for one night I don't know
0:45:58 when there's kind of a metallic sound
0:45:59 but this side a deep breath and then I
0:46:02 start walking back in uh the apartment
0:46:04 complex across the street it's front
0:46:07 door opens and you're wearing a trench
0:46:09 coat and a scarf and like kind of like a
0:46:12 fedora hat approaches a familiar face uh
0:46:15 you immediately recognize your goal who
0:46:17 has apparently been shaking out across
0:46:19 the street this entire time to make sure
0:46:20 that you stay safe miles it is so very
0:46:22 good to see that you are well
0:46:24 I kept denying the situation for as long
0:46:25 as I could inform their size to what was
0:46:27 taking place
0:46:29 good to see Marcos
0:46:31 see you too miles you look healthy no oh
0:46:34 doing better than it was yes well I
0:46:37 protected everything for you
0:46:39 done an excellent job thank you it seems
0:46:42 like our sire has
0:46:44 oh
0:46:45 given us new responsibilities
0:46:47 uh I'm sorry my sire or my goal oh yes
0:46:52 of course right
0:46:56 okay
0:46:59 we are going to be very busy in the near
0:47:01 future and um it's promising times
0:47:05 it's very good to hear full of danger
0:47:07 but many things can come up I'm okay
0:47:09 with it
0:47:10 very good why is there why is the car
0:47:13 still here the why is the car still here
0:47:15 yes
0:47:17 um
0:47:18 a great deal the internals have been
0:47:19 torn out I couldn't how did that happen
0:47:21 I have no idea huh hopefully they took
0:47:24 all the other things inside because I'd
0:47:26 be very distraught if I seem to be
0:47:29 missing any of my other items no he's
0:47:32 noticed the car when
0:47:33 he opens his trench coat and takes out
0:47:36 your Katan thanks that's very important
0:47:38 I guarded it with my life good thank you
0:47:41 it's very important yeah you know yes
0:47:44 I'm sorry I guess I'll be on my way then
0:47:45 no please stay you should probably be
0:47:47 party to what's going to come next As
0:47:50 You Wish I turn around and go back
0:47:51 inside and look look at the door I
0:47:53 remember hearing yelling well
0:47:56 quite a shop you have here Neil Neil
0:47:59 size
0:48:00 looking around at like the wreckage at
0:48:03 this point I will turn off my heightened
0:48:04 census so we have a couple things coming
0:48:07 up ahead of us yes we do so what have
0:48:09 you learned about zentos though what
0:48:12 what have you been doing since I've been
0:48:14 out making sure you're guarding your
0:48:16 body yeah for one thing okay my body
0:48:19 doesn't move doing some other people's
0:48:22 body is supposed to be whose bodies do
0:48:24 the set eyes the ones described to the
0:48:26 ones who did this okay to my home how
0:48:29 many times did they do it once when does
0:48:31 it like an hour ago right well miles we
0:48:35 were told that you'd be woken up soon so
0:48:38 well we didn't know what soon meant but
0:48:40 essential Reiss was supposed to come
0:48:43 here and wake you up and then a day
0:48:47 passed and then another day passed and
0:48:49 then it was two weeks later almost was I
0:48:51 supposed to do uh hell did Reiss blood
0:48:54 give you blood too no he didn't what no
0:48:57 he just put a hand over him he incanted
0:49:00 him wait Reiss gave him blood yeah yep
0:49:04 Johnny growls and smashes the counter in
0:49:08 the future
0:49:10 the one part that was totally untouched
0:49:13 miles no I'm sorry I should have stopped
0:49:17 at my kneeled I got distracted sorry I
0:49:20 shouldn't have let race do that
0:49:22 well you guys are a hot mess
0:49:26 right
0:49:27 so one thank you for looking at my body
0:49:31 for the last two weeks and you've been
0:49:34 getting better at hunting he uh asks to
0:49:36 Brita
0:49:37 um well I've managed she's been doing it
0:49:41 without supervision great we have to go
0:49:44 take care of the Sentosa family and we
0:49:46 need to bring them alive alive
0:49:51 can you talk to them the zanto I don't
0:49:54 know I was hoping for more information
0:49:56 than the last one we had well I'm
0:49:58 working on some things but I need some
0:50:00 help you're uh your former primogen said
0:50:02 that they were revenants yeah I don't
0:50:05 know a whole lot about the about
0:50:06 remnants from what she said they were
0:50:08 they can make their own vampiric blood
0:50:11 but if they're still living you knock
0:50:13 them on the head and hopefully they just
0:50:15 fall out
0:50:16 so how rough or miles can just talk to
0:50:19 them in his super Authority I'm a
0:50:21 ventral voice we look we have a lot of
0:50:24 options we should start with the fact
0:50:26 that they're probably going to have more
0:50:28 Abominations yeah probably that's what
0:50:31 I've been working on is trying to figure
0:50:33 out nomination stuff
0:50:35 trying to figure out when the best night
0:50:37 to move is well hopefully we're not
0:50:39 talking about Abominations the size of
0:50:41 the Weeping bear if that seems to be an
0:50:43 anomaly the Weeping bear was created for
0:50:46 a specific purpose also we can get
0:50:48 hardware and other things that we may
0:50:51 need
0:50:52 if we know what we're going in against
0:50:53 it makes it easier that's our first
0:50:55 thing the second thing is we get to
0:50:57 defend New Haven you got promoted of
0:50:59 sorts oh that's fantastic you think
0:51:01 maybe that we could like angle you to
0:51:04 replace the prince
0:51:06 whoa there Chief I know that they drove
0:51:09 away and all but miles there's been some
0:51:12 developments the things that Glenn
0:51:14 brujas has been asked to do Army
0:51:21 something about a smoke screen before we
0:51:23 go that that's my side of things hold on
0:51:26 a second so let me give you an overview
0:51:28 the Sabbat are moving in a large
0:51:32 complex attack yeah that makes sense
0:51:36 from Mexico City all the way through all
0:51:40 of the East Coast we're talking
0:51:42 unprecedented organization the entire
0:51:45 East Coast entire East Coast that
0:51:49 doesn't make sense what I don't know how
0:51:51 I don't know exactly why but our job is
0:51:55 to keep New Haven Sabbat free they
0:51:59 illnesses have anything to do with what
0:52:01 you've been researching and maybe I have
0:52:04 been given the job to make sure that
0:52:07 Upton does this job manifesting kidding
0:52:10 me while Upton stays maybe secure that
0:52:14 prickly down an edict that all of Clan
0:52:17 bruja get right of Prodigy progeny and
0:52:21 not just right of progeny we're forced
0:52:24 to make two progeny and hand them over
0:52:26 Roman Pendragon yeah it sounds like that
0:52:29 force does not expect to make it out of
0:52:30 the engagement that it happens to be in
0:52:32 there's
0:52:33 I can't do that miles but if it's
0:52:38 against something like
0:52:40 or the black hand another anomaly that
0:52:43 is an organization what are you talking
0:52:45 about with black hand and smoke screens
0:52:47 and stuff Brita she's referring to the
0:52:49 conversation I just had with my sire yes
0:52:52 yes oh I'm sorry you need to back it up
0:52:56 what did you say I the black hand does
0:53:00 that sound familiar to you because it is
0:53:02 a organization within the Sabbat that's
0:53:04 organizing this attack Johnny's eyes
0:53:07 kind of go wide in confusion and then
0:53:11 anger and then a lot of other emotions
0:53:14 in the span of a few seconds
0:53:17 an organization yeah that's what I was
0:53:20 informed of I've only ever known one
0:53:22 black hand and I thought he was the only
0:53:25 one I imagine based on the information
0:53:28 that I just received that's the false
0:53:30 the vampire that embraced me
0:53:32 had a crescent moon tattooed to the
0:53:36 inside of his hand and I never knew his
0:53:38 name
0:53:40 other members of the pack just simply
0:53:42 called him the black hand
0:53:44 so now you're telling me they're a whole
0:53:46 organization of [ __ ] like that
0:53:49 I thought that was kind of like the
0:53:51 Sabbat in general no it was a bunch of
0:53:54 [ __ ] like that no he was a
0:53:57 special kind of [ __ ] he was
0:53:59 calculated okay he
0:54:02 the kind of individual who could
0:54:04 entirely an organization of scattered
0:54:08 zealots like the Sabbat and send them at
0:54:11 chosen nuclear targets along the east
0:54:13 coast with enough of a blood Bond they
0:54:15 could do anything like that
0:54:17 excuse me for a second when you
0:54:19 eavesdrop on people's conversations you
0:54:20 probably should try to cover for it a
0:54:22 bit better I don't believe I should
0:54:25 definitely should no you just go from
0:54:28 torpor yes I'm not gonna lie to you
0:54:31 about it no that's fine in this
0:54:33 circumstance I'm saying I'm saying that
0:54:36 if you're going to do that
0:54:38 just a bit more subtle that's it if it's
0:54:41 any of you it's part of my accounting is
0:54:43 to teach you these things I'm just
0:54:45 making sure I appreciate the lesson but
0:54:48 miles
0:54:49 and take this lesson from uh from your
0:54:51 uncle Johnny here what he's trying to
0:54:54 say is keep it within Clan Venture but I
0:54:56 agree with your sentiment keep it in the
0:54:58 keep it in the codery no I I don't you
0:55:01 know what I think miles is saying if I
0:55:03 can interpret for miles is that wait for
0:55:05 this
0:55:08 when you'll have a chance afterwards no
0:55:10 I'm already thinking of how I'm going to
0:55:12 interpret what Neil says that you're
0:55:14 saying that you're saying Johnny's
0:55:15 saying that no no let's let him go do
0:55:18 you remember what I was talking about
0:55:18 earlier where there are no secrets and
0:55:20 everyone can find out anything all the
0:55:22 time
0:55:22 yes make it harder uh the assumption
0:55:26 that you were eavesdropping people will
0:55:29 only know that you were eavesdropping if
0:55:31 you make it obvious that you were doing
0:55:34 some sort of eavesdropping so next time
0:55:37 you eavesdrop uh make sure no one is
0:55:40 eavesdropping on you when you tell us
0:55:42 about how you were eavesdropping Niels
0:55:44 what I think Neil is trying to say if I
0:55:45 can interpret for Neil is that you
0:55:47 should either blow a dog whistle or an
0:55:49 air horn before you start listening in
0:55:50 on people's conversations that's the
0:55:52 opposite of what I was saying take you
0:55:54 to someone who listens to a lot of
0:55:55 conversations
0:55:56 foreign
0:55:58 you just do you okay look I have an
0:56:02 accounting and I think that I have to
0:56:03 teach I think
0:56:05 is that
0:56:07 okay you can do whatever the [ __ ] you
0:56:10 want Oh after you leave my accounting
0:56:12 until that point
0:56:14 I am responsible for you that includes
0:56:18 these things
0:56:19 miles in the future what would you like
0:56:21 me to do feel free to bring it up in the
0:56:23 code read but just I'm just saying for
0:56:25 this and I don't know how new you are to
0:56:28 all of this I was making it clear that
0:56:30 if you're using some of the abilities
0:56:33 that come with this
0:56:34 just be subtle about it line it in check
0:56:37 with the people around I mean to be
0:56:38 totally fair she was just talking to us
0:56:40 and nobody's around right now I could
0:56:42 tell because I'm eavesdropping
0:56:45 okay fine
0:56:48 I don't have any intention on lying to
0:56:50 you guys about it nope you did good fine
0:56:53 also Neil what Neil what it still feels
0:56:56 like you're undercutting me so let's do
0:56:58 I need to demonstrate this again what am
0:57:01 I undercutting you want Just Let It Go
0:57:03 just what I said Let It Go it wasn't
0:57:07 me saying somebody did something bad I
0:57:10 am just making a point so you don't need
0:57:12 to undercut I agree and I'm not
0:57:13 undercutting you I just thinking did a
0:57:15 good job
0:57:17 everybody should probably feed I'm gonna
0:57:19 give you a really quick tip
0:57:22 just give miles the last word miles
0:57:26 thank you you're welcome
0:57:30 Johnny puts a hand and just kind of
0:57:32 shoves me on to the next one
0:57:34 it has been
0:57:38 an interesting waking up to I did not
0:57:40 expect my sire to show up among other
0:57:42 things now
0:57:45 and I don't know how to make this better
0:57:48 it sounds like a [ __ ] situation now I
0:57:51 can tell you something
0:57:53 and it's going to be the good or bad I
0:57:55 don't know these people are going to die
0:57:58 so don't pick people you like
0:58:01 there's a lot of trash in New Haven feel
0:58:04 free
0:58:05 but there's not a choice in this
0:58:08 particular circumstances
0:58:11 and unfortunately it's going to get a
0:58:13 lot worse a lot sooner
0:58:16 and I don't want to be harsh and I don't
0:58:18 want to come off this way but things are
0:58:20 about to get
0:58:22 very bad yeah I know yeah
0:58:26 we need a bowl by the way
0:58:28 I'm sorry what as the good review uh
0:58:32 kind of chat about the bull situation it
0:58:35 takes kind of it takes some time to
0:58:37 figure that one out and the group you
0:58:41 kind of have your you know your reunion
0:58:42 your chat some of you go out hunting
0:58:44 we'll do some rolls for that uh but by
0:58:48 and large it's actually a pretty smooth
0:58:49 easy night I also at some point check on
0:58:54 that pink rhinestone beeper
0:58:57 tons of messages any from a number that
0:59:03 I'm looking for which number are you
0:59:05 looking for I'm looking for that number
0:59:06 that I think my daughter was calling me
0:59:08 from it's all from that number all from
0:59:10 that number you get a a message a call
0:59:14 hello hey I just want to let you know
0:59:17 they're apparently planning to move
0:59:19 against you when he hangs up I called
0:59:22 back hello when when the next couple of
0:59:26 nights okay do you have any way of
0:59:28 directing them to a particular area
0:59:30 to let them know hey look at the cool
0:59:32 information you found about where he's
0:59:34 going to be yeah I can do that great uh
0:59:37 I'll call you back I'm gonna hang out
0:59:38 okay hey uh miles yeah where do you want
0:59:43 to get ambushed by the set Heights if
0:59:44 you could pick a place
0:59:46 my house is lovely for us at Ambush this
0:59:50 time of year I don't but then they know
0:59:52 where you are in the woods it's not a
0:59:54 hard thing for me to find a new place to
0:59:56 live we also need to maybe pick a place
0:59:59 where it won't be an obvious trap
1:00:01 someplace that miles would conceivably
1:00:03 be yeah let me give me miles doesn't go
1:00:06 for enthusiastic walks in the woods no
1:00:09 clearly not last time he was in the
1:00:11 woods he got all huffy he's not wrong
1:00:14 though
1:00:15 Huffy seems a little extreme yeah it's a
1:00:18 bicycle as the night goes on you guys
1:00:22 are talking about stuff
1:00:23 um Johnny
1:00:24 has just been quiet the entire time and
1:00:28 has been pensively smoking through his
1:00:30 packs of cigarettes uh staring at this
1:00:33 little pink rhinestone Bieber and just
1:00:36 keeps on checking it and looking at it
1:00:38 and just getting like getting a darker
1:00:41 and darker expression on his face as the
1:00:43 night goes like this the past hours this
1:00:45 has been like this some point Johnny
