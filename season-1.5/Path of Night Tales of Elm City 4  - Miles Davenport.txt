0:00:24 [Music]
0:00:40 foreign
0:00:51 Davenport
0:00:53 after the events that took place the
0:00:56 last Elysium and the very near Praxis
0:00:59 attempt uh you have found yourself over
0:01:01 the past few weeks coordinating with
0:01:04 what resources remain to attempt to
0:01:06 maintain the Masquerade despite the
0:01:08 ridiculous behavior of this apparent uh
0:01:12 single Sabbat pack that is now operating
0:01:15 in the area this has come the form of
0:01:17 bribes to police this has come in the
0:01:19 form of media interventions this is all
0:01:23 all sorts of solutions have been applied
0:01:25 but it seems like it's becoming worse
0:01:27 and worse this pack is extremely
0:01:30 aggressive in terms of its ability to
0:01:33 undermine the Masquerade now that Upton
0:01:35 Rowlands is awake and in a better
0:01:39 position he has requested that you meet
0:01:41 him at the Connecticut Financial Center
0:01:43 in New Haven it's a building that's been
0:01:45 built within the last decade and it is
0:01:48 the tallest building and New Haven and
0:01:50 has like a nice view of the New Haven
0:01:54 when you arrive Servants of the prince
0:01:57 meet with you and your escort up for a
0:02:01 nice elevator ride when you come out it
0:02:03 is to a posh office that has a very nice
0:02:06 view of the city itself his grace is
0:02:10 present he seems to have a seat ready
0:02:12 for you he has already lit a cigar as
0:02:14 you kind of come close he stands up to
0:02:17 greet you the prince actually offers you
0:02:19 a handshake and speaks up miles uh
0:02:24 you've done some very good work in the
0:02:27 recent weeks regarding this threat
0:02:29 um but I think it's time we talk some
0:02:31 strategy someone why don't you have a
0:02:33 seat uh can I interest you in a cigar
0:02:35 yes thank you yogurt I can catch your
0:02:38 cigar that's it gives you the means with
0:02:40 which to light it so first and foremost
0:02:43 I wish to reward your hard work and he
0:02:47 opens up the side of his desk and
0:02:49 retrieves for you a very like nice
0:02:53 little Sandalwood box
0:02:55 and he sets it out for you
0:02:58 um that is for you uh very well earned
0:03:00 and
0:03:02 um I would like you to have it thank you
0:03:05 I will turn the box around and then open
0:03:09 it within it is a pin and on that pin
0:03:13 there's an iron circlet it is a venture
0:03:17 dignitas that is representative one's
0:03:20 dedication to the Clinton it's much
0:03:22 appreciated uh your grace and I will
0:03:24 make a show of putting it on like right
0:03:27 there and then you know putting in the
0:03:29 appropriate spot that's like a smug
0:03:31 Pride to him when you do it
0:03:33 now for the next uh order of business
0:03:37 uh
0:03:39 I wish for you to serve in an elevated
0:03:42 position within the domain of New Haven
0:03:45 um I am giving you the position of
0:03:47 sheriff
0:03:49 uh as of this night forward
0:03:51 what is to happen to Mr weathers all
0:03:54 right and you can return to the rest of
0:03:57 the rabble and they can spend their
0:04:00 nights doing whatever it is that they do
0:04:02 provided he Embraces the two children
0:04:06 that is expected of him of course but Mr
0:04:09 weathers was also bare in defending the
0:04:11 domain the night that the Praxis was
0:04:14 taking place that is very true uh miles
0:04:17 he was there and responsible for the
0:04:20 events that happened at the Elysium like
0:04:21 it was his duty to defend
0:04:25 he did help defend the Elysium he was
0:04:28 there
0:04:28 the truth of the matter is he is not
0:04:32 deserving of this title any further and
0:04:34 the reality is after everything then
0:04:36 happened so one has to pay the price
0:04:39 until it deciding that Mr weathers would
0:04:41 do so yes
0:04:44 and you
0:04:45 should take his place I've seen your
0:04:46 ability to coordinate of various Clans
0:04:51 if you can put that gamble to work you
0:04:52 should be able to organize just about
0:04:54 anyone
0:04:55 thank you your grace but I have being in
0:04:58 and around court and coordinations have
0:05:00 are
0:05:02 sometimes an impediment of me getting
0:05:04 things done for the domain miles this is
0:05:06 not
0:05:06 um a negotiation no you are the sheriff
0:05:11 and should you need time to accomplish
0:05:13 matters I have no doubt that you can
0:05:15 assign bully boys
0:05:17 to see to it that the work you need is
0:05:19 done
0:05:21 what about the other positions in the
0:05:23 domain
0:05:24 actually I was thinking that as my
0:05:25 Sheriff you and I might discuss it
0:05:28 let's continue forth then
0:05:31 in light of the reasons about attacks
0:05:34 um I am of the opinion that
0:05:38 uh
0:05:40 Mr John Reiss is needed by this city
0:05:44 it is my intention to
0:05:47 make a little bit of a show of some sort
0:05:49 of uh punishment for allowing things to
0:05:53 get as out of hand as they did but we
0:05:57 must be very careful about how we go to
0:05:59 do that he is a valued asset of the
0:06:01 domain
0:06:03 I cannot have him uh stressed
0:06:07 I think Mr Reiss needs to answer for a
0:06:10 few things first before we can come to
0:06:13 that I understand him being a valuable
0:06:15 asset to The Domain with the oncoming
0:06:17 Sabbat but
0:06:19 he needs to answer for some things
0:06:22 otherwise he's continued
0:06:24 presence here will be a problem
0:06:27 go on
0:06:28 well he was instrumental in removing
0:06:32 those that were trying to protect you
0:06:34 and quite possibly locating
0:06:36 your grace to be attacked for the Praxis
0:06:40 I had a conversation with Reiss
0:06:43 he informed me that he was not aware of
0:06:47 the extent to which
0:06:49 those plotting against me were in fact
0:06:52 plotting against me and when he found
0:06:55 out he subverted
0:06:57 their attempt and ensured that my own
0:07:01 life was kept intact
0:07:04 I in Georgia on life was kept intact but
0:07:07 he helped he was actually instrumental
0:07:09 and not in being a impediment to such
0:07:12 things
0:07:13 miles he and I are very old friends
0:07:17 yes but he's also not at the clan
0:07:20 this is true and he was instrumental in
0:07:22 putting not only you but my sire into
0:07:24 danger and I believe my sire helped you
0:07:27 get through that particular event
0:07:31 so we should proceed with caution when
0:07:32 it comes to Mr Reiss and I agree that we
0:07:35 should proceed with caution and we
0:07:38 should Levy some sort of punishment upon
0:07:40 him that makes him aware that we have
0:07:43 shown him Mercy in this instance
0:07:46 and
0:07:48 secure his Aid
0:07:50 for future actions taken against the
0:07:53 Sabbat we can bind him into a contract
0:07:56 a contract
0:07:58 I've talked a bit with my sir about this
0:08:00 and there's a couple things we can do to
0:08:02 ensure his continued
0:08:05 help to The Domain and the camera alone
0:08:07 as we go forward I should warn you that
0:08:10 Mr Reiss has a life Moon that I owe him
0:08:13 uh I do not know how much we will be
0:08:16 able to leverage such a thing against
0:08:18 him however something perhaps something
0:08:20 else can be arranged uh perhaps he can
0:08:23 in turn owe Boons perhaps we can impress
0:08:27 him for favors of Our Own
0:08:29 I feel like those things are quite
0:08:31 possible but we cannot restore his
0:08:33 position in the domain either in light
0:08:35 of everything that had happened who
0:08:37 would I make senatorial instead
0:08:39 I have a suggestion who is your
0:08:41 suggestion Elsa Linden the Viper is it
0:08:46 not best to keep a Viper close to you
0:08:48 if that's the case we should keep Reiss
0:08:50 right where he is but if your intention
0:08:52 is to prevent a Potential Threat to my
0:08:56 braxes from being Senator replacing with
0:08:59 us Linden does me very little good I
0:09:01 understand but Elsa Linden helps to
0:09:04 smooth things over where normally your
0:09:07 power and presence disturbs things
0:09:11 what uh insurances that we have that
0:09:16 empowering Elsa Linden at the detriment
0:09:18 of Reiss is going to provide us a
0:09:21 long-term Advantage Elsa Linden owes me
0:09:23 and my coteria lifeboon is this claimed
0:09:25 not yet
0:09:27 but will be soon enough if it is claimed
0:09:29 I believe that provides us the advantage
0:09:31 that we would need in the event she
0:09:33 attempts to turn on me being that my
0:09:35 enCoterie may die to save her life
0:09:38 yes they um odd Clan was here not Kevin
0:09:41 yes
0:09:42 uh tragic
0:09:45 yes
0:09:47 well let us
0:09:49 um
0:09:50 before we continue I do wish you to know
0:09:52 that your friend uh the mulcavian
0:09:57 um a sire who was a significant threat
0:10:02 to the domain for a Time
0:10:04 he was something of an awesome cultist
0:10:07 who had ties back to their stronghold
0:10:11 alamut
0:10:13 um
0:10:13 it would seem that despite his Heritage
0:10:18 um
0:10:19 your friend
0:10:21 proved to be a truly loyal servant of
0:10:24 the camera
0:10:25 yes
0:10:27 he has been very helpful to me and my
0:10:30 goals in aims which I've always been to
0:10:32 the Camarilla and this domain very good
0:10:35 no
0:10:37 I wish for you to see to a handful of
0:10:41 matters immediately as of uh tonight
0:10:45 becoming a sheriff of this domain uh
0:10:48 Arabella Rowlands is missing has been yes
0:10:53 I would like her collected her own life
0:10:56 intact
0:10:57 I have many questions from my wayward
0:10:59 child as to why it is that she would
0:11:01 betray her clan
0:11:04 I can see what I can do in addition to
0:11:07 this Mr zantosa must be found
0:11:12 the tramir required him for
0:11:14 experimentation very good but I am
0:11:18 loathe to hand over the zentosa to the
0:11:22 chamir why is that he's dangerous and
0:11:25 Powerful on his own before he gained on
0:11:28 life yes however there is no Clan but
0:11:32 suited to examining what it is that
0:11:36 makes this individual tick
0:11:38 in preparation for more direct conflict
0:11:41 with the Sabbat
0:11:43 I understand that in the premiere are
0:11:46 snakes and
0:11:48 untrustworthy I'm not a fool of miles
0:11:51 but what I will tell you
0:11:54 is that the premier have been
0:11:57 auckland's longest standing allies
0:12:00 and their thoughtmatological might
0:12:03 allows them to contend with the Sabbat
0:12:05 in ways that many of the Clans cannot
0:12:08 and I understand but I also need to
0:12:10 check because my sire also desired the
0:12:13 Sentosa
0:12:14 to an end he needed him alive and that
0:12:18 was the information that was given to me
0:12:20 regardless the xantosa needs to be found
0:12:23 and he needs to be contained
0:12:26 yes and I will tell you that uh I do
0:12:30 recommend you direct your side to speak
0:12:32 with me on this matter as uh while I do
0:12:36 respect his authority as an archon does
0:12:39 not supersede the will of a prince in
0:12:40 his domain no but you were there the
0:12:43 conversation present that he had asked
0:12:45 for him well that's what conversation
0:12:47 the one when the you and the archon and
0:12:52 Reiss all came to awaken myself and the
0:12:55 Brujah
0:12:57 yes of course
0:12:59 there was so many things going on I
0:13:01 understand that it got lost in the
0:13:02 shuffle I had a great deal to consider
0:13:04 and uh we'll say that uh while your
0:13:09 sires welcome to continue our working
0:13:13 relationship
0:13:15 um
0:13:16 the zantosa
0:13:19 must be provided to the premier
0:13:22 my domain needs it
0:13:23 what happens if it does not get the
0:13:26 Terminator don't get it then my domain
0:13:28 is left at a disadvantage in a war
0:13:30 against the Sabbat who are the tamiros
0:13:32 requesting such things
0:13:34 the New Haven Chantry so Reiss well
0:13:39 isary still in control of the Chantry
0:13:41 yes
0:13:43 very good
0:13:44 I will do my best
0:13:46 you will succeed and it points to that
0:13:49 pin on your chest have I failed yet
0:13:52 well I don't have the zentosa miles
0:13:54 let's not get ahead of ourselves well I
0:13:57 was a little busy that night
0:13:59 well perhaps but anyways
0:14:01 um
0:14:02 uh make the arrangements secure Santos a
0:14:06 secure Arabella Rowlands
0:14:08 and uh be sure to let weathers know he
0:14:12 has a I would say a week to pack up his
0:14:14 things
0:14:15 so I'm allowed to elevate those to the
0:14:18 positions I need as of right now uh yes
0:14:21 if you would like you can award him the
0:14:23 title of bully boy and he can serve you
0:14:25 but he needs to get his things out of
0:14:27 the office so the domain understands who
0:14:29 it is that serves as Sheriff of this
0:14:31 domain
0:14:32 without a bellagon we also never missing
0:14:35 a hobby currently too yes though
0:14:37 traditionally the hobby is determined by
0:14:39 the primagen council we usually have a
0:14:41 voice in such things though we do
0:14:43 we have a vote just as the rest of the
0:14:46 primogen do um
0:14:47 is there someone that you're
0:14:48 recommending
0:14:50 not at this time but uh of the people
0:14:53 that was helpful during the whole fight
0:14:55 over the domain uh
0:14:57 both fester and Jane were helpful
0:15:03 Jane uh uh I miles you do understand
0:15:08 that she is also Brujah yes yes but not
0:15:11 quite the same as the other group you
0:15:13 would have this domain converted into a
0:15:16 new Carthage or I'm not here to stop you
0:15:19 I have a tendency to believe to reward
0:15:21 those who do work for the domain
0:15:24 miles
0:15:25 reward those who stand above and deserve
0:15:29 such praise
0:15:30 if we were to reward everyone for doing
0:15:32 the basics of their duties
0:15:34 everyone would have uh be of great
0:15:38 standing and everyone would be equally
0:15:41 important to the domain it'd be nonsense
0:15:44 we're asking a lot of the Brujah right
0:15:45 now and while I don't necessarily reward
0:15:48 them for their loyalty to Shaw recently
0:15:50 he like rolls his eyes miles we're
0:15:53 asking that they Embrace children have
0:15:56 you seen how many they already are
0:15:57 this is nothing to them
0:16:00 to some of them
0:16:01 you know what you should do Sheriff
0:16:04 you could repopulate the local Gangrel
0:16:08 you're asking me to tell the Gangrel
0:16:10 to do things
0:16:12 I've seen you do it
0:16:14 that's a working relationship well work
0:16:17 it
0:16:19 I will see what I can do to convince
0:16:20 local Gangrel too
0:16:23 when I asked for these things you must
0:16:25 respond with confidence I am but
0:16:28 I tell you these things because not
0:16:30 everything can come to the degree which
0:16:33 you wish it sounds like you're
0:16:34 attempting to get me to catch my
0:16:35 expectations and frankly I will not see
0:16:39 these things done
0:16:41 they will be done
0:16:42 thank you
0:16:44 now
0:16:46 with that said
0:16:48 bear of the iron circlet
0:16:51 well Sheriff
0:16:53 if you have any questions you have my
0:16:55 undivided attention for the moment
0:16:57 what would you like to discuss
0:17:00 he like Puffs on the cigar I think at
0:17:02 this moment there's not much else you've
0:17:04 covered everything that the domain needs
0:17:06 at this point yes I tend to have a good
0:17:09 pulse from that sort of thing uh I will
0:17:12 come together with a plan for moving
0:17:14 forward with Reiss and what we should do
0:17:16 to
0:17:18 keep his friendship with the domain
0:17:20 in a positive light while showing our
0:17:22 displeasure at his actions excellent
0:17:24 give me a praise of um
0:17:26 any discussions that have regarding the
0:17:29 future of this domain from here on out I
0:17:31 intend to know everything
0:17:34 of course excellent I will go visit
0:17:38 Sheriff weathers and I will finish up
0:17:42 and talk with Elsa Linden
0:17:44 to get those things moving
0:17:46 wait what did we want from South London
0:17:49 to discuss the life boon with her yes
0:17:51 okay very well I will see you soon he uh
0:17:54 gives you a handshake and hey opens the
0:17:57 door his servants waiting there and they
0:18:00 will escort you uh downstairs and that
0:18:03 resolves your meeting with Prince Upton
0:18:06 Rowlands and the car kind of like work

0:18:29 H I can't just say dark purple not at
0:18:31 this point in our lives I mean if we're
0:18:33 keeping with a theme we've seen some
0:18:34 sort of weather thing like stormy Violet
0:18:37 Sunset violet
0:18:39 Violet so like a gray purple kind of
0:18:43 Sheen
0:18:44 yes a stormy Violet Lamborghini Diablo
0:18:49 the Diablo Waits this this is a good way
0:18:52 to relieve stress as we continue forward
0:18:54 with today you started up at purrs
0:18:57 and you Journey forth with it this I
0:18:59 feel better already I can feel my
0:19:01 Humanity restoring
0:19:03 I'm sorry headed we should probably
0:19:05 visit Mr weathers first
0:19:07 weathers is at Elysium currently
0:19:10 coordinating defenses against the Sabbat
0:19:12 yeah boy probably
0:19:15 feel like I should tell Johnny but maybe
0:19:17 I should just
0:19:19 get this over with and come to an
0:19:21 understanding with whether it's on my
0:19:22 own and not involve Johnny's
0:19:24 relationship and such things and also
0:19:27 with his Sabbat problems right now I
0:19:30 don't want to further make that an issue
0:19:33 so we will drive up to the Elysium have
0:19:37 my car parked and proceed inside
0:19:40 excellent your car is parked uh nice and
0:19:43 in view of everyone it's kind of like

0:19:49 pottering rain you kind of you know make
0:19:52 your way over with an umbrella head on
0:19:54 inside the Elysium itself is largely
0:19:57 empty no one is going out and enjoying
0:20:01 the company of other Kindred in light of
0:20:03 the Sabbat presence within the domain
0:20:05 you find yourself hiding to that little
0:20:08 office The Familiar office of Mr
0:20:10 weathers yeah weathers is there
0:20:14 he is accompanied uh it's him and he's
0:20:18 kind of hanging out with us like uh this

0:20:24 leather jacket with red tinted
0:20:26 sunglasses and a New York Yankees
0:20:28 baseball cap and the two of them are
0:20:32 kind of uh laughing about something
0:20:35 being a little bit of work buddies you
0:20:37 know what I mean they're kind of like
0:20:38 getting along pretty good and kind of
0:20:41 pause when they recognize you uh do you
0:20:44 have a like Kendra lore or politics

0:20:48 intelligence politics difficulty for

0:20:57 individual as the infamous archon killer
0:20:59 bee AKA archon Theo Bell I will walk in
0:21:03 to the edge of the office until they
0:21:06 look at me and then I will look I'll
0:21:08 come Bell
0:21:10 he kinda gives you a look that he
0:21:12 acknowledges that you're there
0:21:15 weathers turns his attention to what's
0:21:18 up miles
0:21:19 we need to discuss something
0:21:22 like some privacy that'd probably be
0:21:24 best
0:21:25 Arkham Bell kind of Mr Jacks uh that's
0:21:28 no problem I need to go check on a few
0:21:29 matters anyways and he turns and makes
0:21:33 his exit weathers invites you in closes
0:21:36 the door in the office
0:21:38 takes a seat
0:21:39 so what exactly is it
0:21:41 it's the prince handing out edicts
0:21:43 already
0:21:45 this is surprising I'm surprised it
0:21:47 lasted this long anything useful
0:21:50 depends on how you feel about it
0:21:53 all right what is one
0:21:55 he wants me to be Sheriff
0:21:57 come again you heard me at the you heard
0:22:01 me
0:22:03 his neck audibly cracks
0:22:06 yeah I guess I did hear you sorry I did
0:22:09 not mean to be offensive in that way but
0:22:11 I'm not prone to repeating myself either
0:22:16 so it's like that no I very much argued
0:22:19 for you to stay in your position and
0:22:21 what you just insisted and have you you
0:22:24 could imagine have you met him I didn't
0:22:26 have enough to wiggle out of it
0:22:28 so how do you want to proceed because I
0:22:30 very much like to have both your help
0:22:33 and for you of course without me
0:22:34 everything's going to go to [ __ ] and
0:22:36 you're going to look bad I want your
0:22:38 help because you're a good person and
0:22:39 you've helped us on numerous occasions
0:22:41 and I want to continue our relationship
0:22:43 to be good I am not the prince and you
0:22:47 know that
0:22:48 I owe you a boon Weathers a boon you
0:22:51 didn't necessarily need to do you didn't
0:22:53 necessarily even make happen but I did
0:22:55 you know that I'm fair about this stuff
0:23:01 I'm gonna have to think about it
0:23:03 you have some time unfortunately the
0:23:05 time is not a lot because the prince
0:23:06 gave you a week to remove your stuff as
0:23:10 he said I'll be packed up and not a year
0:23:11 in a day
0:23:13 that doesn't sound good
0:23:15 what other things are you considering
0:23:18 everything
0:23:19 I'd rather not see you leave I'd rather
0:23:22 not be reduced to some Lackey who's also
0:23:24 forced to mass Embrace but like you said
0:23:27 we know the prince
0:23:29 I don't think that edict came from him
0:23:31 and you know that edict didn't come from
0:23:33 him
0:23:33 yeah he didn't exactly say no to it if
0:23:36 he's the prince he can own what happens
0:23:37 in his domain yet again I know this
0:23:41 isn't the best circumstance no it's not
0:23:44 and I don't necessarily want to see a
0:23:46 mass Embrace of people to go off and die
0:23:48 either
0:23:49 I know that that's not what the Brujah
0:23:52 want done either The bruha Wanted Shaw
0:23:54 in church
0:23:55 which would have been also bad yeah I
0:23:58 guess
0:23:59 just
0:24:01 picking your poison at this point we're
0:24:04 working on managing that poison who's we
0:24:07 myself
0:24:08 I am also trying to get Elsa Linden and
0:24:12 Jane in positions to help
0:24:15 well I wish you the best of luck he
0:24:17 holds his hand out to give a shake I
0:24:18 don't want you to leave chef
0:24:21 you're the sheriff
0:24:23 I need your help and I said I'll think
0:24:25 about it what can I do to help
0:24:29 drag my hand say goodbye stand him away
0:24:32 for a while very good
0:24:34 you have my number
0:24:35 anything you need
0:24:37 it kind of gives you a handshake and he
0:24:40 starts kind of arranging his stuff
0:24:43 he doesn't really seem to kind of waste
0:24:44 any time about it you know he just kind
0:24:46 of moves to get it resolved right then
0:24:48 and there
0:24:49 over the course of about 20 minutes he
0:24:52 gets most of things packed Jane appears
0:24:53 she kind of gives you a curtain odd and
0:24:56 she goes about loading things into the
0:24:58 couple boxes that she brought with her
0:25:00 are you also leaving Jane I don't know
0:25:03 what a weather say whether is thinking
0:25:05 about it and I'm thinking about it
0:25:07 she kind of like punches your shoulder
0:25:10 and I like hard enough to like hurt you
0:25:12 but like way [ __ ] harder than like
0:25:16 and like like people usually give on
0:25:19 those light traps not like intentionally
0:25:21 just right you know and the two of them
0:25:24 make their way out of Elysium uh within
0:25:27 moments the handful of like [ __ ]
0:25:30 toriador that are there already kind of
0:25:32 gossiping and giggling
0:25:34 so now I look upon this scuffed small
0:25:37 office that is apparently mine no
0:25:40 windows
0:25:43 how did he get himself in this position
0:25:46 I need a better office he heads out you
0:25:48 kind of hear like murmurings about did
0:25:51 he give me any of the information he was
0:25:52 using to coordinate or did he leave me
0:25:54 an alert did not give you anything he
0:25:58 just left
0:26:01 and just leave it alone that's why we're
0:26:04 gonna kind of make little quips
0:26:06 about the field Sheriff
0:26:09 formerly the house Sheriff
0:26:12 that is not cool no it's awful like it's
0:26:15 like that awful late 90s
0:26:17 hmm sense of humor that's just like not
0:26:21 really okay yeah they're that
0:26:24 I was counting on them to keep their
0:26:28 infrastructure
0:26:30 I will
0:26:32 [ __ ]
0:26:34 I call Marcos
0:26:36 yes Marcos good news what is the good

0:27:39 of that for you thank you Marcus so
0:27:42 there you are I'm in your office being
0:27:44 that I just passed off almost all my
0:27:46 responsibilities to my goal yeah totally
0:27:48 yep
0:27:49 look he'll find somebody to help me do
0:27:51 that I am not equipped for this kind of
0:27:53 stuff
0:27:55 that is why I have a goal
0:28:01 [Music]
0:28:04 I'm gonna go visit Elsa Linden at this
0:28:06 point you you uh drive to a Victorian
0:28:11 styled house that has
0:28:13 beautiful painting on it like like you
0:28:17 know if you know those Victorian style
0:28:18 houses that have like almost like like a
0:28:21 pink paint and then like a purple or a
0:28:23 green and this and that and just this
0:28:25 really like intricately done house she
0:28:28 has that her domain is very soothing you
0:28:31 arrive does she have any known ghouls or
0:28:34 anything working for yes she does I
0:28:35 assumed her so I will have them park my
0:28:38 car for me and announce myself to her
0:28:40 and hopefully we can hopefully she will
0:28:42 meet with me the retainers uh me with
0:28:44 you they actually kind of go to turn you
0:28:46 away at first but a way of your position
0:28:49 to sheriff they end up actually inviting
0:28:50 you in oh that was quick all right
0:28:54 coming downstairs
0:28:55 dressed in I want to say she's like kind
0:28:58 of quote unquote dressed down a very
0:29:02 nice like velvety clothing she's all of
0:29:05 her makeup is on her earrings are on
0:29:07 she's wearing some jewelry and she is uh
0:29:11 carrying with her this like little glass
0:29:14 of what could be wine if she was a mere
0:29:17 mortal I think she used Celerity to get
0:29:20 ready
0:29:23 ah that is something she's capable of
0:29:24 all right anyways
0:29:27 she's very well put together for a
0:29:29 surprise visit
0:29:30 I suppose congratulations are an order
0:29:32 Sheriff thank you though
0:29:35 I think the work has just begun I'm not
0:29:38 necessarily happy about how this is
0:29:39 going out why is that sheriff weathers
0:29:42 was helpful in keeping this domain
0:29:44 before even if he was sometimes a social
0:29:47 liability
0:29:49 I think you pretty well summed up my
0:29:51 opinion of that
0:29:52 he did help unfortunately his
0:29:54 involvement was part of what gave Shaw a
0:29:57 power yes which we've all seen neatly to
0:30:00 ending
0:30:01 why are you here because it is time for
0:30:04 us to discuss moving forward with this
0:30:06 domain oh
0:30:09 you don't possibly mean move forward as
0:30:13 in preparations for the Sabbat Invasion
0:30:16 that's part of it but in a different
0:30:19 circumstance that's not necessarily your
0:30:22 particular field of expertise no but it
0:30:25 is something that I am curious about
0:30:27 you see I have contacts outside of this
0:30:30 region from here to Los Angeles and they
0:30:34 have informed me that the Sabbat is
0:30:38 intending a crusade that starts off in
0:30:42 Miami and is intended to sweep up the
0:30:45 East Coast
0:30:47 and because of this archons have been
0:30:50 more active in the area making
0:30:52 preparations
0:30:53 [Music]
0:30:54 but I'm noticing that the only reason
0:30:57 that I know this is because I sought the
0:31:00 information myself how much of the
0:31:02 domain is aware
0:31:04 that the sabbatan tends to sack this
0:31:07 domain all of the leadership
0:31:09 let's see which I'm hoping to add you to
0:31:12 it
0:31:13 there are things that I will require
0:31:14 there are things I will require
0:31:17 since Romeo's final death I find myself
0:31:21 wishing to receive the right of progeny
0:31:24 I believe that could be arranged good I
0:31:26 would like two children and in
0:31:30 accelerated accounting their accounting
0:31:33 will conclude when I say that it
0:31:35 concludes
0:31:36 not when his grace does
0:31:39 I believe these are things that we can
0:31:41 make happen
0:31:43 but you haven't asked me what I'm
0:31:44 looking for
0:31:46 you're asking me to help this city
0:31:48 reorganize and survive what's coming and
0:31:51 if we are to do that I intend to have
0:31:54 every reason I can find to stay and not
0:31:58 simply leave to somewhere that isn't
0:32:00 going to be under the duress of
0:32:03 constants about attack this is both my
0:32:05 goal and my charge to keep this free of
0:32:08 Sabbat and I've been doing work to do
0:32:11 this but
0:32:12 Rola needs assurances too because he is
0:32:16 not pleased with my thought so I am
0:32:19 looking to collect or not collect but
0:32:21 get the Boon for saving your life
0:32:24 I believe I owe that Boon to a dead man
0:32:26 who was part of my cotary
0:32:28 that doesn't entitle you to his things
0:32:30 no it doesn't but you're still here
0:32:33 because of him and it seems dishonorable
0:32:36 to do such things what would be
0:32:38 dishonorable is to attempt to utilize
0:32:40 his sacrifice for political gain
0:32:43 he's also not dead
0:32:45 excuse me I'm fairly sure he's not dead
0:32:50 then find him and tell him to collect it
0:32:53 until then I need your assurances and
0:32:55 then I will move it to him
0:32:57 I will hold it in place I see no reason
0:33:00 to do that you have no leverage on me
0:33:01 you need me far more than I need you
0:33:04 so you're just going to operate like
0:33:06 this I'm going to pay very close
0:33:09 attention to whether or not I give a
0:33:12 life Boon to someone that Upton rolands
0:33:15 has sway over
0:33:17 Upton Rowlands has sway over me because
0:33:20 currently I've been instructed to keep
0:33:22 him that way that is simply the reason
0:33:25 why giving you a bonus giving him a boon
0:33:29 it would not when in reality I could
0:33:30 simply wait for the malkavian kneel to
0:33:35 come and collect what he has earned
0:33:36 himself so here what about this and I
0:33:40 know it's not common we're talking about
0:33:42 good faith good faith is always common
0:33:44 in the beginning until someone makes
0:33:47 agreements in good faith but then you
0:33:49 become an elder and realize that that's
0:33:51 always destined to fail so I have a
0:33:53 counteroffer I'm listening if Upton
0:33:56 Rowlands gives me whatever position I
0:33:58 want if I want one and in exchange I
0:34:02 don't warn the domain that this savat
0:34:05 pack is merely the beginning and there
0:34:07 is a massive Crusade underway
0:34:10 you see the Brujah are upset that their
0:34:14 children will be sent off to war when
0:34:16 they're forced to mass Embrace but it's
0:34:18 so much worse than that the child are
0:34:20 directly father there is no way any of
0:34:22 them is around surviving
0:34:24 some May
0:34:26 but that doesn't help anything and not
0:34:27 no this is not a conversation for your
0:34:29 naivete they are going to die so I'm
0:34:33 going to withhold that life poon until
0:34:36 Neil is ready to collect it and in the
0:34:38 meantime you will have the ability to
0:34:40 inform Upton rolands that I will help in
0:34:43 good faith
0:34:44 we can keep proceeding this way or we
0:34:46 can go another way or just the other way
0:34:48 you're thinking of
0:34:50 give me the lifeboon
0:34:52 you have to have more than that we know
0:34:55 other things too I'm aware of your
0:34:59 circumstances that have led to you being
0:35:01 here and the fact that the Sabbat packs
0:35:03 are concerned and that you want to stay
0:35:06 in this domain otherwise you would have
0:35:08 already left
0:35:11 miles
0:35:12 so stop pushing me around like I don't
0:35:15 know any better is your plan to squeeze
0:35:17 me for a Lifeboat in exchange for
0:35:18 protection from the Sabbat no I'm
0:35:21 reminding your plan you do not have the
0:35:23 right to remind me of anything I'm
0:35:27 reminding you that me and my team saved
0:35:29 you and you're deciding to do this to
0:35:32 squeeze me squeeze you yes I'm looking
0:35:36 to try to help this in this domain do I
0:35:38 owe you me giving you a life one doesn't
0:35:40 help the domain it satisfies up and
0:35:42 Rowlands ego and I don't feel the need
0:35:43 to do that
0:35:45 I'm not his cat's paw you are
0:35:48 that is a you problem miles I'm aware of
0:35:51 my problems this is a discussion between
0:35:54 the two then do not paint some
0:35:56 ridiculous picture that me refusing to
0:35:59 placate Upton Rowlands is somehow a
0:36:01 betrayal to this domain it's a betrayal
0:36:04 to me
0:36:05 regardless of the circumstances and he
0:36:08 may or may not be alive I like to
0:36:10 believe that he's alive we still went
0:36:12 out of the line to help you I distinctly
0:36:16 recall having helped you in the past as
0:36:17 well and we traded wounds at that time
0:36:20 for that to happen and we are on good
0:36:22 standings and I want to continue our
0:36:24 good standing and the way that we should
0:36:25 continue our good standings I should
0:36:27 give you a life Moon that you yourself
0:36:29 acknowledged Neil earned
0:36:31 I will give it to Neil you will give it
0:36:34 to me and why shouldn't I simply be the
0:36:35 one to give it to Neil because I want to
0:36:37 move things forward in this domain and
0:36:38 the prince needs help and you know he
0:36:42 needs help no the prince needs to not be
0:36:44 Prince and you know that
0:36:47 I cannot comment on that one way or
0:36:49 another I know you can't just like if
0:36:51 Upton Rowlands was attempt to abuse the
0:36:53 Boon you wouldn't be able to come into
0:36:54 them either so I will hold on to my Boon
0:36:57 I would if you have another offer I will
0:36:59 hear it but if not let us find a
0:37:02 compromise then and not one where you're
0:37:05 pushing me because you know that you can
0:37:08 then what is your offer miles
0:37:10 work with me I will work with rolands to
0:37:14 accept uh for now but I need your help
0:37:16 managing both him and the domain what
0:37:19 are you asking of me specifically don't
0:37:21 give me the Bono hold it for Neil then
0:37:23 yes and I will convince Upton that it is
0:37:26 happening and you will register it for
0:37:28 Neil then you you want me to what is it
0:37:32 hard to register a lifeboon with a dead
0:37:33 man then she wanted log to Neil that's
0:37:36 fair I can agree to that as soon as we
0:37:39 get a new hobby in place yes of course
0:37:41 but I was hoping you would be sent a
0:37:43 show
0:37:46 and Reiss race is out for now not dead
0:37:50 unfortunately and unfortunately still
0:37:52 part of the domain but will be handled I
0:37:55 will serve in this position of San
0:37:57 Angelo for the duration of John Reiss's
0:38:01 absence however many weeks that is
0:38:03 before often rewards in the position
0:38:04 again I'm going to
0:38:07 I am going to be letting out punishment
0:38:10 with some help with the ventru in
0:38:12 regards to Reiss
0:38:13 okay but I will if that does not go the
0:38:17 way I plan I will let you know or set up
0:38:20 I would love for the punishment of John
0:38:22 Reiss to be made a public matter so that
0:38:24 I can watch
0:38:26 because regardless of how that ends it
0:38:28 will uh make for an eventful evening I
0:38:32 will see what I can do I would also
0:38:34 enjoy that
0:38:36 kind of beams with this like perfect
0:38:38 disarming smile excellent we have an
0:38:41 agreement

0:38:48 kind of like gestures these bottles I
0:38:50 have no indication as to whether or not

0:38:58 I don't mind I'm going to enjoy my
0:39:01 drinks for the evening and I wish you a
0:39:05 farewell

0:39:08 all these circumstances I've genuinely

0:39:18 things
