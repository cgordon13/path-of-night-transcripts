0:00:55 hear the Ravens cry
0:00:57 the Stillness of the wind Rising hard on
0:00:59 the street the towers hide the darkness
0:01:01 of the day when the sombra's dreams come
0:01:03 true on the day when the moon runs as
0:01:05 blood and the sun rises black in the sky
0:01:08 that is the day of the Damned or Kane's
0:01:10 children will rise again and the world
0:01:13 will turn cold and unclean things will
0:01:15 boil up from the ground and great storms
0:01:17 Will Roll lightning will light fires
0:01:19 animals will fester and their bodies
0:01:21 Twisted will fall so too will grant
0:01:24 sires will rise from the ground they
0:01:27 will break their fast on the first part
0:01:29 of us they will consume us whole on the
0:01:31 second day Cain will return and call his
0:01:34 children to the meeting place
0:01:37 Neil you must wake wake Neil you feel a
0:01:42 hand shake you and you come out of this
0:01:45 days that you'd found yourself in again
0:01:48 around you you see Baghdad uh you
0:01:53 actually have a very beautiful view that
0:01:54 you kind of quickly recall that you and
0:01:58 Nora have been hiding in Baghdad Tower
0:02:02 which is a place with again an excellent
0:02:04 View and there is an observatory there
0:02:07 that she has been using in an attempt to
0:02:11 communicate with the ladder of Heaven
0:02:13 for weeks now you've been working on
0:02:16 this matter regarding something called
0:02:19 The Herald
0:02:20 Herald of Hakeem
0:02:22 she hasn't really explained very much
0:02:23 about it but you have been taking
0:02:28 probably more Khalif now than you've
0:02:30 ever had throughout your own life she
0:02:33 keeps meeting with other members of her
0:02:35 clan who all seem to have this very
0:02:37 close interest in you but they
0:02:39 themselves come across as conspirators
0:02:42 who are afraid of the city that they're
0:02:45 in
0:02:46 so again it is you and her and you
0:02:50 finding yourself having spouted strange
0:02:53 words
0:02:55 um what sorry I'm having trouble
0:02:57 focusing what were we talking about
0:02:59 beloved
0:03:01 Neo
0:03:03 I do not know the extent to what I can
0:03:05 share with you
0:03:07 but I will try to make you understand
0:03:10 okay
0:03:11 you climbed the ladder of heaven and saw
0:03:15 a dark cloud that draws near to the
0:03:19 heart of my clan
0:03:21 a handful of us
0:03:23 received a vision there must be a Schism
0:03:26 there must be a Schism two paths
0:03:29 but we do not know why we do not know
0:03:31 why the heart of our clan must be cut
0:03:34 into but in my vision I saw you
0:03:40 Schism sounds familiar from when I
0:03:44 climbed back at home the one time I was
0:03:47 able
0:03:50 um
0:03:51 it's it's been harder
0:03:54 harder to turn things off whenever I
0:03:57 look
0:03:58 there is a man that I aim to meet
0:04:00 tonight and he is
0:04:03 during my time as Fida in he had studied
0:04:07 alongside me with his preference
0:04:11 the history is that he has drawn to are
0:04:14 focused on naughtism
0:04:17 the the old Tales of Cain and his
0:04:22 mistress Zilla
0:04:24 for him
0:04:25 I think I have a Xerox or some of that
0:04:27 it would seem that there are many who
0:04:29 seek these words
0:04:31 signs
0:04:33 um premonitions of dark times have
0:04:35 become quite frequent and jubair
0:04:38 believes that some of the things that
0:04:41 you are experiencing are tied to what is
0:04:46 known as gehenna I I didn't think it was
0:04:50 real I just assumed that was the end
0:04:53 times are I mean that's it's a metaphor
0:04:56 I thought I do not know if this is real
0:05:00 but what I do know is that something is
0:05:02 happening to the get of Cain
0:05:05 or whatever it is
0:05:07 has consequences for the children of
0:05:10 Hakeem as well
0:05:12 and I need your help to find out what
0:05:14 that is
0:05:15 and I have meddled in the Jihad of New
0:05:18 England trying to see if you can provide
0:05:21 any answers but so far
0:05:24 your Visions have yielded
0:05:26 strange signs that I do not understand
0:05:30 Neil Karo runs his hands through his
0:05:32 hair and sort of ducks his head a little
0:05:34 bit just seems embarrassed like no he's
0:05:38 never really as helpful as he hopes he
0:05:40 could be and even in front of Nara seems
0:05:43 kind of disappointed that he in himself
0:05:45 that he's not more helpful but doesn't
0:05:48 have any answers so doesn't really say
0:05:49 anything
0:05:50 for example
0:05:54 um do you remember anything of The
0:05:55 Herald
0:05:58 I
0:06:00 I don't know I I remember
0:06:03 I remember looking to the heavens on New
0:06:06 Year's Eve
0:06:08 seeing seeing so many things coming
0:06:12 and the the
0:06:14 Scions the many-faced demon the
0:06:18 baleful eye Watching Over Us the coming
0:06:20 storm I remember I mean some of the
0:06:23 things I saw have already happened
0:06:25 at the end of it though I remember it
0:06:27 just this hand
0:06:30 I don't know if it's if it's the herald
0:06:32 I just I I couldn't stop seeing it in a
0:06:35 manner in which I could never
0:06:37 not do before do you remember anything
0:06:40 about this hand small it's a child's
0:06:43 hand rising out of a tomb
0:06:46 blackened almost like it was charred or
0:06:49 I couldn't stop seeing it I saw it
0:06:51 coming out of everywhere and anything
0:06:53 that looked like a like a cave or a tomb
0:06:55 or a or just a small dark opening just
0:06:58 reaching out
0:07:00 so that's I couldn't stop seeing it I
0:07:04 didn't have any context after that
0:07:06 I'm sorry
0:07:07 you have nothing to regret
0:07:09 I'm not sure if the answers even exist
0:07:14 for all I know we are
0:07:16 chasing signs that don't lead anywhere
0:07:21 that's um
0:07:22 yeah that's pretty standard
0:07:25 that's it in my experience it's
0:07:28 everything leads to something but it's
0:07:30 it's it's hard to
0:07:31 but
0:07:33 when you have a box full of a thousand
0:07:35 puzzles and and all its separate pieces
0:07:37 it sometimes it's difficult to put all
0:07:40 those pieces together into a picture
0:07:42 that makes sense
0:07:43 yes yes I suppose that is true she kind
0:07:47 of scoots over next to you and she's got
0:07:49 like those long
0:07:51 tanned legs and a little silk robe that
0:07:54 she wears kind of like falls down her
0:07:57 Curves in just the right way and she
0:07:59 offers a still more Kali flighting it
0:08:03 for you and then passing it your way
0:08:06 you
0:08:09 you smoke if she gives it to me I I take
0:08:12 it it's hard to say no
0:08:14 she gives you even more Khalif and
0:08:18 sensing something she Rises to her feet
0:08:21 and heads off to a door that seems to
0:08:24 have been uh like barricaded like she
0:08:26 was trying to secure it from other
0:08:28 people interrupting you maybe and she
0:08:31 kind of moves the chair and and the
0:08:34 debris out of the way and when she opens
0:08:36 the door there is a young man with kind
0:08:40 of a scraggly belongish beard
0:08:42 he's kind of wearing like olive drab
0:08:45 kind of color clothes and some jeans and
0:08:48 he has a backpack on him he slips in and
0:08:51 he greets the both of you and uh
0:08:54 actually approaches you and and he's
0:08:56 like uh hello it's very good to meet you
0:08:58 my name is jubair and I am here help
0:09:00 understand the visions that you were
0:09:01 having Nara seems to kind of like get in
0:09:04 the way and she's like slow slow down he
0:09:06 has he is just undergoing a vision and
0:09:10 and we have to we have to pace this or
0:09:13 we can hurt him and jubai is like that's
0:09:15 very good all I want to do is introduce
0:09:17 myself and he kind of cuts around her
0:09:18 and is like hello your Neil of the
0:09:23 malkavians and I am jubair of the
0:09:26 children of Hakeem I am a vizier and I
0:09:29 am going to help you understand the
0:09:31 strange visions that you are having
0:09:32 because I believe that these visions
0:09:34 that you're having are tied directly to
0:09:35 the book of Nod and together we are
0:09:38 going to unravel his secrets and use
0:09:40 what we find to
0:09:43 save Baghdad and many other places from
0:09:47 ancient evils that would rise up and
0:09:49 consumer all of the get of Cain and
0:09:51 innocent people in the way it's wake
0:09:53 Neil having just done more Khalif 30
0:09:57 seconds before the sky walked in the
0:09:59 room just looks at him nods very
0:10:02 seriously
0:10:04 could could you do that again I I
0:10:06 stopped paying attention I'm sorry no
0:10:09 it's okay Mr Neil I am Jew buyer and I
0:10:12 am here to help you understand
0:10:13 everything that you're going through and
0:10:15 together we will solve this mystery and
0:10:17 prevent gehenna and all of the get of
0:10:20 Cain and the children of Hakeem will be
0:10:22 grateful to us so uh while I understand
0:10:25 you are very high right now I just need
0:10:28 a moment of your time and why don't we
0:10:32 start with some very simple conversation
0:10:33 uh Mr Neil what is it that you do uh
0:10:37 where are you from who are your friends
0:10:38 what do you like
0:10:40 and she like shoves him like away from
0:10:43 you and he's he seems to be having a
0:10:44 very very hard time not just bombarding
0:10:47 you with questions and Intrigue and all
0:10:51 these like little Curiosities that he
0:10:52 has regarding you Neil sort of looks at
0:10:55 him looks kind of confused between him
0:10:58 and Nara scratches the side of his face
0:11:01 um
0:11:02 I'm sorry all you want from me is
0:11:04 infinity
0:11:06 well I I like to think that all we want
0:11:09 ultimately is infinity you said a moment
0:11:12 of time but time is such a weird concept
0:11:15 it's so fluid Infinity moments in every
0:11:18 second
0:11:19 just
0:11:22 eternally approaching an event horizon
0:11:25 that will never come well in truth time
0:11:27 is merely a matter of perspective but it
0:11:29 is true I seek your perspective and if
0:11:32 your perspective is out of the infinite
0:11:33 and that is what I seek indeed and he
0:11:36 just sits down across from you and he
0:11:38 like takes your joint and he takes like
0:11:42 a like a heavy hit and then passes it
0:11:45 right back so my friend tell me about
0:11:47 your Infinity
0:11:50 I'm Neil hi Neil
0:11:52 um
0:11:53 where do you want me to begin
0:11:55 what was your favorite day my favorite
0:11:59 day well you couldn't begin there the
0:12:02 most auspicious day of my life was July
0:12:04 20th 1969.
0:12:06 and Neil just goes dead and white
0:12:07 doesn't explain anymore
0:12:09 oh it's very interesting what is the day
0:12:12 that you brushed with the secrets of not
0:12:15 when did I go to the copy machine
0:12:18 yes
0:12:19 I don't remember it was a few weeks
0:12:22 after January 1st 1999. tell me about
0:12:26 your adventures with the copy machine
0:12:27 and would that do that I'm having
0:12:29 trouble remembering where we got it or
0:12:32 why
0:12:33 did that come from the Sentosa I don't
0:12:36 know I don't remember like Neil's
0:12:38 scratching his head like trying to piece
0:12:40 all the pieces of where things came from
0:12:41 together where are you getting to know
0:12:43 xanthosa Mr camarilla oh it's okay
0:12:47 um my code remake killed him
0:12:50 well that's good but then he got better
0:12:52 that's not good and then he escaped
0:12:54 because they didn't listen to me who
0:12:57 didn't listen to you they didn't stop
0:13:00 the pipes up it takes your joint again
0:13:02 and takes another hit they didn't stop
0:13:03 the pipes okay you need to stop her up
0:13:07 the pipes where did you get the copy of
0:13:08 the book of not what pages did you have
0:13:10 did you read them what were your
0:13:12 thoughts and he'll keep scratching his
0:13:14 head for a minute takes the joint back
0:13:16 and and takes another hit
0:13:19 um the sun
0:13:20 what's the Sentosa was it maybe it was
0:13:23 Shaw
0:13:24 this is xantosa veto he
0:13:29 he had it he had fragments of of this
0:13:32 heretical text we were going to use it
0:13:36 to he was sending it to a member of the
0:13:38 domain we were going to use it to to
0:13:40 bury that member of the domain but
0:13:43 the Santos got away I didn't really have
0:13:45 a chance to read very much of it we were
0:13:48 busy that night we were very busy that
0:13:50 night oh my friend time is infinite it's
0:13:53 true you should have had every
0:13:55 opportunity to read it perhaps that is
0:13:57 why we are here now confused and missing
0:14:00 important pieces because the pieces have
0:14:03 already been laid out for you I was more
0:14:05 preoccupied with the coup and the Lupine
0:14:08 Jihad exists to Blind negative to the
0:14:12 truth of the world my friend it is all
0:14:15 manipulations
0:14:17 okay
0:14:18 I have uh I have procured information
0:14:21 from a contact
0:14:23 and it is
0:14:26 interesting news if I don't say so
0:14:28 myself
0:14:29 show it for you and uh I wish to know
0:14:33 what it is that you think what kind of
0:14:36 starts going through his backpack and he
0:14:38 starts like taking out like his own
0:14:40 xeroxes and like notes and all of these
0:14:43 things what what I think
0:14:46 I am I'm just I'm just kneelite but it
0:14:50 is you who saw the herald yes
0:14:52 I guess so it's very important he sort
0:14:55 of like looks over at Nara for
0:14:56 reassurance she's kind of giving him
0:14:59 weird looks but then she she seemingly
0:15:01 makes a point of giving you a confident
0:15:02 nod as soon as he sees her he like
0:15:04 relaxes a little bit more he uh clears
0:15:07 his throat um
0:15:08 uh Mark these signs they are coming
0:15:11 gehenna will be on earth Mark the shadow
0:15:14 Which flies mock the dragon which Rises
0:15:17 Mark the darkness which moves Mark the
0:15:21 shadow of the Moon Mark the angel that
0:15:23 dies Mark the maiden Who Weeps Mark the
0:15:27 children embraced Mark The clanless Who
0:15:30 Run
0:15:31 we descend that knees are the signs of
0:15:34 gehenna and supposedly more and more
0:15:39 proof of it coming appears every night
0:15:41 however it seems that not everyone can
0:15:44 seem to identify what these signs
0:15:46 actually are or whether or not they are
0:15:48 even appearing
0:15:50 what you you want me to try
0:15:54 yes
0:15:56 um I'll have a vision do it he like
0:15:58 pokes you have a vision and like he kind
0:16:01 of like repeats himself and then pokes
0:16:03 you in the exact same way thinking that
0:16:04 maybe like he did it wrong the first
0:16:06 time Neil's a people pleaser and he
0:16:08 wants to try to do what this guy wants
0:16:11 so he'll kind of like brush him off and
0:16:14 walk out to the window to walk over to
0:16:16 the window you said this was an
0:16:18 observatory right and just you know how
0:16:20 we're in the middle of the city how
0:16:22 clear is this guy very clear despite how
0:16:26 much light pollution you would expect
0:16:29 there to be and actually seems like you
0:16:31 can still see a great deal of the Stars
0:16:33 much the same way that he did when he
0:16:37 was in New Haven a couple months ago
0:16:39 Neil sort of plants his bare feet on the
0:16:43 stone of the floor leans out the window
0:16:46 maybe a little precariously and opens
0:16:49 his eyes up and looks up at the stars
0:16:51 to the other people in the room let's
0:16:53 ask it again ask me what you want to
0:16:55 know again we want to know what the
0:16:59 signs of gehenna have to do with the
0:17:02 herald and and uh
0:17:05 one question at a time
0:17:09 now that he's in this like weird
0:17:11 position he seems a little bit more
0:17:13 confident confident a little bit more
0:17:15 sure of not sure of what he's doing but
0:17:17 in that same way that Neil gets very
0:17:19 focused on stuff sometimes gets very
0:17:22 focused on the task at hand and looking
0:17:25 into the chaos of this mattering of
0:17:27 stars across the sky tries his best to
0:17:30 see something
0:17:31 Nara speaks up
0:17:33 The Herald The Herald must be the first
0:17:35 question that we always ask
0:17:37 what is the Herald's name
0:17:42 hyperlaced with Khalif to a dangerous
0:17:45 degree Neil leans out the window to get
0:17:49 the best view of the Stars he can opens
0:17:52 his eyes they go full black widening to
0:17:56 the point where he loses his sclera
0:17:57 again
0:17:58 what is the name of the herald who comes
0:18:01 let's pause here one second
0:18:05 Neil as you ask that question you feel a
0:18:09 cold hand grip you by your throat
0:18:13 your mind starts to drift as though this
0:18:15 is some sort of vision you're having or
0:18:18 you then quickly realize that perched
0:18:20 against the outside of this makeshift
0:18:23 Haven you have there is someone who has
0:18:25 been lurking and watching you from
0:18:27 outside the window and with his hand
0:18:29 choking against your throat he whispers
0:18:33 to you
0:18:34 his name is urshulky
0:18:39 um
0:18:40 it is then
0:18:42 that you can feel the terror of your
0:18:45 companions behind you as they also make
0:18:48 a realization
0:18:50 from here I need initiative Lord Jesus
0:19:00 I don't suppose I'm not not high enough
0:19:02 to
0:19:03 spend blood you can spend blood all
0:19:05 right well I can spend one because I'm
0:19:07 gen 13. by the way they got me so hopped
0:19:09 up I'm assuming I'm a full pool more
0:19:11 like down a couple for doing Magics oh
0:19:14 you're out of my studio penalty it was
0:19:15 treated like a one penalty no I mean
0:19:17 like full blood pool oh yeah you're
0:19:19 totally a football yeah I assume they've
0:19:20 been just yeah doping the [ __ ] out of me
0:19:22 yeah they have been pumping you full of
0:19:24 of all sorts of [ __ ] for weeks and weeks
0:19:30 after spending one blood for decks I'm
0:19:33 at an inish 12 unless you want to do
0:19:35 minus two for the Anish as well then I
0:19:37 am at a 12. okay Nar is that a 15 shoe
0:19:41 by year is that a 12
0:19:43 um going on a
0:19:45 is the mysterious attacker going on B is
0:19:50 Nara going on C is Neil going on D is
0:19:54 jubair oh okay
0:19:57 with his action he does two things
0:20:00 holding in your grasp he simply holds
0:20:03 you and there is no visible consequence
0:20:05 of him doing that then he tilts your
0:20:08 head to the side and spits some sort of
0:20:11 fluid from his mouth directly at Nara
0:20:17 uh he hits now with three successes when
0:20:20 it connects you can hear this sizzling
0:20:23 sound and she screams in pain as this
0:20:27 acid strikes true and burns her
0:20:30 no no no no no please just don't don't
0:20:34 hurt them there will be no interference
0:20:36 for the rise of the herald not from you
0:20:39 not from them it is meant to be Nora
0:20:43 gestures out with her hands
0:20:47 with your head parking outside you can
0:20:49 feel a sudden shift in the humidity in
0:20:51 the air outside and there is a streak of
0:20:55 lightning that rains down from what is
0:20:58 this sudden storm
0:21:00 very quickly seemingly so fast he can
0:21:03 evade lightning the person that has come
0:21:06 for you Dodges out of the way but
0:21:08 releases you from his grip and
0:21:10 disappears in that window when you as
0:21:13 you stumble back away from the lightning
0:21:14 you're certain he's still out there but
0:21:16 he's simply out of view at the moment
0:21:17 Neil is your action Nara is like
0:21:20 standing beside you with like hands up
0:21:21 having just called lightning against him
0:21:24 where do we go what do we do
0:21:26 we must leave this place okay that is
0:21:30 that is he is one of the web of knives
0:21:34 so we so we go then we we run we run as
0:21:37 long as we can until he kills us
0:21:39 and they grab up their things and they
0:21:42 seem ready to go Neil will follow after
0:21:46 but now knowing that there are members
0:21:48 of the children who came coming to kill
0:21:50 us which seems pretty obvious or worse
0:21:53 he will put up heightened senses and
0:21:55 keep an eye out for hidden assassins
0:21:58 coming out of nowhere and just follow
0:22:00 after Nora okay uh Nara is having a hard
0:22:02 time walking then he will support Nora
0:22:05 okay as much as possible jubair puts on
0:22:07 his backpack he's like I'm very sorry
0:22:09 that we're being interrupted by this but
0:22:11 hopefully if we do not die tonight maybe
0:22:13 we can discuss all of those things I
0:22:14 brought up and he goes and he like
0:22:16 starts undoing the barricade as quickly
0:22:18 as he can I'm a drawspecdf I have four
0:22:20 aspects okay so we're gonna go into a
0:22:23 new round and you are going to roll in
0:22:27 aspects versus obviously
0:22:30 foreign
0:22:35 I have three successes that's going to
0:22:38 be against this manipulation plus
0:22:39 subterfuge I'm going to go ahead and
0:22:41 give that a quick roll
0:22:43 he has one two three four five six
0:22:46 successes oh my God so no wait I had
0:22:49 four successes one's a ten I have a spec
0:22:51 doesn't matter though
0:22:52 [Laughter]
0:22:55 the only thing that you sense coming
0:22:57 from the window itself is a soft Breeze
0:23:00 you know it's open you know he's coming
0:23:03 and it's almost made worse by the fact
0:23:06 that you can't see him I really don't
0:23:08 like being on this side of it jubair
0:23:10 gets as much of the debris out of the
0:23:11 way as possible swings the door open uh
0:23:14 we if if we make it out uh we'll be good
0:23:18 friends
0:23:19 foreign
0:23:23 I
0:23:25 have very many things I wish to say but
0:23:28 we we must go and shoot by air
0:23:32 starts rushing down the stairs and uh he
0:23:35 he kind of just rushes to the next door
0:23:39 and holds it open and again there's this
0:23:43 moment where you can't
0:23:47 hear the sound of your teeth grinding
0:23:50 but you don't see anyone it's just this
0:23:54 very brief moment but it is completely
0:23:57 unsettling to someone who's so
0:23:59 awakened to the worlds around them in
0:24:01 terms of their senses and they all will
0:24:04 try and Usher Nara out
0:24:08 and close the door behind if that's
0:24:11 possible
0:24:12 just trying to think of all the weird
0:24:14 little tricks and roadblocks that always
0:24:16 frustrate him whenever he is hidden from
0:24:19 sight so there's a bunch of debris and
0:24:20 [ __ ] around right and there is a bunch
0:24:23 of Khalif so like incense or ashes or
0:24:26 anything like that all over the place on
0:24:28 the way out of the room Neil's gonna
0:24:29 grab a Brazier and just like a couple
0:24:31 handfuls of Ash
0:24:32 okay
0:24:33 as the group of you had down Trooper
0:24:36 here actually calls out to you from the
0:24:38 next door there's people at the entrance
0:24:40 we have to go out another way
0:24:42 um come on uh oh okay uh excitedly he
0:24:46 like shoulders open a window and starts
0:24:48 trying to make open space we'll have to
0:24:50 jump oh it's jump yes come on
0:24:54 wait wait okay um
0:24:58 looks up can you jump
0:25:01 there is no escaping the weapon of
0:25:03 knives
0:25:05 maybe
0:25:06 but I
0:25:08 Johnny told me never to give up never
0:25:10 die he just to keep fighting where's
0:25:12 Johnny
0:25:13 it's a very headstrong I know
0:25:18 um we don't have very many bruja who
0:25:20 survive here uh huh
0:25:23 yeah I don't know I don't know if
0:25:25 they're alive either
0:25:26 shoe by ear leaps clearly channeling
0:25:30 some of the power of His Celerity uh but
0:25:33 actually rolls up to his feet pretty
0:25:34 good when he gets to the next rooftop
0:25:36 The Observatory is a pretty high point
0:25:41 from that nearby Roof oh boy so it at
0:25:44 the very least this is gonna hurt you um
0:25:47 you go first
0:25:51 she tries to conjure up some magic
0:25:55 and
0:25:57 lifts herself off the ground and through
0:26:02 the power of Duran key she actually like
0:26:06 levitates and kind of at a walking pace
0:26:09 floats down towards or jubair is waiting
0:26:15 um everything goes silent Neil will turn
0:26:18 because he's just near the window throw
0:26:21 his handfuls of Ash into the air
0:26:24 because [ __ ] you obfuscate and then
0:26:27 throw himself out the window as best he
0:26:29 can when you throw the ash up into the
0:26:31 air it gives you just the briefest like
0:26:33 outline of like this forming figure
0:26:36 that's like stalking just inches behind
0:26:39 you and give me a dexterity plus
0:26:42 Athletics role
0:26:45 uh I can have spent more for decks the
0:26:48 way this is gonna work is it is going to
0:26:50 deal
0:26:51 four levels of lethal damage
0:26:54 minus one level of damage
0:26:58 per success that you roll on your
0:27:01 Athletics check and then you can roll
0:27:03 whatever soak you have Neil not having
0:27:06 enough time to really prepare himself
0:27:08 throws himself as best as his little
0:27:10 kicky legs will take him out the window
0:27:12 towards the other rooftop I think it's
0:27:14 important to note that I have no
0:27:15 Athletics so
0:27:19 [Laughter]
0:27:21 I don't blow tense two successes okay so
0:27:25 roll stamina
0:27:26 I don't have much of that either
0:27:31 two successes okay you hit the ground it
0:27:35 is not a graceful Landing but jubair
0:27:38 grabs you and he's like that was great
0:27:40 let's go we have to keep going if we
0:27:42 want to live oh boy
0:27:44 um okay yeah yeah I'll um I'll I'll
0:27:47 follow you I don't I don't know the city
0:27:49 very well oh no me neither I just got
0:27:52 here which which way do we need to go
0:27:54 let's get to the river where's the river
0:27:55 well there's two of them there's one on
0:27:57 each side just get to the river north
0:27:59 south east or west
0:28:00 I was thinking like let's go like uh uh
0:28:03 and as she's like pondering it
0:28:06 you swear there's that moment of silence
0:28:09 again oh okay now now no second pick a
0:28:12 direction great
0:28:14 um and Neil will is an hour still
0:28:16 floating okay uh yeah she's still
0:28:19 floating just sort of like take her hand
0:28:20 to pull her along like a balloon uh it
0:28:23 actually doesn't work it makes it harder
0:28:25 for her to like maintain the magic
0:28:26 eventually she tries yeah all right and
0:28:30 would rather just limp along with you
0:28:32 um who runs along and Neil will spend a
0:28:34 point of blood as they're running to
0:28:36 figure out his Direction sense so he can
0:28:39 help at least guide them in the right
0:28:40 direction since Jupiter is very
0:28:42 enthusiastic but I'm not sure has the
0:28:45 most efficient frame of mind no he's
0:28:48 very he's kind of seems really happy to
0:28:50 be here even though the web of knives
0:28:53 has come to kill everyone like it's not
0:28:56 a deal breaker for Drew by year yeah as
0:28:58 much as I love him I that means I want
0:29:00 him not to die so we gotta you know so
0:29:02 uh Neil will as they're running look up
0:29:05 to the sky and spend a point in Blood
0:29:07 and try and get his Direction so that he
0:29:10 said hey reverse to the South we gotta
0:29:11 go to the South okay uh you hoping that
0:29:15 jubayer actually knows what he's talking
0:29:16 about he's terminally right directions
0:29:18 this this cradle of of like a place is
0:29:22 actually surrounded by like water and
0:29:24 there is indeed River there great
0:29:26 um okay well now I know where we're
0:29:28 going what what do we do when we get to
0:29:29 the river are we going to the river
0:29:31 um I'm not a very strong swimmer oh my
0:29:35 dude why would you need to be a strong
0:29:36 swimmer what are you going to do breathe
0:29:38 your way out of here let's go come on
0:29:41 um okay he kind of like does like a big
0:29:43 friendship hug with you and Nara but is
0:29:45 actually kind of like trying to run with
0:29:46 you guys and I just need a couple of
0:29:51 gifts and Athletics challenges uh this
0:29:54 one is again six lethal and the last one
0:29:56 is against eight lethal what as uh
0:29:59 jubair kind of like pushes for some
0:30:02 hustle with with through judicious use
0:30:04 of his Solarity oh okay you know I'm in
0:30:09 the intro I'm gonna spend another Blood
0:30:10 for that uh for another point of Dex
0:30:12 just because um I will spend a willpower
0:30:15 on one of these to keep us going
0:30:18 assuming I still have full willpower I
0:30:19 have no idea I'm still drugged to [ __ ]
0:30:21 yeah no they're hooking you up all right
0:30:26 oh difficulty what was it six six okay
0:30:30 regular uh three successes on uh four
0:30:32 successes for the first one with the
0:30:34 willpower so why don't you give me a
0:30:36 salmon roll against two lethal
0:30:39 two successes okay I'm gonna actually
0:30:41 rolling really good here uh yeah no you
0:30:43 hit the ground Jupiter is like yes that
0:30:45 was so very good okay
0:30:47 um you've done this before I have never
0:30:51 nope well not against well with knives
0:30:52 you'd be dead but you know from other
0:30:54 stuff yeah I'm gonna have people talk to
0:30:57 you about bedside Manor um
0:31:02 and then you need another one yep one
0:31:04 more all right he's like this is a big
0:31:06 one but we're near the river now if we
0:31:08 can just get down to the ground floor
0:31:10 all right I'm definitely spending
0:31:11 another willpower and another blood pump
0:31:13 might decks up to five because
0:31:18 um
0:31:20 three willpower four successes so you're
0:31:23 rolling seven against four lethal four
0:31:25 lethal yeah okay
0:31:28 oh yeah that's no that's a it's not a
0:31:31 botch but it's a nothing you land it
0:31:35 doesn't hurt at first but then you
0:31:37 notice this audible crunch that comes
0:31:40 from your left leg when you look down
0:31:42 you can see bone popping out of your
0:31:45 pants leg that's not good however before
0:31:48 you land you hear this like grunt come
0:31:51 from Nara
0:31:52 when you hit the ground Jubilee rushes
0:31:55 to the two of you he's your leg and he's
0:31:57 like no Nara
0:31:59 she looks as though the fluid from her
0:32:03 body has been stripped from her and she
0:32:05 is this and and this death-like state
0:32:08 okay uh there's not another idea she's
0:32:11 in her back there is a single throwing
0:32:14 knife and like
0:32:16 dripping from its point of entry is this
0:32:20 like
0:32:20 black viscous goo no no no no no no no
0:32:25 no no no no no no no
0:32:27 is she is she does she have to go this
0:32:30 isn't final death take her with us I
0:32:33 don't know yeah we find out okay
0:32:35 Neil slaps you Neil
0:32:39 you you are what they want
0:32:42 if they do not have you there is hope
0:32:46 they so we make sure that they do not
0:32:49 have you
0:32:50 um and we take Nara with us so that if
0:32:53 Nara dies she is in good company and she
0:32:56 does not die we save her
0:32:59 so for now we live with you and her we
0:33:03 go now let's go okay okay okay and Neil
0:33:07 tries his his little best to like have
0:33:10 her to and try and carry her and keep
0:33:13 going as best he can on a broken leg you
0:33:16 should spend a point of blood just to
0:33:17 like put the like pop the bone back into
0:33:19 place absolutely okay
0:33:21 [Music]
0:33:26 you wade into the water and I need a DEX
0:33:30 plus Athletics role as Alamo Alim draws
0:33:35 closer if you are successful are you
0:33:38 able to make it down towards the bottom
0:33:40 of the river and where it'd be much
0:33:42 harder for almorelim to follow you if
0:33:45 not uh we'll be rolling to see whether
0:33:47 or not he snatches Nara from your hands
0:33:48 definitely spending willpower on this
0:33:50 one and you can pump decks to six right
0:33:52 you can actually just kind of keep
0:33:55 pumping decks but if it's after six It
0:33:58 Go the bonus goes away after three
0:33:59 rounds well I'm I can only spend one at
0:34:01 a time and I only have limited blood
0:34:02 pool so that's so sex is probably it
0:34:05 yeah
0:34:08 holy [ __ ] look at this roll it seems
0:34:10 some things are meant to be that is six
0:34:13 seven successes okay you dive in taking
0:34:16 Nora with you and you can feel the cool
0:34:17 dead hand grab her but her hand kind of
0:34:22 slips between his fingers as you descend
0:34:24 into the water there's a few things that
0:34:27 happen one uh the current is actually
0:34:29 very difficult to operate in but once
0:34:31 you're down deep enough you're
0:34:33 essentially just kind of going along for
0:34:36 a slow ride there really isn't any light
0:34:38 coming from out of the river even with
0:34:41 your heightened senses you are able to
0:34:43 kind of see your way around and using
0:34:47 his heightened senses jubair does make
0:34:49 it to you and it becomes the three of
0:34:52 you one of you in torper making your way
0:34:55 out of the situation by the time you
0:34:57 surface comes out with you he looks
0:35:00 really really sad and he kind of sits
0:35:03 down next to you on the banks of the
0:35:05 river and he opens his backpack and he
0:35:09 kind of takes out this clump of like wet
0:35:11 ruined paper from all of the notes that
0:35:14 he worked so so hard on
0:35:19 grits his teeth
0:35:21 steps away and frenzies hissing and
0:35:26 screaming and losing it because of the
0:35:30 notes he had taken are now gone because
0:35:32 of his own idea and you find yourself
0:35:34 with a torpert Nara on your lap
0:35:37 and this strange man jubair howling at
0:35:41 the Night Neil just sits on the bank
0:35:44 runs his fingers through nara's like wet
0:35:48 shriveled hair
0:35:50 looks down at like the clump of papers
0:35:54 I think I can save those
0:35:56 thinking about just stacks of wet
0:36:00 newspapers that feel like home that he
0:36:04 has not seen in weeks
0:36:06 give me do you have eyes of gas I do
0:36:09 roll it here's a weird question that's
0:36:11 never come up before eyes of chaos is a
0:36:13 perception rule yeah does aspects lower
0:36:15 difficulty yes okay so it's because it's
0:36:18 a set it's whatever you set minus four
0:36:21 yeah for diff so diff three
0:36:25 eight successes okay with eight
0:36:28 successes you see that all of his
0:36:31 research barely brushes against the tip
0:36:35 of an iceberg and you find yourself
0:36:37 pondering other major locations across
0:36:40 the globe and the subtle subtle signs of
0:36:44 these events conspiring to come into
0:36:47 existence and you realize that those
0:36:51 signs of gehenna that he was pondering
0:36:54 so much aren't Global events they aren't
0:36:58 things that are going to appear in the
0:37:00 news they aren't things that are going
0:37:02 to be discussed in Elysium and they are
0:37:04 just the subtle Quiet Moments waiting to
0:37:07 happen and you know now more than ever
0:37:10 before that those moments are real
0:37:15 they conspire to bring ruin to the world
0:37:21 Neil just kind of loses himself in the
0:37:23 moment waiting for jubileir to calm down
0:37:26 in time chubair comes down
0:37:29 and he heads over next to you and he
0:37:31 sits just Sullen and defeated the things
0:37:36 you did
0:37:37 not quite looking at him it's kind of
0:37:39 looking at the flow of the water
0:37:42 the work you put in it was worth it
0:37:45 now it's gone I've seen it I was reading
0:37:49 it what did you see
0:37:51 it's happening
0:37:52 it's all happening in
0:37:56 what you
0:37:58 Nora all of us
0:38:01 we were too
0:38:03 too focused on the grand on the large
0:38:05 scales and the Earth's shaking news
0:38:07 that's not what's happening
0:38:10 much
0:38:12 quieter apocalypse than any of us
0:38:14 thought was going to happen
0:38:16 but it's happening
0:38:18 he watches
0:38:20 enthralled as you speak
0:38:23 then we must listen carefully
0:38:26 ah
0:38:28 I do not know
0:38:30 where we can take Nara or she will be
0:38:33 safe
0:38:34 of the web of knives is willing to
0:38:37 attack her I must believe that they are
0:38:40 willing to take our own life
0:38:42 I want to go home
0:38:44 where are you from
0:38:46 America
0:38:48 from New Haven
0:38:49 I do not know of New Haven in America
0:38:53 my Haven is there

0:39:41 I think I'm starting to sober up
0:39:43 always a sign of a bad time
0:39:46 and Neil sort of quietly gets to his
0:39:48 feet because what else are you gonna do
0:39:50 but walk should buyer gets up to follow
