0:00:19 we want you to feel the same so listener
0:00:21 discretion is advised
0:00:23 now let's walk the path of night
0:00:28 [Music]
0:00:36 so
0:00:38 [Music]
0:00:52 [Music]
0:00:54 when
0:00:55 it's been some time since you've been
0:00:57 back to the haven ever since all of the
0:01:00 sacrifices and
0:01:02 monstrous fights and
0:01:05 the arrival of the sabbat
0:01:07 but it's quiet
0:01:08 and the forest is starting to show signs
0:01:11 of spring
0:01:12 it gets muddy
0:01:14 this time of year
0:01:15 i mean that explains a lot of the
0:01:16 conditions of
0:01:18 of winds boots
0:01:19 but it does mean that there's not as
0:01:21 many people
0:01:23 which does give her a lot more time to
0:01:24 think
0:01:25 and you can smell this like
0:01:28 earthen
0:01:29 kind of you know muddy and
0:01:32 that melting snow scent as uh
0:01:36 february kinda starts to warm up for you
0:01:38 some this is kind of the first time
0:01:41 you've really had
0:01:42 a moment of tranquility since
0:01:45 the chaos that happened back at elysium
0:01:48 i mean it's
0:01:49 it's tranquility in so much that i'm not
0:01:52 being expected to do anything but it's
0:01:55 wynn is wrestling with a lot of guilt
0:01:57 at this point there's a lot of
0:02:00 misplaced correlation
0:02:03 that if
0:02:04 if she hadn't been helping joey maybe
0:02:06 she could have saved neil
0:02:07 an impossible choice was it even a
0:02:09 choice
0:02:11 you know was there ever a point where
0:02:14 it was fair to
0:02:16 choose
0:02:17 when
0:02:18 it should have been her choice who lives
0:02:20 who dies
0:02:21 she's
0:02:22 wrestling with that very concept of how
0:02:25 much agency did she really have in the
0:02:27 outcome
0:02:29 she holds joey's whistle
0:02:31 usually every day and just kind of looks
0:02:33 at it and thinks about
0:02:34 all the things that led to her being
0:02:36 able to hold it in her hands
0:02:38 if joey's around she makes sure that he
0:02:40 knows she still has it it's eerie
0:02:42 because you can never quite hear the
0:02:44 steps that he takes and he doesn't speak
0:02:46 much but
0:02:48 when you turn and kind of look carefully
0:02:50 he's always kind of somewhere by you
0:02:52 exploring and coming to understand this
0:02:54 new world that he exists in now from the
0:02:57 shack
0:02:58 you can see
0:02:59 the silhouette of a man
0:03:02 with the glint of cat's eyes
0:03:04 kind of staring at you
0:03:06 and he rounds the corner
0:03:08 and disappears
0:03:11 you recognize this as
0:03:13 the wraith mr perfect
0:03:15 who seems to have come to pay you a
0:03:17 visit
0:03:18 you can come talk to me
0:03:21 i see you
0:03:22 that's why i'm here
0:03:24 okay so what do you need to talk about
0:03:26 big big conversations
0:03:28 all right well i got time
0:03:30 good who's the kid
0:03:33 none of your business he's cute
0:03:35 my time is running out
0:03:38 be that way
0:03:39 i found something weird
0:03:41 real weird
0:03:43 and it's in the skin lens now
0:03:46 i thought maybe
0:03:47 if i help you do a good
0:03:50 you'll help me know what's going on
0:03:52 we'll see what we can do to help each
0:03:53 other
0:03:55 you ever been to the holy land
0:03:58 i was at woodstock
0:03:59 nah waterbury
0:04:02 the holy land
0:04:03 so what do you say you have fur ride
0:04:06 not your kind of ride
0:04:08 then you're kind of right
0:04:09 yeah let's go to the [ __ ] holy land
0:04:11 i'm sure you love it there i do
0:04:13 yeah
0:04:14 that's mine you know he kind of says
0:04:17 coming out of the dark to like
0:04:19 walk over towards you
0:04:21 bone thin and lanky and just this
0:04:23 uncomfortable thing
0:04:26 let's go
0:04:27 he goes to follow you along
0:04:29 and it's always kind of like looming and
0:04:31 watching the boy but he never makes a
0:04:33 move
0:04:35 [Music]
0:04:40 eventually the two of you make your way
0:04:43 to holy land which is like up on a
0:04:45 mountain there is this huge shining
0:04:48 cross
0:04:49 that overlooks the crime ridden city of
0:04:53 waterbury
0:04:54 once up there you can kind of smell piss
0:04:57 alcohol and like just pain
0:05:00 all of the little you know statues and
0:05:03 what could have been rides are all kind
0:05:05 of like they're strung about covered in
0:05:07 graffiti and it is just awful he
0:05:11 seems empowered just being there
0:05:15 so sometimes
0:05:17 the locals like to hide people here
0:05:20 and
0:05:21 i'll take the bodies for a ride of
0:05:24 course you would but right now
0:05:27 you see i can't do that with the last
0:05:28 batch
0:05:30 okay
0:05:31 the storm that's coming in it's real
0:05:33 [ __ ] bad
0:05:35 and it's hitting people so hard and that
0:05:38 they're just
0:05:39 ending up anywhere
0:05:40 and now
0:05:43 he kind of crouches down in points
0:05:46 and
0:05:47 moving
0:05:48 amidst this set of images of the virgin
0:05:51 mary
0:05:52 are these bodies that kind of shamble
0:05:56 and
0:05:56 wander in a stupor
0:05:59 the dead
0:06:01 are crossing into the world of the
0:06:03 living
0:06:04 but it's not right it's not supposed to
0:06:06 be this way no it's not
0:06:09 i need you to get rid of these [ __ ]
0:06:12 they're intruding
0:06:14 and in exchange
0:06:16 you get to
0:06:17 keep your little secret and the world
0:06:19 doesn't know that there are dead bodies
0:06:21 walking around
0:06:23 well i mean obviously i'm going to take
0:06:24 care of this yes
0:06:26 can i make it a cult role
0:06:28 yeah have i ever heard of this or would
0:06:30 lord wraith be better uh laura wraith
0:06:32 intelligence
0:06:34 difficulty six uh one success with one
0:06:37 success
0:06:38 you know
0:06:39 that it is possible for a wraith to
0:06:44 bond with their own corpse and
0:06:47 walk around
0:06:48 but it is a very complicated and
0:06:50 difficult process for there to be just a
0:06:52 handful of people doing this right here
0:06:55 probably unlikely and also the fact that
0:06:58 these are just confused wandering
0:07:00 corpses is really unlike uh that other
0:07:03 thing that you've heard of becoming a
0:07:05 revenant
0:07:06 wind kind of puts her hands on her hips
0:07:08 and just looks at these shamblers i like
0:07:10 the way you do that i'm sure you do is
0:07:13 he manifested no no god though yeah
0:07:17 come over here and say that i like the
0:07:19 way you do that you feel the chill
0:07:22 of his breath against you that your back
0:07:24 of your neck i drive an elbow nothing i
0:07:26 know
0:07:27 all right i'm gonna coach you how you do
0:07:29 this i'm gonna try this on my own well
0:07:33 you know
0:07:34 you're a woman so
0:07:38 he kind of disappears oh [ __ ] that guy
0:07:40 [ __ ] a whole lot of that guy and she
0:07:42 kind of looks to make sure joey is kind
0:07:44 of in her field of view he dips his head
0:07:47 out from behind something with his
0:07:48 emaciated face
0:07:50 and smiles at you and gives you a thumbs
0:07:53 up
0:07:54 and then he goes back to hiding she
0:07:56 returns the thumbs up and goes over to
0:07:59 one of the shamblers and just kind of
0:08:01 stands in front of it kind of
0:08:03 seeing if it even acknowledges corpses
0:08:05 all turn to look at you there's three in
0:08:07 all and they look like they are in pain
0:08:12 but it is pain to the point of blind
0:08:15 violence and the three of them come like
0:08:19 stomping and squishing their way towards
0:08:22 you go ahead and give me an issue
0:08:29 can i spend the blood real quick of
0:08:30 course okay bud bud blood spinning one
0:08:33 two beef my dex
0:08:35 when you are first go ahead and describe
0:08:37 your action and give me a roll win just
0:08:41 cause i didn't want it to come to this
0:08:43 secretly she probably a little bit
0:08:45 wanted it to come to this but
0:08:47 she pops claws
0:08:51 i come towards you and takes a swing at
0:08:53 the closest one right i'm gonna split my
0:08:55 dipole so i can make two attacks

0:09:12 days
0:09:13 five damage you
0:09:16 rake into them uh the first one and
0:09:19 entrails come pouring out of his like
0:09:21 soft kind of squishy belly even as
0:09:24 this person loses like 30 pounds of
0:09:26 weight he just kind of looks at you with
0:09:28 this confused pained look
0:09:33 and he attacks you buddy just stop
0:09:37 four successes
0:09:38 his fist smashes against the side of
0:09:41 your head dealing three levels of

0:10:02 not getting both of you prone but deals
0:10:04 no damage the other one is gonna like

0:10:25 round why don't you go ahead and you're
0:10:26 gonna you're gonna sacrifice your
0:10:27 movement to stand up and then you can

0:11:14 okay then the next closest guy
0:11:18 uh no successes on that one with there's
0:11:21 so much viscera
0:11:22 the two remaining rotting corpses

0:11:27 together
0:11:29 wow this is five successes gross four
0:11:32 carry over
0:11:35 two damage
0:11:38 eight successes the second one reaches
0:11:40 out and
0:11:41 their hand kind of becomes covered in
0:11:44 these like pustules and mushrooms that
0:11:46 start to bloom and it will attempt to
0:11:48 strike you as well
0:11:51 as three successes to carry over
0:11:55 and it will deal
0:11:57 one level of aggravated damage okay as
0:12:01 it sizzles when it makes contact with
0:12:03 you
0:12:05 four successes your turn she takes a
0:12:08 swing says i'm sorry i know you're in

0:12:19 with the other one oh wait your minus
0:12:20 one success yeah that is a botch okay
0:12:23 you fight against the rots while kind of
0:12:27 swinging one loose mud under your boot
0:12:30 gives way causing you to slip hit the
0:12:33 ground and tumble
0:12:35 down one of the edges of the um pathway
0:12:39 you don't you know you don't get hurt
0:12:41 very much
0:12:42 but you're covered in mud and you're a
0:12:44 bit of a distance away from them now and
0:12:46 they're kind of wandering towards you
0:12:48 okay
0:12:48 just gonna kind of shake the mud off and
0:12:50 wait for them to come to me yeah hell
0:12:52 i'll just start walking back towards
0:12:54 them okay the other one starts to gain
0:12:56 that gross
0:12:57 mushroom effect along their hands grease
0:13:01 starts to like drip from their fingers
0:13:05 two successes to hit to obliviate you i
0:13:08 don't like the sound of that at all
0:13:16 uh no successes you will suffer two
0:13:17 levels of aggravated damage what is the
0:13:19 feeling of it is it like a burning is it
0:13:21 a
0:13:22 acid is uh it feels like um
0:13:26 necrosis so like i'm rotting right all
0:13:29 right let's split my dice pool and take
0:13:31 a swing at the closest one go for it
0:13:35 two successes roll
0:13:37 uh strength plus two dice or damage
0:13:41 four damage on the next one
0:13:44 uh no successes they're
0:13:46 going five successes to hit okay

0:13:53 two levels of damage this is uh still
0:13:55 aggravated
0:13:57 uh four successes you're good the
0:14:00 other one
0:14:03 uh deals no damage here you go i need
0:14:05 these things to stop swinging as hard as
0:14:07 i do and wind just swings both of her
0:14:09 arms uh so that they intersect in front
0:14:12 of her kind of in a sweeping scissors
0:14:14 motion
0:14:16 uh six successes roll strength plus six
0:14:19 dice of damage
0:14:23 seven success roll soak from the last
0:14:25 one there
0:14:29 three successes
0:14:30 okay here you go the two of you are at
0:14:32 this point fighting in the mud you're
0:14:34 standing in the remains of the second
0:14:37 one that you've killed it feels like
0:14:39 you're standing on a pool of boiled meat
0:14:41 like it's just very soft
0:14:43 gets between the toes it's like my boots
0:14:45 you're doing one attack or two one
0:14:47 attack okay
0:14:51 uh two successes roll strength plus two
0:14:53 dice of damage
0:14:56 two successes okay
0:14:59 the last one what was probably once a
0:15:02 young woman her like
0:15:04 spandex pants are like torn and like
0:15:08 [ __ ] old flesh is kind of like rolling
0:15:11 out sagging out and yeah it's
0:15:13 very
0:15:14 it's not
0:15:14 great and she will attempt to grapple
0:15:16 you okay
0:15:18 with four successes okay
0:15:20 all right she
0:15:21 jumps up onto you and
0:15:24 her tongue
0:15:25 and lips are kind of covered in the same
0:15:29 like putrescence that her hands were
0:15:32 kind of giving you the impression as to
0:15:33 what's probably going to happen next
0:15:35 just like woodstock so i'm going to try
0:15:36 and break the grapple okay
0:15:39 four successes to break the grapple you
0:15:41 do and i stand up uh she swings at you

0:16:08 her kind her fists around and though it
0:16:10 breaks her hand that globule of whatever
0:16:13 it is that she's exuding uh streaks
0:16:16 across the side of your face for a level
0:16:18 of aggravated damage
0:16:20 okay three successes okay your action

0:16:37 of be seen cat eyes glinting in the dark

0:16:43 amusement as he watches you slug it out
0:16:45 with the corpses

0:17:15 okay struggling to get a hold of you
0:17:17 well we're both kind of mucked up at

0:17:26 dice wind give me strength
0:17:29 all right two successes the
0:17:32 [Music]

0:17:50 dice of damage

0:17:57 with your claws sending it tumbling down
0:17:59 the hill
0:18:03 [Music]
0:18:06 in the shadow lands
0:18:08 you see this trio now of these
0:18:11 pained
0:18:13 pained wraiths
0:18:15 that are largely torn asunder by
0:18:17 whatever storm it is that they were
0:18:18 caught in and kind of creeping up
0:18:21 towards them
0:18:23 with this look of glee is mr perfect
0:18:28 he did real good
0:18:30 eat a dick
0:18:31 close
0:18:33 he grabs one and his drawers start to
0:18:36 distend
0:18:38 very slowly like the way a snake eats a
0:18:40 mouse he shoves one of the wraiths into
0:18:44 his mouth
0:18:45 and just slowly sucks
0:18:47 and gobbles it down
0:18:49 the other two are too confused and lost
0:18:53 by whatever it is they've gone through
0:18:55 and
0:18:56 he just one at a time consumes these
0:18:59 three wraiths wind doesn't stay in watch
0:19:02 she walks away missing the best part
0:19:04 we have to work together win there might
0:19:07 be more of these things out there and i
0:19:10 can help you finish it when you know you
0:19:12 finish it
0:19:13 we can be a team to both of us predators
0:19:16 you don't want that any more than i do
0:19:18 it's working out so far
0:19:20 for one of us
0:19:21 yeah why wouldn't i want it
0:19:24 you feel like these tiny little fingers
0:19:26 grab your hand
0:19:28 the kiddo kind of stands next to you
0:19:30 defiant of this
0:19:32 malevolent spirit
0:19:34 she kind of puts an arm around him and
0:19:36 just keeps walking there's going to be
0:19:38 more wind
0:19:40 eventually as you kind of make your way
0:19:42 down that
0:19:43 rocky side
0:19:44 when making your exit from holy land the
0:19:47 two of you stop feeling that feeling of
0:19:51 being watched
0:19:53 joey okay
0:19:54 yeah
0:19:55 uh you stay you see him you stay away
0:19:58 from him understood understood
0:20:00 so what now
0:20:02 we're gonna find some answers
0:20:04 because this can't keep happening and i
0:20:05 don't want him to be the first one to
0:20:07 find them
0:20:08 is it okay if i see my mom
0:20:10 i made you a promise didn't i
0:20:12 yeah but you have a lot going on and
0:20:15 and there's a lot of weird stuff so
0:20:17 there's a lot of weird stuff but i can
0:20:18 wait
0:20:19 if you need we can make time for this
0:20:21 buddy
0:20:23 okay
0:20:23 thank you yeah
0:20:25 and win kind of realizes at that point
0:20:27 that she's in
0:20:28 no shape to go see anybody she's covered
0:20:32 in mud and viscera and
0:20:34 these holy land things probably should
0:20:36 be called into weathers
0:20:38 if there's
0:20:39 anyone to
0:20:40 to try and see if there's a masquerade
0:20:42 to even cover up anymore
0:20:45 her plan at this point is to head back
0:20:47 to the shed and hose off
0:20:49 to find a pay phone along the way and
0:20:51 see if there's a point to trying to call
0:20:53 weathers okay uh you do find a pay phone
0:20:55 on the way when you call weathers uh
0:20:58 there's actually an answer
0:21:00 hey hey
0:21:02 what's the matter
0:21:03 night of the living dead is happening in
0:21:05 the holy land there's
0:21:07 there's literal corpses rising from the
0:21:09 dead i don't get that reference you're
0:21:11 gonna have to explain that there's
0:21:12 corpses walking around not not coherent

0:21:45 something's wrong in that area we're
0:21:47 going to see more corpses coming out of

0:22:10 better clothes better being kind of a
0:22:12 qualified term little joey picks up the
0:22:15 hose and he helps spray you off
0:22:18 well that's new

0:23:21 time okay and she'll reach out and take
0:23:23 his hand
0:23:24 and make sure she has the whistle he
0:23:26 definitely gets lost like four times
0:23:29 but eventually you do find your way to
0:23:32 this little house with a little white
0:23:36 picket fence around it there's a
0:23:38 driveway you know there's a car in the
0:23:41 driveway it's got like a garage and
0:23:44 there's a car in the garage
0:23:46 at the house you see there are two
0:23:49 individuals talking one is a
0:23:52 woman who pro looks honestly a lot like
0:23:55 the stereotype of what you would expect
0:23:57 for like a kindergarten teacher you know
0:23:58 she's like young she's got a very
0:24:00 friendly soft demeanor and she is
0:24:03 talking to a man that you recognize as
0:24:06 detective suarez
0:24:08 he is wearing like a leather jacket tie
0:24:12 on and it's definitely like a detective
0:24:15 you could smell the cigarettes coming
0:24:17 off of him from there and like coffee
0:24:19 stains on his teeth and you know he's
0:24:21 got that like that look you know he's
0:24:24 growing a little early just a guy who's
0:24:27 been through some [ __ ] and the two of
0:24:28 them are
0:24:30 talking and he's kind of trying to give
0:24:33 some
0:24:34 very
0:24:35 curt counseling and is kind of
0:24:38 explaining you know we're gonna find the
0:24:39 one who did this don't worry i know i
0:24:41 can't undo what's already happened but i
0:24:44 can at least i'll bring you justice and
0:24:46 he makes that mistake that you're never
0:24:48 supposed to make
0:24:50 he promises justice
0:24:52 the actor for doing it does cause joey's
0:24:56 mom to fall quiet and she does seem a
0:24:58 little at peace by this
0:25:00 detective suarez makes his way out and
0:25:03 you know without a word heads off on his
0:25:05 way probably to the next case yeah he's
0:25:07 got a lot on his plate wind stays some
0:25:09 distance away she doesn't make her
0:25:11 presence known she kind of actively
0:25:13 tries to make sure that they don't see
0:25:15 her and she turns to joey and said
0:25:17 that's mom
0:25:18 yeah have you seen my owl trick he gives
0:25:20 you like this super incredulous look owl
0:25:23 trick yeah
0:25:24 no
0:25:25 uh she takes the whistle out of her
0:25:27 pocket and sets it on the ground he
0:25:29 picks the whistle up hold on to that for
0:25:31 me okay buddy
0:25:32 when spends the blood and takes the time
0:25:35 to kind of shift into a large bar now
0:25:38 she sits there looking at joey and kind
0:25:40 of [ __ ] her head and whistles at him oh
0:25:42 uh can i do that
0:25:45 she shakes her head all i can do is pick
0:25:47 stuff up
0:25:49 she kind of gives him a conciliatory
0:25:51 nod of the head
0:25:52 his sadness is like annihilated in the
0:25:55 face of a cool owl
0:25:57 she kind of clacks her beak a couple
0:26:00 times motioning for him to put the
0:26:01 whistle in her mouth he heads over and
0:26:04 very
0:26:05 gingerly puts the whistle into your
0:26:08 mouth she holds it like a golden
0:26:10 retriever holding an egg just very
0:26:12 gently like aware of how precious this
0:26:15 is that he's entrusting her with this
0:26:17 someone normally so violent and so rough
0:26:20 around the edges is the one who's having
0:26:22 to deliver the final justice for this
0:26:25 little boy in a way that the good
0:26:27 detective probably won't be able to
0:26:29 she kind of gives joey a look
0:26:32 that says wait here
0:26:34 and she takes off
0:26:36 lands on the picket fence near mom
0:26:39 uh she is startled uh she does not hear
0:26:42 the owl coming nope um
0:26:45 but certainly notices the presence of
0:26:46 this massive barn ohio when she turns
0:26:48 ugh
0:26:52 my goodness
0:26:56 well
0:26:57 hi there owl um
0:26:59 and when doesn't make a whole lot of
0:27:01 moves at first she kind of lets mom
0:27:03 acclimate to the presence of an owl
0:27:05 which normally
0:27:06 isn't gonna be there isn't looking to
0:27:08 make friends in this case this this owl
0:27:11 has something to say
0:27:13 it's like she has this very spiritual
0:27:16 moment kind of seeing this owl and
0:27:18 trying to infer
0:27:20 what its presence might mean in this
0:27:22 kind of very dark time for her and she
0:27:24 notices
0:27:26 the whistle
0:27:28 very slowly with a hand up she starts to
0:27:31 approach you
0:27:32 having found her courage
0:27:35 wind stays very still until mom gets
0:27:37 close enough that she can drop the
0:27:39 whistle in her hand
0:27:41 the moment there was a length of her
0:27:42 hands it's like a shock to her
0:27:45 tears well up in her eyes and she has
0:27:49 this very
0:27:50 cathartic cry
0:27:53 that starts to consume her
0:27:55 she doesn't say anything she just starts
0:27:57 to like
0:27:58 weep and weep
0:28:00 when doesn't as an owl can't really do a
0:28:03 whole lot to comfort her but
0:28:06 stays
0:28:07 she just kind of lets this woman have
0:28:10 this moment with
0:28:11 with this owl
0:28:13 and the message
0:28:15 the crying kind of hits a point where
0:28:16 she's like on her knees i mean it's not
0:28:19 that she's upset at the owl at all this
0:28:21 is it's very clear that she is feeling
0:28:25 like
0:28:26 maybe
0:28:27 death wasn't the end maybe he's okay
0:28:30 she's she's going through a lot of very
0:28:32 raw emotions and little fingers reach
0:28:35 over the top of the white picket fence
0:28:37 and kind of peeking just like he had
0:28:39 earlier you can see joey look at his mom
0:28:43 and he's got these like big round eyes
0:28:45 that are also kind of tearing up
0:28:48 he's kind of like sharing this moment
0:28:50 even though he can't touch her
0:28:53 wind kind of looks to
0:28:55 joey and then back to mom as if trying
0:28:58 to draw a line between the two
0:29:01 she follows the owl's eyes kind of
0:29:04 realizing that theo will see something
0:29:06 she doesn't and she kind of whispers and
0:29:09 i love
0:29:10 you he doesn't really make any sounds
0:29:14 but you can see his lips kind of like
0:29:16 mouth the words
0:29:19 and
0:29:20 she just looks at the owl and it's like
0:29:22 thank you
0:29:23 the owl wind just kind of lowers its
0:29:25 head
0:29:26 and
0:29:27 looks to where joey is and kind of
0:29:29 motions that it's time to go
0:29:33 and
0:29:33 takes off
0:29:35 joey gives an understanding nod gives
0:29:37 his mom a last look and kind of like
0:29:40 seems relieved
0:29:42 that she's not afraid
0:29:44 and then he heads off with the owl
0:29:48 [Music]
0:29:54 one of the following nights while
0:29:56 resting and trying to take some time to
0:29:59 heal the wounds that she suffered at the
0:30:00 hands of those rats animal messengers
0:30:03 come along notifying her that old man
0:30:06 rusty is calling for a meeting of the
0:30:09 clan to discuss
0:30:11 what direction the clan will take and
0:30:14 how they will support him in his
0:30:15 position as primogen
0:30:18 about how many other gangrel are in the
0:30:20 city just you that's kind of what i
0:30:22 thought
0:30:23 all right let's get this over with
0:30:25 when kind of stands up laces up her
0:30:27 boots puts on her fighting flannel all
0:30:28 right she still wears the one remnant of
0:30:31 the shirt tied around her wrist
0:30:33 she
0:30:34 contemplates bringing the shotgun
0:30:36 make sure that her door is shut and
0:30:39 she heads off to the mentioned location
0:30:42 from the animal messengers she kind of
0:30:45 tugs her leather jacket a little snugger
0:30:47 around herself concealing the strength
0:30:49 that is the fighting flannel he doesn't
0:30:51 need to know she's bringing her a game
0:30:52 right away smart you find yourself
0:30:55 traveling to a small old dilapidated
0:30:58 farm in hampden out there there's like a
0:31:00 very thick tree line that kind of
0:31:02 surrounds a bunch of this old field that
0:31:04 used to be used
0:31:06 there's a campfire there and kind of
0:31:09 sitting everyone's sitting at a safe
0:31:10 distance
0:31:12 away from the fire is a group of your
0:31:15 clan mates
0:31:16 only old man rusty is actually a member
0:31:18 of the camera

0:31:22 wanderers kind of coming through wynn

0:38:11 yep then four successes okay you will
0:38:13 take no damage from his attack he
0:38:16 scratches and rips at you and cannot
0:38:18 seem to get through the fur coat it is
0:38:20 your turn swinging at him full strength
0:38:22 again
0:38:24 seven to hit yes full strength plus
0:38:27 seven nicer damage
0:38:30 seven damage okay uh you smash into him
0:38:34 rip him apart and he begins to crumple
0:38:36 to rapidly decomposing ash
0:38:40 the other gay girl like yeah
0:38:42 raven crosses his her arms and just kind
0:38:46 of watches you win did not intend to go
0:38:49 that far but apparently that's where
0:38:51 we're at
0:38:52 she gradually cricks her body back into
0:38:56 her unfighting form and looks to those
0:38:59 assembled
0:39:01 gangrel there's a new primogen
0:39:03 some of them start like cheering
0:39:06 raven does not
0:39:09 very well primogen
0:39:11 what do you intend to tell his grace
0:39:15 gonna work on that
0:39:16 some advice
0:39:18 he died outside the city of new haven
0:39:20 and therefore you did not violate the
0:39:22 right of destruction however
0:39:26 now
0:39:27 there is a case for conspiracy
0:39:29 against shaw and his allies
0:39:33 cross that bridge when we come to it
0:39:35 there are much bigger fish we need to
0:39:37 fry first that is in fact hubris work
0:39:39 but you can know which way you're going
0:39:41 before it happens
0:39:43 i knew which way i was going
0:39:46 okay
0:39:48 all right
0:39:49 so
0:39:50 as it stands
0:39:53 i've just made a liar out of myself i
0:39:54 have no idea which direction i'm going
0:39:58 you're going to want to talk to miles
0:39:59 yes no i that was on the docket
0:40:03 they love cleaning up messes like this
0:40:05 yes
0:40:06 it makes him happy so i'm happy to
0:40:08 contribute that is the very reason they
0:40:10 created the camarilla
0:40:13 all right
0:40:15 raven
0:40:16 yes
0:40:17 there are some words i would like to
0:40:19 have with you
0:40:20 i have nothing further for the clan who
0:40:22 resides in the city at this time
0:40:26 those who are here
0:40:27 you're welcome to stay the night
0:40:29 don't make yourself a nuisance
0:40:31 no problem they all seem very ready to
0:40:34 not upset you
0:40:36 no one get goes to pick up the remains
0:40:39 of old man rusty he just kind of
0:40:41 decomposes there
0:40:44 right where he died
0:40:46 raven kind of sits and crosses her legs
0:40:50 tell me what is on your mind a lot a lot
0:40:53 raven
0:40:54 there's a lot that i can't control and
0:40:56 this was something i could
0:40:58 and you wanted to speak about what you
0:41:00 cannot control yeah
0:41:02 okay
0:41:03 first and foremost i apologize for the
0:41:05 way i spoke to you when last we spoke
0:41:08 i accept your apology thank you
0:41:10 raven there's something wrong with the
0:41:12 with the wraiths here
0:41:14 over in the holy land they the dead are
0:41:16 walking
0:41:17 it isn't just there what's happening
0:41:20 i've never seen this before
0:41:23 some
0:41:24 see it as a sign of the end times
0:41:27 these are the final nights
0:41:29 i know a guy who would probably agree
0:41:30 with that
0:41:32 maybe i knew him
0:41:35 well it's true
0:41:37 i have never in my own life and i am
0:41:40 admittedly not the oldest but in my life
0:41:43 i have never seen so many
0:41:45 machinations of elders come to fruition
0:41:49 it is as though all at once
0:41:52 and their subconsciousness
0:41:55 they knew
0:41:56 that these were the nights
0:41:58 where their plotting would have to
0:42:01 reach completion
0:42:04 because if it not now
0:42:06 it will never happen
0:42:08 more elders awake now than any time i
0:42:10 have seen
0:42:12 more strange occurrences happen now than
0:42:14 any time that i have seen
0:42:16 have the trimmer told the court what
0:42:18 they're doing in boston the deals
0:42:20 they've made with the giovanni
0:42:22 no
0:42:23 there is something
0:42:25 in boston
0:42:27 and it is causing
0:42:29 ripples across the realm of the dead and
0:42:32 the living
0:42:33 a great maelstrom is moving and it will
0:42:36 be here soon
0:42:37 and among the dead
0:42:39 this is believed to be their end
0:42:42 no more ghosts
0:42:44 the tremere are studying it of course
0:42:47 they are it is a curiosity to them
0:42:50 these wraiths
0:42:51 reconnected to their bodies and that
0:42:54 seemed to be what was animating them
0:42:56 they were wounded they were whatever
0:42:58 this is that drove them back to their
0:43:00 bodies this it is the power of the storm
0:43:03 it is the storm
0:43:04 that is the theory
0:43:06 based on the tremere studies
0:43:08 yes
0:43:09 what did the giovanni have to do with it
0:43:11 the giovanni are obsessed with the realm
0:43:13 of the dead
0:43:14 and
0:43:16 with the help of their shroomer allies a
0:43:19 secret society known as house high
0:43:21 saturday
0:43:23 they are
0:43:24 learning the secrets of this storm and
0:43:26 it is said
0:43:28 that the storm
0:43:29 conceals a voice
0:43:32 something is in it
0:43:33 but we don't know
0:43:35 right
0:43:36 where did this information come from
0:43:39 boston
0:43:41 were the wraiths talking about it
0:43:43 did they claim that there's a voice in
0:43:45 there or is this just conjecture i do
0:43:48 not know the exacts
0:43:49 only that the giovanni are
0:43:53 very interested
0:43:55 in any medium that they can find anyone
0:43:58 capable of interacting with the
0:43:59 underworld who can aid them in their
0:44:01 studies
0:44:02 because the storm is
0:44:04 evolving quickly
0:44:06 and
0:44:07 there is
0:44:08 growing concern that they are going to
0:44:10 miss their opportunity before it becomes
0:44:12 too dangerous to remain in boston
0:44:15 is there a way to i don't know dive into
0:44:18 the storm
0:44:20 you said it's affecting many of the dead
0:44:22 were sent into the storm
0:44:24 but none have returned none have
0:44:25 returned
0:44:26 okay well this isn't good among the dead
0:44:29 there are stories of ancient maelstroms
0:44:31 terrible storms that ravaged the
0:44:34 underworld some believe that when the
0:44:37 sixth comes there will be no more
0:44:40 underworld safe for the dead this is the
0:44:43 sixth great maelstrom
0:44:46 and it was
0:44:47 the house of high saturday that's
0:44:48 looking into this yes
0:44:51 along with the giovanni
0:44:52 a man by the name of ambrogino
0:44:55 leads this study
0:44:57 giovanni yes
0:44:59 i brought this to you because
0:45:01 i personally understand very little of
0:45:03 the dead
0:45:04 but i am owed favors by the giovanni
0:45:08 that i'm gonna keep that in my pocket
0:45:10 if you don't mind
0:45:12 do so
0:45:13 what is it like in boston right now
0:45:16 do you know on the surface it is a city
0:45:19 bustling with activity from drunk idiots
0:45:23 businessmen
0:45:24 how is the maelstrom
0:45:26 affecting it
0:45:27 well
0:45:28 i cannot see that exactly but i know
0:45:30 that there is an impact
0:45:33 sounds like i might need a trip to
0:45:34 boston
0:45:35 perhaps
0:45:37 i can extend the offer of these favors
0:45:39 to you
0:45:40 but like i said
0:45:42 many elders
0:45:44 are attempting to reach the final stages
0:45:46 of their personal plans
0:45:47 i am no exception
0:45:49 i seek fragments of a book
0:45:52 called the er codex
0:45:54 if you are willing to help me procure
0:45:56 pages
0:45:57 in exchange
0:45:59 i will call in favors of the giovanni
0:46:02 what is the er codex
0:46:04 it was once mine
0:46:06 my covenant and i
0:46:08 what's in it
0:46:10 the great truth
0:46:12 the ability to awaken
0:46:15 i'll help you with this
0:46:17 thank you
0:46:20 i'm not sure how
0:46:21 but i can
0:46:22 try
0:46:24 very well we have an understanding is
0:46:25 there anything else you wish to discuss
0:46:28 i think i'm all set for now
0:46:31 you should tend to your wounds
0:46:32 i know
0:46:33 they're gifts from the uh the walking
0:46:36 dead
0:46:37 i see
0:46:38 they um they tried to melt me is what it
0:46:41 felt like they tried to decompose me
0:46:44 so be mindful of that if you come across
0:46:46 these and i'm guessing you will oh keep
0:46:48 that in mind thank you yes
0:46:50 wind kind of leans her head forward and
0:46:53 bops raven on her forehead she does not
0:46:55 resist and heads out after so an
0:46:58 exchange of some like very feral body
0:47:00 language between the two of you raven
0:47:02 kind of spends the rest of the evening
0:47:04 tending to the fire and kind of keeping
0:47:06 an eye on the young dumb Gangrel that
0:47:07 are kind of passing through you when you
0:47:11 get back to your haven for the day
0:47:13 joey is there with you as you kind of
0:47:15 like make sure everything's sun-proofed
0:47:17 and kind of like really get ready to
0:47:18 relax

0:47:20 kind of just like sits down next to your
0:47:23 little bedding spot
