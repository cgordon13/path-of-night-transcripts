0:00:32 [Music]
0:00:55 [Music]
0:00:58 johnny will we pick up with you
0:01:00 alone having spent some time back behind
0:01:03 the sherwood cafe where your haven is
0:01:06 the Coterie hasn't really talked to
0:01:08 each other in a few nights and everyone
0:01:10 seems to be slowly
0:01:12 deciding what
0:01:14 or how they feel about what's taking
0:01:16 place back at the elysium you were part
0:01:18 of the crew that was assigned to clean
0:01:20 up after everything was said and done
0:01:21 which means it was left you
0:01:23 to handle the body
0:01:25 of the lupine that went berserk on the
0:01:27 kindred that were gathered so you wake
0:01:29 up around when you normally do every
0:01:31 night with the same routine
0:01:33 on the little small
0:01:35 windowless cement block haven room that
0:01:38 you have long forgotten and
0:01:41 interconnected with tunnels that lead
0:01:43 around the neighborhood
0:01:45 you
0:01:46 turn on that one light get a good look
0:01:48 at your music collection one of the few
0:01:50 only things that you own
0:01:52 and then you see her
0:01:53 wrapped tight in a blue tarp small
0:01:56 possibly small compared to
0:01:58 how you remembered her when you were
0:01:59 fighting her to the death
0:02:01 what do you do
0:02:03 johnny takes a
0:02:05 few minutes
0:02:06 sitting up on his i imagine that he
0:02:09 probably probably sleeps on a cot
0:02:11 for go for goad getting the traditional
0:02:14 kind of cliche coffin just as a cot in
0:02:17 the cement room down underneath the
0:02:19 block where the sherwood is it's
0:02:21 probably an old uh
0:02:23 fallout shelter that got built
0:02:25 into the foundation back in 40s 50s who
0:02:28 knows new haven is infamous for whole
0:02:31 sections of the city buried underneath
0:02:34 the new so fallout shelters like that
0:02:36 very common without looking he reaches
0:02:39 over to a bedside table and grabs up a
0:02:42 pack of cigarettes
0:02:43 looks down and kind of frowns to notice
0:02:46 that there's none left tosses the empty
0:02:48 pack back on the on the bedside table
0:02:50 and looks over at the the concrete wall
0:02:53 opposite where the uh the girls wrapped
0:02:55 up
0:02:56 and kind of looks at the remains of
0:02:58 where he ended up smashing the wall
0:03:01 in the moment he was
0:03:03 a flurry of all kinds of emotions
0:03:05 dealing with his daughter and
0:03:07 frenzying from hunger and fighting shaw
0:03:10 and protecting his pack that he didn't
0:03:11 really get a chance to deal with the
0:03:13 fact that the lupine was a young girl
0:03:16 it's about them that it hits you
0:03:19 that you call them your pack
0:03:26 he doesn't even exhale or swallow he
0:03:29 thinks about that
0:03:30 and then kind of just tongues the fangs
0:03:33 in his mouth
0:03:34 thinks back to a time when he was being
0:03:37 forcibly inducted into a sect that he
0:03:40 does not want to be his home
0:03:42 and he kind of just drops his hand his
0:03:44 head into his hands and rubs his temples
0:03:48 because all of that is now
0:03:51 catch finally catching up with him
0:03:52 thinks a lot about
0:03:55 all of the other shovelheads
0:03:58 that he were told were now his brothers
0:03:59 and sisters and he thinks about the city
0:04:02 Gangrel who acted like dogs that he
0:04:05 was raised up with
0:04:07 and he starts thinking about
0:04:09 the man that was johnny sire
0:04:12 an individual that he never got his name
0:04:15 but a dangerous individual
0:04:18 with a crescent moon tattooed on his
0:04:20 hand
0:04:21 and before he can really deal with the
0:04:24 emotions he kind of just
0:04:27 tousles up his hair
0:04:28 slaps his head a few times and it's like
0:04:30 all right sex and just get up you've got
0:04:32 work to do stands on his feet and
0:04:35 will make sure that she is wrapped up
0:04:37 properly that he can possibly get her
0:04:40 up to the truck which i don't think he
0:04:42 he's probably he's probably already lost
0:04:44 the truck from the elysium that we got
0:04:47 out in now he's probably got some other
0:04:49 vehicle that he's doing some work in
0:04:51 that that weather's hooked him up with
0:04:53 or maybe miles hooked him up with either
0:04:56 way he's got to get the uh her body up
0:04:58 to there and make sure that nobody sees
0:05:00 exactly what he's doing it doesn't take
0:05:02 much work there's some paths that are
0:05:05 already laid out that really aren't
0:05:07 trafficked by the kind you make your way
0:05:10 to
0:05:11 what looks like a very kind of plasticky
0:05:13 looking nissan xterra
0:05:15 it's like like that forest green color
0:05:17 and it's kind of meant to look like it's
0:05:20 for off-roading but you know this thing
0:05:21 is not meant for that miles yeah
0:05:25 it's pretty though
0:05:26 you open up the back seat and
0:05:29 kind of gingerly
0:05:31 lay this this young woman down
0:05:34 when you
0:05:35 shut the back door you can kind of hear
0:05:37 the the squelching sound of silt being
0:05:41 displaced by like boot heels and you
0:05:43 realize you're not alone in the alley
0:05:45 johnny tenses up but doesn't like swing
0:05:47 around to look who it is uh hey johnny
0:05:50 you hear the familiar voice of a man by
0:05:53 the name of phil mctavish the owner of
0:05:55 the uh bar
0:05:57 that your haven is connected to uh
0:06:00 johnny is everything all right he
0:06:01 relaxes a little bit turns around and
0:06:03 kind of pastes a fake smile hey phil
0:06:07 how's it going
0:06:08 uh
0:06:10 well as usual the circumstances aren't
0:06:12 exactly perfect but man i can use your
0:06:14 help for the situation that i'm dealing
0:06:16 with ah phil i don't know if tonight's a
0:06:18 good night johnny there's no there's no
0:06:21 good nights for this can i talk to you
0:06:22 just a moment johnny kind of looks into
0:06:24 the vehicle where there is a girl's body
0:06:28 tarped up in the back seat tenses up
0:06:33 all right
0:06:34 locks the vehicle
0:06:36 all right phil william
0:06:37 what do you got phil kind of resting his
0:06:39 hands on his hips he's wearing like a
0:06:41 green and blue flannel shirt that's kind
0:06:44 of
0:06:45 buttoned up probably more than it should
0:06:46 be he's a bit overweight over 40 balding
0:06:50 his jeans are you know like really
0:06:52 really really blue
0:06:54 but it looks uh there's this fear in his
0:06:56 eyes when he looks at you johnny uh i
0:06:59 have a
0:07:00 i have a a bartender who's been uh
0:07:04 putting in some work and she's
0:07:06 she's going through a little bit of
0:07:07 trouble and she's not quite talking to
0:07:09 me
0:07:10 and i've got this bad feeling
0:07:12 she keeps showing up nervous
0:07:14 she's ducking out at odd times there's
0:07:16 something going on i think she's in
0:07:19 trouble
0:07:20 you think she's in trouble
0:07:22 trying to have a pretty good instinct
0:07:23 about these things
0:07:24 phil if if this was just some shitty
0:07:27 boyfriend i feel like you wouldn't be
0:07:29 coming to me
0:07:30 what the hell is going on here
0:07:32 let's just say she's real scared i feel
0:07:35 like
0:07:36 i don't know there's something different
0:07:37 about this
0:07:39 johnny's gaze kind of softens a bit he
0:07:41 looks at phil and recognizes that the
0:07:44 two of them are probably not that
0:07:46 different
0:07:47 johnny just got cased in amber
0:07:50 10 years back
0:07:52 if that hadn't happened it maybe his
0:07:54 hair would be thinning like phil's
0:07:56 maybe his gut would have come out a
0:07:58 little bit more
0:07:59 but they're both wearing the same kind
0:08:01 of flannel they're both wearing a beat
0:08:03 up pair of jeans and pair of boots and
0:08:05 he can't help but feel like he's gotta
0:08:08 look out for this guy
0:08:10 he nods
0:08:13 all right what's uh what's her address
0:08:16 she lives out in the tray johnny
0:08:17 immediately recognizes that as a place
0:08:19 that is like or a good 80 percent of
0:08:22 like violent crimes happen in new haven
0:08:25 it is a very very bad neighborhood
0:08:28 you know he takes out a cigarette
0:08:30 lights one up kind of offers as like
0:08:33 almost like a an apology for disturbing
0:08:35 you his eyebrow definitely kind of like
0:08:37 raises when he sees the pack come out
0:08:38 and he kind of angles over a little bit
0:08:41 yeah here and here please
0:08:43 thanks um tonight i'm out
0:08:45 of course that's how you know it's gonna
0:08:47 be a bad night huh for sure our name's
0:08:49 sheila she's actually inside right now
0:08:53 she arrived about a half hour ago and uh
0:08:56 late
0:08:58 she is jumping at her own shadow
0:09:00 something is going on
0:09:03 all right johnny reaches out
0:09:05 grabs his lighter
0:09:07 lights the uh
0:09:08 the cigarette takes the long drag
0:09:11 looks at the uh the lighter
0:09:13 pockets it
0:09:15 reaches out and grabs the pack of
0:09:16 cigarettes out of phil's pocket these
0:09:18 will kill you you know puts it in his
0:09:20 own oh you dick
0:09:22 laughs
0:09:23 yeah that's fair i need you living a
0:09:26 long time phil i don't know if that's in
0:09:28 the cards for others
0:09:30 johnny kind of half-heartedly smirks at
0:09:32 that
0:09:33 pats him on the shoulder and heads
0:09:36 inside to go talk to sheila
0:09:38 uh when you head inside it is bustling
0:09:41 with activity you can kind of hear all
0:09:43 of the classic sounds drinks
0:09:46 bustling for the sherwood is like what
0:09:48 six people no it's actually uh it's
0:09:51 actually legitimately oh all right
0:09:53 bustling uh with activity right now um
0:09:57 but it's not a friday or you're not
0:10:00 really sure yeah
0:10:02 that kind of i think i think the concept
0:10:04 of of friday saturday so that's all kind
0:10:07 of outside of johnny's capacity to keep
0:10:10 in mind yeah so the crowd that's there
0:10:13 largely looks like it's from one crew of
0:10:17 people
0:10:18 um you know that like that's kind of
0:10:20 crowd where everyone seems to know each
0:10:21 other someone's got a birthday or
0:10:23 something yeah
0:10:24 and somebody's back in town or
0:10:27 yeah yeah and a lot of these these guys
0:10:30 are a little on the young side
0:10:32 loud and excitable uh all kind of
0:10:35 getting together and
0:10:36 getting absolutely hammered over their
0:10:39 winter vacation where's johnny's blood
0:10:42 pool at currently uh rome8010 oh boy
0:10:46 oh 10.
0:10:48 in that case
0:10:50 uh johnny is gonna spend a point of his
0:10:53 uh blood
0:10:54 to
0:10:56 swell up a little bit just so that
0:10:57 nobody wants to mess with him just so i
0:11:00 look a little bit extra dangerous as i
0:11:02 kind of walk over the bar
0:11:04 as you approach the bar there's a
0:11:06 handful of these uh young excitable men
0:11:10 who are
0:11:11 [Music]
0:11:12 rather overtly complimenting sheila on
0:11:16 her appearance the ordering runs are
0:11:18 shots and she seems to be kind of
0:11:21 playing it safe and staying pretty well
0:11:22 behind the bar and out of arm's reach
0:11:24 kind of subtly indicating that
0:11:27 you know someone already made a grab at
0:11:29 her
0:11:30 uh she herself is you know she's a
0:11:33 good-looking young girl uh healthy and
0:11:36 she's dressed in kind of a a tight black
0:11:40 shirt that's kind of like a little
0:11:42 a bit of cleavage showing but you know
0:11:44 she's bartending so
0:11:46 she's wearing kind of like a tight skirt
0:11:48 her hair is kind of that long like raven
0:11:51 color that's so popular she's got total
0:11:53 like raccoon eyes for makeup she kind of
0:11:57 gives you this like nervous look as you
0:12:00 apply it as you approach as though uh
0:12:03 your intimidation factor is not just
0:12:05 applying to these like goons
0:12:08 but to her as well and they part away
0:12:11 admittedly begrudgingly as as you
0:12:14 approach johnny takes off his leather
0:12:16 jacket puts it on the seat adjacent and
0:12:19 then sits down at one of the seats of
0:12:20 the bar okay and that way he's taken up
0:12:23 some space yeah yeah he gonna mean mugs
0:12:26 some of the other guys for a while just
0:12:27 so they know to give him a little extra
0:12:29 space some of the guys uh they've got
0:12:31 like red new york yankees baseball caps
0:12:35 and like
0:12:36 big heavy thick coats they're wearing
0:12:39 bright colored sneakers
0:12:41 they've got their
0:12:43 haircuts like like kind of like buzz
0:12:45 cuts some of them blonde
0:12:48 soul patches and chin straps
0:12:51 so they definitely kind of like mean mug
0:12:52 you back but they like also hold each
0:12:54 other back to like protect you from
0:12:56 their incredible capacity for violence
0:12:59 eventually sheila leans on the bar and
0:13:02 she's like hey what are you drinking
0:13:04 oh
0:13:07 johnny kind of takes a look over at the
0:13:09 bar
0:13:10 trying to remember things that he used
0:13:11 to drink once upon a time uh
0:13:14 how about a uh what a manhattan
0:13:17 make one of those yeah you can have a
0:13:19 manhattan
0:13:20 yeah he nods and so his name waits
0:13:23 patiently for her to
0:13:24 she starts fixing you a drink
0:13:27 her name is johnny
0:13:29 uh she kind of pauses at that
0:13:31 you must be uh the new girl sheila phil
0:13:34 tell me a little bit about you well uh
0:13:36 well i don't think phil sends me
0:13:38 anywhere but he uh he definitely let me
0:13:41 know what was going on and
0:13:42 well i just got a big heart let's say
0:13:44 yeah takes a ashtray moves it closer to
0:13:47 him and
0:13:48 ashes in there a little bit
0:13:50 she slides your drink uh and actually
0:13:52 lights up herself kind of sharing an
0:13:54 ashtray with you and johnny just tips
0:13:57 the rocks glass and kind of just looks
0:13:59 in it but doesn't ever leave the table
0:14:01 yeah
0:14:04 phil likes to get in other people's
0:14:05 business is what i'm gathering from this
0:14:08 well
0:14:09 he's a good soul
0:14:11 anytime he's gotten anybody else's
0:14:13 business it probably needed to happen
0:14:15 but he also knows
0:14:17 when to leave things be and when it is
0:14:19 serious enough that he does have to do
0:14:21 that
0:14:22 why is that uh is he getting into
0:14:23 someone's business he shouldn't be doing
0:14:25 it's like she gives you two looks at
0:14:27 once
0:14:28 one sheepish and clearly feeling a
0:14:31 little called out by what you're
0:14:33 inferring the other look
0:14:36 is kind of uh a resolved expression like
0:14:40 like she can take care of herself and
0:14:42 and maybe you know if she handles this
0:14:45 her way
0:14:46 this problem might go away she says so
0:14:48 many things to you all at once with just
0:14:49 a look she bats her like
0:14:52 big blue eyes at you and
0:14:55 sort of grumbles when she bats eyes at
0:14:57 johnny he actually kind of like
0:14:59 gets a little bit darker in the
0:15:02 expression like don't pull [ __ ] with
0:15:04 me girl oh
0:15:06 she pauses at that
0:15:10 you know what fine i'll talk to you but
0:15:13 afterwards i want to be left alone you
0:15:14 don't need to be running errands for
0:15:16 phil and i don't need anyone running
0:15:18 errands for phil now with regard to my
0:15:20 life
0:15:20 you know
0:15:22 i do a lot of work in this city i move a
0:15:25 lot of things
0:15:26 i talk to a lot of people
0:15:28 but one thing i don't abide by is anyone
0:15:30 calling me a [ __ ] errand boy so you
0:15:33 tell me what's going on
0:15:35 do not lie to me
0:15:37 and we'll have a good night her uh
0:15:41 bristling at the idea of you helping her
0:15:43 kind of withers
0:15:45 ah
0:15:46 i need a cigarette do you want to talk
0:15:48 about
0:15:49 sure she puts out the cigarette that she
0:15:51 just lit calls to her friend tammy this
0:15:54 this woman with like blonde hair and
0:15:56 blue eyes that kind of comes over
0:15:58 and
0:15:58 tammy takes over and
0:16:01 she kind of cuts through the back
0:16:03 and just seems to kind of assume
0:16:06 phil approves of you being able to
0:16:07 follow her right along the path she's
0:16:09 taken
0:16:12 [Music]
0:16:15 you head out back with sheila and
0:16:19 the two find yourselves beside these
0:16:21 like old
0:16:23 rust covered dumpsters she lights up
0:16:25 this menthol smelling
0:16:28 newport cigarette she gives you a look
0:16:31 like
0:16:32 maybe feels right about something
0:16:34 because you can you can recognize the
0:16:37 fear in her eyes and it's the fear of
0:16:39 someone who has brushed with
0:16:42 some of the dark secrets of the world
0:16:44 that kind of changed someone forever
0:16:46 johnny uh never stopped smoking the
0:16:48 cigarette he was smoking inside the bar
0:16:50 heads out leans on the dumpster next to
0:16:52 her and then uses a maneuver that he's
0:16:55 practiced a long time in his work as a
0:16:57 volley bully boy which is
0:17:00 now is the time to kind of switch from
0:17:02 bad cop to good cop so he's his vision
0:17:04 kind of crystallizes with awe
0:17:07 tell me what's going on
0:17:09 she takes a
0:17:11 nervous
0:17:12 breath and kind of again stares at you
0:17:15 with these haunted eyes i was seeing
0:17:17 someone named eddie and eddie
0:17:20 was
0:17:21 involved in
0:17:22 some sort of uh
0:17:24 trafficking you know from
0:17:27 from bridgeport to new york on the ferry
0:17:30 and
0:17:31 long story short
0:17:32 he got mixed up with some people and uh
0:17:37 iran um during the course of his running
0:17:41 he was he was in new york he took
0:17:44 he took the subway to get away uh and he
0:17:49 saw something he saw something yeah and
0:17:53 whatever it was
0:17:55 i don't know he says
0:17:56 he says that he doesn't think it was
0:17:58 human and it bit him scratched him
0:18:01 something happened but by the time he
0:18:02 got home he was bleeding and and
0:18:05 he got really sick
0:18:08 the other night
0:18:09 actually like uh
0:18:11 right after my interview here um he took
0:18:14 off from home with this
0:18:16 look in his eyes like he was it was
0:18:18 insane and
0:18:20 you know no one can find him no one's
0:18:22 heard from him but every now and again
0:18:24 when i'm walking you know home or or
0:18:27 outrunning errands i swear to god johnny
0:18:30 i see him i think he's following me
0:18:33 i want you to think long and hard about
0:18:35 this next question i'm gonna ask you
0:18:37 okay
0:18:38 what do you want
0:18:40 i i think
0:18:42 eddie has some sort of like
0:18:44 rabies or something i'm not asking you
0:18:46 what you think i'm asking you what do
0:18:48 you want i want to feel like i'm not
0:18:50 being followed i want to feel like i'm
0:18:52 not going to end up with whatever it is
0:18:54 that it's got him sick
0:18:56 so you want eddie to go away
0:18:59 she looks
0:19:01 ashamed
0:19:02 and can't quite form the words
0:19:05 but you know that's what she wants
0:19:07 johnny kind of gives her a hard look but
0:19:10 nods reassuringly at her drags down the
0:19:13 rest of the uh of the marlboro all the
0:19:15 way down to the filter throws it at the
0:19:18 ground and then heads back through the
0:19:19 bar
0:19:21 she leans against the wall and
0:19:23 as you're kind of going you can see she
0:19:25 just sparks up another and seems
0:19:27 determined
0:19:29 to chain smoke as long as she can with
0:19:31 this impromptu break that she's taking
0:19:33 he actually puts a hand out and catches
0:19:34 himself on the doorframe
0:19:36 when are you getting off tonight
0:19:38 uh 2 30. he looks at his watch and kind
0:19:41 of figures out when about how much time
0:19:43 he's got for all kinds of things
0:19:45 continues on
0:19:47 [Music]
0:19:52 so
0:19:53 johnny's got two things he's got to get
0:19:55 done tonight yep um you think basically
0:19:57 he figures if this thing is following
0:19:59 her whatever happened to him and there's
0:20:01 a whole host of things that could be
0:20:03 that are running through his head his
0:20:05 best bet is to probably tail her
0:20:07 see if he can spot anybody else doing
0:20:09 the same but he's also got to get this
0:20:12 girl
0:20:14 where she needs to go
0:20:15 and he has an idea about what he wants
0:20:17 to do with her kabir has talked to
0:20:21 johnny about lupines
0:20:23 yes
0:20:24 yes
0:20:25 they are out in the woods
0:20:28 not too far from here right what did we
0:20:31 say it was um
0:20:33 what was the farm you guys went to that
0:20:34 was in that was in wallingford yeah and
0:20:36 it's that's probably the closest area
0:20:38 where i'm i'm pretty sure yeah it's kind
0:20:40 of around wallingford off to like around
0:20:43 meriden middletown almost overall like
0:20:46 sleeping giants over by there right yeah
0:20:48 that's probably giant castle craig a lot
0:20:51 of
0:20:52 those places are the places that kabir
0:20:54 talked about you know stories about you
0:20:56 know lupines being
0:20:59 very aggressive
0:21:01 and destroying
0:21:02 stupid kindred that infringe upon their
0:21:04 homes
0:21:05 sleeping giant is out going basically
0:21:08 going through anarch territory to get
0:21:09 there right
0:21:10 i think johnny will probably give that a
0:21:12 shot okay he figures that the last thing
0:21:15 i need is to be running into any
0:21:16 elements of the sabbat while i'm doing
0:21:18 this they might be less likely to
0:21:20 crusade through a anarch area while
0:21:23 they're currently going after camarine
0:21:25 territory at least that's my thought
0:21:27 does that make sense at all yeah don't
0:21:28 want to stir up two nests when you're
0:21:30 when you're really just going for one
0:21:31 right the spots the ammo
0:21:34 specifically with the pack the killing
0:21:35 spree is that their target isn't
0:21:38 actually the camera look kindred yeah
0:21:40 their intent is actually to risk the
0:21:42 masquerade as frequently and as hard as
0:21:45 possible so that it becomes a resource
0:21:47 drain for the camera which means that
0:21:48 when the actual crusade happens the
0:21:50 camera is so on the back foot that it's
0:21:53 pretty much already done and i figure
0:21:54 that there might be a chance that that
0:21:56 they're actually staying in our
0:21:58 territory but if they're sleeping there
0:22:00 their abbot is probably not trying to
0:22:01 cause any trouble because they don't
0:22:03 want their home base operations so like
0:22:06 as a general rule nomadic pets don't
0:22:08 specs don't [ __ ] where they in this case
0:22:10 that might be the safest route is to
0:22:11 find a spot where where they are staying
0:22:13 to travel through it right that's kind
0:22:15 of what i'm thinking i think i'm going
0:22:16 to go through anarch territory to get
0:22:17 over to sleeping giant because i want to
0:22:19 try and return this body to her ken folk
0:22:21 okay uh she's going to take a route uh
0:22:24 or her
0:22:39 anarch territory intent on not drawing
0:22:42 actually a better question am i going to
0:22:44 have time to do that before she gets off
0:22:46 at 2 30 yes okay perfect
0:22:51 look at that a single success perfect
0:22:57 [Music]
0:23:00 you make your way to sleeping giant and
0:23:02 you kind of arrive to
0:23:04 a pretty simple parking lot there's a
0:23:07 lot of hiking trails that are arranged
0:23:09 everything's kind of closed up for the
0:23:11 night so you end up kind of having to
0:23:12 like actually kind of park right in
0:23:13 front of the parking lot you know again
0:23:16 there's a set of hiking trails that are
0:23:18 kind of marked with different colors
0:23:20 it's the white one that seems to kind of
0:23:23 lead uh deepest into the the wooded area
0:23:27 and is the mo the least traversed by
0:23:30 the kind he gets out of his uh extera
0:23:34 looks down at his pocket where the
0:23:35 cigarettes are and puts them back in the
0:23:37 uh truck he doesn't want to take chance
0:23:40 that he lights up in there because he's
0:23:42 heard tales that these things can smell
0:23:45 out anything so he knows he probably
0:23:47 already reeks of cigarettes but he
0:23:49 doesn't need to be smoke sparking up a
0:23:51 new one and drawing attention
0:23:54 and he will then open up the back and
0:23:57 gingerly pick up the uh the tarp with
0:24:00 the girl
0:24:02 actually before he picks her up i think
0:24:03 he actually pulls it back a little bit
0:24:05 and just takes a look at her to make
0:24:07 sure that she's
0:24:08 presentable
0:24:10 and that's when you see that he's
0:24:11 actually taken the time to like buy some
0:24:13 clothes
0:24:14 wash her from some of the blood
0:24:17 and just try to like be as respectful as
0:24:19 he can to the uh the corpse of this poor
0:24:22 young girl
0:24:23 gives her kind of one last look to make
0:24:25 she's sure that things are in order and
0:24:27 then wraps her back up picks her up and
0:24:29 starts walking up the trail the moment
0:24:33 you
0:24:34 feel like the crunch of
0:24:37 cold earth
0:24:39 beneath your boots
0:24:41 you start to feel as though
0:24:44 you're not alone and it is this
0:24:46 foreboding presence
0:24:49 that always feel it it's the feeling
0:24:51 like like there's someone right behind
0:24:53 you with a hand outreached and just
0:24:56 barely not touching like the back of
0:24:58 your neck your ears your hair that that
0:25:01 like kind of static energy that you feel
0:25:03 when you know someone is right behind
0:25:05 you you feel it every step you take
0:25:08 along the way
0:25:09 once again he uses his
0:25:11 ample blood supply tonight to
0:25:14 heighten all of his
0:25:16 physical senses
0:25:18 he makes himself stronger faster more
0:25:20 ready to take a punch
0:25:22 because
0:25:23 he starts to get the kind of feeling
0:25:25 like i'm not gonna make it out of this
0:25:27 without some kind of fight you can feel
0:25:29 the echoes of your beast rise it rattles
0:25:33 in its cage and tries to force you to
0:25:36 turn back i need a raw trek check
0:25:41 the difficulty of this check is five
0:25:44 and that's courage
0:25:45 it is
0:25:48 three successes okay with steely nerves
0:25:52 uh you clench that like draw line of
0:25:54 yours and you push on through
0:25:58 you kind of start to wind up
0:26:00 the side of this cliff for you it's it's
0:26:04 actually a pretty easy walk but up
0:26:07 towards the top
0:26:09 you reach this point where there's the
0:26:10 open sky overhead it's a clearing
0:26:13 there's the ruins of old structures that
0:26:16 had been built here a long time ago
0:26:18 you start to feel like
0:26:20 maybe
0:26:21 this is a place where maybe i could put
0:26:22 her to rest right and where her kind
0:26:25 will likely find her
0:26:27 right
0:26:28 finds a good clear spot opensight to the
0:26:31 sky
0:26:32 gently lays her down reaches into his
0:26:35 jacket and pulls out a small little note
0:26:38 written on the inside it just says
0:26:42 i'm sorry
0:26:44 folds that up puts it in with her
0:26:47 and kind of slowly backs away
0:26:49 keeping his eyes on the tree line and
0:26:52 starts to take steps towards the trail
0:26:54 when you take a step towards the trail
0:26:56 you actually catch the glimpse
0:26:59 of a flashlight that shines towards you
0:27:03 looking at you from the trail itself is
0:27:06 a
0:27:08 older woman
0:27:09 she's probably
0:27:10 actually maybe a little older than you
0:27:13 she looks startled to see you there
0:27:16 there's a couple things that you notice
0:27:18 about her right away her eyes are this
0:27:19 kind of uncomfortably light light light
0:27:22 blue and that kind of um
0:27:24 takes on this like sheen and you kind of
0:27:27 recognize that
0:27:29 her a lot of her features her bone
0:27:30 structure
0:27:31 her now graying blonde hair
0:27:34 kind of resembles
0:27:36 the the young woman that you brought
0:27:38 here
0:27:39 she nervously looks at you kind of like
0:27:42 as weary of you as you are of her
0:27:45 she kind of leans on her back leg
0:27:48 and
0:27:49 you catch a glimpse that
0:27:51 along her her right side versus the side
0:27:54 kind of facing away from you
0:27:56 you can kind of see
0:27:58 a rifle like a like a hunting rifle
0:28:01 around her neck is this
0:28:04 on a thong this like little
0:28:07 iron
0:28:08 medallion that kind of resembles
0:28:12 a small
0:28:13 handled hammer designed from nordic not
0:28:16 work
0:28:18 her weariness
0:28:20 gives way to
0:28:21 anger when
0:28:23 she kind of like looks and sees
0:28:26 what you've done
0:28:30 johnny outstretches his hands and just
0:28:32 very calmly and collected
0:28:36 this is a peace offering
0:28:40 what do you what do you what do you
0:28:42 what do you mean a peace offering our
0:28:45 eyes immediately start to water
0:28:47 my kind
0:28:49 stole this girl
0:28:51 and are responsible for her death
0:28:53 but i wanted to make sure she was
0:28:55 returned to your people
0:28:57 what is your kind
0:29:00 those who drink blood
0:29:02 leech
0:29:03 he kind of bows his head kind of in
0:29:05 shame
0:29:07 when my husband
0:29:08 hears about this
0:29:10 his his rage
0:29:13 the things he will do
0:29:15 you're right to be angry i know that
0:29:18 okay like does this look like like
0:29:21 though you're much bigger than her she
0:29:22 is ready to fight
0:29:25 my name's johnny
0:29:26 if your husband needs revenge i won't
0:29:28 deny him that
0:29:30 and he slowly starts kind of backing off
0:29:33 she kind of steps to the side
0:29:36 seemingly
0:29:37 willing to fight but not actually
0:29:40 convinced she could win
0:29:41 and
0:29:42 as you move towards the trail she kind
0:29:45 of passes you and kind of just as
0:29:48 careful of what you might do
0:29:50 she makes her way to her daughter
0:29:54 bloody tears kind of start welling up in
0:29:56 johnny's eyes
0:29:59 it wasn't the court of new haven that
0:30:00 stole her
0:30:02 all of your kindness of plague you're
0:30:04 not wrong and we are it's cure he looks
0:30:07 at her really
0:30:08 sadly
0:30:10 i wish that were true
0:30:12 he kind of puts his hands up she kind of
0:30:15 gives you this look like
0:30:16 she does too
0:30:18 and he turns around and he starts just
0:30:20 walking down the trail slowly he's
0:30:22 basically kind of
0:30:24 fine with if she needs to take a parting
0:30:26 shot it's probably not the worst thing
0:30:28 on some level you can
0:30:30 you can kind of sense that the
0:30:32 reasonable side of her
0:30:34 has pieced together this gesture that
0:30:36 you've made but all sense of logic is
0:30:38 lost in in her need to grieve for her
0:30:41 daughter and her focus becomes on that
0:30:43 and you do not find yourself
0:30:46 attacked by her at all as you back away
0:30:48 onto the trail
0:30:49 once he gets back down to the truck he
0:30:51 kind of like wipes away some of the the
0:30:53 blood you know that that's now staining
0:30:55 his cheeks
0:30:56 wrenches open the car door pulls out the
0:30:59 pack of cigarettes immediately pull
0:31:00 sticks one in his mouth and lights it up
0:31:02 and when you kind of like light that
0:31:04 cigarette as though it's kind of this
0:31:06 serendipitous moment nearby
0:31:09 where you are there's there's actually
0:31:11 kind of like a number of like homes
0:31:14 back from the top of sleeping giant you
0:31:17 hear this
0:31:19 this howl
0:31:21 that
0:31:22 echoes and booms and you can kind of
0:31:24 like
0:31:25 feel the xterra shake like the trees
0:31:29 kind of like shake lights and homes
0:31:33 start
0:31:34 flickering on
0:31:36 this whole area becomes frightened by
0:31:40 whatever anthem has been howled from on
0:31:43 top of that mountain
0:31:44 johnny keeps his
0:31:47 tries to keep his cool
0:31:49 one hand on his beast
0:31:51 the other one on the steering wheel the
0:31:53 exterior puts it into drive
0:31:55 and starts heading out almost certain
0:31:58 that that's probably not going to be the
0:32:00 last time he hears that howl you make
0:32:02 your way back i'm not sure whether or
0:32:04 not you're being watched that feeling it
0:32:06 takes a while for it to leave but
0:32:08 eventually you arrive to the sherwood
0:32:10 cafe
0:32:14 [Music]
0:32:17 before uh before 2 30
0:32:19 yep perfect before 2 30.
0:32:22 and phil is
0:32:24 standing outside he's smoking a
0:32:25 cigarette he kind of gives you a wave
0:32:26 when he spots the xterra and makes his
0:32:29 way over to you to speak with you when
0:32:31 the when the suv pulls up hey how's it
0:32:34 going
0:32:35 good good uh how did the the talk go i
0:32:38 learned some interesting things
0:32:40 but i was right though right
0:32:42 something's wrong i think you're right
0:32:44 okay
0:32:45 look
0:32:46 you and i we have
0:32:48 an arrangement you help out when we need
0:32:50 you and i promise you this is not one of
0:32:52 those situations where we're crying wolf
0:32:55 we feel you never cry wolf
0:32:58 thank you and i appreciate what you do
0:33:00 to look out for
0:33:01 my home
0:33:02 i'm glad we have an understanding i
0:33:04 understand sheila was a little rude to
0:33:06 you and i'll talk to her about that no
0:33:08 no no
0:33:09 i uh
0:33:10 i like to make mountains out of mole
0:33:12 hills
0:33:13 it also helps her understand that i'm
0:33:15 not uh
0:33:17 i'm not the usual kind of clientele that
0:33:19 she can just kind of bat around with her
0:33:21 eyes
0:33:22 yeah well she'll do that she thinks you
0:33:23 can get away with it lord knows yeah i
0:33:26 know a couple like her well uh i got
0:33:28 something for you no
0:33:30 yeah uh
0:33:32 so it's a small gesture and
0:33:34 he actually heads over to his car which
0:33:37 is actually parked not too far from
0:33:38 yours and out of the passenger seat he
0:33:40 retrieves a carton of marlboro
0:33:43 cigarettes that is shy one pack and
0:33:46 uh it's like for your trouble oh phil if
0:33:49 i could blush i might be doing it right
0:33:51 now
0:33:52 all right well i'ma get back to work but
0:33:54 thank you you got it old friend he heads
0:33:56 on inside and a lot of the
0:33:59 the young troublemakers that were
0:34:00 present earlier have kind of laughed
0:34:02 things have significantly wind down
0:34:04 they're more return to normal so johnny
0:34:07 is going to move the exterior into a
0:34:09 position where he can kind of keep eyes
0:34:11 on the parking lot off of the sherwood
0:34:14 so he can watch when sheila leaves gets
0:34:17 into her car and he's just gonna
0:34:19 shadow her and see if he can spot
0:34:22 anybody else doing the same okay so
0:34:25 you sit by and you watch and uh shortly
0:34:29 after 2 30 it looks like they've kind of
0:34:31 busted everything down and are ready to
0:34:33 go for the night and sheila makes her
0:34:35 way out of uh the back waves goodbye and
0:34:40 she actually kind of tucks her hands
0:34:43 into this big puffy navy blue coat that
0:34:46 she has and she starts kind of walking
0:34:50 johnny kind of shocked that she's just
0:34:52 walking back uh grabs up a few items in
0:34:55 the exterior pack of smokes make sure
0:34:57 his jacket's on and then
0:35:00 slowly and quietly gets out shuts the
0:35:02 door and locks it and he'll actually
0:35:03 start tailing her on foot okay i'll give
0:35:05 me decks with stealth
0:35:09 hey i got one success okay she does not
0:35:11 seem to notice uh you following along
0:35:14 it's about 20 minutes into the walk
0:35:17 that you start to notice that someone
0:35:20 else is following her this person while
0:35:22 they walk they kind of like shiver if
0:35:24 they're not wearing a coat or anything
0:35:26 they're just kind of wearing like a big
0:35:27 white t-shirt and baggy jeans this
0:35:30 uncomfortable twitchy shivering person
0:35:33 just kinda
0:35:34 starts heading towards her she does not
0:35:37 seem aware though she is wary she keeps
0:35:39 looking around and and is definitely
0:35:42 concerned that there's some sort of
0:35:43 trouble
0:35:44 but does not seem to have spotted me yet
0:35:46 and he goes as far as like ducking
0:35:49 behind cars he's not even just stalking
0:35:52 her like a typical stalker he's stalking
0:35:54 her like an animal stalk someone so two
0:35:57 things
0:35:58 johnny
0:35:59 is not sure
0:36:01 i think johnny's actually been to new
0:36:02 york a couple of times just in in his
0:36:05 line of work does not like going there
0:36:08 no he looks pretty bad you know he's
0:36:10 probably heard some rumors about some of
0:36:12 the things but i don't know if he's
0:36:13 actually heard about anything going on
0:36:15 down in the sewers necessarily there are
0:36:18 urban legends that exist actually better
0:36:20 yeah
0:36:21 how about i give you an occult check and
0:36:23 you can tell me what he may have heard
0:36:25 yeah about that is that all right yeah
0:36:28 one success okay uh so with one success
0:36:31 you know about two things that go into
0:36:33 the stores and are aware that there are
0:36:35 more uh one of them is that there is a
0:36:38 legend of a massive massive white
0:36:40 alligator that resides in the new york
0:36:43 source
0:36:44 it is known to have consumed and
0:36:47 gobbled up numerous
0:36:49 workers that have gone down there in the
0:36:51 past as well as
0:36:52 the homeless it's actually kind of
0:36:53 particularly among the homeless that
0:36:55 this urban legend exists but that
0:36:57 doesn't line up because he he got bit by
0:37:00 something
0:37:01 and managed to get away the other thing
0:37:03 is a little stranger
0:37:04 that talks about
0:37:06 strange spongy fleshy
0:37:09 monsters
0:37:10 that exist deep underneath new york city
0:37:12 and the rumor has it that the nosferatu
0:37:15 have been fighting with these things
0:37:19 for a few years now trying to maintain
0:37:23 their subterranean control of new york
0:37:25 now when i when i think back on that and
0:37:28 i look at the way that this guy is
0:37:29 quivering am i at all reminded of the
0:37:32 zantosa house
0:37:33 not
0:37:34 physically but you do get a bad feeling
0:37:38 like in some way on some level these
0:37:41 things are connected he's gonna
0:37:43 start to pick up the pace a little bit
0:37:45 and try and get a little bit closer
0:37:47 and before
0:37:49 this thing even gets close enough to
0:37:51 sheila to pounce johnny wants to pounce
0:37:54 on him and pull him right into an alcove
0:37:56 out of line of sight okay uh give me a
0:37:59 another dex plus stealth do i have any
0:38:02 willpower at this point it's been a
0:38:04 couple of nights
0:38:05 uh you'll have refreshed four willpower
0:38:07 okay that'd also count for like the the
0:38:09 girl that i returned because i feel like
0:38:10 that would be a mm-hmm that'd be a
0:38:12 refresher of willpower for johnny is uh
0:38:14 nature's caregivers oh yeah definitely
0:38:17 all right dex bliss stealth yes sir uh
0:38:19 i'll spend willpower on this okay and
0:38:21 actually um i'll spend three more blood
0:38:25 just to pump up dex uh strength and
0:38:28 constitution or stamina i'm sorry
0:38:32 four successes okay uh so you're gonna
0:38:34 be able to use those as dice for an
0:38:36 ambush perfect and you are successfully
0:38:39 poised to ambush this opponent yes
0:38:41 you're gonna roll uh dex plus brawl plus
0:38:44 four dice from the stealth and then two
0:38:46 dice from striking from behind would
0:38:48 sucker basically they're hitting him
0:38:49 with a tackle from behind into this into
0:38:51 a thing would that be considered street
0:38:52 fighting yes okay absolutely i'll get
0:38:55 the
0:38:56 only two successes okay i rolled a bunch
0:38:58 of ones
0:38:59 uh grapple uh
0:39:00 yeah i figure actually okay and i will
0:39:03 spend an extra blood for celerity for an
0:39:05 extra action uh so you're gonna use that
0:39:06 in actual rounds okay uh so for now did
0:39:09 you roll the die for celerity on your
0:39:11 attacker no i didn't
0:39:13 oh actually
0:39:14 since i get to do more i'll roll two
0:39:16 more so that's one more success two more
0:39:18 successes okay
0:39:20 uh so with four successes you grab him
0:39:22 and pull him into an alley the alley
0:39:23 itself is covered in grime it's again
0:39:25 it's so cold so there's there's little
0:39:27 puddles that are completely kind of
0:39:28 frozen over and in this case the wet
0:39:31 slick ground from whatever slime it is
0:39:33 that that people dump out this way is
0:39:35 frozen so this is all kind of very
0:39:37 slippery you grab him and you're no no
0:39:40 no no no um and i will just smash him
0:39:43 into the wall to try and knock the
0:39:45 breath out of him okay uh give me an
0:39:47 initiative roll 15. okay uh so you're
0:39:50 going to go first okay so what are you
0:39:51 doing the first thing i'm going to do is
0:39:53 i'm going to slam now that i haven't
0:39:55 grappled i'm gonna slam him against the
0:39:56 brick wall to knock the breath out of
0:39:58 him and that i figure will do one of two
0:40:01 things it'll either stun him a little
0:40:02 bit or it'll tell me that this guy does
0:40:04 not have breath to knock out of him okay
0:40:06 give me a uh dexter sprawl
0:40:09 successes okay give me a strength role
0:40:12 uh with potence and two successes from
0:40:15 attack can i just add blood to uh to
0:40:17 auto potence i will
0:40:20 uh seven levels of uh bashing damage
0:40:23 he soaks three
0:40:24 he definitely seems to uh have an active
0:40:26 like respiratory system and he
0:40:28 definitely breathes and you kind of
0:40:29 knock the wind out of him but his eyes
0:40:31 don't move together um
0:40:34 and
0:40:34 when his face contorts into like an
0:40:38 aggressive reaction it doesn't contort
0:40:40 in a humane way
0:40:42 with like an overly long tongue and
0:40:45 sharp teeth eddie glares at you he's
0:40:48 like no no no
0:40:49 and we'll rake at you with
0:40:52 these bone spurs that exude pat through
0:40:55 the tips of his fingers turning into
0:40:57 like strange claws and
0:40:59 we have to break the grapple first uh
0:41:01 that is his plan okay so first let's try
0:41:03 to break the grapple
0:41:05 and that's an opposed strength check
0:41:06 strength brawl
0:41:08 plus brawl too you say
0:41:11 nine successes okay he had two so uh you
0:41:14 will maintain control did you have any
0:41:16 extra actions this round i did it's all
0:41:17 i knew seeing that his tongue is
0:41:20 ascended sharp and
0:41:22 whatever the hell this thing is i'm
0:41:24 going to put it down and i'll ask the
0:41:27 domain about it later okay seeing that
0:41:29 he has a functioning respiratory system
0:41:32 i feel confident that i can probably
0:41:34 just smash its head into the brick wall
0:41:37 and
0:41:37 get it to stop moving so he's gonna rear
0:41:40 back with him and once again smash him
0:41:42 even harder into the wall really leaning
0:41:44 in with the potence to just splatter
0:41:46 whatever's left of his brain few hero
0:41:51 five successes four roll over into
0:41:53 damage i will spend
0:41:55 i will not spend i'll just use my
0:41:57 potence this ah that's a tough i will
0:42:00 spend for potence i just gotta i gotta
0:42:02 drink now started off with some blood
0:42:04 and i've used most of it
0:42:06 i know right run hot baby all right so
0:42:11 so three levels plus the force of seven
0:42:14 more bashing damage uh he falls
0:42:16 unconscious and kind of goes limp but
0:42:18 even while he's unconscious the body
0:42:20 twitches and like roils as though
0:42:22 something's underneath his skin he drops
0:42:25 the body unconscious and then
0:42:27 immediately puts a boot to just finish
0:42:29 him off okay do not ask questions you
0:42:31 execute him and
0:42:33 uh put your boot through his skull the
0:42:35 skull seems
0:42:36 soft
0:42:37 it's more like a cardboard and a grape
0:42:40 than it is like anything that's like a
0:42:42 solid bone when it breaks and this
0:42:45 tissue tears you can see this orangey
0:42:49 [ __ ] moss that kind of spills out of
0:42:52 his skull and this muck kind of like
0:42:55 sticks and kind of stretches like
0:42:57 mozzarella cheese when you like lift
0:42:59 your boot off of where you made the kill
0:43:01 and you scrape it on like the icy cold
0:43:05 like grimy ground and it's just like
0:43:08 everywhere and it seeps and slurps and
0:43:11 it is just a terrible experience
0:43:15 he kind of just
0:43:16 recoils and disgust at this thing the
0:43:19 body kind of twitches at first it's
0:43:21 clearly death spasms and you're used to
0:43:23 that sort of thing he backs off a few
0:43:25 steps
0:43:26 and
0:43:27 pulls out the lighter that he took from
0:43:29 phil
0:43:30 strikes it and kind of holds it down
0:43:32 towards the body the body wiggles and
0:43:35 like rides as though
0:43:37 whatever it is that's uh controlling
0:43:39 this host is reacting to the presence of
0:43:42 fire irritated by it but it's all silent
0:43:45 because his head is gone so it's just
0:43:46 this headless corpse writhing and
0:43:49 wiggling and almost panicking when
0:43:51 confronted by fire johnny just takes a
0:43:54 look around
0:43:55 this
0:43:56 body's gotta go and he's trying to think
0:43:58 of ways to to help it along you know you
0:44:01 actually recognize the smell where do i
0:44:04 recognize it from it smells like the
0:44:07 weeping bear and the mongrel monster
0:44:09 that had to be put down before it
0:44:12 he's going to um
0:44:14 look back the exterior is quite a ways
0:44:16 away from here isn't it it's about it
0:44:18 was about a 20-minute walk before he got
0:44:19 to this point he'll walk over are there
0:44:21 any cars parked on the road yes he'll go
0:44:23 kind of like looking in the windows of a
0:44:24 few cars to see if he can like spot
0:44:27 anything to help him out what are you
0:44:28 looking for to help you out i think
0:44:30 ideally he's looking for something to
0:44:31 start a small fire at least i mean in a
0:44:34 pinch he could like smash open like a uh
0:44:36 the gas tank on a car and and get gas
0:44:38 but that's such a [ __ ] mess he's now
0:44:40 he's looking at full-on masquerade
0:44:42 breach if somebody catches him lighting
0:44:44 a car on fire and stuff like it could
0:44:46 get bad do you have a investigation
0:44:48 maybe some like if i can see some like
0:44:50 newspaper like just like some kindling
0:44:52 so i can start a small fire right on
0:44:54 this kind of like door stoop where his
0:44:56 body is right he does have a point of
0:44:58 investigation all right give me a
0:45:00 perception plus
0:45:02 investigation success with one success
0:45:06 you are
0:45:07 able to find the back of a station wagon
0:45:10 the old ones have like the the the wood
0:45:12 looking siding to them yeah in the back
0:45:15 there is uh a stack of like a big
0:45:20 [ __ ] stacks of newspapers uh that
0:45:23 have not yet been delivered and
0:45:25 a blanket beautiful it's like one of
0:45:27 those old kind of fuzzy blankets
0:45:28 johnny's gonna take a look around make
0:45:30 sure that no one's watching at least no
0:45:32 one is obviously like watching her like
0:45:34 getting interested and coming over give
0:45:36 a sharp elbow to the uh to the window on
0:45:39 the uh
0:45:41 it breaks open there's no car alarm on
0:45:43 this he'll reach in and kind of unlatch
0:45:45 the uh the trunk push up that door and
0:45:47 gather some of the uh some of that
0:45:49 newspaper and kind of just crush it up
0:45:51 into little balls and he'll just start
0:45:52 throwing the balls of crushed up paper
0:45:54 into the little alcove where this body
0:45:56 is just wriggling when you return to the
0:45:59 lock of you find that the body is like
0:46:02 10 feet further down the alley
0:46:05 i'll throw the blanket on top of him
0:46:08 kind of like roll him up in that hoist
0:46:10 it and maybe there's like an empty
0:46:11 dumpster somewhere there's trash cans
0:46:13 like you know the old like trash barrels
0:46:15 that her homeless would use to with a
0:46:17 little bit a little bit of johnny saxon
0:46:19 uh uh elbow grease he's gonna take this
0:46:22 blanket full of goo and just stuff it
0:46:24 into a metal garbage can easily
0:46:26 accomplished he'll uh then take some of
0:46:29 those uh some of the the newspaper kind
0:46:32 of just stuff it in there just get some
0:46:33 a bunch of dry stuff to help it kind of
0:46:35 go up and he'll uh start a fire though
0:46:38 it is headless you can hear a squealing
0:46:41 that's it's kind of like when a lobster
0:46:43 gets dropped into boiling water
0:46:46 soon after whatever it is falls limp and
0:46:50 simply burns
0:46:52 johnny will go back
0:46:54 walk down a few blocks grab the exterior
0:46:56 drive back this way
0:46:58 park outside the alley and by this time
0:47:01 go back to check to see what what the
0:47:02 state of this is you make arrangements
0:47:04 by the time you get back body's done the
0:47:07 remains in the garbage can how uh how
0:47:09 human do those look at this point it
0:47:12 looks like just kind of like burning
0:47:14 meat it's kind of hard to tell exactly
0:47:16 what's going on
0:47:17 i mean if like a police officer or
0:47:19 someone who knows what they're doing is
0:47:21 to take a look this would probably be
0:47:22 identified as a human body up right now
0:47:24 it just kind of smells like burning
0:47:26 flesh and is just a little hunk of meat
0:47:29 burning inside of that can yeah that's
0:47:31 good good enough for government and it
0:47:33 burns well
0:47:35 kind of satisfy with the fact that this
0:47:37 is done and gone he'll leave that as it
0:47:40 is a burned up body in new haven is a
0:47:42 pretty terrible thing to have to find
0:47:44 but not necessarily
0:47:46 gonna immediately draw back to the court
0:47:49 it'll be on the news for a day yeah
0:47:51 gives kind of a heavy sigh make double
0:47:53 checks himself over
0:47:54 none of the the mozzarella flesh has
0:47:57 stuck to you uh you're probably okay and
0:48:00 with that he'll pack it up and probably
0:48:02 head back to his haven okay
0:48:08 [Music]
0:48:12 you make it back to the haven smelling
0:48:14 like cigarettes and burning flesh by and
0:48:16 large the night sound at the bar it's
0:48:19 quiet and it's just you and
0:48:21 a little record player and a little bit
0:48:24 of silence
0:48:25 you can hear his beast kind of hungrily
0:48:27 growling at his at his insides
0:48:30 but he just ends up popping open a new
0:48:32 pack of cigarettes from the curtain phil
0:48:34 got him
0:48:35 pulls that another one and
0:48:37 goes over to his records
0:48:39 picks something a little bit
0:48:41 easier going
0:48:43 puts it on the player and then just lays
0:48:44 in the cot and
0:48:46 waits for the sun to come up and sleep
0:48:49 to take over
0:48:50 johnny listens to music that kind of
0:48:53 soothes
0:48:54 his beast
0:48:56 and eventually he finds himself falling
0:48:59 into a restless sleep
