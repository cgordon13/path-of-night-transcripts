0:00:00 path of night is an actual play vampire
0:00:02 the masquerade podcast set in the
0:00:03 classic world of darkness we're all
0:00:05 friends we're here to have fun but our
0:00:07 story can include graphic violence drug
0:00:09 use sexual content and other mature
0:00:11 themes we've talked at our table about
0:00:13 safety comfort and consent both as
0:00:15 players and storytellers we know what to
0:00:17 expect we're all excited to be here and
0:00:18 we want you to feel the same so listener
0:00:20 discretion is advice
0:00:22 now let's walk the path of night
0:00:26 [Music]
0:00:49 [Music]
0:00:53 it has
0:00:55 been some time a lot of the quarterly
0:00:56 has been handling their own personal
0:00:58 business leaving you with an opportunity
0:01:01 to finish any preparations you need to
0:01:04 make regarding your cafe if you can can
0:01:07 you go ahead and give me a quick
0:01:09 description as to what the cafe looks
0:01:10 like
0:01:11 the cafe was more empty when we first
0:01:14 saw it the computers are still in
0:01:16 orderly rows um the glass displays look
0:01:19 cleared of dust like they would be ready
0:01:21 for food for the mortals coming in the
0:01:24 cafe has a lot of windows
0:01:27 very few curtains uh blocking off the
0:01:29 windows during the day it would have
0:01:32 light streaming in during the night it
0:01:34 would have sort of that gauzy effect
0:01:37 blocking off the straight lights the
0:01:40 walls are covered in photographs
0:01:43 photographs of
0:01:44 paintings of travel
0:01:46 of nature and sort of a collage type of
0:01:49 effect it's a very
0:01:51 neat visually pleasing aesthetic light
0:01:54 colors
0:01:55 little edges of darkness in the details
0:01:58 modern designs for the time period
0:02:00 when you go through the door for the
0:02:02 kindred area the details they get darker
0:02:05 more delicate
0:02:06 there's dark wood in the bar
0:02:08 there's
0:02:09 booths so that people can have private
0:02:11 spaces
0:02:12 little hidden spots you get the sense
0:02:14 that if you were to test spaces you
0:02:16 might be able to find hidden
0:02:17 compartments you find
0:02:20 that it's taking some time to kind of
0:02:21 get everything in order but honestly the
0:02:23 labor of it has kind of allowed you to
0:02:26 decompress after a series of
0:02:29 ultra-violent events and the shock of
0:02:32 becoming kindred anyone in here would
0:02:35 notice that the area is perfectly clean
0:02:39 and meticulous sort of like someone had
0:02:42 a vision as to how this might have come
0:02:44 across and uh was pouring that negative
0:02:47 energy into it
0:02:49 you might see on a table a sack of
0:02:52 colored pencils next to heavy sketch
0:02:55 paper
0:02:56 or
0:02:57 cds spread across in a very neat way of
0:03:00 different musical titles and genres
0:03:03 it seems like things that might
0:03:05 ordinarily be left out near a computer
0:03:07 or for the guests to
0:03:09 interact with but there's little hints
0:03:12 that whoever was setting this up britta
0:03:14 that is that she's been trying to make
0:03:17 the space her own a little confused in
0:03:19 that way so right now you have
0:03:21 everything kind of like very
0:03:23 carefully arranged
0:03:25 there's this rare occasion where you
0:03:29 return to the kindred area
0:03:31 and you find something out of place
0:03:34 a chair is moved
0:03:37 a light kind of flickers on and off and
0:03:39 is looser than it should be the first
0:03:41 time that happened britta called out
0:03:45 very quietly after kind of looking
0:03:47 around
0:03:48 neil
0:03:50 it's never neal does she get any
0:03:52 indication of uh any kind of who well
0:03:56 after
0:03:57 the
0:03:58 you know fourth or fifth night of this
0:04:01 you
0:04:03 you come into the room again and this
0:04:05 time the faucet is running down by the
0:04:09 back sink and
0:04:11 when you get close
0:04:12 you will notice that this time the sink
0:04:15 is blood stained
0:04:17 brita's coming over at first with like
0:04:19 half a mind to turn it off
0:04:21 kind of set things back to how they
0:04:23 ought to be but as she takes a closer
0:04:25 look at the sink and that color of it
0:04:28 now does the water appear to be bloody
0:04:31 or is it just that like there seems to
0:04:33 be some residue in the sink it looks
0:04:35 like there's residue and it seems to
0:04:37 kind of spill over the counter and onto
0:04:39 the floor
0:04:40 but there's no blood on the floor itself
0:04:44 don't worry i'm going to clean it up for
0:04:46 you
0:04:47 she's turning around to find the source
0:04:48 of that
0:04:49 you find
0:04:51 the unmistakable veto zantosa
0:04:54 you came back
0:04:57 of course i come back
0:04:59 i came back for you
0:05:01 but i
0:05:03 i shot you
0:05:04 nah that's okay
0:05:06 um
0:05:07 i intend to
0:05:09 express pain with you in unusual ways
0:05:12 then
0:05:13 we'll take something like a gunshot and
0:05:17 make it as nothing
0:05:19 well
0:05:20 no i didn't mean to shoot you um
0:05:23 it's just
0:05:24 no no that's okay he kind of like steps
0:05:27 a little bit closer
0:05:29 i am back i am of this industry family
0:05:32 sensation for
0:05:34 any purpose
0:05:36 is thrilling to us
0:05:38 addictive
0:05:40 well then you're welcome and
0:05:43 she's taking steps like she probably
0:05:46 doesn't have far to go before she gets
0:05:48 back to
0:05:50 the sink against her and when she
0:05:52 notices that she'll kind of like try to
0:05:54 veer left or right
0:05:57 i'm glad that i accidentally provided
0:05:59 you with that experience um
0:06:02 but i no
0:06:04 it was no accident
0:06:06 and i suppose that
0:06:08 is what i find myself wondering
0:06:11 if the rest of your friends
0:06:14 were intending on keeping me alive
0:06:16 why did you wish for me to die
0:06:21 there's
0:06:22 a lot i don't know about my memory and
0:06:27 things just happen sometimes so
0:06:30 maybe if there's something about your
0:06:33 and your is there someone who would
0:06:36 want to shoot your family or cause
0:06:38 people to want to shoot you
0:06:40 yes of course
0:06:42 would you mind telling me about them
0:06:45 this antos are an evil people
0:06:47 most
0:06:49 would desire us expunged from the world
0:06:53 anyone particularly skilled in
0:06:57 in what exactly
0:06:59 anything you've seen from me
0:07:03 no
0:07:04 you
0:07:05 you so far are one of a kind
0:07:08 she kind of has that like jaw tightening
0:07:11 moment of keeping a straight face
0:07:14 um our
0:07:17 codery does
0:07:18 want to keep you alive
0:07:21 except for you
0:07:22 why it's
0:07:24 not me it's something in my head and
0:07:27 maybe knowing more about who your
0:07:29 enemies are could help me know more
0:07:31 about
0:07:32 me
0:07:33 there is
0:07:34 little sense of discussing the litany of
0:07:36 enemies with you but
0:07:39 but perhaps
0:07:41 i can help you with your memories
0:07:45 how
0:07:46 by looking into your eyes
0:07:48 and uncovering them
0:07:50 i don't feel like you mean just
0:07:54 looking
0:07:55 you mean
0:07:56 with the abilities of your blood
0:07:59 yes
0:08:01 i do
0:08:02 i don't want that
0:08:04 sometime soon you're going to have to
0:08:06 choose between things you want
0:08:08 and don't want
0:08:10 i looked into my memories a bit more
0:08:14 with with miles
0:08:16 and
0:08:17 found some stuff and maybe i could do it
0:08:20 that way i can
0:08:22 why do you want to do it that way do not
0:08:25 worry
0:08:26 i will not harm you i promise
0:08:30 he kind of draws just a little closer
0:08:32 hand now like resting on the counter
0:08:35 this is etude from what i can see it
0:08:38 stays on you
0:08:40 what does that even mean
0:08:42 this is a tune
0:08:44 it is merely the means by which flesh is
0:08:47 manipulated
0:08:48 we are all flesh
0:08:52 we've seen some
0:08:54 i mean you must have seen what we found
0:08:57 in that building with you
0:08:58 the ways that they were shaped and it
0:09:01 doesn't seem to leave
0:09:04 people
0:09:05 it kind of gives this like nervous
0:09:07 shiver when you bring it up the things
0:09:09 that are there are not simply
0:09:12 manipulated flesh
0:09:14 they are extensions of my master's will
0:09:18 he who sleeps until the final nights
0:09:23 are you an extension of your master's
0:09:25 will all flesh
0:09:27 is an extension of my master's will
0:09:31 and
0:09:32 what does your master's will go towards
0:09:38 these are things i would have to teach
0:09:39 you in time
0:09:41 but if you just let me he reaches for
0:09:44 you
0:09:45 and
0:09:46 seemingly trips and falls but rather
0:09:49 than
0:09:50 landing on the floor he lands up on the
0:09:52 ceiling
0:09:53 by some unseen power he is dragged from
0:09:57 the room
0:09:58 and the door slams shut behind him
0:10:01 [Music]
0:10:07 uh brita's going to let out a yelp and
0:10:10 look for the cause of it looking around
0:10:12 but it seems to be totally alone in the
0:10:14 room and even when you check beyond the
0:10:17 room
0:10:18 no she'll run to the door and like
0:10:20 jiggle it not really uh seeming to
0:10:22 follow him trying to follow the dragging
0:10:25 when you get to the other side of the
0:10:27 door because because it does open for
0:10:28 you okay virus santosa is gone you are
0:10:32 alone in the cafe
0:10:34 is there any sign of disturbance there
0:10:36 is not
0:10:37 is there any sign of um anything
0:10:41 like is the door open is there any like
0:10:43 paper ruffled is there anything at all
0:10:45 or is it perfect perfect perfect perfect
0:10:48 and if i run outside after like that
0:10:51 glance around
0:10:53 is there anything to do with the outside
0:10:56 world that seems different when you go
0:10:57 outside uh something like the windows
0:10:59 are fog
0:11:01 because you know it's still like pretty
0:11:02 cold winter nights
0:11:04 on the front door under like where the
0:11:07 little bell is and everything to kind of
0:11:09 notify you and people arriving you see
0:11:13 it's like someone was breathing against
0:11:16 the glass and then
0:11:18 used their fingers to trace something
0:11:21 you see the name brita scrawled across
0:11:24 the glass as those written with a finger
0:11:27 brita takes in
0:11:28 that image for a second just almost with
0:11:32 that chest tension of someone who needs
0:11:34 to breathe but without the rise and fall
0:11:38 she memorizes what she can tell about
0:11:40 it's not really even handwriting but
0:11:42 she's looking desperately for like any
0:11:44 sense of what's going on she casts a
0:11:47 look around at the surrounding streets
0:11:49 everything is
0:11:51 painfully typical so in that case she
0:11:54 takes her sleeve she rubs her name away
0:11:57 she goes back inside the cafe
0:11:59 and
0:12:00 back to the kindred area and she checks
0:12:03 to see if the blood in the sink is still
0:12:05 there the blood in the sink is gone
0:12:08 and the faucet is however running she
0:12:10 turns it off after a moment and kind of
0:12:13 sl like
0:12:14 stretches
0:12:15 that full body stretch where you place
0:12:18 your hands on the edge of the sink and
0:12:20 you lean and you arch your back to try
0:12:22 to get the tension out of it
0:12:24 she casts another look around just
0:12:27 deeply suspicious of the normalcy of the
0:12:29 place
0:12:30 kind of stalks to where she's determined
0:12:33 her safe spot is which in the kindred
0:12:36 areas behind the bar where she found the
0:12:39 gun from before and she kind of found
0:12:40 her
0:12:41 found her stuff set up and she retrieves
0:12:45 one of her guns and
0:12:47 she tries to call win
0:12:48 you
0:12:49 place a call and you page her but it
0:12:52 doesn't seem that there's an immediate
0:12:53 phone call and return at the end of the
0:12:56 paging though um you can hear familiar
0:13:00 music what kind of familiar music you
0:13:03 can't quite place your finger on it but
0:13:05 it's some sort of instrumental it's so
0:13:08 so so distant sounding does it seem as
0:13:11 if the phone call connected yes and it's
0:13:13 a kind of instrumental music does it
0:13:15 remind me of miles
0:13:17 it's not over the phone
0:13:19 okay
0:13:21 coming from somewhere within the
0:13:24 cafe the phone is getting hung up in
0:13:26 that sort of like
0:13:28 i have to ask is this a flip phone
0:13:30 how does this yeah it's probably a flip
0:13:32 phone
0:13:34 do you know that like one finger like
0:13:37 slow like clap hang up when something's
0:13:40 wrong yeah she'll do that and she'll put
0:13:42 the phone away
0:13:45 and uh the gun is not getting the safety
0:13:50 taken off quite yet but it is very much
0:13:53 in hand as she gets back up
0:13:56 stands slowly and sticks to the edges of
0:14:00 the room as she starts heading towards
0:14:03 the front of the cafe sort of like
0:14:06 sticking to the walls
0:14:08 not touching the door until she's ready
0:14:10 to reach out and push it open and step
0:14:14 through by the time you're touching the
0:14:15 door
0:14:16 it is ice cold to the touch do i notice
0:14:19 this with my uh a touch of frost you do
0:14:22 oh
0:14:23 so i normally wear gloves as brita but i
0:14:25 imagine when she's in her haven alone
0:14:27 that might be when she takes the time
0:14:30 to remove them and
0:14:32 that touch of ice
0:14:34 back and the contrast of how cold this
0:14:37 door must be
0:14:39 she kind of pulls her hand back to
0:14:40 herself but her attention is swinging
0:14:43 around the room scanning for whatever's
0:14:45 going on here
0:14:46 you get this uh
0:14:48 morose feeling
0:14:50 and
0:14:51 at this point you're certain that you're
0:14:52 not alone
0:14:53 but that said you don't really see very
0:14:56 much
0:14:57 that's out of place and every time you
0:14:59 do
0:15:00 it is
0:15:02 under control again within moments do i
0:15:04 still hear the music only when you
0:15:06 listen for it britta's gonna keep
0:15:08 listening for it she's gonna
0:15:10 slowly gun's still in hand she's gonna
0:15:13 go and take one of the chairs from
0:15:15 behind the rows of computers and
0:15:18 she's gonna i think it's one of those
0:15:20 wheeling chairs
0:15:22 makes like a soundless
0:15:24 uh you know like when you drag one of
0:15:26 those and it kind of like the wheels
0:15:28 don't actually make a sound but there's
0:15:29 just that sort of like
0:15:31 shift
0:15:32 and she will bring it over to the middle
0:15:35 of the room
0:15:37 and kind of like fuss with how it's
0:15:39 angled for a second before
0:15:42 sitting down all of her motions are
0:15:45 kind of guarded
0:15:47 and uh slow
0:15:50 but she sits down in the chair
0:15:52 lowers the gun to her side
0:15:55 and
0:15:56 says
0:15:58 hello
0:16:06 who's there
0:16:13 i can hear you i can hear you saying
0:16:15 hello
0:16:18 can you say more
0:16:26 we can talk all right
0:16:28 i'm
0:16:31 brought up who are you
0:16:39 repeats again
0:16:41 trying to
0:16:43 communicate something to you
0:16:46 the room is cold
0:16:50 and
0:16:51 even as you
0:16:54 draw a breath
0:16:56 like like a whole unnecessary
0:16:59 deep breath
0:17:02 you
0:17:03 exhale
0:17:05 you know that bit of fog that comes when
0:17:06 you're breathing in the cold when it's
0:17:08 snowy out and you kind of like yeah have
0:17:11 that puff
0:17:12 you experience that
0:17:14 and that with the music
0:17:17 seems to take you to another place
0:17:21 reality seems to kind of fade and slip
0:17:24 from between your fingertips
0:17:26 and you drift off into another time
0:17:32 [Music]
0:17:35 you're quite young britta is
0:17:39 maybe 10 years old and you can kind of
0:17:41 feel
0:17:42 that youth the simplicity of your
0:17:45 thoughts and
0:17:46 your
0:17:47 diminutive
0:17:48 size
0:17:50 you feel yourself
0:17:52 rocking on some sort of very small boat
0:17:57 the sound of the waters gently
0:18:00 slapping against the shore has an
0:18:03 unnatural quality to it like the sound
0:18:06 reverberates in unnatural ways
0:18:09 when you look about the world is dusky
0:18:13 and gray
0:18:15 and
0:18:16 devoid of any real color
0:18:20 and you
0:18:21 are not the only child there's six of
0:18:23 you and all and one
0:18:26 hooded figure who is
0:18:29 rowing and
0:18:31 making every effort to transport the
0:18:33 group of you and you can't quite clearly
0:18:36 see his face but you recognize him as a
0:18:39 man
0:18:40 with
0:18:41 sharp teeth not just the fangs of a
0:18:44 kindred
0:18:45 but all of his teeth are sharpened to
0:18:49 razor points
0:18:51 if i look behind me do i see anything
0:18:54 indicating from where we came
0:18:56 it's just darkness that's brita's first
0:18:58 instinct she checks behind the boat to
0:19:00 try to see if there's anything that
0:19:02 would give her more history to this
0:19:04 moment dark gray storm clouds black
0:19:07 waves
0:19:09 black sand
0:19:11 and before you
0:19:13 there's a city with high walls
0:19:16 and the city is
0:19:18 the stone is cracked uh the city it lies
0:19:21 in as like ancient ruins
0:19:24 the man leads the group of you off the
0:19:27 boat and you find yourself coming to the
0:19:30 realization that whatever this place is
0:19:34 whatever terror it has in store for you
0:19:36 it is your true home
0:19:40 that you have
0:19:41 in this moment left the world behind you
0:19:45 bretta's chest is rising rising and
0:19:47 falling in
0:19:49 and sort of making her feel strange in
0:19:52 this
0:19:52 younger body that she can feel how small
0:19:55 she is and the breaths that she's taking
0:19:58 and she's staying close to the other
0:20:00 kids
0:20:01 keeping track of them keeping track of
0:20:03 the man with with the pointed teeth
0:20:06 looking around at
0:20:08 what has this sense of uh
0:20:11 it has a sense of home but it comes with
0:20:13 a sense of dread
0:20:14 yes this place
0:20:17 is not
0:20:18 natural
0:20:19 and even with the vast imagination of a
0:20:22 ten-year-old child you know that this is
0:20:26 beyond the edge of
0:20:28 reality as you know it and there are
0:20:30 others there all of them
0:20:32 kindred do they all have the teeth
0:20:35 they do not all have the teeth
0:20:38 but the one that leads you further in
0:20:40 does and you were taken below ground
0:20:44 where there is
0:20:45 a small
0:20:47 almost labyrinth of ruins and there
0:20:51 they have the holding pens
0:20:53 for
0:20:54 the young humans that they bring there
0:20:57 how long does it seem like some of them
0:20:59 have been here
0:21:01 not all of them are children anymore
0:21:02 many of them are adults so whatever
0:21:05 period of time it is that you would be
0:21:07 expected to be here it would be measured
0:21:09 in years
0:21:10 bretta keeps an eye out along the way
0:21:13 for
0:21:14 ways to slip away but she knows there's
0:21:16 well
0:21:17 now she knows they're vampires but
0:21:19 there's a sort of muddling happening i
0:21:22 think of her memory and her her
0:21:25 circumstance
0:21:27 the memory fades and again reality sort
0:21:30 of slips between your fingers and you
0:21:32 find yourself
0:21:34 with a man with obsidian skin young
0:21:36 people with you but older than the 10
0:21:38 year olds that you were then
0:21:40 together the group of you are training
0:21:44 with automatic weapons and firing on
0:21:47 these bust statues that are specifically
0:21:51 prepared and you remember hearing the
0:21:53 report of these guns and
0:21:55 taking a certain pride in your
0:21:57 proficiency with them
0:21:59 the gun feels
0:22:00 less natural
0:22:01 in my younger hands it's uh i still have
0:22:04 to figure out where to lay my fingers
0:22:06 how to catch my grip
0:22:09 a sort of strange double outline
0:22:12 of how i know to do it now in my older
0:22:15 self and what it feels like to be in
0:22:16 that body honestly it feels
0:22:18 a lot like the awkwardness of being a
0:22:21 teenager yeah but even then uh you
0:22:24 perform well and the group of you are
0:22:27 rewarded with food though again gray and
0:22:30 bleak it is warm to the touch and
0:22:33 provides nourishment the group of you
0:22:37 talk about
0:22:38 which among you remembers what the sun
0:22:41 looks like and what it felt like
0:22:44 the older children that you've been
0:22:46 working with seem to admit to the group
0:22:49 as a whole that they no longer quite
0:22:51 remember
0:22:52 and that the sun
0:22:54 is no longer so important
0:22:56 bretta holds on tightly to what
0:23:00 the flowers in her neighbor's window
0:23:03 looked like the different kinds and
0:23:05 colors
0:23:06 there were always perennials in there
0:23:08 sometimes she'd change them out but
0:23:11 that's the memory that she holds on to
0:23:12 the color green
0:23:14 and the leaves when the flowers
0:23:16 were brightest the way that it looked in
0:23:18 the winter
0:23:20 the group of you shared a meal at its
0:23:22 conclusion you're each sent back
0:23:24 underground to those rooms that you had
0:23:27 found when you were first a child
0:23:28 brought to this place
0:23:31 it's more like dormitories than cells
0:23:34 you're comfortable here it's home
0:23:36 they're so familiar i have memorized
0:23:39 the way that the turns form in the walls
0:23:43 of this place
0:23:44 i've made comfort for myself
0:23:47 a favorite blanket or crack's account in
0:23:50 the wall by my bed
0:23:52 i recognize them now looking back on the
0:23:54 memory they
0:23:55 seem so intrinsic to
0:23:57 what my experience had been but
0:24:00 keeping that separation it's hard to
0:24:02 realize that i forgot them once you come
0:24:05 to
0:24:06 when you're kind of looking at it and
0:24:07 remembering
0:24:09 you hear a knock
0:24:11 at the doorway to your space
0:24:14 when you turn
0:24:15 you recognize romeo
0:24:17 [Music]
0:24:19 romeo
0:24:20 what are you
0:24:22 he gives you a confused look
0:24:24 we've been activated
0:24:26 this is it get your things
0:24:29 we're headed to the world of flesh
0:24:33 to engage in a hunt
0:24:34 the shadow crusade has use for us
0:24:39 brett uh stares at him for a moment
0:24:41 keeps track of what's on his person what
0:24:44 he seems to mean when he says gather
0:24:46 your stuff
0:24:48 but she turns and she does as he
0:24:50 instructs
0:24:51 and
0:24:52 the confusion still written plainly
0:24:54 across her face joins him at the door
0:24:56 by the time you straighten and turn to
0:24:59 join them at the door
0:25:00 the memory slips from between your
0:25:02 fingers
0:25:04 and you find yourself in the dark
0:25:07 in your cafe with all of the lights out
0:25:10 and you can see the faintest silhouette
0:25:14 of romeo sitting across from you
0:25:17 and a chair
0:25:22 [Music]
0:25:26 romeo
0:25:29 brittany
0:25:32 those were the names we picked
0:25:34 we
0:25:35 picked those names
0:25:38 yeah

0:25:43 not anymore
0:25:45 i don't know that i even had one
0:25:48 did i
0:25:50 have one
0:25:52 i
0:25:53 trying to remember seems to cause him
0:25:56 pain i'm sorry i'm sorry and he fades
